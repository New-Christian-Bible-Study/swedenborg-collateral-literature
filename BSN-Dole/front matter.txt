About this version of the "Bible Study Notes"

We have revised these notes in a few minor ways to make them better suited to online use. These revisions include:
<ul>
<li>Each of the 158 lessons can stand on its own, related to a Bible story.</li>
<li>Importantly, we have inserted hyperlinks to the many cited Bible verses, and to the references from Swedenborg's theological works.</li>
<li>We have renamed the age groups, since the original age-order group names "Primary, Junior, Intermediate, Senior, Adult" seem to have been a little misleading to modern educators. Most would have switched Junior and Intermediate, and some thought Senior might have been referring to "senior citizens". These group names are as follows in this instance: Young children, Older children, Young teens, Older teens, Adults.</li>
<li>We have moved the "Basic Correspondences" section in each lesson up below Doctrinal Points, from its original home in the lesson for Intermediate students.</li>
<li>We haven't included the chart of the 4-year curriculum, or the 5 specific New Church Day lessons, or Appendix 2 on heredity and the human soul.</li>

Editor's Note from Rev. William Ross Woofenden, 2001 edition.

As we may see by the accompanying chart, this program was planned as a four-year Bible course, but it was originally arranged so that the whole Word was covered by periods each year, in order that the child might early realize that the Bible is one book — not only a continuous story but a completed one — and also that children might not so often enter the Sunday School for the first time in the middle of the Bible story with no idea of what has gone before. While this plan might in any one year seem to leave many important stories untouched, the retelling of the background of the successive periods from year to year in the context of different stories built up gradually in the child's mind both a surer knowledge and a better understanding of the whole letter of the Word. The plan insured that the beginning of the Bible story was not forgotten before the end was reached, and that the Old and New Testaments were seen in their proper relation and proportion. Although the lessons are now arranged in Bible sequence, it is still possible, by using the chart, to use the original four-year plan.

The notes for the various age groups are written with two purposes in view. It is not intended that the teacher should read them to the class. Neither is it intended that copies should be given out to the pupils in advance. Only the Bible reading should be done in advance. For the teacher, the notes are meant to suggest the points to be covered in the lesson, a possible order of presentation, and the general level of meaning which pupils in the particular age group may be expected to comprehend. For the pupil, if he has his own set of the books, they are meant to be taken home, read as a review during the week, and preserved for future reference.

It is very important that the teacher plan his use of the class time carefully. Five minutes or less at the beginning of the period are enough for review questions. Then give five minutes to a carefully thought-out covering of the background of the lesson for the day before going into the lesson proper. In the Old Testament, build the background as far as possible about persons and places in order to fix these in their proper sequence in the pupils' minds. In the New Testament the background should be the factual story of the Lord's life on earth.

The writings of the church tell us that "generals" must be grasped before "particulars" can be understood in their proper context; so we may feel sure that our first object in the Sunday School should be to impress the general outline of the whole Bible story on the minds of our pupils. The covering of the whole story each year has this objective in view.

The two survey lessons (nos. 22 and 24 on the accompanying chart) are general lessons but are based on a different passage each year in order to give the pupils a wider variety in the study of the Prophets than has been possible in previous courses. They are also optional lessons, written in such a way that Sunday Schools with a school year of less than forty sessions may omit them without losing continuity. Each series also contains fifteen lessons from the New Testament. A different Gospel is studied each year. Two of the fifteen lessons are written as optional lessons; three are the special lessons for Christmas, Palm Sunday, and Easter; and three are from the book of Revelation.

*This present memorial edition in permanent book form* has been rearranged in Bible sequence, necessitating some editing in order to eliminate references to the "last lesson," the "next lesson," etc. Other editorial changes have been for the most part limited to the occasional correction of matters of fact and to the rearranging of some of the features in order to make their use more practical. The most extensive change has been made in combining the notes for Beginner and Primary ages with an attempt to keep the best of both. Notes for Teachers, instead of being kept all together on a single sheet, have been put with the notes for the various age levels (e.g., Junior teacher suggestions will now be found at the beginning of the section for Juniors). The Doctrinal Points, instead of being grouped in ten-lesson units, appear with the lesson to which they refer.

No substantive changes have been made in the text, although occasional editorial comments have been added in footnotes. It has been a privilege to have been involved in helping make these valuable materials available to a wider audience.

The editor would like to thank Louise Dole Woofenden and Adrienne Frank for their contributions to the revision of this second edition.

About the Author

The following brief memorial address was included in the 2001 printed edition, and it provides a good, brief biography of Mrs. Anita Sturges Dole, 1889-1973, the author of this thorough, insightful curriculum.

In Memoriam of Mrs. Anita Sturges Dole
<i>Edmonton, Alberta, April 13, 1973</i>

The author of these lesson notes was born on March 18, 1889 in Chicago, Illinois, to James Dwight and Anna Gertrude Cary Sturges. She received her education in the Chicago public schools, and received the A.B. degree from the University of Chicago in 1908, having been elected to Phi Beta Kappa the previous year on the basis of her academic achievement. As a child she attended an Episcopal Sunday school, and was confirmed in that faith in 1902. On completing her education, she was employed first as a cataloguer in the University of Chicago Library (1908-1910), and subsequently as secretary to Professor William I. Thomas (1910-1912), as a Research Assistant in the Chicago School of Civics and Philanthropy (1912-1914), and as Assistant Manager of a small publishing company (1914-1917).

During this period she studied voice and was in training under Herman De Vries of the Chicago Opera Company, considering a career in music, when in February of 1917 she was persuaded by her sister Alice to accept a teaching position at Urbana, a New Church high school and junior college in Ohio, to fill an unexpected vacancy. That summer, at the end of the term, she went with her sister to the New Church Assembly in Almont, Michigan. There she heard the Rev. Dr. Thomas King give a lecture in which he traced the correspondence of the donkey in the Bible, illustrating its spiritual meaning with quotations throughout the Bible. She was fond of telling how, at the end of this talk, she was so convinced of the truth of the doctrine of the New Church concerning the Bible that she was ready to join the New Church. She was confirmed by Dr. King there at Almont, in August, 1917. That fall she made her decision to give up her promising career in music and devote herself to the teaching of the New Church doctrines, and to the work of the church. Her lovely soprano voice, though lost to the world at large, enriched the worship of her church to the end of her life.

She also loved to tell how, before she went to Almont, she had audited a course in philosophy being given at Urbana by its principal, Rev. Louis A. Dole, of how she had been most strongly attracted to him, and how Mr. Dole had apparently taken no notice of her at all. However, when she returned from Almont a confirmed and enthusiastic member of the New Church, Mr. Dole lost no time in becoming better acquainted with the new teacher on his staff. They were married on New Church Day — June 19, 1919.

In September of 1920 Mr. Dole accepted a call to serve the New Church society in Fryeburg, Maine, on a six-month trial basis; they stayed there for seventeen years. Almost immediately on taking up the Fryeburg pastorate, they discovered an interest among several Massachusetts New Church members who summered in Fryeburg, in establishing a summer assembly similar to that at Almont. It was through the on-the-scene efforts of the Doles, coupled with the fund-raising activities of the Massachusetts group, that the Fryeburg New Church Assembly became a reality in 1921, with Mr. Dole as its first president.

Time passed, and Mr. Dole was invested as General Pastor of the Maine Association of the New Church. In this capacity he became increasingly concerned at the decline of the Bath society where his father had once been minister, and where he himself had been confirmed. After several unsuccessful attempts to re-establish worship services in Bath by other means, he accepted a call to serve as its minister. The Doles moved to Bath in 1937.

In Bath, Mrs. Dole became active in the Parent-Teacher Association, serving several terms as president of her local chapter and as chairman of the Constitution and By-Laws Committee of the state organization; in the Girl Scout movement, serving as Commissioner for the Bath area for several years; in the Bath Council of Churches; in the Maine Council of Churches, serving on its Constitution and By-Laws Committee; and in the Bath Council of Church Women, which she helped to found. During World War 2 she was Production Chairman of the Red Cross chapter in Bath, supervising the preparation of war relief materials sent overseas from the Bath area. Through these and other activities people of all faiths came to know and love her, and many found in her that rare combination of spiritual insight, practical advice, and personal interest which brought them again and again to her door. Many were still corresponding with her at the time of her passing on.

She was one of the most active members of the New Church, not only at the local level, but on the national scene. She served from time to time on the various committees of the General Convention and was elected to the Board of Managers of its theological school, from which she resigned when her son became a student there. She was active in the National Alliance of New Church Women, becoming one of its presidents and an ardent promoter of its Round Robin program — a system of circulating letters among particularly the isolated New Church women. She was for some years its Mother Robin.

She was best known, and will likely be longest remembered, for what she herself considered her life's work: the preparation of a comprehensive four-year course of Sunday school lesson notes based on the interpretation of the Bible in the light of the New Church teachings concerning its spiritual meaning. Although she did the research and writing for these lessons herself, she always sought her husband's opinion of her work, and would publish nothing which he had not read and approved. Working together, both in writing and in parish teaching, they passed on to their congregations and to their many church friends a rich heritage of Bible scholarship of a truly spiritual character, and they also achieved a degree of success rare in this century of widening generation gaps, in passing on to all three of their children not only their knowledge, but also their deep and lasting love for the Word of the Lord and for the church based on it.

In 1966, two years after the passing of her husband into the spiritual world, Mrs. Dole retired from parish work and went to live first with her son in Massachusetts and finally with her daughter in Edmonton. She never did retire from active service to the church, continuing to teach in the Sunday school and to participate in study programs, and carrying on a remarkably extensive and varied correspondence to the end.

In her old age she looked forward with increasing anticipation and some impatience to her passing into the spiritual world to join her beloved husband. This became her dearest wish, and it was granted by our Lord's divine mercy on April 7, 1973, shortly after her eighty-fourth birthday.

We rejoice today in her release from the increasing burdens of old age, and look forward to joining her when in due course we are called into that world where she has awakened and taken up her life's work in the health and vigor of her spirit.

She will always be held in loving memory by her three children, Rev. George F. Dole, Mrs. Louise Woofenden, and Mrs. Gertrude Tremblay; by her sons-in-law and daughter-in-law; by her thirteen grandchildren; and by her countless relatives and friends.
