=== From the Writings of Swedenborg

Doctrine of the Holy Scripture, n. 49: "The power of Divine truth is directed especially against falsities and evils, thus against the hells. The fight against these must be waged by means of truths from the sense of the letter of the Word. Moreover it is by means of the truths in a man that the Lord has the power to save him; for man is reformed and regenerated and is at the same time taken out of hell and introduced into heaven, by means of truths from the sense of the letter of the Word ... The Lord's power from the ultimate things of truth was represented by the Nazirites in the Jewish Church; and by Samson, of whom it is said that he was a Nazirite from his mother's womb, and that his power lay in his hair ... No one can know why the Naziriteship (by which is meant the hair) was instituted, or whence it came that Samson's strength was from the hair, unless he knows what is signified in the Word by the 'head.' The 'head' signifies the heavenly wisdom which angels and men have from the Lord by means of Divine truth; consequently the 'hair of the head' signifies heavenly wisdom in ultimate things, and also Divine truth in ultimate things ... In short, the reason why the power of Divine truth or of the Word is in the sense of the letter, is that there the Word is in its fullness; and it is also because in that sense are, at the same time and together [simul], the angels of both the Lord's kingdoms and men on earth."
