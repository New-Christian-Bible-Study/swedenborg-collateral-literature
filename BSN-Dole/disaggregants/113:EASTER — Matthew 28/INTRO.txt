=== INTRO

In the younger classes the teacher should start with a brief review of the Palm Sunday lesson and then tell the children as simply as possible the story of the last week of the Lord's life on earth. He spent the first two days of the week teaching in the temple, but at night He went out of the city to Bethany, the home of His friends Mary and Martha and Lazarus. On Thursday evening He went into the city again and celebrated the Passover feast with His disciples. It was at this feast that He instituted the Holy Supper, which in the Christian Church takes the place of the Passover. After supper He went out to the Garden of Gethsemane to pray, and it was there that the crowd, led by Judas, seized Him. He was tried before the high priest, before Herod, and finally before Pilate, the Roman governor. No fault could be found in Him except by the use of false witnesses, but they demanded His death, and on Friday He was crucified. This review of events should be given in full to the Juniors but more briefly to the younger ones.
