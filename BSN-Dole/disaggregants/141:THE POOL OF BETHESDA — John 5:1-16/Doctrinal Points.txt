=== Doctrinal Points
----
• The Lord works in us through the knowledge of the Word in our minds.
• The knowledge of the Word which we gain in childhood is our "pool of Bethesda."
• This knowledge is stirred up in our minds whenever we really recognize one of our faults and sincerely want to correct it.
• When one fault is cured, we must go on to fight others. As we go on, we discover deeper and deeper evils in our hearts, but this should not discourage us. it means that we are making spiritual progress.
