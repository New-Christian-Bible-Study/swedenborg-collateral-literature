As you talk about the lesson, repeat the names Jacob, Leah, and Rachel as often as possible so that the children will become familiar with them. They should also hear about Jacob's long stay in Haran and the fact that he had twelve sons. Mention Joseph as the last son born in Haran, and the fact that Benjamin was not born until after they returned to the Holy Land.

---
Isaac and Rebekah had twin sons, Jacob and Esau. Even though they were twins, they were not at all alike, and as they grew up they did not get along well together. Once Esau even threatened to kill Jacob. So Isaac and Rebekah sent Jacob away on a visit to Rebekah's old home in Haran.

Do you remember the story of the dream Jacob had on the way?

When he came to Haran, where did he stop first?

Who came out to water her father's flock?

How did Laban receive Jacob?

What other daughter did Laban have?

What did Jacob ask of Laban?

When the seven years were over, Laban deceived Jacob and gave him Leah instead of Rachel.

So Jacob served another seven years for Rachel.

After that he served another six years, and took his pay in sheep and cattle. How many years does that make altogether?

Leah bore Jacob six sons.

She also gave Jacob her handmaid Zilpah, who bore him two sons. Rachel's handmaid Bilhah bore him two sons.

Eleven sons were born to him in Haran and a twelfth after he got back to the Holy Land. Only the last two were the children of Rachel, the wife whom Jacob loved best.

These last two were Joseph and Benjamin. Joseph was the last one born in Haran. Benjamin was born near Bethlehem. Do you know who else was born at Bethlehem a long time afterward? It was the Lord, when He came into the world to show us how we ought to live.
