=== From the Writings of Swedenborg

@AC 3819: "Leah is called the 'elder' because external truth is first learned, and Rachel is called the 'younger' because internal truth is learned afterwards, or what is the same, man is first affected with external truths, and afterwards with internal ones; for external truths are the planes of internal ones, being generals into which singulars are insinuated; for without a general idea of a thing man comprehends nothing that is singular. This is the reason why in the literal sense of the Word there are general, but in the internal sense singular truths."
