[.underline]#*Teacher Notes:*# 
Mention Solomon's wish and show the children simply what an understanding heart is. Also mention the building of the temple by Solomon. Then tell some of the wonderful things Solomon had, as background for the story of the visit of the queen of Sheba. Develop the idea that Solomon's riches and honors were the result of Solomon's wise choice.

---
After Saul died, David became king. David was a great warrior and conquered all the enemies of Israel. Just before he died, he had his son Solomon anointed to be king after him. The name Solomon means "peace." That is easy to remember because Solomon's reign was a peaceful one. He did not have to fight any enemies.

He built a beautiful temple at Jerusalem in which to place the ark. He also built many other buildings and cities.

He married the daughter of the Pharaoh of Egypt.

His friend Hiram king of Tyre furnished him cedar wood from the forests of Lebanon.

Solomon had a dream in which the Lord told him to ask for whatever he most wanted, and Solomon had asked for "a wise and understanding heart." The Lord was pleased with this wish and granted it, and He also gave Solomon riches and glory and a long life. Solomon had a throne made of ivory overlaid with gold, with a figure of a lion on either side of it, and it had six steps leading up to it with a lion on either side of each step. And Solomon had a fleet of ships, which brought him gold and silver from other countries, and ivory and apes and peacocks.

The wisdom and glory of Solomon became so well known that kings and queens came from other countries to see his treasures and to ask him questions.

About what particular queen do we read in our lesson?

Why did she come to Solomon?

What presents did she bring him?

What did she say after she had talked with him?
