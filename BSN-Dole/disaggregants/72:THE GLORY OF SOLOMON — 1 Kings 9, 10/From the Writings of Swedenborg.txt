=== From the Writings of Swedenborg

@AE 514[7]: "Although these are historical facts [concerning Solomon's navy and the loss of the navy under Jehoshaphat] they contain a spiritual sense as well as the prophecies (Isaiah 23:1,2,14 and 60:9); 'the ships made in Ezion-geber, at the shore of the Red Sea, in the land of Edom,' signified knowledges of the natural man, for these contain in themselves, and as it were carry, spiritual wealth, as ships carry worldly wealth; for the 'Red Sea' and 'the land of Edom,' where Ezion-geber was, were the outmost border of the land of Canaan, and the 'outmost borders of the land of Canaan' signify the outmosts of the church, which are knowledges including knowledges of truth and good. 'Gold and silver' (1 Kings 10:22) signify the goods and truths of the internal church; 'ivory, apes, and peacocks,' signify the truths and goods of the external church; knowledges here meaning such knowledges as the ancients had namely, knowledges of correspondences, of representations, and of influxes, and respecting heaven and hell, which especially included and were serviceable to the knowledges of truth and good of the church. 'Hiram' signifies the nations that are out of the church with whom also there are knowledges of good and truth; and that the 'ships' under king Jehoshaphat 'were broken' signifies the devastation of the church in respect to its truths and goods."
