=== For Younger Children

[.underline]#*Teacher Notes:*# 
The teacher may spend a good part of the lesson period telling the story of the return from captivity and the rebuilding of the temple. Then speak of the Minor Prophets and especially of the last three, and read the lesson from the Word. The children may be interested in hearing of the various ways in which the prophets were inspired. This information will be found in the Junior notes.

---
Most of the Minor Prophets lived in Judah or Israel before the people were carried away, but the last three came later. We learned one Sunday that when the people of Israel were carried away to Assyria, they never came back. But some of the people of Judah did.

King Cyrus, who followed Darius as king of Babylon, was told by the Lord to let them return.

He gave them back all the gold and silver vessels of the temple which Nebuchadnezzar had carried away.

Many of the people did not want to go back, but they helped those who went with money and supplies and animals.

The leader of the returning captives was Zerubbabel, a grandson of king Jehoiachin of Judah.

More than forty-two thousand returned to the Holy Land. They rebuilt Jerusalem and started to build the temple. But they stopped in the middle of building the temple and began to build homes for themselves instead. So the Lord had to speak to them again and tell them to finish the temple first. The last three of the Minor Prophets were the ones through whom He spoke to them at this time.

One of these was Zechariah.

In our lesson for today how did his vision come to him?

What did he see?

What did the angel tell him the seven lamps on the candlestick meant?

What did the two olive trees mean?
