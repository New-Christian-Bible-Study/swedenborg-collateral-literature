=== Introduction

Again we have a story about two brothers, but this time they are twins with the same mother as well as the same father. The teacher should fill in a little of the background by telling how Abraham sent his servant up to Haran, where his brother Nahor had settled, to bring back a wife for Isaac from his own people. Sarah had already died, and after Isaac married Rebekah, Abraham died also.
