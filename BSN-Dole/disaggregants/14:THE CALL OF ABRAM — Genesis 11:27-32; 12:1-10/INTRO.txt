=== INTRO

Noah's descendants, like the descendants of Adam and Eve, turned away from the Lord and wanted to go their own way, until finally they became so selfish that they could not live peaceably together and had to be scattered over the face of the earth. There is a good moral lesson for small children here because they know that when even one child in a group is selfish, there is always quarreling and trouble.
