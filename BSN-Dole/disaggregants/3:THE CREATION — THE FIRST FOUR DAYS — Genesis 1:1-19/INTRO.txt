=== Introduction

In teaching the Creation story we need to keep in mind that this is not only the beginning of the Bible but the foundation of all our further teaching. The thought of the Lord as the beginning of everything, our Heavenly Father, the Creator of everything we see and know, is essential to any spiritual understanding and to any genuinely good life. With all the classes we shall need to point out that our primary business in Sunday School is to learn of the Lord and His purposes for us so that we may truly serve Him, and that the only sure source of such knowledge is His Word which He has given us so that we may know these things. We are studying the Word as the Lord has given it to us and as He has opened it for our deeper understanding. Throughout our year's work we should frequently remind ourselves as well as our pupils that what we are studying is the Lord's Book, which is the Book of Life. We are putting special emphasis on the thought of the first four days in the Creation story, but the seven days should first be covered briefly.
