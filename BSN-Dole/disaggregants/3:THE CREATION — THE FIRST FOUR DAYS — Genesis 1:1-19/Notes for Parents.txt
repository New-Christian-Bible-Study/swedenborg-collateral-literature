=== Notes for Parents

Genesis means "beginning." The first words of the Bible are "In the beginning God." This is the first thing we need to know if we are to be true human beings and not mere animals. The real difference between an animal and a human being is that an animal can know nothing beyond physical things, while a human being can know God.

If we stop to think, we should be able to see that God would not be likely to waste time telling us things we can find out for ourselves — things about the world of nature. What He has to tell us are the things about Himself and about our souls, because these we cannot find out in any other way. So this first chapter of the Bible, about which people have disputed so much, really tells us about the creation of the human soul. It is a wonderful parable, a symbol story, taken from an Ancient Word written in the time when men spoke in this symbol language because they saw everything in the world about them to be an expression of something in God and thus in the soul. Throughout His Word the Lord speaks to us in this language and if we study it, we can understand more and more of what He wishes to tell us. The Bible is like Jacob's ladder with its foot on the ground and its top reaching up to God; God's thoughts come down to us through it and our thoughts rise up to Him, like the angels on the ladder. Read this story in Genesis 28:10-22. We, as well as our children, need to know the Bible stories well, just as they are given us in the Bible, if we are to find God in them.
