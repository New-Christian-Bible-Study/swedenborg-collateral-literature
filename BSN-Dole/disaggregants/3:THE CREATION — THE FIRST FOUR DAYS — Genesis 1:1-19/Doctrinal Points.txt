=== Doctrinal Points
----
• The first thing we need to know about the Lord is that He is the Creator of all things. The Lord's name Jehovah means "I am."
• The whole Word is a parable written in the language of correspondences.
• Faith is the acceptance of something as true, and the better we understand anything the more faith we can have in it.
• Truth which does not lead to good deeds is like a plant which bears no fruit.
