=== From the Writings of Swedenborg

@AE 654[19]: "The Lord Himself when He was an infant was carried down into Egypt ... This, again, signifies the first instruction of the Lord, for the Lord was instructed like any other man, but by virtue of His Divine He received all things more intelligently and wisely than anyone else. This departure into Egypt was merely a representative of instruction; for as all the representatives of the Jewish and Israelitish church looked to Him, so He represented them in Himself and completely observed them, thus fulfilling all things of the law. Since representatives were the outmosts of heaven and the church, and all prior things, which are things rational, spiritual, and celestial, enter into outmosts and are in them, so through these the Lord was in outmosts; and as all strength is in outmosts, so it was from firsts through outmosts that He subjugated all the hells, and reduced to order all things in the heavens. This is why the whole life of the Lord in the world was representative, even all things related in the Gospels respecting His passion, which represented what the church then was in contrariety to the Divine and to all the goods and truths of heaven and the church."
