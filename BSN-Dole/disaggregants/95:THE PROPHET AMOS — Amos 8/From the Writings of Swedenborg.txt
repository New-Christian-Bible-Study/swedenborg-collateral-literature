=== From the Writings of Swedenborg

@AE 386 [11]: "A famine for bread is not meant, nor a thirst for waters, but for hearing the word of Jehovah, thus that it is a lack of the knowledges of good and truth that is meant; and that these are not in the church or in its doctrine is described by the words, 'they shall go from sea to sea, and from the north to the sunrise, seeking the word of Jehovah, and shall not find it,' 'from sea to sea' signifying on every side, for the outmost boundaries in the spiritual world, where truths and goods begin and terminate appear like seas; consequently 'seas' in the Word signify the cognitions of truth and good, also knowledges [scientifica] in general; 'from the north to the sunrise' signifies also on every side where truth and good are, 'the north' meaning where truth is in obscurity, and 'the sunrise' where good is. Because 'famine and thirst' signify a lack of the knowledges of good and truth, therefore it is also said 'in that day shall the beautiful virgins and the youths faint for thirst,' 'the beautiful virgins' meaning the affections of truth from good, and 'youths' the truths themselves that are from good, 'the thirst from which they shall faint' meaning the lack of these."
