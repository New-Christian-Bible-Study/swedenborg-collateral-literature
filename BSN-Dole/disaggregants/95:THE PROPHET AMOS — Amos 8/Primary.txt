=== For Younger Children

[.underline]#*Teacher Notes:*# 
Show the children the books of the Major and Minor Prophets in the Bible and talk to them about the prophet's mission. Then take up the chapter for today, distinguishing between the vision in the first verse and the message that follows.

---
Ask your teacher to show you in your Bible the books of the Prophets. The first four of these are long books and so they are called the Major Prophets. These four are named Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and Daniel. Then there are twelve short books. These are called the Minor Prophets. Let us read their names so that you will recognize them when you hear them again.

All the prophets knew that the words they spoke were the Lord's — not their own.

They were messages given them by the Lord to pass on to the people. They had strange visions, too.

They did not understand what the visions meant, but they knew they were to write them down.

Amos is the third of the Minor Prophets, as the books come in our Bible. He tells us himself that he was a shepherd who lived in Tekoa, a village near Bethlehem.

He lived in the days of king Uzziah of Judah. This was some years before king Hezekiah.

In our chapter what did Amos see in vision?

Then what was he told would happen to the people of Israel?

What bad things were they doing?

People today are still tempted to do these very same bad things.

Perhaps even you have sometimes wanted to take more than your share of things and to take things that belonged to other children, and to stay at home and play instead of going to Sunday school and church. So you see the Lord is warning us all.

Now read verse 11.

We say sometimes that someone is hungry for love. And we speak of a thirst for knowledge.

What kind of food and drink does verse 11 tell us our souls need?
