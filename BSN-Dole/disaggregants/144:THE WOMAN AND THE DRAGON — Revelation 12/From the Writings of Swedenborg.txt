=== From the Writings of Swedenborg

@AR 548: "By 'war' is signified spiritual war, which is of falsity against truth, and truth against falsity, for no other war can take place in heaven, where this is said to have existed ... By 'Michael' is not meant any archangel; neither by 'Gabriel, and Raphael,' but ministries in heaven are meant; the ministry signified by 'Michael' is performed by those who confirm from the Word, that the Lord is the God of heaven and earth, and that God the Father and He are one, as the soul and body are one; also that men ought to live according to the commandments of the Decalogue, and that then men have charity and faith."
