=== From the Writings of Swedenborg

@AE 638[7]: "This treats of the foundation of the house or temple by Zerubbabel; and the 'house' or 'temple' signifies the church, therefore a 'lampstand' was seen by the prophet, and 'near it two olive—trees,' almost the same as what was seen by John here in the Apocalypse; and the 'two olive—trees' and the 'olive berries' signify celestial goods, which are the goods of love to the Lord and of love towards a brother or companion; the former good is signified by 'the olive—tree seen at the right side of the bowl,' and the latter by 'the olive—tree seen near the left side.' The truths of this good are meant by 'the sons of the olive—tree standing by the Lord of the whole earth,' 'to stand by Him' signifying to be and to exist from Him."
