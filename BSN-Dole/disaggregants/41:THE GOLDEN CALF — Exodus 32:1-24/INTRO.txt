=== Introduction

The teachers should review chapters 19, 20, and 24 in order to have clearly in mind the sequence of events from the time of the arrival at Sinai to the incidents of our lesson for today. Moses has been up and down the mountain more than once. Note especially 24:18, which introduces the situation in chapter 32. In all the classes stress the fact that all the people had heard the commandments given by the voice of the Lord from the mount, and that they had several times promised to obey.
