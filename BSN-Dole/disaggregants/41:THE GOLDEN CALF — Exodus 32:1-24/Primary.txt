=== For Younger Children

[.underline]#*Teacher Notes:*# 
The story is simple and dramatic. Tie it in with the giving of the commandments. Tell the children that one of the principal idols of the Egyptians was the calf.

---
You remember that the children of Israel were led out of Egypt in a wonderful way. The Lord went before them in a pillar of cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night. They were told to follow the pillar wherever it went, whether it moved by day or by night: and when it stopped, they were to stop and camp, and not to go on again until the pillar moved on.

When they left Rephidim the pillar led them to the wilderness of Sinai, a great plain at the foot of a steep mountain. They had been on their journey about three months. The pillar stopped in front of Mount Sinai and the people camped, and they remained there for nearly a year.

What did all the people hear the voice of the Lord speak from the mountain top?

Moses was called to come up to the top to receive the commandments and many other laws and instructions for the life and worship of Israel.

Some of the elders, including Joshua, went part way up with him, but not to the top.

Moses was gone forty days and forty nights.

The people had promised to obey the Lord in everything. Did they keep their promise?

When they thought Moses was not coming back, what did they ask Aaron to do?

What idol did he make for them?

What did he use to make it?

What did Moses have in his hands when he came down from the mount?

When he found the people worshiping the golden calf, what did he do with the tables?

What did he do with the golden calf?
