[.underline]#*Teacher Notes:*# 
This is a long chapter and is difficult to cut to a suitable reading for younger children. Interrupt the reading at each break in the continuity and tell briefly the part of the story which has been omitted. Parents reading with the family at home are urged to read the whole chapter aloud, but not all at once.

---
Abraham loved his son Ishmael, but the Lord told him that he was to have another son who would be the child of his true wife Sarah. So when Ishmael was fourteen years old, Sarah had a son. He was named Isaac, which means "laughter."

After Isaac grew up and his mother Sarah had died, Abraham sent his servant to Haran, where Abraham's brother Nahor had settled, to get a wife for Isaac from among his own relatives. The servant took ten camels with him on the journey, as well as presents to give to his master's future wife and her family.

Where did the servant stop near the city of Haran?

What did he ask of the Lord?

What maiden did the Lord show him was to be Isaac's wife?

Who was Rebekah?

Her parents and her brother Laban welcomed Abraham's servant.

They felt that the Lord had chosen Rebekah for Isaac and so they were willing to let her go.

Rebekah was willing also.

Where was Isaac when he first saw Rebekah?

Was he satisfied with the wife the servant had brought him?
