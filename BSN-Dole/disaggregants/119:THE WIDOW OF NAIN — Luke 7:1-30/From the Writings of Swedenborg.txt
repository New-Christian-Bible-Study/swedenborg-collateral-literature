=== From the Writings of Swedenborg

@AE 899[11]: "'Death' signifies resurrection, and thus 'the dead' signify those who rise again into eternal life, because 'death' signifies hell, and thus evils and falsities; and these must die that man may receive spiritual life; for until these are dead and extinct man has no spiritual life, which is the life that is meant in the Word by 'life,' 'eternal life,' and 'resurrection'; therefore 'to die' means here and elsewhere in the Word the extinction of the life that is man's own, which regarded in itself consists solely of evils and falsities from them ... Resurrection from the dead, both in the natural and in the spiritual sense, was represented and thus was signified by the dead whom the Lord raised."
