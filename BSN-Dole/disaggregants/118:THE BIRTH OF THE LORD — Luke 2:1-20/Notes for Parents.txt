=== Notes for Parents

We all know that the Advent of the Lord made such a change in the world's history that eventually the calendar was changed to date from it. This alone should prove to us that Jesus was not a man like ourselves. No mere man could have accomplished what He accomplished.

Throughout the Old Testament there are prophecies that one day God Himself would come into the world. The Hebrew word Messiah, "the anointed one," was the name used by the Jews to refer to this promised savior, and the Greek word which means the same is Christ. Jesus means "Jehovah saves," and it was also said that the child was to be called Emmanuel, which means "God with us."

The Lord said that He came into the world not to condemn but to save. He took on a human nature from Mary in order that He might come in direct contact with all the temptations which we feel, and by overcoming them give us the power to overcome them in His strength as we try to follow His example. He came to show us the way to safety, happiness, and peace — the way to heaven. He came because He loves us.

Nothing was accidental about the way in which this great event took place. Every detail of the Christmas stories in Matthew and Luke has a deep meaning which the older children are studying. They are beautiful stories which we all love, and they should mean more and more to us as the years go by. We should never forget that on the first Christmas day God gave us the greatest gift of all: Himself.
