== THE WIDOW OF NAIN — Luke 7:1-30

As noted in the first lesson from Luke, our effort - after covering the basic story of the Lord's life in Matthew - is to center the lessons as far as possible in stories in the particular Gospel under consideration which do not appear in the other Gospels. This means that the facts of the Lord's life must be brought in by the way. In this lesson, for example, the teacher should tell briefly the story of the Lord's early years and of His baptism before taking up the chapter for the day. The latter part of the lesson ties in with the review and with the Old Testament.
