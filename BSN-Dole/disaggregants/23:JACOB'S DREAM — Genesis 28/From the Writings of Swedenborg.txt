Doctrine of the Holy Scripture, n. 78: "It is through the Word that the Lord is present with a man and is conjoined with him, for the Lord is the Word, and as it were with the man in it. The Lord is also Divine truth itself, as likewise is the Word. From this it is evident that the Lord is present with a man and is at the same time conjoined with him, according to his understanding of the Word, for according to this the man has truth and the derivative faith, and also love and the derivative life. The Lord is indeed present with a man through the reading of the Word, but He is conjoined with him through the understanding of truth from the Word, and according thereto; and in proportion as the Lord has been conjoined with a man, in the same proportion the church is in him. The church is within man; the church that is outside of him is the church with a number of men who have the church within them. This is meant by the Lord's words to the Pharisees who asked when the kingdom of God would come: 'The kingdom of God is within you.' (Luke 17:21) Here the 'kingdom of God' means the Lord, and from Him, the church."
