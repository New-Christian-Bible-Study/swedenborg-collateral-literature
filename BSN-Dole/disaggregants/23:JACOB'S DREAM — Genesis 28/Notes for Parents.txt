=== Notes for Parents

This beautiful story is familiar to us all. We can picture the young man Jacob starting out on a long journey all by himself with no certainty as to where he would get food or how he would prosper, and also with the knowledge of the wrong he had done his brother and of his brother's anger. He could not have been in a very happy state of mind. We all have times when we are very much like Jacob. We too do wrong and carry burdens on our conscience, and we too often have to start out on new undertakings with very little assurance as to how things will turn out for us.

Have you ever thought how many stories there are in the Bible which concern sleep? Swedenborg tells us that the reason why we need so much sleep is that when we are asleep our minds are taken off the things of this world and of our own success and desires, and the Lord can draw closer to us and renew our souls. Our souls need sleep even more than our bodies do. Little children need a great deal of sleep because it is in infancy and early childhood that the Lord stores up in them states of trust and innocence which will help them all their lives.

So Jacob had a wonderful dream which gave him hope and courage and led him to promise to serve the Lord all his life. Jacob's dream is a picture of something we may have in our own lives which will give us courage and strength to face all our problems and troubles if only we will take advantage of it. The Bible is our "Jacob's ladder." Its foot is on the earth; that is, it is written in terms of everyday life, which we can understand. But its top is in heaven, and the Lord is there at the top. The ascending angels are our thoughts going up to Him as we read it and the angels that are descending on it are His truths which He speaks to us through it.
