[.underline]#*Teacher Notes:*# 
The children should be reminded of the history and character of Daniel, with emphasis on his courage in doing what was right in the midst of temptation. Then read the story from the Word. Emphasize verses 25-28 and make the point that when we do right, other people are often led to a better state of thought and feeling.

When king Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon conquered Judah, he at first tried to keep things there very much as they were. Although he carried off some of the treasure, he did not take most of the people away at that time. But he did have a few of the most promising young princes brought to Babylon to be trained in his own court. One of these young princes was Daniel.

You know some children are very easily persuaded by their playmates to do things they know are wrong. Daniel was not like that. He was very brave and honest, and he went right on worshiping the Lord in Babylon just as he had at home in Jerusalem. So the Lord gave Daniel great wisdom and the ability to interpret dreams and to foretell the future. And He made him His prophet to speak words of warning to the kings of Babylon.

The Lord gave him power to interpret dreams.

Through this power he became one of the rulers in Babylon.

Do you remember someone else who rose to power in the same way?

Later, under king Darius, the princes of Babylon became jealous of Daniel. What law did they persuade Darius to sign?

What did Daniel do?

Did the king want Daniel killed?

How did the king show his grief?

How was Daniel saved?

How did Darius punish the princes?

When we try to hurt other people, we are very likely to find that we ourselves are the ones who get hurt.
