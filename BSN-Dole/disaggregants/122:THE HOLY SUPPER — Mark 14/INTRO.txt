=== INTRO

As an introduction to this lesson review briefly the Palm Sunday account, calling attention to the fact that the Lord came to Jerusalem to die and told His disciples so, but that they did not understand or remember what He said. Note that during the last week of His earthly life He spent the nights at Bethany.
