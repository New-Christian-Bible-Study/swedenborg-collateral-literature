Talk about the vine and the grapes. The miracle at Cana may be recalled in some detail as a basis for showing that all life is from the Lord. This class can be given the idea of the difference between good done from self and good done from the Lord.

You have all eaten grapes. You know that they come in bunches and are very sweet and juicy and refreshing. Perhaps some of you have been in places where grapes are grown, and have seen the grape vines twining upon the trellises built to support them. We not only eat grapes, but their juice is used to make the wine which is served at the Lord's table in the Holy Communion, which you will share when you are old enough to be confirmed.

Wine was served at the Passover feast when the Lord was on earth, and at other feasts, too.

Do you remember how the Lord turned water into wine at the wedding feast at Cana?

There were no grapes in that story, were there?

The Lord did not need the grapes in order to produce wine. From our lesson today can you tell why?

All the power to produce anything comes from the Lord.

Without Him we can do nothing, just as John 15:5 says. The "fruit" the Lord wants us to produce is good deeds.

But goodness can come only from Him.

If we praise ourselves instead of the Lord for our good deeds, they are not really good at all.

They are like artificial fruit, which looks pretty but cannot be eaten. When we think our goodness is our own, we are cutting ourselves off from the vine.

We must learn what the Lord wants us to do, and ask Him to help us do it.

Every time you say the Lord's Prayer remember that you are asking the Lord to help you to be His branches and to bring forth the good fruit which He expects of you.
