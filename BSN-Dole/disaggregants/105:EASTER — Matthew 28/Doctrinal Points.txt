=== Doctrinal Points

Disbelief in the resurrection is willful, not logical.

Easter means not only belief in a future life. It also means belief in the power of love over hate, of truth over falsity, in all of life.

The Lord's resurrection teaches that the Lord is always with us even though we cannot see Him with our physical eyes.
