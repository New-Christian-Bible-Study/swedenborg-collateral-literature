Spend most of the class time on the two incidents at Rephidim. Be sure the children understand that Moses, when he stood on top of the hill and held up his hands, was asking for the Lord's help. They will remember about the crossing of the Red Sea, and they should remember the giving of the manna. In the lesson for today impress upon them the name and function of Joshua, as this is the first time he appears in the Bible story. The Lord's constant presence and help is the principal lesson.

You remember that when the children of Israel ate the feast of the Passover, they were dressed all ready for their journey out of Egypt. They left in great haste and traveled as fast as they could. It was fortunate that they did, because after they had gone, Pharaoh changed his mind and sent an army after them to bring them back. The army caught up with them just as they reached the shore of the Red Sea, and they thought their effort had failed.

But the Lord saved them in a wonderful way. First He caused the pillar of cloud and fire, which He had given to lead them on their journey, to move around behind the Israelites and hide them so that the Egyptians could neither see nor reach them. Then He rolled back the waters of the Red Sea so that they could cross on dry ground. And finally, when the Egyptian army tried to follow them, He made the waters come back again so that the Egyptians were all drowned.

To reach the Holy Land the people had to travel a long way.
