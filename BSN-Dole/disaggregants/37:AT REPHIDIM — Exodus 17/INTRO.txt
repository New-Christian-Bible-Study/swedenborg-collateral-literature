=== Introduction

Several familiar stories — the crossing of the Red Sea, the sweetening of the bitter waters of Marah, the rest at Elim, and the giving of the quails and manna — form the background for this lesson. Each teacher will have to judge how much of the class time may safely be spent on the review of these stories without slighting the lesson for the day. The Lord's care and protection of the children of Israel is the unifying thought.
