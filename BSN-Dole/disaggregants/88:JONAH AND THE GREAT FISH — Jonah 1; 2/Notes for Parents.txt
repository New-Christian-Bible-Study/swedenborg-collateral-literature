=== Notes for Parents

Most of us have heard people make fun of the story of Jonah.

It is one of the stories in the Bible whose wonderful lessons have been hidden from many people by careless talk. Jonah was saved by a miracle no more remarkable than any other miracle in the Bible. "The Lord prepared a great fish to swallow up Jonah." If we believe that God is the Creator of everything, we certainly should not question His power to create new forms and to govern and direct His creation.

Jonah was a prophet in the kingdom of Israel some seventy-five years before Israel was taken captive by Assyria, but even then Assyria was recognized as an enemy. It was quite natural that when the Lord told Jonah to go to Nineveh, the capital of Assyria, and tell the people there of their wickedness, Jonah did not want to obey. How often we are willing to do anything but the one thing we know the Lord wants us to do! We run away from our duty just as Jonah did. The Lord put the story of Jonah in the Word to teach us that running away does no good. When we run away, nothing goes well for us. We cannot hide from the Lord and we cannot hide from ourselves. If we mean to be good people, sooner or later we shall have to bring our fault out into the open and look at it honestly and make up our minds to get rid of it. Then we have a period of struggle, which is pictured by Jonah's three days and nights in the belly of the fish. He says of himself, "The waters compassed me about, even to the soul: the depth closed me round about, the weeds were wrapped about my head." Doesn't this describe the way we feel sometimes when we are fighting some bad feeling deep in our hearts? But finally the Lord brought Jonah out of his trouble, and then Jonah thanked the Lord even for the trouble, because it had showed him his fault, and now he could do what the Lord wanted him to do.
