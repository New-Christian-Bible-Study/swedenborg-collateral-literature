=== INTRO

The first seven chapters of Genesis were copied verbatim from the Ancient Word and are in the language of pure symbol in which that word was written (see @DSS 103, @TCR ???; SD 5605). They are especially adapted to the teaching of young children, who love the simple, beautiful pictures they present and retain them deep in their memories. They should be taught with a feeling of wonder and reverence.
