=== Notes for Parents

The beautiful parable of the Garden of Eden shows us the happy, innocent state of the first people on earth after they had developed — through the stages described in the Creation story — into a church. At the center of this church was worship of the Lord as the Source of all goodness and truth — the tree of life. The river which watered the garden was truth from the Lord flowing into every plane of life. It was an ideal state.

Do we wonder why it did not last? It was because of that other tree in the garden, the tree of knowledge of good and evil. Mankind, we remember, was created in the image and likeness of God. Man was not to be a mere automaton, carrying out the will of God by instinct like the animals. He was to have the feeling that he was an independent being, and the freedom to choose whether he would serve God or himself. This was the tree of knowledge of good and evil. The Lord warned man not to eat of its fruit, that is, not to believe that he was really wise apart from the Lord's truth, but he was left free to disobey.

The story of the creation of woman from Adam's rib is, of course, a parable too. The first seven chapters of Genesis were copied by Moses from an Ancient Word which existed before our Bible and which was written in an old style of pure symbolism. We should know that Adam and Eve were not two individuals, for we have already been told that both men and women had been created. Adam is the Hebrew word for "man" or "mankind," and Eve means "life." The story of the creation of Eve gives us a picture of the Lord's mercy in permitting mankind to see how the lifeless framework which he really is can be brought to life and clothed with beauty by the Lord's spirit. Of ourselves we are nothing, but if we turn to the Lord and obey Him, He can make us angels. And this story also gives us the basis of true marriage, for it is only obedience to the Lord and unselfish devotion to one another that can make a marriage happy.
