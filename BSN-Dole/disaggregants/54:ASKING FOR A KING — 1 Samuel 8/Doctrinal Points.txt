=== Doctrinal Points

The Lord adapts His treatment of us to our states.

The Word always shows us clearly the transition from one spiritual state to another.

It is natural and right for us to wish to understand the principles which the Lord gives to guide us, but we must be willing to recognize the difficulties if we are to enjoy the benefits of such knowledge.

When we try to have our own way in anything, it is always to some degree a rejection of the Lord.
