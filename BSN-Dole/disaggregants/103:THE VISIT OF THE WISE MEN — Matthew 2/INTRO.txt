=== Introduction

This is the first of our special lessons. In this Christmas lesson, in all classes except the Younger Children, it should be pointed out that the number and names of the Wise Men are not given in the Word. Tradition says there were three — possibly because of the three gifts — and gives them the names Casper, Melchior, Balthazar, and many Christmas pictures, pageants, and stories are based on these traditions. But the children should know from the start what is Scripture and what is tradition, as the confusion of the two is hard to correct later.
