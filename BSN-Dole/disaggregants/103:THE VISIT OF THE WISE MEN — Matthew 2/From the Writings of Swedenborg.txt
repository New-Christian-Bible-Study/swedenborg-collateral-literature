=== From the Writings of Swedenborg

@AC 9293: "By 'gold, frankincense, and myrrh' are signified all things of the good of love and of faith in the Lord; by 'gold' those of the good of love; by 'frankincense' those of the good of faith; and by 'myrrh' those of both in things external. The reason why the Wise Men from the East offered these things, was that among some in the East there remained from ancient times the knowledge and wisdom of the men of old, which consisted in understanding and seeing heavenly and Divine things in those which are in the world and upon the earth. For it was known to the ancients that all things correspond and are representative, and consequently have a signification; as is also evident from the most ancient books and monuments of the Gentiles. Consequently they knew that gold, frankincense, and myrrh signify the goods which are to be offered to God. They also knew from their prophetic writings, which were of the Ancient Church, that the Lord was to come into the world, and that a star would then appear to them."
