== THE RESURRECTION — John 20

The distinctive incidents in the Easter story in the Gospel of John are Mary's recognition of the risen Lord and Thomas' doubt and its resolution. But the teachers should be sure that all the classes have a knowledge of the general Easter story, as well as of its background in the states of the disciples.

=== Doctrinal Points

When we die we go on living in a spiritual body.

The Lord glorified His humanity, uniting it with the divinity which had begotten it.

Our idea of God is the most important idea we have.

=== Notes for Parents

On the first Easter Sunday the Lord rose from the sepulcher in which His body had been placed after the crucifixion and showed Himself to several of His followers, and during the next forty days, He appeared to the same people many times and to others also. We need have no doubt of the facts here — all history was changed by them. The Lord's resurrection not only restored the faith of His disciples but gave them courage to go out through the world and found Christian churches in many places.

For us as individuals the Easter lesson means the certainty that our life continues after the death of the body. But it means a great deal more than that. When Mary Magdalene recognized the Lord as He spoke her name, He said to her: "Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended to my Father." Mary was not to think of the Lord as merely the friend and master she had known and loved in the world. He had to rise in her thoughts and be recognized as the heavenly Father Himself. Jesus had once said to Philip, when Philip had asked Him to show them the Father: "Have I been so long time with you, and yet hast thou not known me, Philip? he that hath seen me hath seen the Father." We must learn to think of Jesus not as a man who lived in this world many centuries ago, but as the one God of heaven and earth, who loved us so much that He was willing to take on a human nature like ours in order to show us how to meet and overcome our temptations, and who then put it off to show us that He really is our heavenly Father and that He is not far away but present with us in all our struggles and disappointments, even though we do not see Him with our physical eyes.

Mary and the disciples did not see the risen Lord with their physical eyes. He opened their spiritual sight, as He could open ours if He found it needful for us. The body in which He rose was His divine body, with which He had been gradually replacing the finite physical body He had put on through Mary. He appeared to the disciples without coming through doors. He appeared to each one as that one was prepared to recognize Him. This teaches us a very important lesson. We see the Lord only as we prepare our minds to see Him by learning all we can about Him and obeying His teaching. If we are faithful, He will rise in our minds and will become to us "the way, the truth, and the life."

=== Primary

Get as much of the background from the children as possible. Use the attitude of the disciples to show how foolish it is to think that spiritual things are not real.

When the Lord rode into Jerusalem on Palm Sunday, He knew that the very people who were welcoming Him as their king would turn against Him in just a few days and shout, "Crucify him!" just as loudly as they had shouted "Hosanna!" The disciples did not know this. He had told them what was to happen, but they had not believed it or even remembered it.

When on the very next Thursday night the Lord was seized by His enemies, even His closest followers who loved Him "forsook Him and fled." They were not quite brave enough then to risk their own lives for Him. They still thought of life in this world as the most precious thing and of death as the end of everything. So when on Friday He was put to death, they thought all their hopes had come to nothing and that they would never see Him again.

But some of the women who had loved the Lord thought of one last thing they could do for Him.

It was their custom to use certain spices in preparing bodies for burial. So on Sunday morning the women took these spices to the tomb where the Lord's body had been laid.

The first one to reach the tomb was Mary Magdalene. What did she find?

What did Peter and another disciple do when she told them? 

After they had gone home, what did Mary see in the tomb? 

Who then came and spoke to her?

How did the Lord appear to the disciples that same day? Thomas was not with them, and he would not believe. How did the Lord convince him?

The disciples knew then that death was not the end of life.

Do you wonder that after this none of the disciples was ever afraid of death again? And we need never be afraid of it either.

=== Junior

Do more in this class with the events of Holy Week before you go on to the lesson proper. At this age especially children need to be impressed with the facts of the Lord's life and with the assurance of His continued presence in the world.

What kind of animal did the Lord ride to enter Jerusalem the last Sunday of His earthly life?

How did the people receive Him?

What did they carry in their hands? What did they shout?

What did they think the Messiah would do?

What did the Lord know would happen?

What parable did He tell to explain why He had to die?

You would think, wouldn't you, that the Lord's disciples would have understood Him? But the ideas of life and death which were in their minds were very much like those of the rest of the people. When we are born, we do not have any knowledge of the Lord or of heaven, and unless we are taught these things when we are children, we grow up thinking that this life is all there is and that death is the end of everything for us. And after we are grown up, it is very hard for us to change our habits of thought. Even if we come to see that there must be a God and a future life, it is hard for us to think of either as real, because the things of this earth seem to us the only real things. So, although the Lord had told His disciples that He would be put to death and would rise again on the third day, it seemed so impossible to them that they scarcely even remembered it.

You may remember that the Lord spent the first two days of His last week teaching in the temple, and at night went out to Bethany and lodged at the home of Mary and Martha and their brother Lazarus, whom He had raised from the dead. By Tuesday night the opposition to Him in Jerusalem had become so great that He remained at Bethany and did not enter Jerusalem again until He came for the Passover feast on Thursday evening. At that feast He instituted the Holy Supper, and after it He went outside the city to the Garden of Gethsemane to pray. There Judas betrayed Him into the hands of the officers whom the chief priests had sent to arrest Him.

When He was arrested, all His disciples forsook Him and fled, and on Friday, after He was crucified, they were completely discouraged. Their hopes had centered in Him, and when He did not save Himself from death at the hands of His enemies, they felt that they must have been mistaken in their belief in Him. They were very unhappy about it, but they had no hope. As the two disciples on the way to Emmaus said (Luke 24:20), "We trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed Israel." You see even the disciples had been thinking of the Lord as an earthly king.

But the women who had followed the Lord had loved Him for Himself. They had not been so concerned with earthly greatness. They, too, did not expect to see Him again, but they thought of Him instead of themselves and wanted to do the last thing they could for Him, which was to prepare His body properly for burial according to their customs. That was why they came to the tomb with their spices early on Sunday morning. They could not come before, because it was not considered lawful to do such things on the sabbath.

The first one to reach the tomb on that first Easter morning was a woman out of whom the Lord had cast seven devils (Mark 16:9, Luke 8:2).

Who was this woman?

What did she find? Whom did she tell?

What did Peter find in the tomb?

What did Mary afterward see in the tomb?

Who came and spoke to her?

Whom did she at first think He was?

When did she recognize Him?

What did He tell her?

When did He appear to all the disciples?

Which one was not present?

Why would he not believe the others?

How did the Lord convince him?

What did the Lord tell Thomas, which also applies to us?

We should notice that although there was nothing of the Lord's physical body left in the tomb, and although He appeared to Thomas with the nail holes in His hands and the wound in His side, still Mary at first did not recognize Him, and He appeared suddenly among the disciples in spite of the fact that the doors were closed. We know that death is no more the end of us than it was the end of the Lord. We go right on living in the spiritual world in our spiritual bodies — just as much ourselves as ever. But there is a difference between the Lord and us. We leave our physical bodies behind us when we die, and we no longer have any conscious contact with this world except when the Lord permits us to feel our nearness to the people we love here or to others whom we can help. The Lord also put off the physical body He had taken on from Mary, but He replaced it with a divine body. So He is present in this world everywhere and sees and knows all that goes on here. We do not see Him unless He wishes us to, and when He does appear to anyone, He takes on the form in which the particular person can recognize Him.

These two special lessons we learn from Easter: death is only a step in life, and the Lord is always here with us.

=== Intermediate

There are a number of correspondences here around which to build the lesson for this class. The principal thought to stress is the necessity of rising above earthly ideas. Carry this out in its application to our thoughts of death, if the young people are at all uncertain about this.

At the end of the nineteenth chapter of John we are told that after the crucifixion two members of the high court of the Jews, Joseph of Arimathea and Nicodemus (see Luke 23:50 and John 3:1), with the consent of Pilate, the Roman governor, took the body of Jesus and wrapped it in linen cloths with spices [cf. Mark 16:1, Luke 24:1], according to their burial custom, and laid it in a new tomb. Matthew 27:60 tells us that the tomb belonged to Joseph of Arimathea and that after the burial he rolled a great stone in front of the door. We learn still more about this stone from Matthew 27:62-66.

In our Palm Sunday lesson we learned something of the reason why the Lord had to pass through death. In the Word, burial and a tomb, in the case of a good person, represent resurrection and regeneration. We can understand this most easily if we try to put ourselves in the place of the angels who welcome people into the spiritual world, who see the person awaking there just about the time when his grave in this world is being closed. The ideas which we in this world have about the person who has left us are pictured by the linen cloths in which Joseph and Nicodemus wrapped the body of Jesus before they laid it in the tomb. The spices represent truth also, but more interior truth which comes from goodness in the heart. Both Joseph and Nicodemus believed in the Lord and were trying to do right, although their thought of Him was entirely of His earthly life, which now seemed at an end.

In all four Gospels we learn that it was the women who first discovered that the stone had been rolled away from the entrance to the tomb and that the Lord's body was no longer there. Women represent affections. A stone, in a good sense, represents truth in its basic or lowest form. In this case it represents the truth which had been wrongly used by the Lord's enemies to make sure that He would "stay buried." They had falsified the letter of Scripture by making it mean what they wanted it to mean. In Matthew 28:2 we are told that there was a great earthquake and that the angel of the Lord rolled back the stone from the door. All the thinking of the world was upset eventually by the resurrection of the Lord. The women first discovered it because it is love in the heart which makes it possible for the Lord to show anyone the real truth. The women then told the men — just as our affections, if they are good, enable our minds to see.

When we die, we go on living in a spiritual body. The body we lived in here in the material world we leave behind us, but it lasts - at least in part — a good many years after we have left it, although it no longer has any life. We rise from death only in the spiritual world. But the Lord continued to be in contact with this world. He was seen and recognized by the women, by the disciples, and later by many others. And there was no material body left in the tomb. Yet Mary at first did not recognize Him; He appeared to the disciples suddenly although the doors were closed; and we remember from one of our lessons from Luke that the two disciples who walked with Him to Emmaus did not recognize Him until they began to eat with Him. All through His life in the world the Lord had been putting forth from the Divine within Himself a human nature to replace the finite nature which He took on from Mary. As He overcame each temptation, He put off that bit of the finite and replaced it with the Divine. Someone long ago compared this process with drawing out one thread at a time in a piece of cloth and in its place weaving in a thread of gold, until finally the whole piece would be gold instead of cloth. So when the Lord rose, there was nothing left of the human He had assumed — even of the material body — but He had a divine humanity in its place in which He could always be present in the natural world. His last words in the Gospel of Matthew are: "Lo, I am with you always, to the close of the age." The Lord, unlike spirits and angels, sees and knows everything that goes on in this world because He is present in it in His divine humanity.

The only things that were left in the tomb were the linen cloths and the napkin, which had been about His head. The linen cloths represent the truths about the Lord which we find in the literal sense of the Word, and the napkin the memory of His external life on earth as it is recorded in the Gospels. These are what are left to us to pick up and examine as evidence of the truth. Read John 20:31.

We should all study and remember the little incident about Thomas in John 20:24-29. The kind of person today who likes to say, "Well, you'll have to show me" is sometimes called a "doubting Thomas." The Lord did "show" Thomas by appearing to him just as Thomas wanted to see Him, but He did not praise Thomas for his very earthly idea. The Lord "appears" to every good person just as the person has learned to think of Him, but He does not want us to confine our thoughts of Him to material ideas. This is what is meant by His words to Mary in John 20:17 as well as by His final words to Thomas in John 20:29. As we learn more and more of the Lord from the Word, our idea of Him should rise higher and higher, lifting us above the level of earthly thoughts and ambitions.

=== Basic Correspondences

burial = resurrection and, in the case of a good person, regeneration
women = affections
linen = truth of the natural man
spices = interior natural truth from good
a napkin = the memory of the natural man

=== Senior

The Senior notes have been devoted principally to the question of the importance of having a true idea of God. This lesson is the one to stress, but the teacher may feel that his particular class will be helped also by some of the other points which he will find in the notes for the other classes.

We usually think of the Easter lesson as given to teach us that our life goes on uninterrupted after death and that we should therefore think of death, whenever and however it occurs, not as a tragedy but as merely the beginning of a new and fuller life for the person who has died. This is true, and it is the most obvious lesson to be drawn from the story of the Lord's resurrection. But there are also deeper and more far-reaching lessons in this story.

When the Lord was on earth, even the good people had no thought about goodness except in terms of this world. Even the apostles, who had lived with the Lord for three years and listened to His teaching, still thought of His kingdom as an earthly kingdom and felt, when He was put to death, that all their hopes were over. We see this same belief in our lesson today in the experience of Mary Magdalene. She was a woman out of whom the Lord had cast seven devils. She believed in Him and loved Him. She was not, as the disciples were, concerned about her own future now that He was gone, but the only service she could think of which she could still render Him was the proper care of His body. She was a simple woman. But there was no higher idea than this in the minds of those of the Lord's followers who had education and worldly position, as we see from the deed of the two counselors, Joseph of Arimathea and Nicodemus, in John 19:38-42. The linen cloths in which they wrapped the Lord's body represent their natural ideas of Him, and the spices the quality added to these same ideas by the goodness in their hearts. Spices represent "interior natural truth from good." Truth which we love to learn affects us more deeply than truth we learn because we have to. The people of those days knew the truths of the letter of the Word, but only a few of them loved them. The stone which sealed the tomb was the truth of the letter of the Word falsified by the interpretation of it by the religious leaders.

The Lord's resurrection was first discovered by the women, who represent affections, and they made it known to the men. Unless our hearts are loving, we can never be given any spiritual insight. Mary Magdalene was the first actually to see the Lord after His resurrection, although she did not immediately recognize Him. She knew Him when He pronounced her name. In the Word a name represents the whole quality of a person. Only the Lord knows the quality of each one of us. Then the Lord said to Mary: "Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended to my Father: but go to my brethren, and say unto them, I ascend unto my Father, and to your Father; and to my God, and your God." Here again the Lord was pointing out to His followers by means of one who truly loved Him that their thoughts of Him must be lifted above the level of the worldly ideas they had had, until they could identify Him with God rather than with man.

All our thinking as we go through life really depends upon our idea of God. If, as many do, we think of God as merely the sum total of the forces of the natural world, then all our ideals and aspirations will be for worldly success, and even if we mean to be good and useful people, helping people physically will be the best we can do. If, as the people of the Gospel did and as some sects do today, we think of God as a stern ruler and judge who wants our worship and sacrifices and takes revenge upon us and punishes us if we do not give them, then in our dealings with fellow men we shall think these same things justifiable. If we think of God as merely the first cause, someone or something which created the first material cell and left it to develop according to certain laws, we shall think that every man must determine for himself what he should believe and do and that one man's idea is as valid as another's — that there is no such thing as fixed truth. We are in this same position if we think that there is a God active in the universe but that we can know nothing about Him.

Then among Christians there is the problem of what to believe about Christ. Many Christians — people who accept Christ as their example — still think of Him only as the best man who ever lived. This leaves them free to take what they like of His teaching and say of what they don't like, "He was of course limited by His nation and His times; if He were living here and now, He would speak differently." But Christ was the Word made flesh, God Himself come into the world to live out the truth and to give us an ideal of which we might be sure, to show us that this life of ours in the world is only the beginning of our life and is important only as we use it to give our souls the truest form we can. So our thoughts of Christ must rise above the thought of Him as a man who lived a long time ago, and must be lifted up until we think of Him as God, our heavenly Father Himself. As He had told His disciples (John 16:28): "I came forth from the Father, and am come into the world: again, I leave the world, and go to the Father." He always adapts Himself to our ability to see Him, just as He did with Thomas in our chapter, but if we study the Word and try to increase our capacity to see and understand, He rises in our minds.

And in this new age in which we live He has come again in the opening of the inner meaning of the Word, giving us the means to a rational understanding of His teachings, so that our questions may be answered. If we make use of this means, our vision of the Lord will become clearer and more wonderful all the time, the things of self and of this world will fall into their proper places, and we shall come to live — even while we are still in this world — in the light of heaven.

=== Adult

The Adults will doubtless be familiar with the usual lessons drawn from the resurrection story. These should of course be touched upon, and the summary of the post—resurrection appearances of the Lord should be mentioned. A good discussion topic is found in the last two verses of the chapter. Even New Church people are sometimes fascinated and confused by stories and moving pictures which add imagined detail to the Bible story. Another good discussion topic is the effect of false ideas of the Lord as compared with that of a true idea. Suggestions on this topic will be found in the Senior notes.

In our study of the Easter lesson from the Gospel of Luke, we considered especially the effect of the resurrection upon the apostles, and through them upon the world. This should be recalled, because we all need to feel the force of the external evidence of the access of divine power which came into the world with the resurrection. But the Gospel of John characteristically suggests rather the deep personal application of the story of the resurrection to the regenerating individual.

Many Christians cling to the finite humanity of the Lord, trying to picture Him as He was in the world, stimulating their imaginations with the study of the racial and historical and geographical background of His finite humanity, believing that in this way they are drawing closer to Him and understanding Him better. This effort is unconsciously epitomized in the phrase "Back to Jesus," as if the real Jesus were somewhere in the past. They feel that the historic Christ is the whole Christ. The apostles were in this belief. In spite of all that the Lord had told them, they felt that they had lost Him when His material body was laid in the tomb. In the resurrection He taught them that they were wrong, and He wishes us to see that we are wrong when we confine Him in our thoughts to the humanity which He put off.

Early in the morning, while it was yet dark, Mary Magdalene came to the tomb and discovered that the stone had been removed from the entrance. Morning always pictures the dawn of a new state, but the ignorance still in her mind is represented by the fact that it was yet dark. Mary, out of whom seven devils had been cast (Luke 8:2), represents the heart which has been deeply purified through temptations. It is a deep and loving desire for the Lord which first discovers that He cannot be confined to the sepulcher, the mere letter of the Word; but it is the faculties of the mind — pictured by Peter and John (who was almost certainly the other disciple in our chapter) - which explore the sepulcher. They saw the linen cloths which were left in the sepulcher, the truths concerning the Lord in the letter, but it was Mary again, the loving heart, who perceived the angels, the living truths within the letter. Also it was Mary who first saw the Lord Himself after His resurrection. It is the loving heart which can first be given to feel the reality of the ever-present savior, even though it does not at first recognize Him. The Lord must rise in our hearts and minds. We begin our discipleship by studying His life in the world and trying to follow His example, but if we are faithful, the time will come when we shall no longer think of Him as someone who lived nearly twenty centuries ago, but as someone who is present in the world today, walking with us and speaking to us in the Word.

The Lord rose differently from any finite man. We leave something behind us when we die; we rise as spirits with full consciousness in the spiritual world, but we have left behind us the instruments by which we saw and heard in this world. The Lord glorified even His sensuous, replacing the material substance with divine substance,* so that He left nothing in the tomb, but rose a complete man even to ultimates. "For a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have." (Luke 24:39) (@AC 10252[7], 6135; @HH 316). Through the divine humanity He sees and hears in this world, and could even eat with His disciples and be handled by them. His humanity, being divine, is infinite; so He is present with all men at all times instead of being confined in a finite body which is subject to the limitations of space and time. But His presence is not imaginary; it is the most real fact there is: "Lo, I am with you always, to the close of the age."

[*Cf., however, Athanasian Creed, nos. 161-162 (London, 1954 ed.) or @AE Vol. 6, p.519 (New York, Standard Edition, 1949). -Editor]

The Gospels record several appearances of the Lord after the resurrection. The first was to Mary Magdalene, and Matthew records that He was also seen by the other women at the tomb. That same afternoon He appeared to the two on the way to Emmaus, as recorded in Luke and mentioned in Mark. An appearance to Peter is also mentioned in Luke 24:34. Mark, Luke, and John all record the appearance to the apostles as they sat at meat on the evening of the first day, and John tells us that although Thomas was not present on that occasion, the Lord appeared to them eight days later when Thomas was present. Matthew tells of an appearance in Galilee upon a mountain where the Lord had told them to meet Him, and John gives the story of the meeting by the sea of Tiberias (or Galilee) (John 21). In Acts 1:3 we learn that the Lord was seen over a period of forty days after the resurrection, and Paul says (1 Corinthians 15:6-7) that He appeared to five hundred brethren, and also to James. Evidently the Lord provided that there should be ample evidence of His living presence in the world after the crucifixion, and that the testimony of many should be recorded. But He told Thomas, "Blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have believed." There is a higher sight than that of the eye, and a deeper hearing than that of the ear. If our minds accept the Lord's truth and our hearts receive His life, we have a far deeper conviction of His presence than if we were to see Him with the physical eye. Most of those who saw Him in the flesh rejected Him. Many things which we see and hear in the world make little impression on us because we are not interested in them. Those who do not wish to recognize and obey the Lord simply refuse to believe the testimony of those who saw Him after the resurrection. If they had a vision of Him themselves, they would soon explain it away. Belief is of the will. We are free to choose the Lord or self.

John tells us (John 20:30-31) that the testimony which he has just recorded is not the only evidence of the Lord's deity, but that He did many other signs, and in the last verse of his Gospel (John 21:25) he says that if all the acts of the Lord were written, the world itself would not contain the books.

The Lord's earthly life was one of constant active service. We are told that He went about all Galilee teaching and preaching in the synagogues and healing the sick. Only a very few of His words and deeds are recorded, but these few are so chosen through divine providence that, in the letter, they illustrate all phases of His work, and in the spirit they contain the fullness of divine life. We should be willing to accept the wisdom of divine providence in this selection. In the early part of our lesson we spoke of the tendency to cling to the finite humanity of the Lord as the whole Christ. It is this tendency which causes many to waste time and effort - however sincere and reverent the intention — in trying to reconstruct by means of imagination plus historical studies, portions of the Lord's life which are not recorded in the letter; for example, to picture the Lord as a boy among other boys in Nazareth or as a young man working in Joseph's carpenter shop. Had there been any spiritual value in such thoughts of the Lord, the facts would have been recorded in the Word. Let us rather learn the facts which the Lord Himself considered it necessary for us to know about His earthly life, and not confuse His own picture of Himself with human imaginings, which tend to tie Him down in our minds to the plane of finite humanity. Then the Lord will gradually rise in our minds until we come to see Him as our living, present savior, God with us.

=== From the Writings of Swedenborg

@AE 687[18]: "Angels were seen in the tomb, sitting one at the head, and the other at the feet (John 20:12; Mark 16:5). These things seen were representative of the Lord's glorification, and of introduction into heaven by Him; for the 'stone' that was placed before the sepulchre, and that was rolled away by the angel, signifies Divine truth, thus the Word, which was closed up by the Jews, but opened by the Lord. ... And as a 'sepulchre,' and pre—eminently the sepulchre where the Lord was, signifies in the spiritual sense resurrection and also regeneration, and 'angels' signify in the Word Divine truth, therefore angels were seen sitting one at the head and the other at the feet; 'the angel at the head' signifying Divine truth in things first, and 'the angel at the feet' Divine truth in ultimates, both proceeding from the Lord; and when Divine truth is received regeneration is effected, and there is resurrection. "

JOHN'S VISION — Revelation 1

With all the older classes the historical connection with the Gospels should be made. In A.D. 70, some forty years after the resurrection and ascension of the Lord, Jerusalem and the temple were finally destroyed by the Romans under Titus, and the Christians were dispersed and driven into Asia Minor and beyond. So the early churches developed in Asia Minor. Be sure the children make the distinction between John the Baptist and the Apostle John. Also call their attention to the other name for the book of Revelation — the Apocalypse, the Greek word meaning unveiling or revelation — as they will hear it used frequently.

=== Doctrinal Points

The risen and glorified Lord is the one God of heaven and earth. The vision in chapter 1 gives us a complete picture of the Lord to hold in our minds when we pray to Him.

The book of Revelation is the "charter" of the New Church.

=== Notes for Parents

The book of Revelation has always been a challenge to the Christian Church. Even people who scoff at everything supernatural cannot quite deny its power. For it does not read like something anyone would or could "make up."

It is recognized as prophecy, and many attempts have been made to connect one or another war or disaster or other great historical event with some one of its striking pictures. In the first verse of the book John tells us that it speaks of the things "which must shortly come to pass," and in Revelation 1:19 he is told: "Write the things which thou hast seen, and the things which are, and the things which shall be hereafter."

John was "in the spirit." His spiritual eyes were opened to see the hearts and minds of the people of the Christian Church as they would appear in the searching light of divine love and wisdom. What he saw was like a great moving picture portraying in marvelous symbols the process of judgment.

And first he saw the Lord, the same master he had followed in the world and had seen transfigured once long before. But now the glory is so great that John falls at His feet as dead. And now the Lord can tell him plainly, "I am the first and the last." Jesus Christ risen and glorified is God Almighty. There is no other God.

We see many paintings of Christ, but we know that they are all merely the artists' ideas of what He may have looked like. No likeness painted when He was on earth or by one who saw Him then has come down to us. Why? Because we are not intended to dwell on the thought of Him as one who walked the roads of Palestine centuries ago. We are to think of our living, present Lord. The Lord's last words to His disciples in the Gospel of Matthew were:

"Lo, I am with you always, even to the close of the age."

And we can see Him with our minds. People sometimes ask, "How ought I to think of God when I pray to Him?" The Lord Himself gives us the answer in this first chapter of Revelation. We may think at first that it is a strange picture which is given us, but it is just what we should expect: one "like unto the Son of man," one whom we can imagine walking among us doing and saying the things we find in the Gospels, and yet glorified, surrounded by light, with stars in His hand and a sharp, two—edged sword of absolute divine truth coming from His mouth. The sword destroys what is evil and false, but it defends and protects all that is pure and good.

=== Primary

Speak of John, the apostle whom the Lord loved best, and tell the children how, when John was a very old man and had been driven away from his church and sent to a lonely island, the Lord Jesus whom he loved appeared to him one Sunday in a beautiful vision. The children should distinguish between the two Johns and be told the relation in time of the book of Revelation to the Gospel story which we have been studying. Make the connection between John's vision of the Lord and the story of the transfiguration. Have them notice how everything in this vision is a form of brightness and tell them that light is a picture of the Lord's truth which shows us the way in our lives. Read them Revelation 1:12-16 and suggest that this forms a beautiful thought about the Lord to keep in their minds when they pray.

Not long ago we had a story about how the Lord took His three closest disciples up on a high mountain and let them see a wonderful vision. Do you remember about it? One of those three disciples was John — not John the Baptist, but the John through whom the Lord wrote the Gospel of John.

Do you remember how the Lord looked to the three disciples at the transfiguration?

What three disciples saw Him transfigured?

Many years later the same John had a similar vision.

John was probably the youngest of the twelve apostles, and he lived on for a great many years after the Lord's death and resurrection. He was faithful to the Lord and went about telling people the good news about Him. Many people believed what he told them and were baptized, and Christian churches were started in several places. When John was an old man, he had charge of seven of these churches in Asia Minor, which was north of the Holy Land. The rulers at the time of our story, like the scribes and Pharisees, were trying to destroy the Christian faith.

John was now an old man, and had been banished by his enemies to the island of Patmos.

On what day of the week did John have the vision recorded in the book of Revelation?

John was "in the spirit."

This means that his spiritual eyes and ears were opened. What did he hear first?

Then whom did he see?

Can you describe how the Lord looked?

What did John see around the Lord?

What did the Lord have in His right hand?

What did He say about Himself?

What did He tell John the stars and the lampstands meant?

For whom did He give John messages?

He also told John to write down all he saw and heard.

What he wrote this time is the last book of our Bible, which is called Revelation. This means a revealing of hidden things. It is often also called the Apocalypse, which is the Greek word meaning the same thing.

=== Junior

Tell this class more about how the apostles, after the Lord left them, obeyed His command and went out into the world to found the Christian church. Tell them something about the persecution of the early Christians and how much John needed the encouragement of this vision. Remind them of the correspondence of light, and tell them that every detail of the vision has a beautiful correspondence which they will study when they are a little older. Impress upon them also that this vision is for us, too, and that we should think of the Lord in this way.

What three disciples had seen the Lord transfigured?

Many years later John had another wonderful vision of the Lord.

It was nearly sixty years after the Lord's crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension. John was the only one of the twelve apostles still living, and he was a very old man. Jerusalem and the temple had been destroyed by the Romans some years before and the Christians had been scattered through Asia Minor and even farther away. The first Christian churches had been organized in Asia Minor. John was the leader of the church at Ephesus, and probably had supervision over the other churches in that area.

But now the Christians were being persecuted, and John had been banished to the little island of Patmos out in the Aegean Sea twenty-four miles west of the coast of Asia Minor. One Bible dictionary tells us that the island is divided into two parts and says:

"On the hill to the south, crowning a commanding height is the celebrated monastery which bears the name of 'John the Divine.' Halfway up the ascent is the cave or grotto where tradition says that St. John received the Revelation."

On what day of the week was the vision given to John?

John was "in the spirit." That is, his spiritual eyes and ears were opened to see and hear things in the spiritual world. He was prepared for the vision by hearing a great voice "as of a trumpet," which seemed to come from behind him so that he had to turn toward the voice. We have to turn toward the Lord with our minds before He can instruct us.

What was the first thing the voice said to John?

Alpha and omega are the first and last letters of the Greek alphabet. We often see these letters on chancel furniture in churches.

The vision showed John immediately that the person he had known as Jesus Christ was really God Himself. Swedenborg tells us that no one can enter the heavens who does not recognize Jesus Christ as the only God of heaven and earth, but that good people who have not learned this before they die can be instructed in the other world. It is much better for us, of course, to know it now, because so we can base our lives on the real truth about God.

What was John told to do with the vision?

What did he see around the Lord?

How was the Lord dressed?

What was His voice like?

What did He hold in His right hand?

What went out of His mouth?

What did the seven lampstands picture?

What did the seven stars picture?

Every true church is like a lampstand upholding the truth which gives light to the world. You remember the word angel means "messenger." John was given messages for the seven churches in Asia Minor. He had already been the Lord's messenger in bringing to the people there the good news — or Gospel — of the Lord's coming as their savior. Each one of us can be a messenger of the Lord, if we try to learn all we can from Him and live as He wants us to live. If we are His messengers here, we shall be angels when we go into the other world.

=== Intermediate

The general correspondence of the vision, particularly as to the recurrence of light in all its details, should be stressed. The young people should be urged to read this chapter often and to learn to think about the Lord as He is pictured in it. Call their attention to the fact that, although John recognized Him as the same person who had been his master and his friend in the world, he now saw Him as a glorious being, the alpha and omega, God reigning in heaven.

The apostle John was called "the beloved disciple." To him was given to write not only the Gospel of John but also three letters and the book of Revelation. He outlived all the others. Forty days after the resurrection the disciples saw the Lord ascend into heaven. This is told in Luke 24:50-53. After the ascension the apostles went out, as the Lord had commanded them, to preach the Gospel to all the world. Their dispersion was hastened by the destruction of Jerusalem and the temple at the hands of the Romans in A.D. 70. Asia Minor then became their principal field of activity, and there groups of Christians were formed into churches. John seems to have been leader of the church at Ephesus, and in his old age, as the only survivor of the twelve, was doubtless looked upon as the head of the Christian Church. In one of the persecutions of the Christians he was banished to the island of Patmos in the Aegean Sea, where he had the vision recorded in the book of Revelation. This book is also called the Apocalypse, the Greek word for "revelation."

The Old Testament is composed of the Law and the Prophets.

So is the New Testament, the Gospels constituting the Law and the book of Revelation the Prophets. The other books of the New Testament, like the books of the Old which were included as Sacred Writings, are not part of the Word (not having an inner sense), but are valuable and interesting as history.

John was "in the spirit." His spiritual sight was opened to see "the things which are, and the things which shall be hereafter." The vision was like a mighty symbolic moving picture enacted before his eyes. Swedenborg tells us that the substance of the spiritual world is not inert like material substance, but is immediately responsive to spiritual forces, so that everything there takes on at once an outward form corresponding to the affections and thoughts of the angels or spirits or devils.

John's vision began with an appearance of the Lord to him.

He recognized the master he had known in the world; yet the accompaniments were those of deity, and John fell at His feet as dead. And the words spoken left no doubt that this was the creator Himself as well as the master whom John had known. In the New Church we accept this as our vision of the Lord. We do not look beyond Jesus to some more powerful and more terrible God. The Lord says to us, as to John, "Fear not; I am the first and the last."

John's vision gives us a picture to hold in our minds when we think about the Lord and when we pray to Him. The predominant feature of the picture is brightness — the golden lampstands, the stars, the eyes as a flame of fire, the feet like fine brass, and the countenance "as the sun shineth in his strength." We get the impression of a human form, but so bright that we can scarcely bear to look at it and cannot do more than glimpse its details. The correspondence throughout is to divine truth, except that the golden girdle or belt pictures divine love which binds all together, and the golden lampstands the love of divine truth which makes people of our age into a church. The two—edged sword is a picture of divine truth defending good and destroying evil.

The succeeding visions in the book of Revelation are concerned first with the condition of the church in the world and in men's minds and hearts — conditions which beset it and which eventually destroyed it in the final judgment. Their second concern is the way in which the Lord would build up a new church. The book of Revelation has been called the "charter of the New Church." But we must remember that everything that is said in the Word about the church in general has an application to our own individual lives also, and that each of us has within himself the evils which are pictured, and must fight them and try to grow into a true church.

=== Basic Correspondences

golden candlesticks or lampstands = divine truth loved
a two-edged sword = truth defending good and destroying evil
a golden girdle or belt = the divine love

=== Senior

The special lesson for the Seniors is the importance of the book of Revelation for the New Church, and of this opening vision of the Lord for our concept of Him. Use the details of the vision, in their spiritual sense, to clarify this concept and to stimulate thought about the Lord.

The book of Revelation has been called "the charter of the New Church." It is the strictly prophetic part of the New Testament and treats in all its details of the final dispensation of the Lord's truth which accomplishes the Last Judgment and establishes the Lord's true church, symbolized by the holy city New Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven.

The book of Revelation could not be understood in the light given to the first Christian Church era. All sorts of strange and conflicting interpretations of it were given. Only the opening of the Word in the Second Coming of the Lord has made it intelligible. In the light of the doctrine of correspondence it becomes a marvelous study.

It begins with John's vision of the Lord, and the picture given in our lesson for today is as near as we can come to a true picture of the Lord which we may hold before our minds when we worship. He is, as John saw Him to be, in the human form, the Christ of the Gospels, and yet so resplendent in glory that there can be no lingering thought of Him as a mere historic name, a finite man like ourselves. We see Him as God, the alpha and omega, the I AM.

The foundation of every church is its doctrine of the Lord. All its other doctrines grow out of this and the quality of life depends upon it. In the New Church the Lord means to us Jesus Christ always. Swedenborg tells us that "throughout all heaven no other than the Lord alone is acknowledged as the God of heaven" (@HH 2). The Old Testament prophesied that Jehovah Himself would come into the world, and the Lord, when He was in the world, said: "He that hath seen me hath seen the Father." Now He declared it to John in the words, "I am the first and the last." While the Lord was in the world it was necessary, in order that He might meet and overcome temptations, for Him much of the time to feel Himself to be a man like other men, and thus to look to the Divine as above Him, as His Father rather than as His own indwelling soul, for had He always felt Himself to be God, temptation could not have touched Him. The language of the trinity — Father, Son, and Holy Spirit — was necessitated by this fact. It has confused the men of the church, although even the letter of the Gospel should have shown them that the separation was only an apparent and temporary one, and that the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit are but three aspects of one and the same person. Every New Churchman should think this problem through for himself and be sure he understands it, for only in this way can he present his belief to others clearly.

Jesus Christ is God in the flesh, Jehovah come into the world to show us how this life of ours should and can be lived, and to disclose Himself to us as our friend and companion as well as our Father and our God. It is as if a king, finding himself misrepresented by his ministers and misjudged by his people, should put on the clothes of a workman and live for a time incognito among his subjects so that they might really come to know and understand him. This is not by any means all the purpose and work of the incarnation, but it is perhaps its simplest aspect. We can really know God only if we know Him as Jesus Christ. John's vision assures us that His return to the Father meant simply returning to His own eternal glory by putting off the finite clothing which had been necessary to His work on earth. In the vision John saw Him reigning in the heavens, but recognized Him as the master and friend whom he had known on earth.

The correspondence of the details of the vision as recorded in the Word shows us the various aspects of divine love and wisdom. We can go far, with the help of the writings, in studying each detail. Yet we need frequently to imagine for ourselves the vision as a whole, to think of ourselves as falling at the Lord's feet with John, and hearing the Lord's voice "as the sound of many waters" saying to us: "Fear not; I am the first and the last." We need to realize that we are of His church, with a golden lampstand to uphold which draws its light from one of the stars in His right hand. His messages to the seven churches are spoken to us. The sealed book of which we read in the fifth chapter is the very Word which He has given us, and the judgment which, in the rest of the book of Revelation, follows the opening of the seals goes on in us as we accept or reject its inner truths. It is for us to say whether we shall be cast into the lake of fire or lifted up to enter the gates of the Holy City.

This vision is not just something which one man saw centuries ago. It is something eternally real and present, to be seen by our spiritual eyes today so that we may examine ourselves in its light and take our stand on the side of the angels in the affairs of our everyday life. The great voice "as of a trumpet" is calling us to turn and listen.

=== Adult

The outline of the general content of the book of Revelation will be helpful to the Adults. It is hard to see the outline for oneself amid the multiplicity of details. The opening vision should be discussed as teaching the primary doctrine on which the New Church is founded.

Under divine providence the apostle John was permitted to live out a long life, and in his old age the wonderful vision recorded in the book of Revelation was given through him to the world. It was given on the island of Patmos, to which John had been exiled — possibly during the persecution of the Christians under Emperor Domitian in A.D. 95, John being about ninety years old at that time. We are told plainly in the first chapter that it is a vision seen in the spiritual world - "I was in the spirit on the Lord's day" — and that it is a vision of the state of the church and of what was to come in the future. Swedenborg says (@AE 5) that it treats of the state of the church "in the last times" just before the Last Judgment rather than of the history of the church from its beginning.

Although theologians and others throughout the history of the Christian Church have attempted to interpret and to explain and to apply these visions, the law of correspondence revealed through Swedenborg is the only key to a consistent interpretation. Reverent readers of the Word have always felt their power, and young children love to hear them read, but no one before the Second Coming was able to make any intelligent use of them. We should clearly recognize and be thankful for the fact that "now it is permitted to enter intellectually into the mysteries of faith." We may think of these visions of John, as of those of the Old Testament prophets, as dramas, vast symbolic living pictures enacted in the spiritual world for the instruction and enlightenment of angels and men. The particular prophet is a chosen witness by means of whom the essential features of the drama may be recorded and transmitted to men on earth and preserved in the ultimates of earthly language. The literal details of these visions are powerful and striking, and when we attempt to visualize them for ourselves, they deeply affect the mind. But their ultimate value is in their symbolic meaning. And the Lord in these latter days has made it possible for us to know surely that meaning.

The book of Revelation is a picture of the spiritual forces which were at work even from the beginning of the Christian Church, of the conflict between good and evil, truth and falsity, angels and devils, of the Lord's permission of the evil until its consequences should be plainly seen — as the tares in the parable were allowed to grow along with the wheat until the harvest — and of the final triumph of good and truth and the descent of the holy city New Jerusalem upon the earth. After the opening vision we have the messages to the seven churches in Asia Minor, of which John was doubtless the recognized head. Under the names of these churches all types of acceptance and rejection of the Lord's truth are described, the specific rewards of each type of acceptance shown, and the specific dangers of each type of rejection. Then under the symbols of the throne, the sealed book, and the Lamb, we are shown how the Lord's providence directs the spiritual course of the world through the Word, at first closed and then gradually opened. Then we see how the opening of the Word searches the hearts and minds of men, revealing deeper and deeper evils, how the forces of falsity and evil — under the representation of the dragon and the beast — war against the Lord and the angels for the possession of men's souls, how they are permitted to appear to triumph, but how the good, who in the Lord's strength fight against and overcome their temptations, are preserved, and the New Church, which is born in the midst of the conflict, is saved, and the Lord's kingdom finally prevails throughout the earth.

The book of Revelation has been called "the charter of the New Church" because it prophesies its establishment. Coming to it, as we do, at the close of our study of the whole course of the Word, we should be able to recognize it as the crown of the Word, the culmination of human history, the final act in the great drama of man's spiritual development both as a race and as an individual. Very little can be done with it in the time allotted to it in our course. We can study it for ourselves with the help of Swedenborg's Apocalypse Revealed and Apocalypse Explained and draw more and more illumination and inspiration from it.

This first chapter gives us the wonderful picture of the Lord Jesus Christ reigning. John recognizes Him as the "Son of man," the master he knew in the world, and the Lord declares Himself to be "he that liveth and was dead," but also says plainly, "I am the first and the last." Thus the book opens with the identification of the Lord Jesus Christ as the eternal God of heaven and earth.

Many before John had had visions of the Lord beginning, we recall, with Moses and the seventy elders (Exodus 24:9-10). All these visions are characterized by the appearance of brightness or fire and usually by the specific mention of the human form of the Lord (Ezekiel 1:26-28). The fire and the brightness are symbols of divine love and wisdom. The Lord has always made it clear that we are to think of Him as a divine man. Swedenborg says He is actually the only man, that He is "Very Man" [ipse homo]. But it was not until after the Lord's life on earth that, because He had ultimated His divine human, a vision could be granted whose details could be recorded more specifically. This is the picture of the Lord which He wishes us to hold in our minds. We should study and think about this picture instead of any of the imaginary and strictly finite representations which the artists of various periods have conceived. People often say, "How shall I think of the Lord? What picture of Him shall I have in my mind when I pray to Him?" John's vision is the Lord's answer to this question. If we have any less definite picture, He will not seem to us a real person; if we have any more ordinary picture we shall have no feeling of His glory and power.

The very fact that there are some details in the picture which we find it difficult to imagine and which would be impossible to put on canvas helps to lift our thought of the Lord above His finite humanity to the glorified divine humanity. To understand the meaning of the vision each of us must study it for himself, recalling correspondences already familiar: garments symbolize truth, gold love, the head the directing intelligence which extends to the hairs, its outmost applications; white signifies purity, the eyes understanding, fire love, the feet the outward conduct, brass or bronze natural good, the voice like the sound of many waters "the Divine truth in ultimates" or divine truth as it comes to us, the stars knowledges of spiritual things, the two—edged sword divine truth attacking evil and falsity and defending goodness, the countenance the expression of the interior character, the sun divine love and wisdom, the lampstands the church on earth, whose office it is to receive and transmit divine truth to mankind. Swedenborg in both the Apocalypse Explained and the Apocalypse Revealed gives pages to the interpretation of these few verses. Yet the vision itself may be read in a minute and memorized in a short time, and one will then have in his mind a true concept of the Lord, given by the Lord Himself, which will direct and enlighten all His thought about the Lord and fill his everyday life with meaning and purpose.

=== From the Writings of Swedenborg

Apocalypse Explained (Introduction to chapter 1): "Many have expounded this prophetical book called the Apocalypse, but none of them understood the internal or spiritual sense of the Word. They have therefore applied the particular things in the book to the successive states of the church, which they have learned from histories; many things, moreover, they have applied to civil affairs. For this reason these expositions are for the most part conjectures, which can never appear in such light that they can be affirmed as truths. As soon, therefore, as they are read, they are put aside as speculations. The expositions of the Apocalypse now extant are of this character, because. as has been said, their authors had no knowledge of the internal or spiritual sense of the Word."

Apocalypse Revealed (preliminary Contents of chapter 1): "Verse 12. 'And I turned to see the voice which was speaking with me,' signifies the inversion of the state of those who are in the good of life as to the perception of truth in the Word, when they turn themselves to the Lord. 'And having turned I saw seven golden lampstands,' signifies the New Church which will be in enlightenment from the Lord out of the Word. Verse 13. 'And in the midst of the seven lampstands One like unto the Son of Man,' signifies the Lord as to the Word, from whom is that church. 'Clothed with a garment down to the foot,' signifies the proceeding Divine, which is the Divine truth. 'And girded at the paps with a golden girdle,' signifies the Divine love of the Divine wisdom in firsts and in ultimates. 'And His eyes as a flame of fire,' signifies the Divine love. Verse 15. 'And his feet like unto fine brass, as if glowing in a furnace,' signifies the Divine good natural. 'And his voice as the voice of many waters,' signifies the Divine truth natural. Verse 16. 'And having in His right hand seven stars,' signifies all the knowledges of good and truth in the Word from Him. 'And out of His mouth a sharp two—edged sword going forth,' signifies the dispersion of falsities by the Lord through the Word and through doctrine therefrom. 'And his face was as the sun shining in power,' signifies the Divine love and the Divine wisdom, which are Himself, and proceed from Him."
