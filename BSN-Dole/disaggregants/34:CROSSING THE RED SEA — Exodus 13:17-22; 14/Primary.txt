These children should remember Pharaoh, Moses, the Passover, and the Red Sea. They can be told that the reason why the children of Israel became slaves in Egypt was that they did not go back to the land of Canaan as they should have done when the famine was over. Emphasis should be put on the pillar of cloud and fire and on the power the Lord exercised through the hand of Moses, and the Lord's wonderful protection of His people.

After Moses grew up, he sided with his own people against the Egyptians, and this made the Pharaoh angry. So Moses had to leave Egypt. He went to the land of Midian, and there he was helped by Jethro, the priest of Midian. Moses married Jethro's daughter, Zipporah.

One day when Moses was tending the flocks of Jethro near Mount Sinai, he saw a strange sight. A bush was on fire but did not seem to be burning up. When Moses went over to look at it, the Lord spoke to him out of the midst of the fire in the bush.

The Lord told Moses to go back and lead his people out of Egypt.

He gave Moses power to work miracles, and told him that his brother Aaron would help him.

Pharaoh did not want to let the Hebrews go; so Moses and Aaron brought ten plagues, one after another, upon the Egyptians, and finally Pharaoh said they could go.

The Egyptians were so glad to see them go that they gave them gold and jewels and clothing to take with them.

Just before they left, they celebrated a great feast, called the Passover.

Before they got out of Egypt, Pharaoh changed his mind and went after them. Where did he catch up with them?

How did the Lord keep them safe from the Egyptians through the night? This pillar of cloud and fire was to lead them for forty years.

Then what did the Lord tell Moses to do?

What happened?

How did the children of Israel cross the Red Sea?

What happened to the Egyptians when they tried to follow?
