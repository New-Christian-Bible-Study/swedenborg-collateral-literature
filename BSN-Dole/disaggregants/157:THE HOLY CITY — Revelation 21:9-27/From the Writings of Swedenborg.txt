=== From the Writings of Swedenborg

@AR 914: "And the foundations of the wall of the city were adorned with every precious stone, signifies that all things of the doctrine of the New Jerusalem taken from the sense of the letter of the Word, with those who are therein, will appear in light according to reception. By 'the twelve foundations' are signified all things of doctrine (n. 902). By 'the wall' is signified the Word in the sense of the letter (n. 898). By 'the holy city Jerusalem' is signified the Lord's New Church (n. 879, 880). By 'precious stone' is signified the Word in the sense of the letter, pellucid (transparent) from its spiritual sense (n. 231, 540, 726, 911). And because this is according to reception, therefore it signifies that all things of doctrine from the Word with them, will appear in light according to reception ... Interior thought is in the light of heaven, and is called perception, and exterior thought is in the light of the world; and the understanding of every man is such that it can be elevated even into the light of heaven, and also is elevated, if from any delight he wishes to see truth."
