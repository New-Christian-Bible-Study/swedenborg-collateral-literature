=== INTRO

In all classes above the Primary, a few minutes should be spent reviewing the Word as a whole. Some questions may also be asked, especially in the Junior class, but the review should be kept carefully within limits so that there will be time for the lesson proper, as it is very important for all the pupils to be impressed with the picture of the New Jerusalem as the culmination of the whole Bible story.
