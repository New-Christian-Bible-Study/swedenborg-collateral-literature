=== Doctrinal Points
----
• The Lord knows our worldly circumstances and makes allowance for our weakness.
• The teachings of the Word are given to help and save us, not to make life hard or to condemn.
• Disbelief in the Lord comes from unwillingness to live as He would have us live.
• We may often recognize evil in our hearts by our efforts to cover up our real feelings.
