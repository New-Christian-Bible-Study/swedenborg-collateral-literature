The story of Solomon's dream is a simple one. The children should learn what he asked for and what the Lord promised him. Tell them that to have a wise and understanding heart means to be able to know what the Lord wants us to do and to love to do it, and point out that when we really love someone, we will try to behave in such a way as to make that person happy. This is also an opportunity to review the names of the great leaders of Israel and see what the children remember about each.

What special talents did David have?

What book in the Bible is called "the book of David"?

David was a great warrior and conquered all the enemies of Israel.

When the time came for him to die, the Lord sent Nathan the prophet to him and told him that his son Solomon — one of his younger sons — was to be king after him. So David, even before he died, had the priests anoint Solomon to be king. One of Solomon's older brothers tried to set himself up as king, but the people accepted Solomon.

The name Solomon means "peaceful." What did Solomon ask of the Lord? What did the Lord promise him?

The Lord kept his promise to Solomon, as He always keeps His promises. Solomon became so wise that kings and queens came to ask his advice. And he also became very rich and owned all sorts of beautiful things.

Solomon had peace throughout his reign.

Several chapters in 1 Kings tell about his wisdom and glory and possessions. His greatest work was the building of the temple at Jerusalem.

Solomon and David each reigned forty years.
