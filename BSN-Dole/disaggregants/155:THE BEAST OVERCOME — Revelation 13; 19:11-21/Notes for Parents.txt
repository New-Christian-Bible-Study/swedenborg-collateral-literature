=== Notes for Parents

The vision of the two beasts which arose, one out of the sea and the other out of the earth, is a picture of the results in the hearts of men on earth when they listen to the false reasoning of the dragon. Deep down in our hearts we all know that we ought to acknowledge the Lord Jesus Christ as our God, study His Word, and obey His commandments. But our inherited selfishness is very strong, and we are prone to accept without careful examination any reasoning which favors the things we like to do. Some of these things, like the first beast, are obviously disagreeable. Ordinary intelligence prompts us to reject them. The beast received a deadly wound in one of his heads. But the wound was healed. We find some excuse which glosses over the seriousness of the offense. One very common excuse is: "Everybody does it."

Other bad tendencies of ours put on the appearance of goodness, as for instance when a man, moving into a town, looks around for the church whose congregation seems most likely to be useful to his business and becomes an active member of it. Or when we learn to quote Scripture so that we can condemn other people and impress them with our own goodness. This is like the second beast which had two horns like a lamb.

Only the Lord Himself, the rider on the white horse, could overcome the beasts. Only by honestly trying to find out what the Lord teaches in His Word and fighting such temptations under His leadership can we really recognize our secret selfishness and break down our false reasonings.

The Lord has opened heaven by showing us the inner meaning of His Word. This is the "feast" He offers us. We do not have to stumble along weakly through life, but can walk upright in the clear light of the Lord's truth. Like the woman in the last vision we can have wings which lift us up out of the fogs of human opinion into a higher and purer mental atmosphere.
