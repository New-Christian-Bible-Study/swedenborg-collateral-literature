=== From the Writings of Swedenborg

@AE 580: "One of the seraphim touching the mouth and lips of the prophet signifies his interior purification, which is that of the understanding and will, and thus inauguration into the gift of teaching; the burning coal from the altar signifies the Divine love, from which is all purification, and the mouth and lips signify thought and affection, or what is the same, the understanding and the will; when these are purified man is withdrawn from iniquity and sin; consequently it is said, 'therefore thine iniquity is taken away and thy sin is expiated.' Anyone can see that iniquity is not taken away by a burning coal applied to the mouth and lips."

@AC 303: "A man acquires a life by all the things he is persuaded of, that is, which he acknowledges and believes. That of which he is not persuaded, or does not acknowledge and believe, does not affect his mind. And therefore no one can profane holy things unless he has been so persuaded of them that he acknowledges them, and yet denies them. Those who do not acknowledge may know, but are as if they did not know, and are like those who know things that have no existence. Such were the Jews about the time of the Lord's advent, and therefore they are said in the Word to be 'vastated,' or 'laid waste,' that is, to have no longer any faith. Under these circumstances it does men no injury to have the interior contents of the Word opened to them, for they are as persons seeing, and yet not seeing; hearing, and yet not hearing; and whose hearts are stopped up (Isaiah 6:9, 10). That the mysteries of faith are not revealed until men are in such a state, that is, are so vastated that they no longer believe (in order, as before said, that they may not be able to profane them), the Lord also plainly declares in the subsequent verses of the same Prophet (Isaiah 6:12). He is called a 'man' who is wise, or who acknowledges and believes."
