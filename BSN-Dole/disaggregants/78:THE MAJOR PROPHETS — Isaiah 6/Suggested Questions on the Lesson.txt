== THE MAJOR PROPHETS — Jeremiah 1

This is another background lesson and the important thing, except for Primaries, is to see that the classes know who are meant by the Major Prophets, where their books come in the Bible, what their position was with reference to the history concerned, and what the function of a prophet was. Also essential are the meaning of the word prophet, the fact that the prophets spoke by inspiration, and something of the various types of inspiration.
