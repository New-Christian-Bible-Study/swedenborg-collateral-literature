Even little children can form an idea of what blindness represents and can understand the meaning of the story if it is carefully explained. Discuss the meaning of the Lord's words in John 9:41.

Do you remember the story about the man at the pool of Bethesda, who had been sick for thirty-eight years and did not think he could help himself to become well? The Lord told him to try, and then healed him when he obeyed.

Today we have a story about a man who really could not help himself.

What was this man's trouble? How long had he been blind?

What did the disciples ask the Lord?

What did He tell them?

How did He heal the man?

The Pharisees again objected to the healing.

At first they refused to believe that the man had been healed. Then they tried to tell him that Jesus was a sinner.

But the man felt sure that only God could have such power. So the Pharisees put him out of the synagogue.

Then Jesus came to him again and told him who He was. The man believed Him and worshiped Him.

See if you can think what John 9:41 means.

This miracle, like many of the Lord's miracles, was performed on the sabbath day, and so the Pharisees found fault. They were always looking for faults in the Lord because they did not want people to follow Him.

When your mother asks you to do something, you often say, "Why?" Then when she explains why, sometimes you say, "I see," and do what she asks. But sometimes, if it is something you don't want to do, you pretend you don't see why, even if you really do. That is what the Lord is showing us in this story. Our minds, as well as our eyes, see. The Lord makes it possible for our minds to see what we ought to do, and so when we don't do it, we are to blame.
