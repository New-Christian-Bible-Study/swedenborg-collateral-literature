=== Doctrinal Points

The Lord came on earth among the Jews because they had the Word and lived in the Holy Land of the Old Testament story.

John the Baptist fulfilled the prophecy in Malachi, tying together the Old and the New Testaments.

People had to see and put away their sins before they could accept the Lord.

It was those who truly wanted to be good who accepted the Lord.
