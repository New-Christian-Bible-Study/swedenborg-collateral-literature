=== From the Writings of Swedenborg

@AC 3424: "The 'river' is the Word; the 'waters which cause everything to live' are the Divine truths contained in it; the 'fish' are memory-knowledges."

@AE 629[8]: "How intelligence increases by the reception of Divine truth proceeding from the Lord is described by the 'waters' which the prophet passed through ... 'the waters to the ankles' signify such intelligence as the sensual and natural man has, for 'ankles' signify what is sensual and natural; 'the waters to the knees' signify such intelligence as the spiritual natural man has, for 'knees' signify what is spiritual—natural; 'the waters to the loins' signify such intelligence as the spiritual man has, for the 'loins' signify the marriage of truth and good, which is spiritual; 'the waters that could not be passed through' signify celestial intelligence, which is called wisdom, such as the celestial man or an angel of the third heaven has."
