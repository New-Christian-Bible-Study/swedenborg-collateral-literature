=== Introduction

There are some general facts concerning John's messages to the seven churches which can be presented to all but the youngest children. These have to do with the similarities of all the messages:
(1) Each picks out a particular feature of the vision of the Lord;
(2) Each commends the church for what it is doing that is good;
(3) Each rebukes the church for its particular evil and shows what the resulting punishment will be if the evil persists;
(4) Each offers a special promise if the evil is put away;
(5) Each closes with the words, "He that hath an ear, etc.," leaving the church free to choose whether it will obey or not.
