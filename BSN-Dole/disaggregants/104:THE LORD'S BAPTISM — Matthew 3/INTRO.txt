=== INTRO

In order to get a full picture of John the Baptist and his work as a background for teaching this lesson, the teacher should read also Matthew 11:7-15; 14:1-12; Mark 1:1-11; Luke 1:5-20, 39-45, 57-80; 3:10-14; John 1:19-30. The prophecies in Isaiah 40:3 and Malachi 4:5-6 should be marked so that they can be found quickly and read to the classes.
