=== Introduction

This lesson should be made very practical for all the children, for they can progress spiritually only as they learn to recognize and fight against their individual temptations as of themselves. All children much of the time feel the desire to do right, but unless the desire is intelligently directed it may be wasted. The efforts of their parents must so often be exercised through correction and restraint when the children are actually in selfish and willful states that parents find it hard to put off the tone of command at other times. But in Sunday school the teacher has the opportunity to treat the children's temptations objectively while they are in good and teachable states. Show them first that temptation comes from the hells and that it is a battle between evil spirits and angels for control of their minds and hearts. And then point out that the deciding factor in this battle is their own free choice.
