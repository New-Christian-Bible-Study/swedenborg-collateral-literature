=== From the Writings of Swedenborg

@AC 7102 [10]: "Here the 'dread of night' denotes the falsity which is in secret; the 'arrow that flieth by day,' the falsity which is in the open: the 'pestilence that creepeth in thick darkness,' the evil which is in secret: the 'death that wasteth at noonday,' the evil which is in the open." [We need to know that Swedenborg made his own translation of the Hebrew - a very literal translation.]

@AC 7505: "A very grievous pestilence. That this signifies a consumption in general, is evident from the signification of 'pestilence,' as being the vastation of truth. ... [in Psalm 91:5, 6] 'the pestilence that creepeth in thick darkness' denotes the evil which vastates in secret; 'the death that wasteth at noonday' denotes the evil that vastates openly."
