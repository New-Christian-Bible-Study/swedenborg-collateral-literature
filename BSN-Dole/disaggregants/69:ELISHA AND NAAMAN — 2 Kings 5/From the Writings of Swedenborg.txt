=== From the Writings of Swedenborg

@AE 475[18]: "'Naaman a leper of Syria' represented and signified those who falsify the knowledges of truth and good from the Word, for 'leprosy' signifies falsifications, and 'Syria' the knowledges of truth and good. 'The waters of Jordan' signified the truths that introduce into the church, which are the knowledges of truth and good from the Word, for the river Jordan was the first boundary across which the land of Canaan was entered, and 'the land of Canaan' signified the church; this is why 'the waters of Jordan' signified introductory truths, which are the first knowledges of truth and good from the Word. Because of this signification of 'the waters of Jordan,' Naaman was commanded to wash himself in them seven times, which signified purification from falsified truths; 'seven times' signifies fully, and is predicated of things holy, such as truths Divine are. Because 'seven times' has this signification, it is said that 'his flesh came again like unto the flesh of a little lad,' the flesh coming again signifying spiritual life, such as those have who are regenerated through Divine truths."
