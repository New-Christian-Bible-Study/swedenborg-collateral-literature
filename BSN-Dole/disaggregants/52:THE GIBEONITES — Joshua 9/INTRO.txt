=== Introduction

The lesson should be introduced by emphasis on the fact that when the Israelites returned to the Holy Land from Egypt, they found the land full of enemies, but the Lord had promised them victory if they obeyed Him. The teacher should be prepared to tell briefly the story of the fall of Jericho and the capture of Ai. The older pupils may be able to tell these stories themselves.
