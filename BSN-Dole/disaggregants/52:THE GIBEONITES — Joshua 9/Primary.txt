Your introduction should be given as an explanation of why the Gibeonites were afraid of the Israelites and wanted to make peace with them. The lesson to be drawn from the story is that we are all easily deceived by the way things seem to us at first glance and that we should never make careless promises. Emphasize the need to stop and think whether a thing is right or not before promising to do it.

When the children of Israel crossed the Jordan River into the Holy Land, the land was full of enemies and there were many strong walled cities which they had to conquer. The city nearest the place where they crossed the river was Jericho, and perhaps you remember how the Lord told them to carry the ark around the city once a day for six days and then seven times on the seventh day, and how the Lord then made the walls fall down so that they could go in and take the city. After that the Lord showed Joshua how to take another city named Ai.

When these two cities fell, the inhabitants of the land were frightened. What people decided to try to make peace with Israel?

How did they deceive Joshua?

Joshua had been told by the Lord to conquer all the people of the land. When the Gibeonites came to him, what did he forget to do?

Joshua made a hasty and careless promise.

Do we ever do the same thing?

Before we make a promise, we should always stop to think and to be sure that what we are promising is right.

But Joshua knew that he could not break his promise once it was made. He had to let the Gibeonites live.

Joshua had made a mistake. So Joshua had to make the best of what he had done. He let the Gibeonites live and did not destroy their cities, but he punished them for lying to him by making them servants of the Israelites forever — hewers of wood and drawers of water.
