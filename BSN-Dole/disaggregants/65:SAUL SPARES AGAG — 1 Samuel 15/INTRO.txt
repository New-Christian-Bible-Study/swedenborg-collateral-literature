=== INTRO

The teachers should all be familiar with the events of the chapters between 8 and 15, but the events to be reviewed in class are the anointing of Saul, his later choice by lot, the people's satisfaction with him, his first victory, and his first defection as described in chapters 10:8 and 13:8-14.
