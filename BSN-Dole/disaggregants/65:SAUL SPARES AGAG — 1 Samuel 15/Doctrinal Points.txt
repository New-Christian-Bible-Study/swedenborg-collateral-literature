=== Doctrinal Points
----
• The Lord is pure, unselfish love and seeks above all to drive selfishness out of our hearts for the sake of making us happy.
• Our first understanding of the Word is based on external appearances.
• Faith in the Lord involves obedience to Him even against our own judgment.
• We need to recognize clearly how many of our thoughts spring from our hereditary self love.
