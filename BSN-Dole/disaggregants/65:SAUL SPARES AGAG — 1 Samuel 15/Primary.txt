Be sure the children know that Saul was the first of three great kings who ruled over the whole land, and try to make them see why it was that Saul got into trouble even though he really meant in the beginning to be good. He thought he knew better than the Lord what ought to be done, just as children sometimes do not fully obey their parents because their own way seems better. Review the story of Israel's first battle with Amalek (Exodus 17:8-16) and compare the method of the victory there with Saul's victory and his disobedience.

Saul meant to be a good king, and he won his first battle. But this first victory made him feel too sure of himself. Samuel was still the Lord's prophet, and Saul knew that he ought to do just what Samuel told him to do. But Saul was impatient. The next time an enemy threatened, he gathered his army and did not wait for Samuel to come and offer the sacrifices, as he was supposed to do, but went ahead and offered them himself. And then Samuel came and told him that because he had not strictly obeyed the Lord, his kingdom would not be a lasting one.

You know sometimes when you have been naughty, you go and hug and kiss your mother and think that will make her forget your naughtiness. She likes your hugs and kisses, of course, but she would be happier if you loved her enough to mind her, and your life would be happier too.
