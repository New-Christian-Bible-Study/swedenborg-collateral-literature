=== Introduction

With the younger classes we have chosen the latter part of the chapter for emphasis because it is less familiar than the portion on prayer, but with the older classes both parts should be taken up. Verse 33 may be used to bind the two parts together, for it is only as we turn to the Lord as our Father and seek His guidance and help that we can keep the eye of our soul "single" or clear. The scribes and Pharisees are the classic example of what not to do with our religion.
