=== From the Writings of Swedenborg

@AE 794[3]: "Man has two minds, one spiritual, the other natural. The spiritual mind is what is called the internal and the spiritual man, and the natural mind is what is called the external and the natural man. And as man has an internal spiritual and an external natural, and the internal is conjoined with heaven and the external with the world, it follows that whatever man does from that internal through the external he does from heaven, that is, through heaven from the Lord; but anything that a man does by the external without the internal, this he does from self. This is meant by the Lord's words in Luke ... (Luke 11:39-41). It is said, 'the outside of the cup and of the platter,' and 'the inside' of them, because the 'cup' has a similar meaning as 'wine,' and the 'platter' a similar meaning as 'food'; and 'wine' signifies truth, and 'food' signifies good. It is said also 'give alms,' and this signifies love and charity."
