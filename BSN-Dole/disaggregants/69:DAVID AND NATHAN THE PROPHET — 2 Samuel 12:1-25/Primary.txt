[.underline]#*Teacher Notes:*# 
These children should remember David's birthplace and the story of David and Goliath. They are old enough to understand why Nathan approached David with a parable. Tell them what David's punishment was, and that it teaches us that good never can come from evil.

---
The second king of the Israelites was David.

His home was in Bethlehem.

What do we think of when Bethlehem is mentioned?

David was only a young boy when he was anointed, and Saul continued to be king in the eyes of the people.

But the spirit of the Lord was with David now instead of with Saul.

But finally Saul was killed in battle, and later David was crowned king. Like Saul, David was a great warrior, but David did not trust in himself as Saul had done. He obeyed the Lord, and so the Lord could be with him and give him victory over all the enemies of Israel. One of the cities he took was Jerusalem. He made it his capital and brought the ark there and had a new tabernacle made for it.

But later in life he committed a great sin.

He had Uriah the Hittite killed so that he could marry Uriah's wife, Bathsheba.

Whom did the Lord send to rebuke him?

What story did Nathan tell David?

Then what did Nathan tell him?

Why do you think Nathan told him the story first?
