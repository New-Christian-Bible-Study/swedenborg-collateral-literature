Be sure the children learn that a psalm is a song, that we should sing the Psalms in church, and why they are sung differently from hymns. Stress the value of memorizing the Psalms and show the children how we can use them to help us to resist temptation, using Psalm 91 as an example.

---
You remember King David, don't you? He was the one who conquered all the enemies of Israel. And you remember that he brought the ark to Jerusalem, and that he sang and danced before it as it was carried into the city. David was a musician as well as a warrior. When he was a young man, he played the harp before King Saul to soothe Saul when he was unhappy.

So it was natural that the Lord should choose David to write down many of the Psalms. For the Psalms are songs. The Hebrew people sang them in their services in the temple and we sometimes sing them in our services in church. And we try to learn as many of them as we can so that we can say or sing them to ourselves when we are thinking about the Lord or when we are troubled about anything and need His help especially. For the words of the Psalms are given us by the Lord Himself.

What is our Psalm for today about?

In it the Lord tells us that if we will learn His truth and do as it teaches, we need never be afraid of anything.

Whatever may happen to our bodies, our souls will be safe.

The Lord's angels are always with us even though we cannot see them.

If we trust the Lord and try always to learn more and more about Him and to do what He shows us is right, nothing that may happen to us can really hurt us, and so we shall not need to be afraid of anything. Remember though that the first part of doing right while we are children is to obey our parents.

We should learn as many of the Psalms as we can, because in them the Lord teaches us how to say the things we ought to think and feel.
