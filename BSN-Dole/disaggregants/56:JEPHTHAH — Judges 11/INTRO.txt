=== Introduction

The lesson should be prefaced by a reminder of Joshua's conquest of the whole land and its division among the tribes. Then should follow a statement of the conditions which prevailed during the period of the Judges, emphasizing the reason why the enemies in the land gained in strength. In the lesson for the day, Jephthah's rash vow may be compared with Joshua's hasty acceptance of the Gibeonites. Teachers of all classes should study the Adult notes as a preparation for answering questions which may be asked concerning Jephthah's daughter.
