=== Introduction

This lesson is from the middle of the Abraham story. Review briefly the facts concerning Abraham up to this point, leaving the rest of his story to be covered later. In the story this time Abraham's desire to be directed by the Lord should be emphasized, in contrast to the general state of mankind especially as it was pictured in the lesson on the Tower of Babel.
