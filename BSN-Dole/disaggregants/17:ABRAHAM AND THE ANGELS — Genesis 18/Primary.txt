=== For Younger Children

[.underline]#*Teacher Notes:*# 
Only the first part of the chapter is chosen for these younger children. The Lord's promise to Abraham and the fact that he and Sarah were old people and had had no son will serve to point up the lesson. The details of his entertainment of the angels will interest the children. Tell the children that the word angel means "messenger."

Our story is about Abraham. Abraham was one of the people who still wanted to be taught by the Lord and to obey Him even after most of the world had become self-willed and ignorant of heavenly things. So the Lord could teach Abraham and be with him and help him.

The Lord told Abraham to leave his home and go to the land of Canaan and settle there. It was a long journey but Abraham obeyed, and he finally settled in a place called Hebron — or sometimes called Mamre. The Lord prospered him and he became very rich in cattle, in silver, and in gold. He and his family were shepherds and herdsmen and lived very simply — not at all as most of us do today. Their homes were tents, which they could take down and move about so that their flocks could always find pasture.

The Lord had promised Abraham that he would be the father of a great nation, but Abraham and his wife Sarah had had no children and they were now old people. This troubled Abraham very much, but the Lord always keeps His promises.

Who came to see Abraham?

How did he receive them?

What did he tell Sarah to do?

What other food did he give them?

What did they promise him?

What did Sarah do of which she was afterward ashamed?

The three men who came to Abraham were angels or messengers of the Lord, and Abraham recognized this and welcomed them and was happy to entertain them with the best he had. And he believed what they told him, even though Sarah doubted.
