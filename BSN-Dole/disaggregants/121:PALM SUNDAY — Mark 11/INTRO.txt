=== Introduction

This second of our special lessons can easily be tied in with the course by referring to the Christmas lesson and reminding the classes of the purpose of the Lord in coming into the world. The meaning of the words Messiah and Christ — the anointed one — should be mentioned as well as the fact that anointing is putting oil on a person or object, that oil is the symbol of the Lord's unselfish love, and that this means that the Lord came into the world as the Messiah out of pure love for mankind.
