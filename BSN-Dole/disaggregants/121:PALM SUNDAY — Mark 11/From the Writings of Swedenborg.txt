=== From the Writings of Swedenborg

@AC 9212[6]: "By the disciples putting their garments on the donkey and her colt, was represented that truths in the whole complex were submitted to the Lord as the Highest Judge and King: for the disciples represented the church of the Lord in respect to its truths and goods ... and their garments represented the truths themselves. ... The like was represented by the multitude strewing their garments in the way, and also branches of trees."

@AC 885: "Specifically, by this fig—tree there was meant the Jewish Church, in which there was no longer anything of natural good; and the religious teaching or truth that was preserved in it, are the 'leaves'; for a vastated church is such that it knows truth, but is not willing to understand it. Similar are those who say that they know truth or the things of faith, yet have nothing of the good of charity; they are only fig—leaves, and they wither away."
