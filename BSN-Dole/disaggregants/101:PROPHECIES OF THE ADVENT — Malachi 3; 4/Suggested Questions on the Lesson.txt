== THE LORD COMES INTO THE WORLD — Matthew 1:18-25; 2:13-23

Tell all the classes that in passing from the Old to the New Testament we are merely continuing the Bible story, but that there has been a lapse of more than four hundred years while the people settled again throughout the Holy Land and re—established their formal worship. All through the lesson stress the dependence of the letter of the New Testament upon the Old and the importance of keeping this relation in mind in our study. In all our study of the Lord's life on earth we should keep constantly before the children the thought of His dual nature — the divine from the Father within and the finite humanity from Mary which clothed it.
