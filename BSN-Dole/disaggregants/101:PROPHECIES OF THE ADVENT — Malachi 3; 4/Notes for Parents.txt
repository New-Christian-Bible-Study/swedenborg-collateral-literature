=== Notes for Parents

With this lesson we come to the end of the Old Testament. The name Malachi means "my messenger," and the prophecies given through Malachi were among the chief comforts of the good among the Jews during the four hundred years which followed, before the Lord came into the world. For in spite of all the warnings given it and in spite of the bitter experience of captivity, the ancient Jewish Church as a church never returned to obedience. As we learn from the Gospels, the priests and elders overlaid the Word of God with traditions of their own, more serviceable to them in worldly ways, until the simple people did not know right from wrong. In all those four hundred years no more prophets were sent to them. Through Malachi they had their final warning.

But through Malachi the Lord had also promised that one day He Himself would come into the world and that those who remained faithful would be prepared for His coming so that they could receive Him with joy. Verse 17 of our chapter is a beautiful one for the children to hold in their minds. If they are good, they will be counted among the Lord's jewels. And the second verse of chapter 4 is a beautiful promise, too. For the Lord's coming into our lives — if we are of those who really want to be good men and women — is like the sunrise, bringing the clear light of understanding to our minds and the warmth of love to our hearts, and healing the spiritual diseases which have been festering in our souls.
