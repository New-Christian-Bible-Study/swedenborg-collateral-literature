=== From the Writings of Swedenborg

@AC 8159[2]: "The temptations of those who were of the spiritual church, which they were to undergo after the Lord came into the world, and could then from the Divine Human fight for them against the hells, are meant by these words in Malachi ... (Malachi 3:1-4); clearly speaking of the Lord's coming; 'the sons of Levi' here denote those who are of the spiritual church, for by 'Levi' is signified charity or spiritual good ...; 'the refiner's fire' is temptation, whereby is effected purification, which is here meant by 'purifying and refining them as gold and silver'; 'the meat—offering which they shall bring to Jehovah' is faith and charity; 'the days of eternity' and 'the years' denote the ancient churches, and the states of worship of the Lord at that time."
