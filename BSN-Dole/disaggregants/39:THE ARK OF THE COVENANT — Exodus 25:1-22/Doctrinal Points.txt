----
• Worship of the Lord lies at the heart of everything we do. A study of the spiritual sense of the laws given at Sinai shows us how practical and important every detail of the letter of the Word is for us.
• The plan of the tabernacle is the blueprint for a heavenly character. The commandments must be written in our hearts — not just in our minds.
