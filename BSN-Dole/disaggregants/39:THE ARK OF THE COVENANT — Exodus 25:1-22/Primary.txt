The description of the ark and its contents will make a sufficient lesson for this class. Read the story from the Word. Emphasize the importance of the commandments and their place in the tabernacle. These children can get the idea of the meaning of the ark and its position in our lives. They should be able to describe the ark in detail.

This is another story about Moses and what happened when he was leading his people from Egypt to the Holy Land. Do you remember about how the Lord spoke to Moses out of the burning bush? That was at a place near some mountains called Horeb. One of these mountains was Mount Sinai. Try to remember this name because you will hear it many times. The Lord had promised Moses at the burning bush that after they escaped from Egypt they would worship the Lord at this same place.

After three months they came to a great mountain called Mount Sinai, near the place where the Lord had talked with Moses from the burning bush. They camped in the plain at the foot of this mountain.

From the top of the mountain the Lord spoke to them the ten commandments.

You will learn these commandments someday. They are the Lord's laws, which we must obey if we want to be safe and happy.

Then He called Moses to go up into the mountain and gave him many laws to govern the people.

And He told him how to build and furnish a tabernacle in which they were to worship.

The thing of most importance in the tabernacle was the ark, a box or chest in which they were to keep the two tables of stone on which the Lord had written the commandments after He spoke them.

What was the ark to be made of?

With what was it overlaid?

How was it to be carried?

What was on top of the ark?

After the ark was finished and the two tables of stone put into it, it was placed in the inmost room of the tabernacle, which was called the Holy of Holies. After that the Lord always spoke to Moses and Aaron from between the cherubim on the ark.
