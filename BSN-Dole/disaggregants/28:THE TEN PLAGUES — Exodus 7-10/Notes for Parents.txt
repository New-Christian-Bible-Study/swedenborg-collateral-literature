=== Notes for Parents

The Egyptians never forgot that the Hebrews were "outsiders" and after a while became afraid of their growing numbers, and the Pharaohs began to try to curb them. They made them slaves, and at last one Pharaoh ordered that all the male children of the Hebrews should be killed as soon as they were born. Everyone remembers the familiar story of how the infant Moses was saved.

Moses was preserved by the Lord and finally commissioned by Him to lead the children of Israel out of Egypt and back to their true home in the Holy Land. Pharaoh naturally wanted to keep his slaves, and the story of the ten plagues, which is our lesson for today, is the story of how his stubborn resistance to the Lord's will was gradually broken.

What does this teach us about our own lives? All who love the Bible have recognized the Holy Land as a symbol of heaven. Heaven is our true home. We live on earth for a few years and find the earth beautiful and full of pleasures, but if our life here is too easy, we are likely to forget that after all we are only strangers in the earth and "sojourners, as all our fathers were." If we let the world make slaves of our higher faculties, our character deteriorates, just as the land of Egypt was progressively devastated by the plagues brought on by Pharaoh's stubborn determination not to let the children of Israel go home and worship God. All the good things which the Lord gives us in this world — and they are many — are meant for use, to help us develop the love to the Lord and the neighbor which make heaven in our souls both here and hereafter.
