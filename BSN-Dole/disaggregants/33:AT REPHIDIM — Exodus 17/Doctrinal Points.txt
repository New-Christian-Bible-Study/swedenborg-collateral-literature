=== Doctrinal Points

We can overcome our temptations only by constantly looking to the Lord for help.

When we study the Word in order to find out how to live rightly, the Lord can show us what it means.

We do not really believe in the Lord if we do not trust Him.

It is evil deep within us which makes us subject to discouragement.

Discouragement is really selfish.
