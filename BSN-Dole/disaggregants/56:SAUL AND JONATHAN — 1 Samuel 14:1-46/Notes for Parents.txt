=== Notes for Parents

Jonathan's fine character makes him one of the favorite Bible heroes. His father Saul, the first king of Israel, was a brave man, but he was hasty and self-confident, not willing to wait for Samuel, the Lord's prophet, to give him the word to attack and not careful to obey fully the commands the Lord gave him through Samuel. So the Lord could not always give him the victory.

Jonathan was equally brave but he did not rely on his own judgment and strength. He trusted in the Lord. When the rest of the Israelites were deserting Saul and hiding themselves for fear of the Philistines, Jonathan, with only his armor-bearer to support him, went boldly forward and attacked the enemy — waiting only for a favorable sign from the Lord — relying upon the proved fact that "there is no restraint to the Lord to save by many or by few." And his small initial victory was enough to throw the host of the Philistines into confusion and enable Saul's army to drive them back into their own territory. So our temptations often seem too great for us to hope to conquer, but if we will only trust in the Lord's power and attack them boldly as soon as we are tempted, we shall find our enemy is not invincible, as it seemed.

The rest of our chapter has something to teach us, too. Saul's foolish command to his men not to taste food until they had completed the conquest reminds us of the way some good people afflict themselves and others, imagining that it is impossible to enjoy life and be good at the same time. But the Lord created all the good things of this world for our use and enjoyment, only telling us not to misuse them. Jonathan found the honey on his way and when he had tasted it, "his eyes were enlightened." We remember how the Lord gave the Israelites the quail in the wilderness and how He provided the manna every morning, the manna which tasted "like wafers made with honey." The Lord is a God of love and mercy - not a hard taskmaster.
