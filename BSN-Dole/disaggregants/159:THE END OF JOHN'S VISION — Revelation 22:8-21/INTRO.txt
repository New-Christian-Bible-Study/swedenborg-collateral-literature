=== Introduction

Certain great simple lessons are grouped together in the closing verses of the Bible and should be impressed upon all classes: (1) It is possible to all of us to become angels. (2) The Lord's truth is offered freely to all. (3) We must not from our own will and intelligence tamper with the Word as the Lord has given it. (4) To study the Word and obey its commandments is the way to heavenly happiness. (5) The choice is ours, but it must be made here and it is not changed after death. (6) Jesus Christ, risen and glorified, is the only God, the God who speaks to us in the Word, the alpha and omega, the beginning and the end, the first and the last.
