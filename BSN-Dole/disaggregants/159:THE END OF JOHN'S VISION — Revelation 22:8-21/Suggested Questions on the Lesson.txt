== APPENDIX 1 - SPECIAL "NEW CHURCH DAY" LESSONS

The five lessons that follow — never previously published — are intended for school or home use on the Sunday closest to June 19, New Church Day. The first four were written by the author of this set of lessons, the fifth (which is not complete) by the editor. This latter lesson is included because it bears the "stamp of approval" of Mrs. Dole. See below the photo—reprint of her note which was written on the original typescript.
"This lesson was written by Rev. Wm. R. Woofenden in 1967. O.K. if I pass away. Anita S. Dole"

== NEW CHURCH DAY - Revelation 22:13-21

The emphasis in this lesson should be on the fact that the Second Coming of the Lord has been made and that this is His final revelation to mankind. The Lord has always given man sufficient knowledge of Himself and His will so that man has remained free to choose. Our opportunity is greater than ever, but the price of rejecting the Lord remains the same.
