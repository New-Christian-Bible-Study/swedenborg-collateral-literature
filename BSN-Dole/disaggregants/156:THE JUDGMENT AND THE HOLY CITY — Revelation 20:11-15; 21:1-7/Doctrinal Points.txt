----
• We are all writing our own "book of life" daily by the moral and spiritual decisions we make.
• This "book of character" will determine our eternal state, either in heaven or hell.
• With the aid of the heavenly doctrines, the Word can be for each of us an inexhaustible source of truth about the way and purpose of life.
