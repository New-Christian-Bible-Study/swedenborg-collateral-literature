=== Notes for Parents

There are two parts to the lesson for today, but they are very closely connected and both are very important. The picture of the judgment at the end of chapter 20 is a symbolic picture like all the parts of John's vision. When we die, we do not actually appear before a throne and have all the actions of our lives reviewed. But the judgment is nonetheless real. The books which are opened are the character we have formed by our inner choices here on earth - we are writing this book every day. Here we can often cover up our real feelings and thoughts, but in the other world they can be plainly seen, and if we have not learned to be unselfish and to love the Lord and the neighbor, we shall choose of our own free will to turn our backs on the happy, unselfish sphere of heaven and go with others like ourselves. The lake of fire is also a symbol — it is the burning of selfish passions, which makes the sphere of hell.

Chapter 20 tells us of the new heaven which the Lord created from the good — those in whose hearts was found the unselfish love which is the very heart of the Word of God. The holy city descending from God out of heaven is a new church on earth founded on the basis of the opened Word. It is on this basis that our church was founded when the Word was opened two hundred years ago, and so the name Church of the New Jerusalem was given to it. In its teachings we find all the blessings described in our reading, because the Word becomes to us the "fountain of the water of life," an inexhaustible source of truth which enables us to understand the purpose of our life and to meet whatever hardships come to us as opportunities for spiritual development and progress.
