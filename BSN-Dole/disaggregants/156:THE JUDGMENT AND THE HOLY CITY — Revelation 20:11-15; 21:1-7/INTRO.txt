=== INTRO

In all classes mention should be made of why the Bible is called the Book of Life. It is easy to introduce this by reading the first verse of Genesis and then the first verse of Revelation 21, and finally Revelation 21:6. The teacher of each class — even the youngest — may well base his preparation of the lesson on a study of these three verses. All classes should learn that our church takes its name from Revelation 21:2.
