=== Notes for Parents

For Sarah and Abraham the Lord performed a miracle, for Abraham was a hundred years old and Sarah over ninety when Isaac was born. The name Isaac means "laughter" and we read that Sarah said "God hath made me to laugh, so that all that hear will laugh with me." Ishmael was fourteen when Isaac was born, and because he mocked at the baby, he and his mother were sent away to live in the wilderness, where Ishmael became the father of a numerous people, mentioned several times in the Bible as the Ishmaelites. Sarah and Abraham both lived to see Isaac grow up, for Sarah lived to be a hundred and twenty-seven, and Abraham was a hundred and seventy-five when he died.

It was after Sarah's death that Abraham sent his servant on the long journey to Haran to get a wife for Isaac from among the descendants of his own brother Nahor. The story of Rebekah at the well is a well—known one. It may seem to us today a strange way of choosing a wife, but it had in it all the elements which really make for a happy marriage. The principal one was trust in the Lord. Abraham was obeying the Lord in not allowing his son to marry a woman of different religious standards from his own. The servant asked the Lord's guidance in the discovery of the right maiden. Rebekah's family and Rebekah herself accepted what they believed to be the Lord's will, and Isaac received the wife so chosen without question. There would be fewer broken homes today if parents brought up their children to think of marriage as a holy state to be prepared for and entered into under the Lord's guidance and with the desire and intention to serve Him. Parents today do not choose mates for their children, but they can do much to prepare them to make wise choices for themselves.
