=== From the Writings of Swedenborg

@AC 3212: "And Isaac was comforted after his mother. That this signifies a new state, is evident from the signification of 'receiving comfort,' as being a new state; for a state of consolation is new; and that it succeeded to the foregoing is signified by 'after his mother.' ... When man is being regenerated, he is then becoming altogether another, and is being made new; therefore also when he has been regenerated, he is called 'born again,' and 'created anew.' Then, although he has a similar face and a similar speech, yet his mind is not similar; his mind, when he is regenerate, is open toward heaven, and there dwells therein love to the Lord and charity toward his neighbor, together with faith. It is the mind that makes a man another, and a new man. This change of state cannot be perceived in the body of man, but in his spirit, the body being merely the covering of his spirit; and when it is put off, then his spirit appears, and this (provided he has been regenerated) in altogether another form, for it then has the form of love and charity in beauty inexpressible."
