=== From the Writings of Swedenborg

@AE 279[6]: "By 'the prodigal son' those who are prodigal of spiritual riches, which are the knowledges of truth and good, are meant; 'his returning to his father, and his confession that he was not worthy to be called his son,' signifies penitence of heart and humiliation; 'the first robe with which he was clothed,' signifies general and primary truths; 'the ring on the hand' signifies the conjunction of truth and good in the internal or spiritual man; 'the shoes on the feet' signify the same in the external or natural man, and both signify regeneration; 'the fatted calf' signifies the good of love and charity; and 'to eat and be glad' signifies consociation and heavenly joy."

The New Jerusalem and Its Heavenly Doctrine, nos. 159-161: "He who would be saved must confess his sins, and do the work of repentance. To confess sins, is to know evils, to see them in one's self, to acknowledge them, to make himself guilty, and to condemn himself on account of them. When this is done before God, it is the confession of sins. To do the work of repentance, is to desist from sins after he has confessed them, and from a humble heart has made supplication for remission, and to live a new life according to the precepts of charity and faith."
