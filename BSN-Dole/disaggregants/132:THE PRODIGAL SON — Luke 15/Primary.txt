Emphasize our need of acknowledging our faults, being sorry, and trying to do better. Again the little ones can be introduced to some of the spiritual meaning. Stress the difference between the father and the elder son in the parable.

What fault in the Pharisees did the Lord rebuke in the parable of the great supper?

Whom did the man in that parable first invite to his table?

Why did they not come?

Whom did he invite then?

What does this parable teach us?

The Pharisees would not learn this lesson. They still thought they were better than anyone else. So when they were hunting for faults in the Lord, they said He received sinners and ate with them. And then the Lord tried to show them that the sinners who were sorry for their misdeeds and wanted to do better pleased Him more than all the people who thought they were so good that they did not need to learn anything from Him. He told them three parables.

In the third parable what did the younger son do?

What happened to him?

What did he decide to do?

How did his father receive him?

How did the elder son feel?

You see, the older brother in the parable was like the Pharisees.

The younger son was like every one of us, because we all do wrong things. And the father in the parable was like the Lord, who is always ready to forgive us when we acknowledge our faults and try to do better.
