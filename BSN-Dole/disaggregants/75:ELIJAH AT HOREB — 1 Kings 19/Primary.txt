Remind the children that when Solomon died the country was divided into two kingdoms, Israel and Judah, and that in Israel the kings were wicked and worshiped idols. Have them tell who Jezebel was and why she hated Elijah. Be sure they know that a prophet is one who speaks for the Lord. Remind them of what had happened at Horeb and point out that this was why Elijah wanted to go there. If you have time, read them Genesis 21:22-34 in connection with Elijah's stop at Beersheba, which means "well of the oath."

After Solomon's death his kingdom was divided.

His son, Rehoboam, reigned in Jerusalem over the southern kingdom, which was called Judah.

Ten tribes formed the northern kingdom which was called Israel. Their king was a man named Jeroboam, and their capital was Shechem. All the kings of Israel were wicked and idolatrous.

The worst one was Ahab, whose wife was a woman named Jezebel. Jezebel was a worshiper of the idol Baal.
