=== From the Writings of Swedenborg

@AE 159: "As all perversion of the church springs from those two loves, namely, from the love of self and the love of the world, 'Jezebel' signifies the delight of these loves. ... Every man is such as his love is, and every delight of his life is from his love; for whatever favors his love he perceives as delightful, and whatever is adverse to his love he perceives as undelightful. ... Those, therefore, who are loves of self and of the world, that is, they, with whom these loves reign, have no other life's delight, or no other life than infernal life. For these loves, or the life's delights from them that are permanent, turn all their thoughts and intentions to self and the world. ... It is otherwise when man loves God above all things, and his neighbor as himself; then the Lord turns the interiors which are of man's mind, or of his thought and intention, to Himself, thus turning them away from man's proprium [what is his own], and elevating them, and this without man's knowing anything about it. From this it is that man's spirit, which is the man himself, after its release from the body is actually turned to its own love, because that constitutes his life's delight, that is, his life."
