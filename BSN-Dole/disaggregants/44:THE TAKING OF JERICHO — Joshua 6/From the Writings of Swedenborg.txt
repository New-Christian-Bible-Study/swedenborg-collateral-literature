=== From the Writings of Swedenborg

@AE 700 d: "The 'city of Jericho' signifies instruction in the knowledges of good and truth, by which a man is brought into the church; for Jericho was a city not far from the Jordan, and that river signified introduction into the church. For all places in the land of Canaan were significative of things celestial and spiritual belonging to the church, and this from most ancient times; and as the sons of Israel were to represent the church, and among them the Word was written, in which those places were to be mentioned signifying such things as are of heaven and the church, the sons of Israel were brought into it, and their introduction was signified by 'the river Jordan,' and their instruction by 'Jericho.' And as 'Jericho' signified instruction it signified also good of life, because unless one is in good of life he cannot be instructed in truths of doctrine. But when the land of Canaan was held by idolatrous nations the signification of the places and cities in that land was changed into the opposite, Jericho then signifying the profanation of truth and good. From this it follows that the 'city' itself signified the doctrine of falsity and evil, which perverted and profaned the truths and goods of the church, its 'wall' signifying falsities of evil defending that doctrine, and the 'inhabitants' those who are profane; and as all profaneness is from infernal love after acknowledgment of truth and good, the city was burned with fire, the inhabitants given to the curse, and its wall overthrown, 'fire' signifying infernal love, 'curse' a total blotting out, and 'the overthrow of the wall' exposure to evil and falsity. The sounding of the trumpets by the priests signified the proclamation of Divine truth from Divine good; the shouting and acclamation of the people signified consent and confirmation; compassing of the city signified a survey of falsity and evil and their dispersion by an influx of Divine truth from the Lord; this influx was signified by carrying the ark about it. The priests were seven in number, and the city was compassed seven days, seven times on the seventh day, to signify what is holy, and the holy proclamation of Divine truth, 'seven' signifying holiness, and in the contrary sense profaneness, and as there was holiness on the one part and profaneness on the other, there were seven priests with seven trumpets, and the city was compassed seven times. The gold, the silver, and vessels of brass and iron, were put into the treasury of the house of Jehovah, because these signified knowledges of spiritual and natural truth and good, 'gold and silver' knowledges of spiritual truth and good, which with those who profane are changed into dreadful falsities and evils; but as they continue to be knowledges, although adapted to evils, they are serviceable to the good by application to what is good, and therefore these things were put into the treasury of the house of Jehovah."
