=== From the Writings of Swedenborg

@AC 1069[5]: "Since the 'vine' signifies the spiritual church, and the primary thing of the spiritual church is charity, in which the Lord is present, and by means of which He conjoins Himself with man, and Himself alone works every good, therefore the Lord compares Himself to a vine, and describes the man of the church, or the spiritual church, in these words in John ... (John 15:1-5, 12); from these words it is evident what the spiritual church is."
