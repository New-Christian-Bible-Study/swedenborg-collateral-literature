=== From the Writings of Swedenborg

@AE 1029[5]: "From the interpretation of this dream by Daniel, it is clear that it describes the state of the church that becomes Babylon, from its beginning to its end. ... The successive states of this church even to the last are depicted by the head, breast, arms, belly, thighs, legs, and feet of the statue; likewise by the gold, silver, brass, iron and clay, of which the statue consisted from top to bottom. All this makes clear that this church in its beginning was full of wisdom from the good of love to the Lord. For its 'head,' which is the highest part, signifies wisdom, and 'gold' signifies the good of love to the Lord. That the toes of its feet were 'part of iron and part of clay' signifies that the last state of that church would be without any good of love and without any wisdom. ... 'The seed of man' signifies the Divine truth, thus the truth of the Word; and by this no coherence is effected, because at the end of the church it is falsified by application to the worship of men."

@AC 9406[7]: "That 'a stone out of the rock broke in pieces the iron, the brass, the silver, and the gold' signifies that the church perishes in respect to the reception of truth from the Word, when falsity and evil are confirmed by the sense of the letter of the Word, as is the case when the church is in its last state, when it is no longer in any heavenly love, but only in worldly and bodily love. Such was the Word in respect to its reception among the Jewish nation when the Lord came into the world; and such is the Word with many at this day, insomuch that it is not even known that there is anything internal in the Word; and if it were said that there is, and its nature were to be told, it would not be received; when yet in the most ancient times, which were signified by 'gold,' nothing else was seen in the sense of the letter of the Word than what is heavenly, almost abstractedly from the letter."
