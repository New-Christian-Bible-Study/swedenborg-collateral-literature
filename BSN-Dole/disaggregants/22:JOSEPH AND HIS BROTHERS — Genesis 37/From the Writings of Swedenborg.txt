=== From the Writings of Swedenborg

@AC 4669: "Joseph. That this signifies the Lord's Divine spiritual Human, is evident from the representation of Joseph, as being in the supreme sense the Lord as to the Divine spiritual ... That the Lord is represented by Joseph is known in the church, for when the heavenly Joseph is spoken of, no one else is thought of; but what of the Lord is represented by Joseph is not so well known, for it is the Divine spiritual which proceeds from His Divine Human. The Divine spiritual which proceeds from the Lord's Divine Human is the Divine truth which is from Him in heaven and in the church. The spiritual in its essence is nothing else. The Divine spiritual, or Divine truth, is also what is called the Lord's royalty, and it is likewise signified by the Christ, or the Messiah ... For this reason Joseph was made as it were a king in Egypt, that he might then represent what is of the Lord's royalty."
