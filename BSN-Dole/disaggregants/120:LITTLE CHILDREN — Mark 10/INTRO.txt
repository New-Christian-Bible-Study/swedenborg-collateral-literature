=== Introduction

We can lead into this lesson by linking it to Palm Sunday and telling them that our story is of some things that happened on the journey to Jerusalem that last time. Point out to the Juniors and Intermediates on a map the three divisions of the Holy Land and how the Lord and His apostles came down on the east side of the Jordan this time and crossed near Jericho. We learn also in Luke that He went up from Jericho to Jerusalem.
