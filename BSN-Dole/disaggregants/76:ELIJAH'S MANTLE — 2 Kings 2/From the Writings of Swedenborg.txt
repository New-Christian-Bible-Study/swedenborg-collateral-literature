=== From the Writings of Swedenborg

@AE 395[4]: "Because Elijah represented the Lord in relation to the Word, which is the doctrine of truth itself, and Elisha continued the representation, and because 'mantle' signified Divine truth in general, which is the Word in ultimates, so the mantle divided the waters of Jordan. ... 'Elijah's casting his mantle upon Elisha' signified the transference to Elisha of the representation of the Lord in relation to the Word; and that 'the mantle fell from Elijah when he was taken away, and was taken up by Elisha,' signified that this representation was then transferred to Elisha, for Elijah and Elisha represented the Lord in relation to the Word and they were clothed according to what they represented, 'the mantle' signifying the Word in which is Divine truth in general, or Divine truth in the whole complex. 'The dividing of the waters of Jordan by Elijah's mantle,' first by Elijah and afterwards by Elisha, signified the power of Divine truth in ultimates; 'the waters of Jordan' signifying, moreover, the first truths through which there is introduction into the church, and these first truths are such as are in the ultimates of the Word."
