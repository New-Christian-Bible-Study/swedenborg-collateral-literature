=== INTRO

In review, the institution of the Passover should be mentioned in all classes because of the frequent recurrence of this feast in the Old Testament story and its importance in the story of the Lord's life on earth in the Gospels. The crossing of the Red Sea should also be mentioned, and the pupils should be reminded how the children of Israel were led on their long journey.
