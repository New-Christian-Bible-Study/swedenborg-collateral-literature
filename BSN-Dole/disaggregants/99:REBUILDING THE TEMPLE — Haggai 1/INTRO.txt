=== INTRO

The story of the rebuilding of the temple is an opportunity to review briefly the original plan and furnishings of the tabernacle. Point out that the ark disappeared from the Bible story at the time of the destruction of Jerusalem. In all classes stress the fact that the people were allowed to return because the Lord was to be born among them in the Holy Land. This will make a good point for the transition to the New Testament.
