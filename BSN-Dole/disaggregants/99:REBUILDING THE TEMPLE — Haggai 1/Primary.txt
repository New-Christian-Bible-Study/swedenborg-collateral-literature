The story of the return and rebuilding will interest even the little ones, and they can also get the lesson of Haggai's rebuke. It is not too early to put into their minds the thought that service of the Lord should come first in our lives. Speak of the Minor Prophets, noting that the last three were prophets of the restoration. Then tell the story and end with the lesson taught in Haggai 1, verse 4.

---
Do you remember about the beautiful temple of the Lord which king Solomon built in Jerusalem? When the people of Judah were conquered by the king of Babylon, this temple was destroyed and all its vessels of gold and silver were carried away with the people to Babylon.

But the Lord had promised the people of Judah that after seventy years they would be allowed to return to their own land, and the Lord always keeps His promises. After seventy years a king named Cyrus was inspired by the Lord with the thought that the temple at Jerusalem should be rebuilt.

He said that all who wanted to return might go, and that those who did not want to go should help them with money and animals and clothing.

About fifty thousand went back.

Cyrus let them take back the vessels of gold and silver which Nebuchadnezzar had carried off when he burned the temple.

When the people got back they first set up an altar where the temple had been.

The next year they laid the foundation for the new temple.

Then they became discouraged and anxious to build their own homes, and for sixteen years they did no more on the temple.

What prophet was sent to rebuke them?

What did he tell them was the reason they had stopped building?

Of what kindnesses of the Lord did he remind them?

Did the people listen to him?

Yes, they began to build again and finished the new temple in four years.

Then they celebrated the Passover.
