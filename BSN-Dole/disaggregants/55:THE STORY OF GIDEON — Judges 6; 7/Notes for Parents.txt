=== Notes for Parents

Gideon was one of the Judges. The period of the Judges came between the time of Joshua — under whom the Israelites conquered the Holy Land and divided it by lot among the tribes — and the period of the kings. The Judges were not rulers over the whole land. They were individuals raised up from time to time by the Lord in one or another locality in the Holy Land to lead an attack upon a particular enemy. The enemies in Gideon's time were the Midianites, who were overrunning the land "like grasshoppers" and stealing the crops before the Israelites could harvest them. The whole story of Gideon is a striking one and is given in the Bible to teach us that the power to gain victory over our temptations is not in ourselves, but comes to us from the Lord as we learn His truths from the Word and obey them.

If the Israelites, after they reached the Holy Land and conquered it, had remained faithful to the Lord and continued to keep their enemies in check, they could have been happy and prosperous.

The troubles they got into in the time of the Judges were the result of their becoming self-satisfied and yielding to the great temptation of prosperity — the temptation to forget the Lord. Whenever we get to thinking that we know enough to do right without trying to learn any more, we are sure to get into trouble.
