In every class above the Primary, the teacher should read aloud Judges 17:6 as the keynote of the period of the Judges and explain the difference between looking to self and looking to the Lord for knowledge of what is right. Be sure to point out the difference between the Judges and the patriarchs and Moses and Joshua, and also the kings, who are to come later. The Judges were local and temporary leaders.
