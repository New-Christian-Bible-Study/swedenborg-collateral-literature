=== Introduction

In a brief course such as a Sunday school course must necessarily be, it is impossible to take up all the Lord's work of preaching, teaching, and healing. This chapter has been chosen as showing the variety of the acts of the Lord in His ministry and something of their significance. With the classes from the Older Children up the discussion of miracles in general is perhaps of primary importance. Doubt of the miracles is so prevalent that even the children will inevitably meet it occasionally, and they should understand as clearly as possible why the miracles were necessary and how it was possible for the Lord to perform them. They can be shown that the ground of doubt of the miracles is not reason but unwillingness to believe. A very general statement of the spiritual meaning of the various miracles in this chapter will be enough to show them the importance of the miracles to the writing of the Word. Questions of disease and healing may be raised even by the Older Children, and the effort has been made in the notes to suggest the basis for answering such questions.
