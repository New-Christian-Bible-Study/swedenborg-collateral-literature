[.underline]#*Teacher Notes:*# 
For this age level we have included the last few verses of chapter 4 instead of the first part of chapter 5, as the setting up of the stones will interest the children and they are not old enough for the lesson on circumcision. They should learn the names Joshua and Gilgal and what Gilgal means. Something should be done to review the Passover lesson in connection with verses 9 and 10, and the teacher should be sure the children know about the manna.

In order to enter the Holy Land the people had to cross the Jordan River. It was springtime, and the river was in flood.

Do you remember how they had crossed the Red Sea?

Now the Lord parted the waters of Jordan for them in the same wonderful way.

Before they crossed, the Lord had told Joshua to appoint one man from each of the twelve tribes, telling each of them to pick up a stone from the bed of the river as they went through it. Let us read what they did with these stones at their first camping place in the Holy Land, and then read some of the other things that happened there. Read Joshua 4:19-24 and 5:9-16.

What was the name of their first encampment in the Holy Land?

Why was it called this?

What feast did they celebrate there?

What can you tell about this feast?

How had the Lord fed them every day in the wilderness?

What happened at Gilgal with regard to the manna?

Who afterward appeared to Joshua at Gilgal?

What did Joshua ask him?

What did he answer?

What did he tell Joshua to do?
