=== From the Writings of Swedenborg

@AC 10360[8]: "When the Lord was in the world, and united His Human to the Divine Itself, He abrogated the sabbath in respect to representative worship, or in respect to its worship such as was with the Israelitish people: and made the sabbath day a day of instruction in the doctrine of faith and of love. This is involved in what is written in John ... by the 'healing of the sick' is signified the purifying of man from evils and the falsities of evil; by a 'bed' is signified doctrine; and by 'walking' is signified life."
