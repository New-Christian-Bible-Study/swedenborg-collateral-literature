=== INTRO

A short review of the last lesson will lead easily into the story of Joseph. For the background of today's lesson the important points to bring out are the length of time Jacob stayed in Haran, the number of sons born to him there, the fact that Joseph was Rachel's son, and the reasons why his older brothers hated him. In all the older classes mention the meaning of the series Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and recall the meaning of Egypt which they learned in connection with the story of Abram and Lot. All the classes above the Primary should be fairly familiar with the general outline of the Joseph story. It is a long and interesting one, and the events are so closely connected that it is hard to pass over any of it. If the teacher prefers, he may tell the whole story very briefly before concentrating on the events of these two chapters.
