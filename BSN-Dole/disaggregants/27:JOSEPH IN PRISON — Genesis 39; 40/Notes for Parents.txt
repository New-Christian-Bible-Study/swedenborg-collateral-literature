=== Notes for Parents

Most people are familiar with the beautiful story of Joseph.

He is an example of a man who remained faithful and upright in the face of the severest trials, and the lesson is one from which we can all profit. The Lord can be with us only as we look to Him for help and keep His commandments. When we do wrong, there are always consequences which cannot be averted. Joseph went through some hard experiences, but his brothers were much worse off because they had guilty consciences to bother them. As we read the rest of the story, in chapters 41 to the end of Genesis, we find that Joseph, because of his character, is in a position of control in every situation. The brothers, on the other hand, are afraid at every unexpected turn of events. Read chapter 42, verses 21 to 24, and see the difference between them.

Joseph represents something in the life of every one of us — the voice deep within us which tells us that the most important thing in the world is to do right in the sight of God, whatever may happen to us. We sometimes try to silence that voice and think we have succeeded, but it is there just the same. The brothers were never really happy until they found Joseph again and realized that he had forgiven them and wanted to take care of them. The Lord takes care of us if we let Him.
