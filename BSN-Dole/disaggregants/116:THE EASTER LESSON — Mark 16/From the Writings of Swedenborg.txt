=== From the Writings of Swedenborg

@AE 400[14]: "'The angel rolled away the stone from the mouth and sat upon it' signifies that the Lord removed all the falsity that had shut off access to Him, and that He opened Divine truth, 'stone' signifying Divine truth which the Jews had falsified by their tradition."
