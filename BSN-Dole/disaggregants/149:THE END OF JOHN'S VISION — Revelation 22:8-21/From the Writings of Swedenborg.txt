=== From the Writings of Swedenborg

@AR 954: "I am the Root and Offspring of David, the bright and morning Star, signifies that it is the Lord Himself who was born in the world, and was then the Light, and who will come with new light, which will arise before His New Church, which is the holy Jerusalem. 'I am the Root and Offspring of David,' signifies that He is the very Lord Himself who was born in the world, thus the Lord in His Divine Human; from this He is called 'the Root and Offspring of David,'and also 'the Branch of David' (Jeremiah 23:5, 33:15), also 'the Rod out of the stem of Jesse, and the Branch from his roots' (Isaiah 11:1-2). 'The bright and morning Star,' signifies that then there was light, and that He will come with new light, which will arise before His New Church, which is the holy Jerusalem. He is called 'the bright Star' from the light with which He came into the world, wherefore He is likewise called 'Star,' and also 'Light,' 'a Star' (Numbers 24:17), and 'Light' (John 1:4-12; 3:19, 21; 4:5; 12:35-36, 46; Matthew 4:16; Luke 2:30-32; Isaiah 9:2; 49:6). And He is called 'the morning Star' from the light which will rise before the New Church, which is the New Jerusalem, from Him; for by 'star' is signified light from Him, which in its essence is wisdom and intelligence, and by 'morning' is signified His coming, and then the New Church."
