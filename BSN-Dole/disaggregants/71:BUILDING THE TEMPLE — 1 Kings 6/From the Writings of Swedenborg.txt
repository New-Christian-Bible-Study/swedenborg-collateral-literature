=== From the Writings of Swedenborg

@AC 7847[4]: " ... in the supreme sense by 'temple' is meant the Lord as to the Divine Human, as He Himself teaches in John 2:19-22. Therefore in the representative sense by a 'temple' is meant His church .... Because the 'posts' and 'lintels' signified the truths and goods in the natural which serve for introduction therefore in the temple of Solomon the posts were made of olive wood. ... 'Olive wood' signified the good of truth, or the good which is of the spiritual church."
