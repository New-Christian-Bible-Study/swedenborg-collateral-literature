=== Notes for Parents

People often ask, "Why does the Lord speak to us in parables? Why does He not tell us plainly what He wants us to do?" But suppose He did: would we always do it? Yet it is when we refuse to do what we know the Lord is telling us to do that we commit sin. The Lord is our savior. He came into the world not to condemn, but to save. So He teaches us little by little in hidden ways, giving us an understanding of the truth only as fast as He sees we may accept and obey it.

Read in our chapter for today the parable of the sower and then read the Lord's own explanation of it. The Word of God is like the seed sown broadcast. Everyone may read it. But only in the good ground does it sink in, take root, and bring forth fruit. The good ground is the mind of any person who truly wants to be good. The parables are simple stories, easy to understand and easy to remember. They stay in the mind as stories until we need the lesson they are given to teach us, and then suddenly we think, "Oh, this is just like such—and—such a parable," and then we really understand and are helped.

And, do you know, we do the same with everything we read in the Word of God. At first we take it just as a story of something that happened long ago, but sooner or later it comes home to us with meaning. For all of the Word is a parable which the Lord is speaking to us, just as we tell or read to our children little stories which they can understand and enjoy and which, we hope, will sooner or later help them to decide rightly in the face of some temptation. In the sight of the Lord we are all little children and He leads us gently in the same way, giving us the truth we need but leaving us free to make our own decisions.

Read the whole chapter, remembering that the seed is the Word of God, and that the truth that is within it is the light of the lamp which we should let shine into all the dark corners of our minds and hearts.
