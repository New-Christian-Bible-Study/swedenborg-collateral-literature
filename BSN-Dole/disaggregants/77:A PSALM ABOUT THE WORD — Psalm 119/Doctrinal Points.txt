=== Doctrinal Points

The Lord came to fulfill the Law and the Prophets and the Psalms. 

Conjunction with the Lord and the heavens is by means of the Word.

Only knowledge of the Word can give us a true understanding and guide our lives aright.

Faith in the Lord is dependent upon knowledge of Him. 

Good done from self is not charity.
