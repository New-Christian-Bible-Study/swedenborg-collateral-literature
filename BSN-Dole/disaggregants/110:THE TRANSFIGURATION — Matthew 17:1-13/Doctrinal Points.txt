=== Doctrinal Points
----
• Our life in this world is important only as it affects our souls.
• The Lord keeps us from truths we are not ready to receive and use rightly.
• To acknowledge a truth but then refuse to live according to it is profanation.
• If we study the Lord's life and follow His example, we, too, can see Him in His true glory and beauty.
