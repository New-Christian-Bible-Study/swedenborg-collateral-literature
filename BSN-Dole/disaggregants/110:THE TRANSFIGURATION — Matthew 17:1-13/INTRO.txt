In all classes begin by speaking of the twelve special disciples of the Lord and especially of the first four chosen: Peter, Andrew, James, and John. Even the youngest can learn these four familiar names. Be sure also that they know which three of these were closest to the Lord. Explain the meaning of the word transfigure and then go on to the story. A good plan is to read it verse by verse from the Word, explaining as you go.
