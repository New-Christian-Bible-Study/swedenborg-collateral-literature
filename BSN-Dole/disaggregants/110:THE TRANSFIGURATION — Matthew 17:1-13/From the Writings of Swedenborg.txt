=== From the Writings of Swedenborg

@AE 594[2]: "In this transfiguration the Lord represented Divine truth, which is the Word; for the Lord, when He was in the world, made His Human Divine truth, and when He went out of the world He made His Human Divine good by uniting it with the Divine Itself, that was in Him from conception ... Consequently the particular things that were seen when He was transfigured signify the proceeding of the Divine truth from the Lord's Divine good. The Divine good of Divine love which was in Him, and from which He had Divine truth in His Human, was represented by 'His face did shine as the sun'; for the 'face' represents the interiors, since these shine forth through the face; and the 'sun' signifies the Divine love. The Divine truth was represented by the 'garments' which became as the light; 'garments' in the Word signify truths, and 'the Lord's garments' Divine truth; this is why they appeared 'as the light'; for Divine truth makes the light of the angelic heaven, and is therefore signified by 'light' in the Word. ... Because it was the Word which is Divine truth, that was represented, therefore 'there appeared Moses and Elijah speaking with Him'; 'Moses and Elijah' signifying the Word; 'Moses' the historical Word, and 'Elijah' the prophetical Word. The Word in the letter was represented by the 'cloud that overshadowed the disciples, and into which they entered'; for the 'disciples' represented in the Word the church, which at that time and afterwards was only in truths from the sense of the letter; and because ... revelations and responses are made by Divine truth in ultimates, and because this truth is such as is the truth of the sense of the letter of the Word, it came to pass that 'a voice was heard out of the cloud, saying, This is my beloved Son, hear ye Him,' meaning that He is Divine truth, or the Word."
