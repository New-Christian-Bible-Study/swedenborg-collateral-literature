=== Introduction

In addition to the chapters assigned, the teacher should read Genesis 11, 12, 18, and 19, which cover the story of Lot. Familiarity with a map of the journey, and with the location of the cities mentioned in the Holy Land is also important. Archaeologists are uncertain as to the exact location of the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah, but it is beginning to seem probable that they may be found in an area now covered by part of the Dead Sea, which was in Bible times part of the plain of Jordan.
