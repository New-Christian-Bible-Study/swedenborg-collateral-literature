Get as much of the background from the children as possible. Use the attitude of the disciples to show how foolish it is to think that spiritual things are not real.

When the Lord rode into Jerusalem on Palm Sunday, He knew that the very people who were welcoming Him as their king would turn against Him in just a few days and shout, "Crucify him!" just as loudly as they had shouted "Hosanna!" The disciples did not know this. He had told them what was to happen, but they had not believed it or even remembered it.

When on the very next Thursday night the Lord was seized by His enemies, even His closest followers who loved Him "forsook Him and fled." They were not quite brave enough then to risk their own lives for Him. They still thought of life in this world as the most precious thing and of death as the end of everything. So when on Friday He was put to death, they thought all their hopes had come to nothing and that they would never see Him again.

But some of the women who had loved the Lord thought of one last thing they could do for Him.

It was their custom to use certain spices in preparing bodies for burial. So on Sunday morning the women took these spices to the tomb where the Lord's body had been laid.

The first one to reach the tomb was Mary Magdalene. What did she find?

What did Peter and another disciple do when she told them?

After they had gone home, what did Mary see in the tomb?

Who then came and spoke to her?

How did the Lord appear to the disciples that same day? Thomas was not with them, and he would not believe. How did the Lord convince him?

The disciples knew then that death was not the end of life.

Do you wonder that after this none of the disciples was ever afraid of death again? And we need never be afraid of it either.
