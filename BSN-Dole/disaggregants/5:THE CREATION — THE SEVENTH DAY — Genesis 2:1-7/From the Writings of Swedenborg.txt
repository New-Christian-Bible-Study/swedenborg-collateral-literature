=== From the Writings of Swedenborg

@AC 82-83: "And the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the army of them. By these words is meant that man is now rendered so far spiritual as to have become the 'sixth day'; 'heaven' is his internal man, and 'earth' his external; 'the army of them' are love, faith, and the knowledges thereof, which were previously signified by the great luminaries and the stars. ... Both 'heaven' and 'earth' are predicated of man; for although they refer primarily to the Most Ancient Church, yet the interiors of the Word are of such a nature that whatever is said of the church may also be said of every individual member of it, who, unless he were a church, could not possibly be a part of the church, just as he who is not a temple of the Lord cannot be what is signified by the temple, namely, the church and heaven. It is for this reason that the Most Ancient Church is called 'man,' in the singular number.

"The 'heavens and the earth and all the army of them' are said to be 'finished,' when man has become the 'sixth day,' for then faith and love make a one. When they do this, love, and not faith, or in other words the celestial principle, and not the spiritual, begins to be the principal, and this is to be a celestial man."
