=== INTRO

For all classes this story offers one of our best opportunities to give the doctrine of the future life. In our chapter the Lord shows clearly that He raised Lazarus in order to teach that we never die and that it is He alone who determines when our consciousness should be transferred from this world to the spiritual world.
