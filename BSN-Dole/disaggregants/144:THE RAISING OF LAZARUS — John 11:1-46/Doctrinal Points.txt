=== Doctrinal Points
----
• Death is a kind of "sleep" leading to resurrection.
• The only "death" we need fear is the death of goodness in our hearts.
• Unless we try to obey the Lord, believing in His Word, we are in danger of letting selfish and worldly desires kill any hope that we may become spiritual people.
