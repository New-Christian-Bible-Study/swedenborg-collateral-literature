After reading the story for today dwell on the figure of the little maid who, even in captivity, was sorry for her master and wanted to help him. Tell the children what leprosy is. Drill them on the names Elijah and Elisha. The rest of the story will carry itself.

The two greatest prophets sent to warn Israel were Elijah and Elisha. They did many wonderful things, helping the good people and punishing the bad ones. Because they obeyed the Lord, He could give them great power.

In our story today, what enemy has been troubling Israel? 

Who was the leader of the Syrian army?

What disease did he have?

Who suggested a way to cure him?

Naaman himself must have been a kind man or the little maid of Israel would not have been so eager to help him.

What did the king of Syria do for Naaman?

What did Elisha tell him to do?

How did he at first take Elisha's advice?

What happened when he had washed in Jordan seven times? Elisha would not take any reward from Naaman.

But his cure convinced Naaman that the God of Israel was the true God, and he vowed that he would never worship any other.

What did he ask Elisha to give him?

What happened to Elisha's servant Gehazi, and why?
