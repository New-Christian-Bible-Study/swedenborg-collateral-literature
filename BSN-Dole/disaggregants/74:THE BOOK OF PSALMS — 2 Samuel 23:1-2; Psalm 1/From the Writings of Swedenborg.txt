=== From the Writings of Swedenborg

@AE 687[6]: "Here [Psalm 1:1] the expressions 'to walk,' 'to stand,' and 'to sit,' are used as following one another, for 'to walk' pertains to the life of thought from intention, 'to stand' to the life of the intention from the will, and 'to sit', to the life of the will, thus it is life's being [esse] . Moreover, 'counsel,' of which 'walking' is predicated, has respect to thought, 'way,' of which 'standing' is predicated, has respect to the intention, and 'to sit in a seat' has respect to the will, which is the being [esse] of man's life."
