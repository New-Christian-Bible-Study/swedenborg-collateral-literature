Tell the whole story very simply, explaining what "anointing" means, and then point out why the people liked Saul and were glad to have him for their king. Even little children need to be taught that we cannot always judge things by their appearance.

---
When Samuel grew old, he let his sons do some of the governing for him, and his sons were not good men. They did not govern the people fairly, and so the people came to Samuel and asked him to give them a king to rule them as the other nations were ruled. Samuel was unhappy about it, but the Lord told him to let the people have what they asked for, and the Lord promised to show Samuel who should be king.

Who did the Lord show Samuel was to be the first king?

What tribe was Saul from?

What did he look like?

Saul was out looking for some lost donkeys of his father's when Samuel found him.

Samuel told him that the donkeys were found, and then that he was to be king. A little later he "anointed" him.

This means that he poured olive oil on his head as a sign that the Lord was with him.

Then Samuel sent Saul home and called the people together at Mizpeh. How did it seem to the people that their king was chosen?

Who really governed the way in which the lots fell?

Why were the people pleased with Saul?
