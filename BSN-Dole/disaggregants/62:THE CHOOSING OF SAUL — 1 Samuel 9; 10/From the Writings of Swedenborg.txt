=== From the Writings of Swedenborg

@AC 2015[11]: "As the kings represented truths, which ought not to have command, for the reason ... that they condemn, therefore the desire to have kings was so displeasing as to call for rebuke, and the nature of truth as regarded in itself was described by the rights [jus] of the king (1 Samuel 8:11-18); and at an earlier day it was commanded by Moses (Deuteronomy 17:14-16) that they should choose genuine truth which is from good, and not spurious; and that they should not defile it by reasonings and memory-knowledges [scientifica]. This is what is involved in the directions concerning a king, given in Moses in the place just cited; which no one can possibly see from the sense of the letter, but yet is evident from the several points contained in the internal sense; so that 'king' and 'kingship' evidently represented and signified nothing else than truth."

@AC 8770[2]: "In the representative church among the posterity of Jacob, there was first a kingdom of judges, afterward a kingdom of priests, and lastly a kingdom of kings; and by the kingdom of judges was represented Divine truth from Divine good; by the kingdom of priests, who were also judges, was represented Divine good from which is Divine truth; and by the kingdom of kings was represented Divine truth without Divine good."
