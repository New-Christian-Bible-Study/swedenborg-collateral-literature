=== From the Writings of Swedenborg

@AR 916: "And the twelve gates were twelve pearls: each one of the gates was of one pearl, signifies that the acknowledgment and knowledge of the Lord, conjoins into one all the knowledges of truth and good, which are from the Word, and introduce into the church. ... By 'twelve pearls' is also signified the knowledges of truth and good in a summary, hence it was that 'the gates' were 'pearls'; the reason why 'each of the gates was of one pearl' is, because all the knowledges of good and truth, which are signified by 'gates' and by 'pearls' have relation to one knowledge, which is their containant, which one knowledge is the knowledge of the Lord. It is called one knowledge, although there are many which constitute that knowledge; for the knowledge of the Lord is the universal of all things of doctrine and thence of all things of the church. ... That the acknowledgment and knowledge of Him is the pearl itself, is meant by these words of the Lord in Matthew ... xiii, 45,46."
