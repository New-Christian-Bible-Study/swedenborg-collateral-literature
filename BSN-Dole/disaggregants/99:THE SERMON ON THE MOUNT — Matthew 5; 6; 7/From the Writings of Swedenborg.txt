=== From the Writings of Swedenborg

@AC 9207: "'Ye are the salt of the earth ...' These words the Lord says to the disciples and to the people. By 'the salt of the earth' is meant the truth of the church which longs for good; by 'the salt has lost its savor' is meant truth without any longing for good; that such truth is profitable for nothing is described by 'the salt that hath lost its savor being thenceforth good for nothing, but to be cast out and trodden under foot.' To long for good is to long to do what is good, and in this way to be conjoined with good."

@AE 1193: "When man loves uses by doing them in the first place, the former constitutes his spiritual and the latter his natural; and the spiritual rules, and the natural serves. This is the meaning of the Lord's words in Matthew: 'Seek ye first the kingdom of the heavens and its justice, and all things shall be added unto you' (6:33). 'The kingdom of the heavens' means the Lord and His church, and 'justice' means spiritual, moral, and civil good; and every good that is done from the love of these is a use. Then 'all things shall be added,' because when use is in the first place, the Lord, from whom is all good, is in the first place and rules, and gives whatever contributes to eternal life and happiness; for, as has been said, all things of the Lord's Divine providence pertaining to man look to what is eternal. 'All things that shall be added' refer to food and raiment, because food means everything internal that nourishes the soul, and raiment everything external that like the body clothes it. Everything internal has reference to love and wisdom, and everything external to wealth and eminence. All this makes clear what is meant by loving uses for the sake of uses, and what the uses are from which man has wisdom, from which and according to which wisdom everyone has eminence and wealth in heaven."
