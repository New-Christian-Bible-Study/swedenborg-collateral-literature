=== INTRO

The teacher should be sure the children know the answers to the suggested questions on the lesson at their grade level and any other points mentioned in their own notes. Then take up some of the practical lessons suggested in the Adult notes. The teacher should study these beforehand, picking out and marking the particular verse or verses in the text which express each point. Take these up with the children, having them read them if they are able. Spend more time on any which seem particularly to strike the pupils. You may not be able to get through all of them, as you should leave at least five minutes for the closing parable, but you will be able to do enough to show the children how much there is in the sermon on the mount, and to encourage them to study it for themselves. Be sure they know what is the famous passage in each of the three chapters.
