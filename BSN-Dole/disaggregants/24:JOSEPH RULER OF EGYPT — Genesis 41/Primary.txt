The teacher should plan to retell the whole story of Joseph as simply as possible, not adding anything that is not in the Word. Stress the fact that the Lord could be with Joseph and take care of him because Joseph was good. There may be children in the class who can tell some of the story themselves. Always give them an opportunity when possible to tell what they remember. Point out that things which happen to us that seem very hard at the time will often lead to good for us if we remain good ourselves.

When Joseph was seventeen, his brothers decided to get rid of him. When they were all away from home, they seized Joseph and he was sold to men of a caravan which was on its way to Egypt. They pretended to their father that Joseph had been killed by a wild beast.

In Egypt Joseph was sold as a slave to Potiphar, the captain of the king's guard. Joseph was so industrious and so wise that he rose to be overseer over his master's household. But Potiphar's wife lied to her husband about Joseph and her husband believed her and threw Joseph into prison.

But in prison also Joseph rose, until he was in charge of all the other prisoners. The king's butler and his baker happened to be in prison, too, and Joseph interpreted some strange dreams that they had.

Later Pharaoh — the king — had two dreams which none of his wise men could interpret.

So the butler who had been in prison told him of Joseph, and he sent for him. What were Pharaoh's dreams?

What did Joseph tell him they meant?

What did Joseph advise Pharaoh to do?

Pharaoh found Joseph so wise and so favored by the Lord that he decided to put Joseph in charge of all the land of Egypt.
