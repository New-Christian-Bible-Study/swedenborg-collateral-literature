=== From the Writings of Swedenborg

@AE 700: "Here 'Jordan' and its waters signify falsities of evil ... since the land of Canaan was then filled with idolatrous nations ... Now as the Lord alone removes and scatters the falsities of evil that are from hell, and by His Divine truths brings the faithful into the church and into heaven, and as the ark and the law inclosed in it represented the Lord in relation to Divine truth, it was commanded that the ark should go before the people and thus lead them. This is why it came to pass that as soon as the priests bearing the ark dipped their feet in the waters of Jordan those waters were divided and went down, and the people passed over on dry land, and after this was done the waters returned. Then these same waters signify truths that bring in; for Jordan was the first boundary of the land of Canaan, and that land, when the sons of Israel had entered into it, represented the church, and that river introduction into it. As the waters of Jordan signified truths that bring in they were commanded to take up out of the midst of it twelve stones, and carry them over to the first place where they passed the night, and this because 'stones' signify truths, and 'twelve stones according to the number of the tribes of Israel' signified the truths of the church."
