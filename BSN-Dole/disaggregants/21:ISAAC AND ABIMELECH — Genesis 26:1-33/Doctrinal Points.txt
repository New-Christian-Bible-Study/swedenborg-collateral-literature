=== Doctrinal Points
----
• The Abraham story teaches the way in which the Lord developed as a child, and this is continued in the stories of Isaac and Jacob.
• Nothing in the Word is accidental or unnecessary.
• We should not try to force our doctrines on those who do not want them.
• True rationality is based on the desire to learn and obey the truths of the Word.
