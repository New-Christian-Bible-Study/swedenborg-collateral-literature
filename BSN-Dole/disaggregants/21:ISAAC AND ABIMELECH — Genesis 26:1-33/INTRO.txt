We have already studied the best—known stories about Isaac.

For the two youngest classes the teacher should be prepared to retell very briefly the story of the birth of Isaac and of his marriage to Rebekah, and should then tell today's story as an example of his dealings with the people of the land. With the older classes, also, the life of Isaac should be reviewed briefly as an introduction.
