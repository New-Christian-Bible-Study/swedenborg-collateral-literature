=== Notes for Parents

Joshua conquered the Holy Land in three campaigns. The first was in the center of the land. When we determine to make our character heavenly, we must first of all strike at the heart of all our evil feelings and false ideas: we must recognize and fight the love of self. Then we must fight the wrong desires which spring from self-love — the campaign in the south — and finally acknowledge and correct the false ideas which fill our minds — the campaign in the north. We never make a complete conquest. The Israelites left many enemies untouched. But we can gain a sufficient mastery with the Lord's help so that we become settled in a heavenly order. This is the division of the land among the tribes, of which our chapter for today tells us.

The tabernacle with the ark in it was set up at Shiloh in the center of the land. The commandments must be "written on the heart" if we are to know peace. Shiloh means "peace." The Levites were given cities throughout the land. This means that the desire to serve the Lord must pervade everything we do, for you remember that the Levites were the tribe who had charge of the worship of Israel. Each of the other tribes was given its own special inheritance. All our powers and abilities must recognize and perform their proper functions in the interests of the whole character. Regeneration is not something which is accomplished for us by the Lord without any cooperation on our part, and our cooperation involves thought as well as action. The Lord gives us the power to conquer our inner foes; our place in heaven comes to us as an inheritance from Him. But we must never cease to learn from Him, to ask for His help, and to be on our guard against these evils within ourselves which are always lurking there and gain strength as we become careless and self-confident, and may even get control of us again before we realize what is happening.
