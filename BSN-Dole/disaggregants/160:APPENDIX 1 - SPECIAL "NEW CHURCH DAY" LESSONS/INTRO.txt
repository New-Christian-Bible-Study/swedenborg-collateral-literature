=== INTRO

The five lessons that follow — never previously published — are intended for school or home use on the Sunday closest to June 19, New Church Day. The first four were written by the author of this set of lessons, the fifth (which is not complete) by the editor. This latter lesson is included because it bears the "stamp of approval" of Mrs. Dole. See below the photo—reprint of her note which was written on the original typescript.
"This lesson was written by Rev. Wm. R. Woofenden in 1967. O.K. if I pass away. Anita S. Dole"
