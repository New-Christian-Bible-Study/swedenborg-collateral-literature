=== Introduction

Remind the classes of the varying attitudes toward the Lord exhibited by the multitudes, the disciples, and the scribes and Pharisees. Our lesson today adds further varieties: the people of Nazareth, Herod, and Herodias. Even the Primary children can see this as a picture of the different ways in which we may respond to the truth when it is presented to us by our parents and teachers and later as we read the Word for ourselves.
