@DP 231: "As profanation of what is holy means profanation by those who know the truths of faith and the goods of charity from the Word, and who in some measure acknowledge them, and does not mean those who are ignorant of these, nor those who from impiety wholly reject them, so what now follows is said of the first class, and not of the others. Of the profanation of such there are several kinds, some lighter and some more grievous; but they may be referred to these seven. The first kind of profanation is committed by those who make jests from the Word and about the Word, or from the Divine things of the church and about them. ... The second kind of profanation is committed by those who understand and acknowledge Divine truths, and still live contrary to them. ... The third kind of profanation is committed by those who adapt the sense of the letter of the Word to the confirmation of evil loves and false principles. ... A fourth kind of profanation is committed by those who say with the lips pious and holy things, and counterfeit the affections of love for these in tone and in gesture, and yet in heart do not believe and love them. ... The fifth kind of profanation is committed by those who attribute to themselves what is Divine. ... Babylon and Chaldea are mentioned in many places in the Word, 'Babylon' meaning the profanation of good, and 'Chaldea' the profanation of truth; both of these in such as attribute to themselves what is Divine. ... The sixth kind of profanation is committed by those who acknowledge the Word and yet deny the Divinity [Divinum] of the Lord. ... The seventh kind of profanation is committed by those who first acknowledge Divine truths and live according to them, but afterwards recede and deny them. This is the worst kind of profanation ...
