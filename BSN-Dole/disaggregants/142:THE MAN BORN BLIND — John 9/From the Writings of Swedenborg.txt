=== From the Writings of Swedenborg

@AE 239[19]: "Why the Lord did this no one understands unless he knows the internal or spiritual sense of the Word; in that sense, by 'a man blind from birth' those are meant who are born outside of the church and who therefore could not know anything about the Lord, or be taught out of the Word. 'The clay that the Lord made from spittle on the ground' signifies reformation by means of truths from the sense of the letter of the Word; 'the ground' is the church where the Word is; 'clay' is the ultimate Divine forming; 'anointing the eyes of the blind with it' is to give thereby the understanding of truth; 'the pool of Siloam' also signifies the Word in the letter; 'to be washed there' is to be purified from falsities and evils."
