=== Doctrinal Points
----
• Afflictions are not punishments for sins. They can, however, be opportunities for the development of character.
• To be born blind, spiritually, means to have been deprived by outer circumstance of the opportunity to learn and understand divine truth.
• There are no defective souls.
