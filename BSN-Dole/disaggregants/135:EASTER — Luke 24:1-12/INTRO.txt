=== Introduction

This lesson is prepared with a view to covering the events of Holy Week rather than giving the meaning of the resurrection, which will be emphasized in the next lesson. In Sunday school, the story of Holy Week should be covered briefly, and the teacher should be prepared to do more with the resurrection itself.
