=== From the Writings of Swedenborg

@AC 44-45: "Man, like the earth, can produce nothing of good unless the knowledges of faith are first sown in him, whereby he may know what is to be believed and done. It is the office of the understanding to hear the Word, and of the will to do it. To hear the Word and not to do it, is like saying that we believe when we do not live according to our belief; in which case we separate hearing and doing, and thus have a divided mind, and become of those whom the Lord calls 'foolish' in the following passage: 'Whosoever heareth my words, and doeth them, I will liken unto a wise man who built his house upon a rock: but everyone that heareth my words, and doeth them not, I liken to a foolish man, who built his house upon the sand' (Matthew 7:24,26). The things that belong to the understanding are signified — as before shown — by the 'creeping things which the waters bring forth,' and also by the 'fowl upon the earth,' and upon the faces of the expanse; but those which are of the will are signified here by the 'living soul which the earth produces,' and by the 'beast' and 'creeping thing,' and also by the 'wild animal of that earth.'"
