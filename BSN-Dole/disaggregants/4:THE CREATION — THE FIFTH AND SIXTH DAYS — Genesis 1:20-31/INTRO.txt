=== Introduction

The natural introduction to this lesson is to talk about the Bible as a whole — what it is and why we study it in Sunday school. With all except the Primary class, the children's knowledge on these points should be tested first. Then give a very brief account of the seven days and what happened on each before developing the work of the fifth and sixth days.
