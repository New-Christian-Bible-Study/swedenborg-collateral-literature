== THE TWELVE SPIES — Numbers 13; 14

It is suggested that in all classes the teacher read Exodus 31:1-7, then say that everything was made according to the Lord's directions, and that the tabernacle was finally set up in the midst of the encampment. Then read Exodus 40:33-38. Mention again the contents of the book of Leviticus and the reason for the name of the book of Numbers. Then read Numbers 10:33-36 as the beginning of the further journeyings of the Israelites, and tell the class briefly the story of the almost immediate murmurings and rebellion culminating in the rebellion of Aaron and Miriam. This shows the state of the Israelites at that time, and leads directly into the story of the spies.

=== Doctrinal Points

The Lord withholds us from temptations which we are not strong enough to meet.

The giants mentioned in the old Testament were all evil remnants from the Most Ancient Church.

Our greatest enemies are the giants of selfishness and worldliness within our own hearts, which are there by heredity.

=== Notes for Parents

Before the children of Israel came to Sinai, they were a mere horde of men, women, and children, uprooted from the homes in which they had grown up, and facing a wild and strange life, with no one but Moses to tell them what to do, and no knowledge of the way before them except that they were to follow the pillar of cloud and fire. In the eleven months that they stayed encamped on the plain before Mount Sinai, they were organized into a nation, given laws by which they were to be governed — not only the ten commandments, but also laws for every little thing — provided with directions for their worship and a place in which to worship, told just how each tribe was to march and how to camp, and provided with a priesthood and with lesser judges to settle all their minor questions. This is a picture of the formation of an orderly life. If we understand our Bibles, we can see in each one of these strange laws something which applies to our spiritual life. The Lord had given the children of Israel everything they needed except the one thing he could not give them — the love of doing right. Isn't this true of us, too? We all have by gift of the Lord the means of knowing what we ought to do from day to day, but each one of us has to choose freely whether he will obey the Lord or not. The Israelites had not gone three days further on their wanderings before they were again murmuring against Moses and complaining of the kind of food given them to eat, and asking to go back to Egypt.

Then after a short time they came in sight of the Holy Land, the land their ancestors had possessed and which they had been promised by the Lord. Heaven is often called the Promised Laud, and we know that it is where each one of us really belongs; but do we always keep steadily on the way to it? The Israelites were told to send twelve men, one from each tribe, to spy out the land and bring them back a report of it. That is just what we do when we think about heaven and try to find out what it is like. And the report is always that it is a beautiful land, a land "flowing with milk and honey." We are even allowed to taste little bits of heaven once in a while in our lives. But we also see the false ways of thinking we shall have to overcome, like the walled cities, and the giants of selfishness in our hearts which will stand in our way. So often, just like the Israelites, we say, "Oh, I never could really be good — it would be too hard work. I'll wait until some time when it looks easier." And, like the Israelites, we have to wander in the wilderness until all those weak, cowardly feelings and thoughts in us die out. We forget that the Lord will always help us if we really try. Now that the children have had this lesson, you can remind them of it whenever they complain that their lessons are too hard or that they are not able to do the things you ask them to help you with at home. Children need this lesson, but so do all of us.

=== Primary

The story of the spies is not hard to tell. The children will be interested in the fruits which they brought back and in the fact that they saw some giants in the land. Stress the fact that the Lord would have helped them if they had not been afraid to try to conquer the land. Discuss the point that the Lord cannot help us to do what we ought to do unless we are willing to try. Nothing good is ever accomplished if we think we can't do it. This applies to lessons in school, tasks at home, and to the overcoming of our faults as well.

The children of Israel stayed nearly a year at Mount Sinai. Then the pillar of cloud and fire led them on through the wilderness. From there they were led to camp at a place called Kadesh.

Kadesh was close to the border of the Holy Land.

What did the Lord tell Moses to do?

How many were chosen to spy out the land?

How long were they gone?

What did they bring back?

Did they say the land was a good land?

What did they find there that was not good? 

Which of the spies differed from all the others? 

What did these two advise?

What did the others say?

But the people would not listen to Joshua and Caleb, and even tried to stone them. They believed the ten cowardly spies, and rebelled against Moses, and talked of going back to Egypt. So the Lord said that they should never enter the Holy Land. Only their children, the ones under twenty at the time of our lesson, who were not old enough to have a voice in the people's decision, and Joshua and Caleb would be allowed to enter the land.

What punishment came to the ten cowardly spies?

What was the people's punishment?

What reward was promised for Joshua and Caleb?

=== Junior

With this class review the wilderness journey by the use of a map. Be sure they get the general features of the journey clearly in mind, as well as the reason why they had to wander so long before they were ready to enter the Holy Land. Remind them that they could travel only when the pillar of cloud and fire was moving before them, and had to stop whenever it stopped. This class can easily see the general correspondence of the lesson.

In addition to the detailed instructions for building the tabernacle which the Lord gave to Moses in Mount Sinai, the Lord filled two men (Bezaleel and Aholiab) with wisdom and skill in workmanship, so that they would know just how to make the ark and the tabernacle. Read Exodus 35:30-35.

After the ark and the tabernacle had been made, the pillar of cloud led the people to a place called Kadesh near the northern edge of the wilderness. Here they were close to the southern border of the Promised Land, and at the Lord's command they sent spies to explore it and bring back a report of it.

How many spies were there?

How long were they gone? What did they bring back?

The spies all agreed that the land of Canaan was a good land, "a land flowing with milk and honey." Yet they were not in agreement as to their advice.

Which two differed from the others?

What did these two advise?

Why did they think the people would be strong enough to overcome the giants and the great walled cities?

Whose advice did the children of Israel follow?

What was their punishment?

What happened to the ten cowardly spies?

What was the reward of Joshua and Caleb?

The journey which the children of Israel were making is a picture of the journey each one of us is making when we decide that we want to serve the Lord instead of ourselves. The land of Canaan — the "Promised Land" — is a picture of heaven or of the heavenly character we must have if we are to enjoy living in heaven when we die. Do we always move straight ahead toward this kind of character? No, we often act selfishly and weakly, and delay our progress.

The Israelites of old were very much like we are today. They murmured against Moses because they had no meat to eat, and wanted to go back to the flesh—pots of Egypt. They were not satisfied with the manna which the Lord gave them every day. The Lord satisfied their craving by sending quails again, but with them came a plague which killed many of those who had complained. At another time Aaron and Miriam, the brother and sister of Moses, became jealous of him and talked against him. Miriam was punished by becoming a leper, until Moses prayed to the Lord to heal her. We have to recognize the bad things in our characters and acknowledge them before we can make any real progress toward heaven.

The Lord wants us to choose the right way freely. He never asks us to go ahead blindly. So He commanded the children of Israel to send spies to bring a report of the Holy Land. They brought back wonderful reports of the land itself, but also frightening reports of its inhabitants. We can all see that heaven is a beautiful place where we should like to be. But we must also know that it is not easy to attain. There are giants in ourselves — love of having our own way, greediness, envy of those who have more than we have, laziness — which must be overcome before we can enjoy heaven. And there are walled cities — all the arguments which support and excuse our wrong desires. We cannot overcome these by ourselves, but the Lord can give us victory if we go forward trusting in Him.

=== Intermediate

The need of going forward courageously in the overcoming of our weaknesses and temptations is important for children of this age. They are willing enough to make great efforts in games and skills, but inclined to think their studies and their home chores too hard. We can do nothing unless we try. The correspondence of the fruits, of the walled cities, and of the giants should be discussed.

When the ark was actually made and placed in the finished tabernacle, the pillar of cloud and fire "rested" on the tabernacle. Aaron and his sons had been consecrated to the service of the tabernacle, and the people could begin to observe all the laws which had been given to them. These laws are recorded in the books of Exodus and Leviticus. Then Moses was told by the Lord to number the people. This numbering or census is the first thing recorded in the book of Numbers, and gives the book its name. After the numbering, each tribe brought an offering of silver according to its numbers. Moses was also told to make two trumpets of silver which were to be used to call the people together and to start them on the march. In Numbers 10:11-12 we are told: "And it came to pass on the twentieth day of the second month, in the second year, that the cloud was taken up from off the tabernacle of the testimony. And the children of Israel took their journeys out of the wilderness of Sinai: and the cloud rested in the wilderness of Paran."

Do you think that the children of Israel now went forward bravely and cheerfully? On the contrary: within a very few days they were complaining again and had to be punished to bring them to their senses. We read in Numbers 11:4-6: "And the mixed multitude that was among them fell a lusting: and the children of Israel also wept again, and said, Who shall give us flesh to eat? We remember the fish, which we did eat in Egypt freely; the cucumbers, and the melons, and the leeks, and the onions, and the garlic; but now our soul is dried away; there is nothing at all, beside this manna, before our eyes." The rest of the chapter tells what came of their complaining, and chapter 12 tells how even Aaron and Miriam rebelled against Moses; and the Lord, in order to show the people their true leader, struck Miriam with leprosy and then cured her at Moses' request.

Then comes our lesson for today. The people reached a place called Kadesh, not far from the border of the Holy Land. When they camped here, the Lord told Moses to choose a man from each of the twelve tribes, and send the twelve to spy out the Holy Land to "see the land what it is; and the people that dwelleth therein, whether they be strong or weak, few or many; and what the land is that they dwell in, whether it be good or bad; and what cities they be that they dwell in, whether in tents or in strongholds; and what the land is, whether it be fat or lean, whether there be wood therein or not." And they were to bring back some of the fruit of the land.

This, too, is a picture of something that happens to us. However clearly the Lord shows us what we ought to do, our natural selfishness always hesitates and rebels. We can look back afterward and wonder how we could have been so foolish, but at the time, all we see is that we are not having just what we want at the moment. And we have to be reassured as to whether the heavenly life is really as happy a life as the Lord tells us it is. Our thoughts spy it out, just as the twelve chosen men did. And they bring back the same kind of report. They all recognize that the Holy Land is a beautiful country. And the Lord even permits us to taste the fruit of the land. When we have really done something good without thinking about ourselves at all, don't we usually feel very happy and lighthearted for a while? This is the taste of the fruit of heavenly living. It is said of the spies, "And they came unto the brook of Eshcol, and cut down from thence a branch with one cluster of grapes, and they bare it between two upon a staff; and they brought of the pomegranates, and of the figs." They all called it a "land flowing with milk and honey." Milk represents the truth in which there is goodness; and honey, the happiness which comes from such truth.

But our thoughts, like the spies, also bring back word that there are many enemies in the land, and strong walled cities, and even giants. When we think of really living a heavenly life, we immediately begin to see all our faults which we shall have to fight, the wrong ideas we shall have to correct, and the natural, selfish desires deep down in our hearts which will rise up like giants in our way. We should know that the giants mentioned several times in the Old Testament were an evil remnant of the Most Ancient Church and picture our deep inherited selfishness. The children of Israel were not particularly brave people. We, too, sometimes forget that the Lord has promised to help us, even though there is always something in us to remind us of this fact, just as Joshua and Caleb reminded the Israelites that "if the Lord delight in us, then he will bring us into this land." We draw back sometimes, just at the time when a little more effort would have given us the victory.

What happens to most of us is just what happened to the children of Israel. It takes a long, long time to get rid of our faults. Deuteronomy 2:14 tells us that it was thirty-eight years after the time of our lesson that the Israelites finally reached the point when all the men who had a part in the decision of our lesson — "all that were numbered of you, according to your whole number, from twenty years old and upward, which have murmured against me" - had died. All our weak, selfish thoughts and feelings must be given up before we can really enter the Holy Land. Those who were under twenty years of age at the time were not held responsible. They represent the new and more trusting thoughts which are gradually being developed in our minds as we learn more and more of the Lord's care and protection over us. They were the ones who entered the Holy Land under Joshua. Joshua and Caleb were the only ones of the older generation still living to see that day. Caleb represents the things in us which are fit for heaven, and Joshua — who was to be their leader after Moses — represents the truth fighting. We shall soon learn more about him.

=== Basic Correspondences
milk = truth in which there is goodness
honey = the happiness which comes from goodness and truth

=== Senior

A good discussion topic for this class is the origin and correspondence of the giants in the land, and also the mention of the walled cities in the same connection. Point out that our deep-seated selfishness always tries to justify itself and so builds up systems of falsity. It also turns truth into falsity.

The book of Numbers takes its name from the fact that the first incident recorded in it is the numbering or census of the people by Moses at the command of the Lord. We saw in our lesson on the Garden of Eden that to "name" a thing represented judging its quality. Swedenborg says that to "number" is always predicated of truth. So it was fitting that after all the laws had been given to the Israelites at Sinai, they should be numbered — that is, examined as to their possession of truths. The numbering was carried out by tribes, only the men fit for war being numbered; and afterward an offering of silver was brought by the heads of the tribes. This was in accordance with the law given in Exodus 30:12-13, which means that we are not to count up our knowledge and understanding without recognizing that we owe all we have to the Lord. In the Gospels we read, "Which of you, intending to build a tower, sitteth not down first, and counteth the cost, whether he have sufficient to finish it?" (Luke 14:28) That the mere giving of the laws did not make over the children of Israel was evidenced by the fact that at their first camping place, three days' journey from Sinai, it is recorded that they murmured again and were punished, and a little later even Aaron and Miriam rebelled against Moses and had to be taught a lesson of obedience all over again. It is after these incidents that they were led to camp at Kadesh, near the border of the Holy Land, and Moses was commanded to send out twelve spies to look through the Holy Land and bring back a report of it.

The story of the spies is a searching one in a very real sense. If the people had been willing to believe and trust the Lord, they might have entered the Holy Land at once and possessed it, but the Lord knows that trust and obedience are developed only through long experience: "For precept must be upon precept, precept upon precept; line upon line, line upon line; here a little, and there a little" (Isaiah 28:10). So it is always provided that we have opportunities to "search" the land before we try to enter it. We must see clearly the enemies which are in the land (the faults in ourselves which we will have to overcome) and we must also see clearly the advantages of heavenly living (we must have a taste of the fruits). Conquering our external bad habits is like overcoming the enemies in the wilderness, but the real work comes when we face the evils which lie deep within ourselves.

Our perceptions, like the spies, go on ahead of us to search the land. They bring back the report that it is a good land, a land "flowing with milk and honey," rich in spiritual instruction and the happiness which goes with it. They bring back one enormous bunch of grapes — one experience, perhaps, of what it means to be genuinely good — and also pomegranates and figs — knowledge of good and truth, and experiences of natural goodness. But they show us that we have to live in a world full of strongly entrenched false ideas (walled cities) and even that we shall have to overcome the giants of self-love and self-intelligence.

Then comes the choice. All that is good and wise in us, like Caleb and Joshua, prompts us to trust the Lord and go forward. But our baser impulses say, "I am not strong enough; I was born as I am: I cannot change; I would rather go back to Egypt." Read carefully verses 1 to 10 of chapter 14. The arguments with which we try to quiet the voice of conscience are the stones the congregation wanted to throw at Caleb and Joshua. Remember this when you are tempted to put off the effort to live a really good life. Every time we put it off, the journey becomes longer and harder.

What was true of the Israelites is true of us: We cannot enter the Holy Land until all our weak, cowardly, selfish thoughts have been put away. And when the Lord sees that we are not strong enough to do this, He makes us wait. We cannot rush ahead in our own strength, as some of the Israelites tried to do when they realized what was before them. If we are not willing to obey the Lord, the first enemy we meet will overcome us. But if we follow the pillar of cloud and fire patiently, the time will come when we find that all our foolish thoughts have one by one been left behind us.

=== Adult

The general lesson here is the reason for our slow progress in spiritual living.

To the end of our lives we have the tendency to say, "I can't help it; I was born that way," to see the beauty of the truly heavenly life but to balk at the effort necessary to attain it. Point out that we always lose when we put off the all-out effort. The topic suggested in the Adult notes is also a fruitful one:

"What is the difference between the Church Universal and the Church Specific, and what is the function of the organized New Church in the world today?" Read @HH 308.

The book of Exodus ends with the setting up of the tabernacle and the descent of the pillar of cloud upon it. The book of Leviticus, with the exception of the account of the consecration of Aaron and his sons in chapters 8 and 9 and the brief incident of Nadab and Abihu in chapter 10:1-7, is entirely given over to laws of all kinds. With the book of Numbers the journey of the Israelites continues. The book takes its name from its first incident, the "numbering" or census of the people by Moses at the command of the Lord; but the name is also descriptive of the character of the book, since "numbering" is predicated of truth and the rest of the book of Numbers describes the testing of the Israelites as to their willingness to follow the truth which had been revealed to them. In our lives it pictures this same period of testing. In the New Church we are brought up to recognize the Word as our book of life. Theoretically we accept this fact. But we do not really "know" any truth until we have learned to practice it and proved it in practice. This is where our real testing begins.

When the cloud was lifted from the tabernacle, the Israelites resumed their march, and we read that after only three days' journey the people began to complain again. Note that this is the same period as the three days' march into the wilderness in the first place. The three days picture fullness of experience on the three planes of life: will, thought, and act. As soon as we bring new truth down into the plane of act, we meet temptation. This time the temptation reached even the higher thought and affection: Aaron and Miriam. 

We may remember the words of the serpent in the Garden of Eden: "Ye shall not surely die" if one ate of the fruit of the forbidden tree. We look about us and see people apparently blessed and happy who are not concerned about obedience to the commandments or worship of the Lord. In chapter 12 it is said that Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moses because he had married an Ethiopian [or Cushite (from Cush, son of Ham). -Editor] woman. What they said was: "Hath the Lord indeed spoken only by Moses? hath he not spoken also by us?" Ethiopia in a good sense represents interior knowledges of the Word. So this rebellion pictures unwillingness to look to the Word alone for leadership. Miriam's leprosy is a clear picture of the hypocrisy involved in such apparent liberalism or "broadmindedness." 

Finally — not long after this rebellion — the people arrived at Kadesh-barnea near the border of the Holy Land. The place has been almost certainly identified. It is only about forty miles south of Beersheba. In Numbers it is said that the Lord told Moses to send out twelve spies. The account of the same incident in Deuteronomy 1:19-46 says that the people asked that the spies be sent. Both are true. Our natural desire, before we embark on a new venture, is to look ahead and count the cost (Luke 14:28-32), and the Lord also wishes us to do so. But the Lord sees to it that in addition to our natural selfish affections and thoughts we have in us some good and true affections and thoughts represented by Joshua and Caleb. The perceptions which spring from our selfishness see the good qualities of the heavenly life — any rational person, as Swedenborg points out, can see the value of honesty and uprightness in moral and civil matters — but when it comes to a question of attempting the spiritual conquest which would give eternal value to these external virtues, they see only the difficulties in the way. They say, "Is it not enough to be a good moral person and a good citizen? No one can hope to stand against the world or to change his inherited nature." Walled cities represent false systems of thought which have been developed in defense of selfishness, and giants stand for that deep-seated selfishness itself. The giants, we are told, were evil remnants left over from the Most Ancient Church. Selfishness is always the power behind false reasoning. This is again illustrated by the fact that in the time of David, the Philistines - who represent an interest in the truth without a desire to live according to it — sent out one of these atavistic giants as their champion. The arguments stirred up in our minds by evil spirits in our times of temptation always rely on our inherent selfishness as their strongest ally. These arguments are also pictured by the stones with which the people sought to destroy Caleb and Joshua.

When the people realized that because of their cowardly choice they would not be allowed to enter the land but would die in the wilderness, some of them sought to rush forward in spite of the divine prohibition and were overcome by the Amalekites. This is a picture of trying to accomplish by one's own power something which only obedience to the Lord can attain. Such an attempt is ended by the first discouragement. We recall that the Amalekites picture the discouragement which results from distrust of the Lord — they attacked from ambush and chose the stragglers and the weary as their victims (Deuteronomy 25:17-18; Samuel 15:2). We can accomplish nothing spiritually in our own power alone.

The punishment of the people for refusing to take the advice of Caleb and Joshua seems severe. Does it mean that one wrong choice will cut a person off from the possibility of entering heaven? Certainly not. All the Israelites of our story represent things within each of us. Caleb and Joshua are there as the promptings of our higher nature. The children — those under twenty years — are there as the possibilities in us which are undeveloped at the time of any given choice. Moses is there as the principle of obedience to the commandments, which continues to lead us toward the Holy Land. The people who were refused admittance to the Holy Land as a result of their choice are all those thoughts and affections in us which lean toward self and refuse to obey the Lord. They must die one by one in the wilderness. Even Moses, although he was allowed to see the Holy Land from the height of Mount Nebo (Deuteronomy 34:1-4), was not allowed to enter it. We may read the story of the reason for this in Numbers 20:1-13. Literally, Moses at one time exalted himself instead of the Lord in his dealings with the people and so was refused admission to the Holy Land. Spiritually, Moses in us represents obedience to the commandments from a sense of duty, and this often has in it something of self-praise. We do not actually enter the Holy Land until external obedience to the commandments has become a habit of which we no longer think with pride.

In Deuteronomy 2:14 we read that thirty-eight years passed after the first sojourn in Kadesh—barnea before the children of Israel were again brought to the border of the Holy Land prepared to enter it. It sometimes seems to us that we shall never reach the free and happy state which is promised to those who patiently seek to obey. The Lord alone sees the heart and knows when we are ready. We are told that He never allows us to be tempted beyond our strength to resist, if we will, and that He withholds temptations altogether from those who are not willing to attempt the conquest. Our spiritual strength is developed and tested little by little. If we can believe that the Lord is leading us, and if we can look upon every such testing as an opportunity for spiritual development, our progress will be much more rapid and easy. The constant murmurings and complaints of the children of Israel in the wilderness are recorded in the Word to show us in concrete form the folly of our own discontents and rebellions. And the patience of the Lord through all their weaknesses should help us to see and acknowledge His patience with us.

=== From the Writings of Swedenborg

@AC 1717: "He who supposes that the external man can be reduced into correspondence without combats and temptations is mistaken; for temptations are the means of dissipating evils and falsities, as also of introducing goods and truths, and of reducing the things which are of the external man into obedience, so that it may serve the interior or rational man, and through this the internal, that is, the Lord operating through the internal man. That these things are effected by temptations, no one can know but he who has been regenerated through temptations. But how this is done can scarcely be described even in the most general manner, since it is done without the man's knowing whence and how; for it is the Lord's Divine operation."

@AC 1740: "That evils and falsities are conquered by the combats of temptations, and that goods and truths are thereby put on, comes from the fact that evils and falsities are thus dissipated; and when these have been dissipated goods and truths succeed in their place; and these are afterwards confirmed more and more, and are thus strengthened. For it is by evil spirits that evils and falsities are excited; and unless they are excited, the man scarcely knows that they are evils and falsities; but when excited they are manifest. And the longer the combats of temptations last, the more manifest do the evils and falsities become, until at last they are held in abhorrence."

----
KORAH, DATHAN, AND ABIRAM — Numbers 16

The lesson of defeat at the hands of the Amalekites was not long-lived. Israel was far from ready to resign itself to the necessary unquestioning obedience to the Lord through Moses. So again we find a challenge to the leadership of Moses and Aaron, again with devastating results.

=== Doctrinal Points

The Lord is the source of all creation and sustains us from moment to moment.

The Word is given for our guidance, and we cannot safely set up our own judgment in place of its teachings.

True faith is not just saying we believe in God or even just going through the forms of worship.

Any good thing we do from selfish motives is not really good.

Charity is love to the Lord and the neighbor in the heart.

=== Notes for Parents

The story for today is a strange one. Did these startling and terrible punishments actually overtake the people who rebelled against Moses and Aaron so long ago?

When men began to become absorbed in the study of the natural world, they found it so fascinating that many lost their balance and came to think that this world is all there is. They seemed to think that the natural world came into existence somehow all by itself and developed by its own power, and that man is just the highest of the animals and has somehow managed to improve his own condition and become civilized. Such people of course reject as impossible the miracles of both the Old and the New Testaments. The most unfortunate part of it is that their attitude has had a strong influence on others because they pose as the "thinkers" of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram of the day. So even among people who see that nature could not have created itself and that there must be a God, an intelligent being behind all creation, there is an idea that we must explain the miracles in some natural way. In the case of our story for today, for instance, they would say that there just happened to be an earthquake and probably a bolt of lightning and the beginning of a plague at about the same time, and that Moses took advantage of them to strengthen his position.

But nothing in the world just happens. There are causes for everything, and behind the natural causes there are spiritual causes. Not only everything we do but everything we think and feel affects the world around us and helps or hinders the Lord in His effort to bless mankind. Sometimes men can be waked up out of their self-satisfaction and selfish ambitions only by being allowed to suffer the actual physical effects of their denial of God, and sometimes good people can be stirred to action only by being shown that these effects fall on the innocent as well as on the guilty. Korah, Dathan, and Abiram and those who supported them in their rebellion had to be made object lessons in order to prevent all the people from destroying themselves.

And the Lord included their story in the Bible as an object lesson for us. It is not hard to read the lesson. Those who pretend to worship the Lord in order to further selfish ambition are turning the unselfish love which comes to them from the Lord and from which they live from day to day into self-love, which ultimately "burns them up." Those who refuse to worship the Lord at all and insist on following their own will and understanding — staying in the door of their own tents instead of going to the tabernacle — are swallowed up by the earth: worldliness destroys their spiritual life. And everyone who lets either of these two foolish attitudes influence him is plagued by evils which may destroy him also.

=== Primary

The story from the Word is more impressive than any retelling of it could be.

Read to the children verses 1-7 and 18-35 of the chapter. The lessons to be drawn are the foolishness of jealousy and wanting always to be first, and especially of wanting our own way instead of the Lord's way. Some of these children are old enough to begin to think about obedience to the Lord as well as to their elders.

Do you remember how Moses was given power from the Lord to bring the plagues upon the Egyptians? And Moses by the same power had brought water out of the rock for the people at Rephidim, and he had been the one to whom the Lord at Sinai had given all the laws for the government of the people and the directions for building and furnishing the tabernacle. Wouldn't you think that all the people would have been quite sure that Moses was the one chosen by the Lord to govern them?

But you know sometimes we become jealous of anyone who has been made a leader. When you children are playing together, isn't each one of you likely to want to tell the others what to do?

There was a man named Korah who became jealous of Moses and of Moses' brother Aaron, whom the Lord had appointed to be high priest. Moses and Aaron were descendants of Jacob's son Levi, and the whole tribe of Levi had been set apart by the Lord to take care of the tabernacle; but only Aaron and his sons could be priests.

Of what tribe was Korah?

What two other men joined with him?

The fourth man, On, is mentioned only once.

How did Moses propose to settle the question of leadership? 

What happened to Dathan and Abiram and their families?

What happened to Korah and the two hundred and fifty men who offered incense?

What happened to the people who still murmured? 

How did Aaron stop the plague?

What did they do with the censers of the rebels?

The Lord gives us this story in the Bible to set us thinking about how foolish it is for us to imagine that we know better than the Lord how things should be done.

=== Junior

In addition to the lessons suggested for the Primary class, the Juniors may be given a little of the correspondence of the punishments which followed the rebellion.

After the book of Leviticus comes the book of Numbers. It is so named because it begins with a numbering or census of the people which Moses took at the command of the Lord. Then the pillar of cloud was taken up from the tabernacle and the children of Israel resumed their march through the wilderness.

We have seen how prone the Israelites were to forget all that the Lord had done for them and to be restless and dissatisfied. We must not think of the children of Israel as a mere handful of people who would all be well acquainted with each other and easy to instruct and lead. When they left Egypt, there were six hundred thousand of them who were grown up, besides the children. Among such a large number of people there are always some who find fault with everything and spend their time trying to stir others up to agree with them and make trouble. Even among the leaders there is sometimes jealousy and disagreement. So several times Moses had to deal with rebellion of one sort or another. Our story for today is about one of these rebellions.

Who was the principal leader of the revolt?

To what tribe did he belong?

Who plotted with him against Moses and Aaron?

What did they say about Moses and Aaron?

Who did Moses say would settle the question of leadership? 

What did Moses tell Korah to do?

What happened to Dathan and Abiram and their families?

What happened to Korah and the two hundred and fifty princes who offered incense?

What was Moses told to do with their censers?

So the rebellion was stopped by the Lord Himself. But even such a terrible object lesson was not enough to silence the complaints of the people. Our chapter goes on to tell us that now they actually blamed Moses and Aaron for the death of their friends. And this brought upon them a plague which killed thousands of them and was stopped only by the intercession of Moses and Aaron themselves.

Why do you think the Lord gives us a story like this in the Bible?

It is because the Lord used the history of the Israelites to teach us and other people in all times lessons which we need to learn. The Israelites, as we read often in the Word, were a "stubborn and rebellious" people and could be kept in order only by such startling punishments. And, although men have developed since that time and are better able to learn by reason, we still often need a vivid picture like this to make us stop to think. Korah, Dathan, and Abiram rebelled against Moses and Aaron primarily because they were jealous and wanted to be first themselves. Do we ever have these same feelings? When you see some other boy or girl given the position of honor and trust in school or in your club, are you never tempted to say, "Why should he be picked out instead of me? He's not so wonderful. Why should I have to do what he says?"

Sometimes, of course, it is true that the wrong person is picked for leadership, but not very often, and if we look at things honestly and unselfishly, we can usually see good reasons for the choice. The Israelites had had plenty of proof that Moses and Aaron were really the leaders chosen for them by the Lord.

Today we have the Lord Himself for our leader. When people had become so perverse that no human leaders could bring them back into order, the Lord came into the world Himself to save us and show us the right way to live. And what happens when we rebel against His leadership and want to have our own way instead? One of three things happens to us: Either the "earth" — our lower nature — swallows us up, or the "fire" of self-love destroys us, or we are "carried away" by various evils as the plague struck down the rebellious Israelites. The Lord's way is the only way to peace and happiness.

=== Intermediate

The correspondence of this story should make a clear and helpful lesson. The teacher may draw on the Adult notes for further points if he finds them of use.

Among the regulations for their worship given to the children of Israel at Sinai was the setting apart of the Levites — the descendants of Jacob's third son Levi — to have charge of the care and service of the tabernacle, whether in camp or on the march. At the same time it was commanded that Aaron should be the high priest and that no one but a descendant of Aaron might be a priest. The children of Israel had had abundant evidence of the fact that Moses, who was also a Levite of course, was the one appointed by the Lord to be their leader and governor — that the Lord spoke to them through Moses. The rebellion against Moses and Aaron of which our chapter for today tells was therefore actually a rebellion against the Lord, even though it was led by a Levite who pretended to wish to serve the Lord.

So the first lesson we may draw from this story is that a person may go through all the outward professions and forms of worship and inwardly be in opposition to the Lord. Isaiah said of the people of his time: "This people draw near me with their mouth, and with their lips do honor me, but have removed their heart far from me" (Isaiah 29:13), and the Lord said of the judgment:

"Many will say unto me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works? And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity" (Matthew 7:22-23). This is one of the temptations of all those who are brought up in the habit of church—going — the temptation to let the habit be a substitute for real religion, which is love to the Lord and the neighbor in the heart, and obedience to the commandments in the outward life.

Dathan and Abiram were not Levites. They were descendants of Reuben, Jacob's first son. You remember that the twelve sons of Jacob picture all the different kinds of affections that enter into the development of a good character. Reuben, the firstborn, represents faith. If we do not believe there is a God, we cannot even begin to make spiritual progress. But people may say, "Oh yes, of course I believe in God," and never try to learn anything about Him or about how He wants them to live. They depend for direction on their own ideas and on the general standards of the community in which they live. You notice in the story that Dathan and Abiram would not come to the tabernacle when Moses summoned them, but stood in the door of their tents with all their families. This pictures that unless we are humble and willing to learn of the Lord, we are really looking only to ourselves for wisdom.

And what happened to Dathan and Abiram? "The ground clave asunder that was under them: and the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them up." This really happened to Dathan and Abiram and their families, but it is in the Word because it pictures something that can happen to us spiritually. You remember the first verse in the Bible and that the heavens and the earth in us are the heavenly and the earthly part of us. If we refuse to learn of the Lord and obey Him and so fail to develop the heavenly part, then the earthly part actually swallows us up. Worldly ideas fill our minds and choke out the possibility of heavenly development. The Hebrew word which is translated pit in verse 33 is Sheol, which means "the place of the dead." When we shut the Lord out of our minds and hearts, the only life we have is selfish life, which is the equivalent of death spiritually.

Korah himself and the two hundred and fifty "princes of the assembly" who supported him did not remain in their tents, but gathered at the command of Moses before the tabernacle, each with his censer full of incense in his hand. Princes in the Word represent primary thoughts or precepts; so these princes picture the precepts which Korah had gathered to support him in his rebellion. One of these precepts we find in verse 3, where Korah says to Moses: "Ye take too much upon you, seeing all the congregation are holy, every one of them, and the Lord is among them." This was a truth which Korah was using to set himself up as equal to Moses and Aaron (Exodus 19:6). When we are arguing in favor of getting our own way, we particularly try to find truths which can be twisted to support us. This is what Swedenborg calls the "falsification of truth." The censers represent worship; the fire in them, the kind of love which inspires the worship; and the incense, prayer. The censers in the tabernacle were of brass, which as we learned recently represents natural good.

What happened to Korah and the princes? Fire from the Lord came out and consumed them. Fire from the Lord is unselfish love, which goes out to all men constantly. It is the thing from which we all live. But when a selfish person receives this sacred fire, he turns it into self-love which destroys him. You notice, however, that the censers which the princes carried were not destroyed, but were beaten out and used to cover the great altar of sacrifice. For example, if we were to discover that some people who go to church are hypocrites, we should not stop going to church ourselves; instead, we should learn from our discovery that true worship is the recognition that any good we may do is really from the Lord and not from ourselves. Sacrifice, you know, means "to make sacred," and the great altar in the outer court of the tabernacle, on which all the sacrifices were offered, is the symbol of this acknowledgment that we can claim no goodness for ourselves. Only the Lord is good.

Even after these two terrible object lessons had been given, some of the people still murmured and actually blamed Moses and Aaron for causing the death of their leaders. This is the old constant temptation to shift the responsibility for our sins to someone else. It hangs on even after we have to acknowledge that we actually do have the sins. But until we honestly say, "This sin is my own fault and nobody else's," we cannot get rid of the sin. It continues to fester in us and to destroy our spiritual life, just as the plague began to destroy the people who murmured.

Now suppose this time you try to work out the rest of the story for yourselves. Read verses 46 to 50. Think of Moses as representing the Word; of Aaron, the high priest, as representing the Lord as to His divine goodness; and of the correspondence of the censer, the fire, and the incense. You will then have a sure recipe for getting rid of the evils in your own character which are plaguing you. (Following the "Suggested Questions on the Lesson" you will find an outline of the deeper meaning of verses 46-50 against which to check your results.)

=== Basic Correspondences

princes = primary truths or precepts
earth = the natural mind
censer = worship
incense = prayer 
fire from the Lord = unselfish love

=== Senior

The lesson for this age should be the pervasive and devastating effect on the life and character of allowing self-seeking and self-intelligence to work in the heart and mind, and especially of allowing them to creep into our worship. Stress the fact that the rebellion began with the murmuring of the people and developed more or less under cover until it found a leader in Korah — that is, until it influenced the attitude toward worship.

Our story for today is a striking one in the literal account. We have noted how easily the Israelites in their journey through the wilderness became discouraged and dissatisfied. Even the complete organization of their civil and religious life which took place during their eleven months at Sinai could not prevent this. Is this so surprising? Think of our own country, founded on sound principles of freedom and democracy, more peaceful and prosperous than any other nation in the world, and yet never without its undercurrents of dissatisfaction and rebellion. And think how prone we all are to find fault with any restrictions which interfere with our ability to do as we please. Swedenborg tells us that the Israelites were strongly inclined to think only in terms of their immediate external condition. This was why they could be led by punishments or promises of reward, and why miracles could be wrought among them, without interfering with their freedom of choice. The Lord, when He was in the world, said to the people in some of the cities where He had wrought miracles: "If the mighty works which were done in you, had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes" (Matthew 11:21). It would appear that the Israelites were such that miracles did not force their wills. So the Lord could direct their history in such a way that He could use its course and incidents to represent in the Word by correspondence the lessons He wants to teach us. The incidents of our chapter actually happened as they are recorded, but their value for us is in their internal meaning.

In general the story pictures the consequences of rebellion against the Lord's established order and of setting up our own will against the Lord's and our own wisdom against the truths given us in the Word — that is, of claiming goodness and wisdom for ourselves. This rebellion, in the literal story, had been developing throughout the wilderness journey and gathering strength until it needed only leadership to bring it into the open. In very much the same way, the selfish elements in our own characters fester in our hearts and minds and gain strength until some particular issue brings them out into open rebellion.

Korah was a Levite. The tribe of Levi had been set apart by the Lord for the service of the tabernacle, but only Aaron and his descendants could minister as priests. This was the burden of Korah's complaint. As a Levite he felt himself as good as Aaron. In attacking Aaron's position he had to discredit Moses also, because it was through Moses that the Lord had given Aaron his commission. The Levites in general represent the affections and thoughts in us which lead us to worship the Lord and direct us in our worship. Aaron in his representative character as high priest symbolizes genuine goodness proceeding from the Lord, and Moses stands for genuine truth as we receive it through the Word. Korah represents a selfish motive entering into our worship. When we go to church because it is good policy or carry on our duties in the church with a feeling of self-righteousness or a desire to dominate over others, true worship is profaned and our whole character feels the effects.

In the rebellion there were four elements involved: 

(1) Korah himself is the selfish motive which leads all the others. 

(2) The two hundred and fifty "princes of the assembly" are the precepts which govern our reasoning. These princes had been appointed by Moses to govern under him. When Korah turns them against Moses, it is a picture of what Swedenborg calls the "falsification of truth." We find an example of it in verse 3 in Korah's statement, "seeing all the congregation are holy, every one of them, and the Lord is among them." This is a precept given to the children of Israel by the Lord (Exodus 19:6) but falsified by Korah through his use of it to justify himself in his rebellion.

When we are bent on getting something for ourselves or on proving something we want to believe, we try to find truths which can be used in such a way as to support us. The two hundred and fifty princes with Korah, presenting their censers full of incense before the tabernacle, were destroyed by fire proceeding from the Lord. When we profane our worship by entering into it with selfish motives, we turn the Lord's love — by which we all live — into self-love, which is spiritual death.

Then there were (3) Dathan and Abiram, and On, who is mentioned only at the beginning of the story and must have thought better of his part in the rebellion because he is not said to have shared the punishment of the others. These three were of the tribe of Reuben. Reuben, Jacob's first son, represents "faith in the understanding." This is the first step in the development of our spiritual life. If we do not acknowledge with our minds that there is a God, we cannot even start on the road to a good life. But if we stop with this acknowledgment and do not go on to learn about the Lord and try to obey Him, the acknowledgment has no real force in our lives. Dathan and Abiram would not come to the tabernacle. They stood in the door of their own tents. A man who says, "I believe in God," but refuses to learn about Him or to worship Him, continues to live according to his own ideas and is presently "swallowed up" by worldly considerations and cut off from the light of heaven. Spiritually he goes down into "the pit" (Sheol) and the earth closes over him.

The last element in the rebellion was (4) "the people." The people in the Word represent the multitude of everyday thoughts in which our character expresses itself. When our worship is profaned by self-love and our ideas of right and wrong are self-directed, everything in our life is tainted. The scourge which destroyed so many of the people is a picture of the devastation which self-confidence and self-assertion cause in our minds and hearts. This plague can be stayed only by turning to the Lord with humility and praying for His help. The censer is the symbol of worship, the fire from the altar is unselfish love for the Lord and the neighbor, and the incense is prayer.

We should note that the censers carried by Korah and the princes were not destroyed. We do not abstain from public and private worship just because we find that our motives have not always been pure. Instead, we try to change ourselves and to make our worship a genuine offering of ourselves to the Lord, as the censers were beaten into plates to cover the great altar of sacrifice.

=== Adult

This story is one of many in the Bible given to shake us out of the easygoing self-satisfaction into which we all sometimes fall. The various elements which took part in the rebellion and the variety in their punishments make interesting discussion material.

We have seen that the wilderness journey of the Israelites pictures, in the life of the man or woman "who is to be regenerated," as Swedenborg frequently puts it, the period of reformation — that long, slow process of bringing the outward life into order from a principle of obedience to the commandments — which comes between the free decision to turn away from self toward the Lord and the real enjoyment of spiritual living which is regeneration. That period from its very beginning is punctuated by times of dissatisfaction, discouragement, and rebellion. The old selfish, worldly desires and reasonings persist, festering under the surface even as we plod forward, and from time to time breaking out, in spite of the constant evidences we have of the Lord's presence with us and power to save us and to supply all our needs. Sometimes these rebellious outbreaks are mere murmurings, quickly stilled by the Lord's merciful provision. But sometimes, as in our story today, they are the culmination of a long-unnoticed conspiracy of self-love and self-intelligence within us.

The rebellion which is the subject of our lesson came into the open when it found a leader in Korah. Korah was a Levite, a member of the tribe set apart by the Lord for the service of the tabernacle. But he was not of the house of Aaron, and only Aaron and his descendants could actually be priests. In the literal story Korah resents his subordinate position and tries to overthrow the authority of Moses and Aaron. The name Korah means "baldness"; conversely, hair represents outmost truth. Korah knew that Moses and Aaron had been specially appointed by the Lord, but his ambition prompted him to try to get around the acceptance of the literal fact. In order to do so he drew upon other statements of the Lord which he could interpret in support of his contention. His statement in verse 3 is taken from the Lord's words to Moses as recorded for us in Exodus 19:6. Isn't this something we church people are all prone to do? We profess to believe that the Word is inspired by the Lord and — in the New Church — that Swedenborg was the Lord's instrument in opening the Word and revealing its true doctrine; but when something in the Word or the writings runs counter to what we want to believe, we try to discount it and to find other statements more to our liking, instead of really examining what we read to find out the truth and applying it by changing our thought and conduct. The two hundred and fifty "princes of the assembly" who supported Korah in his rebellion represent just such precepts of the Word, given to govern us but taken out of their context and used to support us in doing what we like. This is what Swedenborg calls the "falsification of truth."

The punishment for such misuse of the truth is described in the punishment of the two hundred and fifty princes: "there came out a fire from the Lord, and consumed them." The "fire" which proceeds from the Lord is unselfish love. It is the very life of life which maintains us from moment to moment. When we profess to be seeking this life and then turn it into self-love, our souls perish. The brazen censers are a symbol of outward worship, the fire in them the motive which prompts it, and the incense the petitions we are offering in our minds. When we go to church professing to believe in the Lord and to be worshiping Him, and are really thinking about how good we are and hoping our worship will be properly credited to us and praying that we may be given the things we want, we are like Korah and the princes. We must note, however, that after these men were destroyed, the censers were preserved. People have been known to excuse themselves from going to church on the ground that there were "so many hypocrites in the churches." External worship is right and necessary. We cannot safely do without it. But our worship should be a humble offering of ourselves to the Lord and not an exaltation of self. This is what is meant by beating the censers into plates to cover the great altar of sacrifice.

There were two other groups concerned in the rebellion of Korah. One was the three Reubenites, Dathan, Abiram, and On. On is mentioned only in the first instance and apparently obeyed Moses and withdrew from the company of the others, as he was not included in their destruction. Reuben, Jacob's first son, represents faith — specifically faith in the understanding. This is the first step in the development of spiritual life; we must acknowledge divine truth with our minds before we do anything useful with it. But if we go no further than intellectual acknowledgment, divine truth has no real effect on our lives. Dathan and Abiram would not go to the tabernacle at the call of Moses. They stood in the door of their tents. Whenever we — any of us — fall into the idea that because we have joined the church and give lip service to the Lord we shall get to heaven without making any real effort to learn the truths of the Word and apply them in our daily lives, we are living in faith alone. When we do not try to learn of the Lord and to obey Him, we are led by our own ideas and the ideas of the world about us. We have cut ourselves off from the light of heaven. And eventually the earth opens her mouth and swallows us up and we go down alive into the pit (Sheol) just as really as Dathan and Abiram did. And all the affections and thoughts and deeds which we have produced and in which we take such pride are dragged down with us. Worldliness and self-interest are in all that we do.

The other group concerned in the rebellion were the people.

"The people" are all our everyday thoughts and feelings. When Dathan and Abiram insisted on remaining by their own tents instead of coming to the tabernacle, Moses gave the people a solemn warning: "Depart, I pray you, from the tents of these wicked men, and touch nothing of theirs, lest ye be consumed in all their sins." We are told in @AC 10130 that "by 'touching' is signified communication, transfer, and reception." Our minds touch other people's minds constantly in the course of our daily life in the world. How easily we fall into the habit of agreeing with our acquaintances without stopping to think whether we really should agree or not! It is so much easier to agree than to think, and the matter in question often seems unimportant. But in this way our own thinking is colored by the ideas of the world about us, and we sometimes wake up and realize that what we have been accepting as a matter of course is actually quite contrary to the principles we profess to hold. The Lord said, "Take heed how ye hear." In our story the people did withdraw from the tents of Dathan and Abiram, but many had been so tainted with the spirit of the rebellion that they still murmured, even after the terrible object lessons they received, and their murmuring took the form of the charge that Moses and Aaron were responsible for the death of their friends. This, too, strikes home to us. How often, when we can no longer deny that we have been wrong, our first impulse is to blame someone else for our condition! The plague which struck among the people who murmured is a picture of the spiritual consequences of refusing to acknowledge and repent of our own sins. Every time of rebellion and disobedience in our lives leaves its trail of consequences in our minds and hearts. The plague was stopped by Aaron by means of a censer full of fire from the altar and incense laid upon it. If we look to the Lord for help with sincere humility and a desire to be shown our weaknesses and evils and are led to serve Him truly, the effects of our rebellion can be checked.

=== From the Writings of Swedenborg

@AE 3246: "Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, with their company, were swallowed up by the earth, although they took fire from the altar and burnt incense, because 'their murmuring against Moses and Aaron' signified profanation of the good of celestial love; for 'Moses' and 'Aaron' represented the Lord; and 'to murmur' (that is, to rebel) against the Lord and at the same time to perform holy offices, is profanation; but as they took the fire from the altar, that fire was cast out, and their censers were made into a covering for the altar."

AARON'S ROD — Numbers 17

The teacher should read Exodus 28:1-4, 40-43 concerning Aaron, and review Numbers 16 as a background for the current lesson. He should also look over the route of the Israelites as found in Numbers 33 and as marked on a Bible map of the wilderness journey, and he should refresh his memory of the story of the spies in Numbers 13 and 14, especially Numbers 14:26-35.

=== Doctrinal Points

The Lord knows what is best for us. We should recognize Him as wiser than we are.

The signs given the Israelites in the Word are signs for us, too.

Faith in the Lord is measured by obedience.

There is no genuine goodness in anything done from self.

=== Notes for Parents

In our lesson for today the children of Israel have left Sinai and have been traveling through the wilderness for some time. Once they even came almost in sight of the Holy Land; but when the spies they sent on ahead reported finding strong cities, powerful enemies, and even giants there, they refused to attempt the conquest, even though two of the spies — Joshua and Caleb — reminded them that the Lord was with them and would surely give them the victory. For this lack of trust in the Lord they were condemned to continue their wanderings in the wilderness for forty years, until all who were of age at the time of their cowardly decision, except Joshua and Caleb, should have died. In the same way, we ourselves all too often lose some great happiness because we refuse to "trust in the Lord and go forward."

And in another way we are very much like the children of Israel.

When we are suffering from the results of some wrong we have done, we try to find someone else to blame instead of ourselves. The Israelites blamed Moses and Aaron and rebelled against their leadership. If you have read chapter 16, you will know the immediate result of the rebellion and the terrible lesson they were given.

Then the Lord gave them a different kind of lesson. At Sinai the Lord had appointed Aaron to be high priest, and only a descendant of his was ever to hold this office. Now the Lord confirms the choice in the eyes of all the people by the sign of the rods. When twelve rods — one for each tribe, each marked with the name of the leader of the tribe — were laid up overnight before the ark in the Holy of Holies of the tabernacle, Aaron's rod bore buds and blossoms and yielded almonds. The other eleven remained mere sticks. In the Gospels the Lord tells us, "By their fruits ye shall know them," and we all understand that fruits mean deeds. Almonds are delicious, nourishing, and long-lasting fruit, and the almond blossom is beautiful. The lesson is not hard to see. Only love to the Lord and obedience to Him can make us happy and good, with the kind of goodness which endures. We should take this lesson to heart, as Moses was afterward commanded to lay up Aaron's rod before the ark forever "to be kept for a token against the rebels."

=== Primary

Bring out especially Aaron's position with reference to Moses and the people. This class should learn the function of the Levites and that of Aaron and his sons, and should have the background story of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram refreshed in their minds. They are not too young to get the general lesson of the blossoming rod.

After the golden calf was destroyed, Moses set the people to work to build the tabernacle, a special tent in which they were to worship the Lord. The Lord had given Moses exact directions for making the tabernacle and the furniture that was to be in it. The holiest piece of furniture was the ark, a box or chest covered with gold, in which were kept the two tables of stone with the ten commandments written on them. You remember that Moses broke the first tables when he came down and found the people worshiping the golden calf. But afterward the Lord told Moses to hew out two new tables from the stone at the foot of the mountain and bring them up, and the Lord wrote the commandments on them again for the people.

Do you remember the name of Moses' brother who went everywhere with him? It was Aaron. The Lord told Moses that Aaron was to be the high priest of Israel and that Aaron's sons were also to be priests. The whole tribe of Levi, to which Moses and Aaron belonged, were to have charge of the tabernacle and its furnishings and of all the things connected with the people's worship, but only Aaron and his sons could perform the highest services.

After they left Sinai, the pillar of cloud and fire led them from place to place through the wilderness, and the people began to blame Moses and Aaron for their long journey and all their troubles. They blamed them for all their troubles.

They thought someone else should be high priest. What did the Lord tell Moses to do?

How many rods were brought to him?

How were they to know which was which?

Where were the rods placed?

Next morning what did Moses find had happened to Aaron's rod? What did this mean?

What did the Lord tell Moses to do with Aaron's rod?

=== Junior

The historical and geographical sequences are important for this age group. The teacher should have a map to show them. The moral lesson is within their reach, and they can also get some idea of the correspondence of the seed/plant series, which will show them the reason for the Lord's choice of this particular sign.

Where did the children of Israel camp for eleven months? 

What did they all hear the Lord speak from the mount? 

What other instructions were given at Sinai?

Where did Moses have to go to speak with the Lord?

How long was he gone the last time?

What did the people ask Aaron to do?

What did he make for them?

What did he use to make it?

When Moses came down, what was he carrying? What did he do with them?

What did he do with the golden calf?

Where did Moses cut two new tables of stone?

Who wrote the commandments on them?

During the rest of their stay at Sinai, the people were kept busy with the construction of the tabernacle and its furnishings and the dedication of it with sacrifices and offerings. This was the kind of thing they could see and enjoy. The tribe of Levi was set apart by the Lord to have charge of everything pertaining to worship. They were to set up the tabernacle when the people camped and to take it down and carry it when the march was resumed, and they were to assist in the offerings and ceremonies. But only Aaron and his sons could be priests. The Lord appointed Aaron to be high priest, and no one but a descendant of his was ever to hold this office.

Finally the pillar of cloud moved. The people were set on the march by the blowing of two special silver trumpets. They were led into the wilderness of Paran which forms a large part of the Arabian peninsula north of Sinai. The thirty-third chapter of Numbers lists the stopping places in their order. Finally they reached Kadesh-barnea, very near the southern border of the Holy Land. But they did not go forward then. They sent twelve men — one from each tribe — to spy out the land, and ten of them came back and said they found enemies there too strong for the Israelites to conquer. And although the other two spies — Joshua and Caleb — reminded them that the Lord was with them and urged them to go forward, they voted to take the advice of the other ten. And the Lord said that because of their lack of faith they would have to go on wandering about in the wilderness until all the men who had been old enough to vote at that time — except Joshua and Caleb — had died. When we are being punished for some wrong thing we have done, we are never very happy, are we? We often forget that it was all our own fault and try to put the blame on innocent people, sometimes on the very ones who tried to keep us from doing wrong in the first place. Our story for today is really a continuation of the story of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram.

What did the Lord tell Moses to have brought for each tribe? 

How many rods were there?

How were they to know which was which?

Whose name was written on the rod of the tribe of Levi? 

What did Moses do with the rods?

In the morning what had happened to Aaron's rod? 

What was Moses told to do with Aaron's rod?

You know what almonds are. They are nuts which keep well, have a fine flavor, and are nourishing. And the almond tree has lovely blossoms, too. The Lord made Aaron's rod blossom and bear almonds to show the people that only worship in obedience to the Lord could make them happy and good.

The people really knew that it was the Lord who had appointed Aaron, but people are not always ready to accept the Lord's will. We like to think we can be good in our own way. We have many good affections: love of our parents, love of study, love of making useful things, love of certain kinds of work, etc. All these lead us to do some good things. But sometimes none of these is strong enough to keep us from doing wrong, especially when we think no one will know what we have done. Only love of the Lord can always keep us in the right way, for we know that the Lord sees and knows everything we do, and even everything we think and feel. We must always remember this. That is why Aaron's rod was to be laid up beside the ark in the Holy of Holies of the tabernacle. You remember the first commandment. And the Lord says that the commandments should be written in our hearts. Our story for today is put in the Bible to help us see that only by obeying the Lord can we be happy.

=== Intermediate

A considerable part of the lesson time will need to be spent on background. The meaning of the lesson for the day itself is simple and should be given as a climax.

Our lesson today is from the book of Numbers. We have learned the meaning of the names Genesis and Exodus and why these two books are so called. The book of Leviticus is the detailed statement of the code of laws given to Moses at Sinai. These were called the "Levitical" laws because the tribe of Levi was set apart by the Lord to have charge of the Jewish worship and to teach and enforce the law. If we read the first four verses of the first chapter of the book of Numbers, we find the reason for its name. Before the people left Sinai, Moses was commanded by the Lord to number or count all the people by tribes, and there are many places in the book where numbers are prominent and where our attention is called to the twelve tribes, their leaders, and their individual functions. Our lesson for today is one of these.

In Exodus 28 we learn that among the Levites Aaron and his sons were given the priestly office by the Lord, and in Exodus 40 their solemn consecration to this office is described. Aaron himself was to be high priest, and only a descendant of his could hold that office.

The greater part of the wilderness journey came after the Israelites left Sinai. Chapter 33 of Numbers lists their stopping places. When they reached Kadesh near the southern border of the Holy Land, at the command of the Lord Moses sent twelve men — one from each tribe — to spy out the land. But the people let themselves be discouraged from attempting its conquest because ten of the spies said the enemies there were too strong for them. The other two spies, Joshua and Caleb, reminded them that the Lord was with them but they were not listened to, and so the Lord told them that they would have to wander in the wilderness until all who had been of age to vote at the time of the decision — except Joshua and Caleb — had died. So it was actually forty years before the entry into the Holy Land took place. We know from experience how prone we are, when we are suffering from the effects of some wrongdoing of our own, to try to find someone else to blame. The Israelites blamed Moses and Aaron. The rule of Moses and Aaron pictures the rule of divine truth and love. When we turn against this, "the earth" — that is, worldliness — swallows us up and the love of our hearts is turned into consuming self-love. This is the negative side of the picture, detailed in the story of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram.

But the Lord, in the Word, follows this with a beautiful picture of the positive results of obedience to divine law. The twelve tribes picture all our good affections and thoughts, the tribe of Levi and especially Aaron as high priest portraying love of goodness from the Lord. The rods, one from each tribe, are symbols of power, the principles which put the various affections into practice.

We have many good affections: love of learning, love of useful service, etc. These are some of the things represented by the rods. But all these may fail under temptation. There is only one love which can carry us through everything, and that is love of the Lord — the power of which is symbolized by Aaron's rod.

The teachings of our church tell us that we are to shun evils as sins against God. This means that we are to judge our conduct by the standard of the Lord's laws instead of by any standards we make for ourselves or find in the world about us. Only in this way can we be sure of avoiding evil and doing good.

Aaron's rod, the power of love to the Lord, "brought forth buds, and bloomed blossoms, and yielded almonds." The buds stand for impulses toward good deeds; the blossoms, thoughts about how to do them; and the almonds, genuine good works, for nuts are both nourishing and lasting.

Moses was commanded to lay up Aaron's rod beside the ark in the Holy of Holies. In the same way, we must hold fast in our hearts to the one true guiding principle, which is love to the Lord.

=== Basic Correspondences

the twelve tribes = all our good affections and thoughts 
Aaron as high priest = goodness from the Lord 
a rod = power 
the almond = goods of life

=== Senior

The principal lesson for this age is in the necessity of distinguishing between good works done from self and good works done from the desire to serve and obey the Lord. Even in the church there is a great deal of self-praise. There is no interior life in good works performed in this spirit.

It is not until the tenth chapter of the book of Numbers that we find the Israelites leaving Sinai. First the tabernacle and its furnishings had to be constructed, set up, and consecrated, and worship begun according to the prescribed rites. The Lord had named Aaron as high priest (Exodus 28) and his sons as priests under him, and the priesthood was to continue in his family. The book of Leviticus gives the detailed code of laws to be taught and administered by the tribe of Levi, to which both Moses and Aaron belonged. Then at the command of the Lord, all the people were numbered or counted by tribes, the event which gives the book of Numbers its name.

If you will look at a map of the wilderness journey, you will find that the Israelites traveled in a fairly steady line from Sinai to Kadesh-barnea near the southern border of the Holy Land. Their encampments along the way are given us in Numbers 33. At Kadesh they sent forward twelve men to spy out the Holy Land; but when the spies returned, the people allowed themselves to be discouraged from attempting the conquest. For their lack of trust in the Lord's power to give them victory — a power which Joshua and Caleb urged them to acknowledge — they were condemned to continue in the wilderness until all those over twenty years of age (voting age) at the time of their weak decision should have died. With the loss of their immediate hope and incentive, their natural selfishness inspired them to continual grumblings and to dissatisfaction with the leaders whom the Lord had given to them. The immediate background of our chapter is the rebellion of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram and the two hundred and fifty "princes of the assembly" against Moses and Aaron. Their punishment is a vivid picture of the worldliness and self-love which overtake those who rebel against the Lord's direction while professing to worship Him.

But after this terrible lesson the Lord gave the people another sign, a beautiful one this time, of the fact that only love to the Lord is able to produce genuine and lasting fruit. We recognize the twelve tribes as standing for all our good affections and thoughts. A rod is a symbol of power. Aaron, as high priest and leader of the priestly tribe, represents the principle that life should be lived in recognition of the Lord and in the attempt to learn and do His will. This principle alone has power to make our lives truly happy and fruitful.

We can imagine that the rods, in the hands of their owners, all inspired respect among the people. We hear people say, even of a man who is an atheist, that he is a good man because he does things which benefit humanity. But we should realize that if such a man does recognize his duty to do good to others, it is from some early religious influence and training or from the acceptance of standards in the community which stemmed from a religious source, and that if he does not recognize God in what he does, he is ascribing goodness to himself. His goodness is then merely on the outside and is not genuine, for we read in the Gospels: "There is none good but one, that is, God." What the Lord shows us in this story is that He alone is the source of the power to do good, and that in His sight — when the rods are laid before the ark in the tabernacle — all principles except that of loving obedience to Him are unfruitful.

The almond was appropriate for several reasons. It is a noble and beautiful tree, blossoming profusely (see Jeremiah 1:11). The blossoms are lovely, and the fruit delicious, nourishing, and lasting. The blossoms of a plant or tree represent our thoughts about specific uses or good works; and the fruit, the good works themselves. If our lives are governed by the principle of love to the Lord and desire to do His will, we shall find delight in thinking about His truth and its specific applications, and we shall find deep and lasting joy in serving Him from day to day. Our lives will not be sterile when laid before the judgment seat of the Lord.

There seems to have been enough power in this final demonstration of the leadership of Moses and Aaron to convince the people. The final proof to us of the rightness of the Lord's guidance is the joy that comes in doing His will. Until we see and taste this satisfaction we are constantly tempted to turn back toward self. And we, too, must "lay up the fruitful rod before the ark" as a constant reminder. That is, the Lord's laws must be written in our hearts. In times of trouble and temptation we must remind ourselves of the blessings that have come to us in the past through obedience, and so hold steadfast.

=== Adult

Discussion material is suggested in the Adult notes in the references to modern humanism and rejection of revelation. The lesson, however, should be directed toward self-examination rather than toward criticism of society.

We have studied the story of the destruction of two of Aaron's sons — Nadab and Abihu — because they offered "strange fire" in their censers (Leviticus 10:1-7); the story of the sending out of the twelve spies from Kadesh and the condemnation of all the adults who voted to follow the advice of the cowardly ten (Numbers 13, 14); and the story of the rebellion of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram (Numbers 16). All these stories show the steady disposition of the Israelites to set up their own will and their own intelligence in opposition to the Lord's commands and instructions. In these striking and dramatic stories it is easy for us to see and condemn the folly of the tendency in the Israelites to set up their own intelligence and their own will against the Lord, but we are slow to recognize this same tendency in ourselves and to acknowledge its foolishness. Yet it is an almost universal tendency. In national life it results in the belief in force rather than in righteousness, in social life in the struggle for money and power, in our individual lives in contempt for those who are different from ourselves and for anyone who disagrees with us. It appears most clearly of all in one modern theory that the Bible is the work of men — rather pretentiously described as "man's ascending search for God" — and in the tendency of churches, including our own, to measure themselves and their members in terms of external activities instead of in terms of justice and righteousness.

In our chapter for today the Lord gives the people a sign. The story is a simple one and we may wonder why the mere miraculous blossoming of a rod should have convinced the people. Yet the last two verses of the chapter indicate that, coming on top of the terrible events described in the preceding chapter, it did convince them, for the time at least.

What does this story mean for us? The Lord at Sinai had appointed Aaron to be high priest. His sons were also to be priests, and the high priesthood was to descend in his line. Aaron and Moses were descendants of Levi, who among the twelve sons of Jacob represents charity. In @AC 342 Swedenborg says: "The church conceives and brings forth nothing else than faith and charity. The same is signified by the first children of Leah from Jacob; 'Reuben' denoting faith; 'Simeon' faith in act; and 'Levi' charity, wherefore also the tribe of Levi received the priesthood, and represented the 'shepherd of the flock.'" He says elsewhere that charity is love to the neighbor in the heart, springing from love to the Lord, and that recognition of the Lord and charity are the essentials of the church.

But among the Levites Aaron was singled out to be high priest.

Aaron, like other individuals in the Bible story, has his basic correspondence, but it takes on various colorings according to the context in which he appears. Basically he represents "the Lord as to Divine good or the priesthood." But before he became high priest, when he was assigned to Moses "for a mouth," he represents "the doctrine of what is good and true." We saw this representation in our lesson on the battle with Amalek. Whenever Moses and Aaron are named together, Moses represents the divine law as it is in its inward sense, and Aaron the same law in its literal sense. In our present chapter it is Aaron as high priest whose authority has been called into question. Since in that office he represents the Lord as to good, to question his authority is to refuse to recognize that "there is none good but one, that is, God." Whenever we find ourselves thinking of ourselves as good, finding fault with others because they are not doing what we do, assuming that our own motives are above reproach and that what we think the Bible ought to mean is what it must mean, we are rebelling against the high priesthood of Aaron. It is a sad commentary on our inherited nature that it is so hard for us to learn the lesson of humility which is taught throughout the Word and emphasized again and again in the writings. Swedenborg tells us that without innocence there can be no charity and, as we saw in our lesson on the Passover, he defines innocence as "to know, acknowledge, and believe, not with the mouth but with the heart, that nothing but evil is from one's self and that all good is from the Lord."

The rod is a symbol of power, specifically of the power exercised by truth. The twelve tribes represent all the goods and truths of the church in a complex. The rods of the tribes are symbols of the power exercised by these. We need them all, but each has its specific place and use, and their immediate importance varies with the circumstances in which we are from time to time. We learn this, for example, as we study the shifting order in which the tribes are named in different stories in the Word. But the office of the tribe of Levi remains constant. Levi is given no separate lot in the Holy Land but is established in cities in every part of it. When the rods of the twelve tribes were laid before the ark in the Holy of Holies, only the rod of Aaron for the tribe of Levi blossomed and bore fruit.

We are familiar with the correspondence of the seed—plant series.

The seed is truth from the Word, the tree itself represents a certain principle, the leaves thoughts from that principle, the blossoms particular thoughts leading to uses, the fruit the uses themselves. Nuts, because they last a long time, represent lasting goods. Of the almond Swedenborg says in @AC 5622: "This tree itself signifies in the spiritual sense a perception of interior truth which is from good, its 'blossom' interior truth which is from good, and its 'fruit' good of life thence derived." So the sign of Aaron's rod means that only the acknowledgment — from the heart — that the Lord alone is good can produce genuine good in the life. The laying of the twelve rods before the ark shows us that it is the Lord's judgment and not man's which counts.

The later laying up of Aaron's rod before the ark, "to be kept as a token against the rebels," tells us that the principle pictured by the fruitful rod should be taken to heart and never forgotten, so that we may not be guilty of setting ourselves up in judgment upon the Lord, the sin which caused the earth to open and swallow up Dathan and Abiram and fire from the Lord to consume Korah and the two hundred and fifty "princes of the assembly" who supported him in his rebellion. This is a lesson which is much needed today when some people are making a cult of the worship of humanity, claiming the innate goodness of human nature, attempting to build up a moral code without belief in revelation, and making external benefactions the test of goodness. The second of the two great commandments cannot be obeyed independently of the first; and the Lord's "new commandment" - "as I have loved you, that ye also love one another" — points with equal positiveness to the necessity of looking to the Lord for the understanding of what love to the neighbor involves and for the power to develop and exercise this love.

=== From the Writings of Swedenborg

@AC 5622[2-3]: "'Almonds' signify goods of life corresponding to the truths of good of the interior natural ... This tree itself signifies in the spiritual sense a perception of interior truth which is from good, its 'blossom' interior truth which is from good, and its 'fruit' good of life thence derived. In this sense the 'almond tree' is spoken of in Jeremiah (1:11-12) ... By the 'almonds which budded from the rod of Aaron for the tribe of Levi,' are also signified goods of charity or goods of life."
