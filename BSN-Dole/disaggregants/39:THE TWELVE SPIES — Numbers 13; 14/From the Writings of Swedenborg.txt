=== From the Writings of Swedenborg

@AC 5622[2-3]: "'Almonds' signify goods of life corresponding to the truths of good of the interior natural ... This tree itself signifies in the spiritual sense a perception of interior truth which is from good, its 'blossom' interior truth which is from good, and its 'fruit' good of life thence derived. In this sense the 'almond tree' is spoken of in Jeremiah (1:11-12) ... By the 'almonds which budded from the rod of Aaron for the tribe of Levi,' are also signified goods of charity or goods of life."
