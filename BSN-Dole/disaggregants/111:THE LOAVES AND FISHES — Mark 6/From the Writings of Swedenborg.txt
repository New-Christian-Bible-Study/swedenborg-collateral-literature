=== From the Writings of Swedenborg

@AC 5291: "It is the same where the Lord mentions these numbers in other places ... and also even in the historic facts that the Lord fed five thousand men with five loaves and two fishes, and that He commended them to sit down by hundreds and by fifties; and after they had eaten they took up twelve baskets of fragments. ... As these passages are historic it can hardly be believed that the numbers in them are significant ... when yet there is a secret in each number. For every detail happened of Providence, in order that Divine things might be represented."
