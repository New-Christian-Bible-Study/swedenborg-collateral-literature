=== Doctrinal Points
----
• All true life comes from the Lord.
• The wonderful meaning revealed in parts of the Bible which are puzzling in the letter is in itself sufficient proof that Swedenborg was illumined by the Lord.
• In the Most Ancient Church truth could be given men directly from heaven because their hearts were good.
• Marriage is eternal. A true marriage is the highest possible human state, but it can be attained only when both husband and wife are trying to serve the Lord together, each desiring the other's happiness more than his own.
