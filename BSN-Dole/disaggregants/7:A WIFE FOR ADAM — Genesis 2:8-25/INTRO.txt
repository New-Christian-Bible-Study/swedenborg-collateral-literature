=== Introduction

This in the letter is a very short and striking story. In all classes it might be well to start by rereading the entire assignment from the Word. Only the very youngest children will be likely to accept the literal story without question, and questions should be welcomed; for the more children question, the more interested they are. Swedenborg says (@AC 155): "The words 'a rib was built into a woman,' have more things inmostly concealed in them than it is possible for anyone ever to discover from the letter; for the Word is such that its inmost contents regard the Lord Himself and His kingdom, and from this comes all the life of the Word."
