Build your story around Joshua, and talk about the necessity for being brave enough to do right. Even little children need this lesson. Something of the review should be given, especially with reference to the decision of the people when the spies returned, and its consequences. The children can see the connection between this and the charge to Joshua and can be shown how it applies to their own lives.

Do you remember the name of the man who led the children of Israel out of Egypt and in all their long journey through the wilderness? It was Moses. Now they have come to the time when they are to be allowed to enter the Holy Land. They are encamped on the banks of the Jordan River, looking across at the beautiful land that has been promised to them for their home.

What had the children of Israel done at Kadesh?

What report had the spies brought back?

What had the people decided to do?

What was their punishment?

Which two spies had given different advice?

What was their reward?

Now Moses is not to lead them across the river, for Moses is dead. Their new leader is Joshua. He was one of the two spies who trusted the Lord and told the people they could take the Holy Land if they tried because the Lord would help them.

Joshua had been the leader of their army in all the battles they had fought in the wilderness; so the people trusted him.

What words from the Lord are repeated three times in our chapter? We have to be brave and strong to do right.

It is really cowardly to do wrong when we know better.

But there was one thing the Lord told Joshua he must remember. What was it?

This is something we must all remember to do all our lives, too.
