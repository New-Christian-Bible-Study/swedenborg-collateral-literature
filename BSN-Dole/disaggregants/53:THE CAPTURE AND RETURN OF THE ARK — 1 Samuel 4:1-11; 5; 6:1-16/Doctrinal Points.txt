=== Doctrinal Points

We should not ask the Lord to help us attain selfish ends.

The Word is a two—edged sword; it protects the good, but it also destroys those who do not wish to obey it.

Faith without love and good works ()"faith alone") is dead. When we have done wrong, we must acknowledge it and try to atone for it.
