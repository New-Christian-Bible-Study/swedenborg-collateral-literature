@AR 276: "Having every one of them harps, signifies confession of the Lord's Divine Human from spiritual truths. It is known that confessions of Jehovah were made in the temple at Jerusalem by singing, and at the same time by instruments of music which corresponded; the instruments were principally trumpets and timbrels, and psalteries and harps; the trumpets and timbrels corresponded to celestial goods and truths, and the psalteries and harps to spiritual goods and truths; the correspondences were with their sounds."

@AR 277: "And golden vials full of incense, signifies confession of the Lord's Divine Human from spiritual good. The reason why 'incense' signifies worship from spiritual goods, but in this instance confession from such goods, is because the principal worship in the Jewish and Israelitish Church consisted in sacrifices and incense; wherefore there were two altars, one for sacrifices and the other for incense; the latter altar was within the tabernacle, and was called the golden altar, but the former was without the tabernacle, and was called the altar of burnt offering; the reason was, because there are two kinds of goods, from which all worship exists, celestial good and spiritual good: celestial good is the good of love to the Lord, and spiritual good is the good of love towards the neighbor. Worship by sacrifices was worship from celestial good, and worship by incense was worship from spiritual good. ... Likewise in Matthew 2:11, 'The wise men from the east opened their treasures, and offered to the Lord recently born, gold, frankincense, and myrrh.' The reason why they offered these three was, because 'gold' signified celestial good, 'frankincense' spiritual good, and 'myrrh' natural good, and from these three goods all worship is made."
