The story is an easy one to tell. Be sure to tell the children that David was a shepherd and that his home was in Bethlehem, and to connect this with the Christmas story. Point out that Goliath was self-confident because of his size and equipment, but David conquered because he trusted in the Lord.

This man was David. He lived in Bethlehem. Do you know who else long afterward was born in Bethlehem? It was the Lord Jesus. Do you remember how the angels gave the news of the Lord's birth to the shepherds at Bethlehem? David was a shepherd, too. He was only a young boy when Saul anointed him, and it was to be many years before he actually became king.

The Philistines were still fighting the Israelites. They had with them a great giant named Goliath. He came out every day and offered to fight one of the Israelites, and the Philistines said that if anyone could kill Goliath, they would all serve the Israelites. But for a long time no one dared fight him.

Three of David's older brothers were in the army, and one day his father sent him to see how they were getting along and to take them some food from home. David saw Goliath come out and dare any Israelite to fight him. So David offered to go out against him. He was not afraid like the others because he trusted in the Lord. The Lord had already helped him to kill a lion and a bear which had been stealing some of his father's sheep, and he knew the Lord always helped those whose intentions are good.
