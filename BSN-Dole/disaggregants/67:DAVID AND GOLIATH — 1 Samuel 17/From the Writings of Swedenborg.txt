=== From the Writings of Swedenborg

@AE 781[12]; "Power was given to David to smite the lion and the bear that took away the sheep from the flock, because 'David' represented the Lord in reference to Divine truth in which those who are of His church are instructed; and a 'lion' signifies the power of spiritual Divine truth, and in the contrary sense, as here, the power of infernal falsity against Divine truth; while a 'bear' signifies the power of natural Divine truth, and in the contrary sense the power of falsity against that truth. But 'a sheep from the flock' signifies those who are of the Lord's church. And as this was represented, the power was given to David to smite the bear and the lion, to represent and signify the Lord's power to defend by His Divine truth His own in the church from the falsities of evil that are from hell.... But 'Goliath,' who was a philistine and was therefore called 'uncircumcised,' signifies such as are in truths without good; and truths without good are truths falsified, which in themselves are falsities."

@AE 817[6]; "All the wars that the sons of Israel waged against the Philistines represented the combats of the spiritual man with the natural man, and thence also the combats of truth conjoined with good against truth separated from good, which in itself is not truth but falsity. For truth separated from good is falsified in the idea of the thought respecting it, and for the reason that there is nothing spiritual present in the thought to enlighten it. For the same reason those who are in faith separated from charity have no truth, except merely in their speech or in their preaching from the Word, the idea of truth instantly perishing as soon as truth is thought about. Because this religion exists in the churches with all who love to live a natural life, so in the land of Canaan the Philistines were not subjugated, as the other nations of the land were, and consequently there were many battles with them. For all the historical things of the Word are representative of such things as pertain to the church; and all the nations of the land of Canaan represented things heretical confirming either the falsities of faith or the evils of the love; while the sons of Israel represented the truths of faith and the goods of love, and thus the church."
