=== From the Writings of Swedenborg

@AC 340: "With such as are called 'Cain' faith is recognized and acknowledged as a thing by itself ... Previously, they had been as it were ignorant of what faith is, because they had a perception of all the things of faith. But when they began to make a distinct doctrine of faith, they took the things they had a perception of and reduced them into doctrine, calling it 'I have gotten a man, Jehovah,' as if they had found out something new; and thus what was before inscribed on the heart became a mere matter of knowing."

@AC 362: "The doctrine of faith called 'Cain' is here described, which in consequence of separating faith from love, separated it also from charity, the offspring of love. Wherever there is any church, there arise heresies, because while men are intent on some particular article of faith they make that the main thing; for such is the nature of man's thought that while intent on some one thing he sets it before any other, especially when his imagination claims it as a discovery of his own, and when the love of self and of the world puff him up. Everything then seems to agree with and confirm it, until at last he will swear that it is so, even if it is false. Just in this way those called 'Cain' made faith more essential than love, and as they consequently lived without love, both the love of self and the phantasy thence derived conspired to confirm them in it."
