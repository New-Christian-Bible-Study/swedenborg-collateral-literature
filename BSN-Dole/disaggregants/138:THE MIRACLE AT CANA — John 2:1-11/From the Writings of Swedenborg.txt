=== From the Writings of Swedenborg

@AC 2649: "As the separation of the first human, which the Lord had from the mother, now follows, and at length the full removal of it, it is to be known that the Lord gradually and continually, even to the last of His life when He was glorified, separated from Himself and put off that which was merely human, namely, that which He derived from the mother, until at length He was no longer her son, but the Son of God, not only as to conception but also as to birth, and thus was one with the Father, and was Jehovah Himself. That He separated from Himself and put off all the human from the mother, so that He was no longer her son, is manifest from His words in John: 'When the wine failed, the mother of Jesus said unto him, They have no wine. Jesus saith unto her, Woman what [belongs] to me and to thee?*'"
