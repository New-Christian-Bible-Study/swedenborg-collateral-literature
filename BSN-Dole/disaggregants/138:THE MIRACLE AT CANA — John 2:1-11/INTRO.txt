=== INTRO

Because we ought to cover the main facts of the Lord's life each year and the Gospel of John does not give the external story of His birth and the period of His growing up, the teacher should begin with the question, "Who was the Lord?" and then review briefly the incidents of the Lord's birth, the flight into Egypt, the return to Nazareth, the Lord's appearance in the temple at the age of twelve, His baptism, and the forty days of temptation in the wilderness, drawing as much as possible from the pupils' memories. In all classes before taking up today's lesson be sure the class understands what a miracle is and why the Lord performed miracles.
