=== From the Writings of Swedenborg

@AC 2826[13]: "There is indeed a fear within all worship, but under another appearance and another condition, and this is holy fear. But holy fear is not so much fear of hell and of damnation, as it is of doing or thinking anything against the Lord and against the neighbor, and thus anything against the good of love and the truth of faith. It is an aversion, which is the boundary of the holy of love and the holy of faith on the one side; and as it is not a fear of hell and damnation, as before said, those have it who are in the good of faith; but those have less of it who are in the good of love, that is, who are in the Lord."
