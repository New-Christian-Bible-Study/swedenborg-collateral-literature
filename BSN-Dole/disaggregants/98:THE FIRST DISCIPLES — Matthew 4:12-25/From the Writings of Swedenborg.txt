=== From the Writings of Swedenborg

@AE 820-821: "The apostle Peter in the Word of the Evangelists means truth from good which is from the Lord, and also in the contrary sense, truth separated from good. And as truth is of faith and good is of charity, 'Peter' also means faith from charity, and again faith separated from charity. For the twelve apostles, like the twelve tribes of Israel, represented the church in respect to all things of it, thus in respect to truths and goods, since all truths are of faith, and goods are of love. In general, Peter, James, and John, represented faith, charity, and the works of charity; and this is why these three followed the Lord more than others ... when they were together they represented these as one. It is said as one, because without charity there is no faith that is faith; and without works there is no charity that is charity ... Peter was the first to be called by the Lord through Andrew, 'Andrew' signifying the obedience of faith; and afterwards James and John were called, and to these the Lord gave a new name. Likewise He took Peter, James, and John up into the mountain when He was transfigured; He also spoke with these three about the consummation of the age, and about His coming; they were also with the Lord in Gethsemane ... That the Lord gave a new name to James and John is evident in Mark: 'Jesus called James the son of Zebedee, and John the brother of James, and them he surnamed Boanerges, which is, sons of thunder' (3:17). 'Sons of thunder' signify truths from celestial good ... As John represented the church in respect to good works, and good works contain all things of love to the Lord and of charity towards the neighbor, John was more loved by the Lord than the others."
