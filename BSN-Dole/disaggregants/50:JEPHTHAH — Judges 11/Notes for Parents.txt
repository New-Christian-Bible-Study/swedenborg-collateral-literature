=== Notes for Parents

The book of Judges contains many interesting stories. Up to this time the children of Israel have had a series of outstanding leaders — Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Joseph, Moses, and Joshua — each one recognized by all the people as their divinely appointed head. But after Joshua's death, when they had come into possession of their long-desired homes in the Holy Land, each family settled down to build and plant for itself, and they became overconfident. Of this period it is said: "In those days there was no king in Israel, but every man did that which was right in his own eyes." (Judges 21:25) We may hear people today say, "If I do what I think is right, that is all that can be expected of me." This sounds good, but it overlooks the fact that people often think things are right which are actually wrong, and that we all need constant study of the Lord's truth to keep us in the right way.

The Israelites forgot the warning Moses had given them that they must be especially careful when they were prosperous not to forget the Lord. We all need the same warning. When we think we can rely on ourselves for guidance, the evils that are in us rise up and get the upper hand as the enemies of Israel did. We can be saved only by the Lord's help. He is always ready to show us the right way and to help us overcome our temptations if we ask Him. But we must be willing, as Jephthah was, to go all the way and really give up our own desires when we find that it is required of us.
