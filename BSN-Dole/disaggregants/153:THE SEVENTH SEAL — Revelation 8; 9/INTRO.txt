This is a rather difficult lesson to teach, because the interest is almost entirely in the details of the correspondence. It is suggested that in each of the three younger classes the teacher, after taking up the review, read from the Word at least chapter 8 and let questions and comments help to determine the direction of the discussion for the rest of the period.
