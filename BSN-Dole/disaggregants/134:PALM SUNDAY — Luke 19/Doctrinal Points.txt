=== Doctrinal Points
----
• The Lord as king is the divine truth ruling in our lives. The Lord was the only one who ever fully mastered the natural reason.
• Even the shortest stories in the Word have meanings which we can study forever.
• If we really accept the Lord, we shall want to correct our misdeeds.
• Humility is the ground of charity.
