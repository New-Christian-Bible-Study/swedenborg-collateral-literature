The reading should be divided into two parts: first the story of Zacchaeus as an illustration of what the Lord's presence in our lives should mean — always being fair to others, trying to make amends when we have done wrong, and helping other people whenever we can. Then, after the teacher has talked about that with the children, the story of the actual entry into Jerusalem. Begin the lesson with the reason for calling the day Palm Sunday, as the palm branches are not mentioned in Luke.

---
Today, the Sunday before Easter, is called Palm Sunday because on this day long ago the Lord rode into Jerusalem as a king, and the people broke off palm branches from the trees beside the road and threw them in His path for Him to ride over. In those days in Palestine they did not have many of the ways of riding which we have today — trains, automobiles, airplanes. They did not even have many horses in the Holy Land itself. Most of the people walked wherever they had to go. But it was the custom for kings and judges to ride on donkeys. The colt the Lord rode on was a donkey's colt. The Lord's followers and the people knew that this meant that He was coming as a king. They thought He was going to take command of their fighting men, overthrow the Roman governor, and make them a great nation again. But the Lord did not come to be that kind of king. His kingdom is in heaven, and in the heart and mind of everyone who loves Him and obeys His commandments. What He really wants to do for us is shown in the story of Zacchaeus.

Where did Zacchaeus live?

What was his occupation?

What was a publican?

Why could not Zacchaeus at first see the Lord?

What did he do in order to see Him?

Why did the Lord tell him to come down?

What did Zacchaeus say which showed his character?

If we receive the Lord into our hearts and minds, we shall all be helped to be unselfish and to help other people.
