=== From the Writings of Swedenborg

@AR 315-316: "A measure of wheat for a penny, and three measures of barley for a penny, signifies because the estimation of good and truth is so small as to be scarcely anything. These are signified because by 'a measure (choenix)' which was the measure and the quantity measured, is signified quality, as above (314); by 'wheat' and 'barley' is signified good and truth; and by a penny (denarius) which is a very small coin, that they are held in little or no estimation ... And hurt not the oil and the wine, signifies that it is provided by the Lord that the holy goods and truths, which lie interiorly concealed in the Word, shall not be violated and profaned. 'Oil' signifies the good of love, and 'wine' truth from that good, therefore 'oil' signifies holy good, and 'wine' holy truth."
