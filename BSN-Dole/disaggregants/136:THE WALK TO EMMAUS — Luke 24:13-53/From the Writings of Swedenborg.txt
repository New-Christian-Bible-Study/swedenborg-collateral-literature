=== From the Writings of Swedenborg

@AC 5620[14]: "The 'honeycomb and broiled fish' that the Lord ate with the disciples after His resurrection, also signified the external sense of the Word (the 'fish' as to its truth and the 'honeycomb' as to its pleasantness) ... It appears as if such things were not signified, because their having a piece of broiled fish and a honeycomb seems as if fortuitous; nevertheless it was of providence, and not only this, but also all other, even the least, of the things that occur in the Word. As such things were signified, therefore the Lord said of the Word that in it were written the things concerning Himself. Yet the things written of the Lord in the literal sense of the Old Testament are few; but those in its internal sense are all so written, for from this is the holiness of the Word. This is what is meant by His saying that 'all things must be fulfilled which are written in the law of Moses, and in the Prophets, and in the Psalms, concerning Him.'"
