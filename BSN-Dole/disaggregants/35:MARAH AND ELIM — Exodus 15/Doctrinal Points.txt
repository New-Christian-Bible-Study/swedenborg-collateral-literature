=== Doctrinal Points
----
• We can always rely on the Lord to protect us if we obey Him. The pillar of cloud and fire represents the letter of the Word in which the Lord's love glows even though it is partly concealed.
• Every difficulty we meet in life is an opportunity to increase our spiritual strength.
• A genuine desire to do what is good can make all our experiences sweet.
