=== Introduction

Cover briefly the story of Moses' return to Egypt and the events of the Exodus through the crossing of the Red Sea. Point out that one would think that after witnessing so many miracles the Israelites would never have doubted or disobeyed again. Yet the sense of deliverance, changing so soon to discouragement and murmuring is one of the keynotes of the whole wilderness story, and with the older classes this may be stressed as an experience common to all of us when we embark upon the effort to reform our lives according to the teaching of the Word. We are familiar with the expression "the ups and downs of life." This can be applied not only to changes in our worldly circumstances but to changes in our spiritual states as well. Our chapter starts with an "up" which is followed by a "down," and it ends in another "up." This gives an outline for taking up the lesson.
