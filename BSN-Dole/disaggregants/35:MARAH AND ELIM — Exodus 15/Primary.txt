This class should be able to get the whole outline of the story from Moses' return to Egypt to the encampment at Elim. Stress the pillar of cloud and fire, and compare it to the teachings of the Bible in our lives.

When the Israelites left their homes in Egypt, the Lord led them in a wonderful way. They saw a pillar of cloud in front of them which at night turned into a pillar of fire, so that they could always see it. It moved along before them and they followed it wherever it went, and when it stopped, they knew they must also stop and wait for it to move on.

First it led them to the Red Sea, and the Lord divided the waters by a miracle so that they could go across on dry ground. By this time Pharaoh had changed his mind and was following them to bring them back, but when his horses and chariots started across the Red Sea, the water closed and drowned them.

Moses and the people sang a song of triumph in praise of the Lord.

The journey to the Holy Land was not to be a short or an easy one. What was the first trouble they had after they crossed the Red Sea? How did the Lord help them?

What did they find there?
