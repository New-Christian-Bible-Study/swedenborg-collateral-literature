=== Introduction

This lesson requires more preparation on the part of the teacher than some. The teacher should be sufficiently familiar with the whole story of Jacob (Genesis 25:19 through Genesis 34) so that he can review it rather fully. He should also think out carefully the particular points in the lesson for the day which he thinks can be presented most interestingly and usefully to his class.
