=== For Younger Children

[.underline]#*Teacher Notes:*# 
The younger children will not profit by so complete a review of Jacob's life as the older ones. In the introduction, dwell on Jacob's dream more than on the rest of the story, as the children may have some recollection of it, and it connects naturally with the return to Bethel.

---
Jacob was his mother Rebekah's favorite.

Once she saved him from Esau's anger by persuading Isaac to send him on a long visit to her brother Laban in Haran.

Jacob was welcomed by his uncle Laban and was so satisfied in Haran that he stayed there for twenty years. In those days people had forgotten that it is wrong for a man to have more than one wife at a time. Jacob married two of Laban's daughters, Leah and Rachel, and he had two other wives, who were the servants of Leah and Rachel — you may remember how Abraham had a son by Hagar, Sarah's Egyptian handmaid.

Eleven sons and a daughter were born to Jacob in Haran. The eleventh son was Joseph.

After Joseph's birth Jacob decided to go home with his family.

He stopped at Bethel, where he had had a wonderful dream on his way to Haran.

What did the Lord promise him there?

What son was born to him near Bethlehem? Who died there?

Joseph and Benjamin were Rachel's only children. Where did Jacob find his father?

How old was Isaac when he died?

Esau and Jacob had become friends again.

Try to remember that the Lord gave Jacob a new name — Israel.

That is how the descendants of Jacob came to be called "the children of Israel."
