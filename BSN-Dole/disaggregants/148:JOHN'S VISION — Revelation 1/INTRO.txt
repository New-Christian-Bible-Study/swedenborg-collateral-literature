=== INTRO

With all the older classes the historical connection with the Gospels should be made. In A.D. 70, some forty years after the resurrection and ascension of the Lord, Jerusalem and the temple were finally destroyed by the Romans under Titus, and the Christians were dispersed and driven into Asia Minor and beyond. So the early churches developed in Asia Minor. Be sure the children make the distinction between John the Baptist and the Apostle John. Also call their attention to the other name for the book of Revelation — the Apocalypse, the Greek word meaning unveiling or revelation — as they will hear it used frequently.
