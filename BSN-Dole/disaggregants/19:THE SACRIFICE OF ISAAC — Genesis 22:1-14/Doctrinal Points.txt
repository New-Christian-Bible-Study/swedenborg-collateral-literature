=== Doctrinal Points

The Lord never tempts us. Temptation comes from our selfish desires. The Lord merely permits temptation to come when we make it necessary.

The Word is written in the language of appearances in order to reach the evil as well as the good.

Our first faith in the Lord is often mixed up with a lot of false ideas.

The Lord will always give us the power to do right if we persist in obeying His commands as we are given to see them from the Word.
