Review the last lesson. Remind the children that the Lord had promised Abraham that his descendants should inherit the land. This makes a good background for the story of how Abraham and Sarah longed for a son and were given Isaac in their old age. It will show how much depended upon Isaac, and how dear he was to Abraham.
