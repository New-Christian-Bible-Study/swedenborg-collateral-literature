[.underline]#*Teacher Notes:*# 
Stress the reason why the Lord's spirit departed from Saul, the character of David, and Jonathan as the connecting link in the story. In telling about Uzzah, point out that Uzzah should have known better than to try to steady the ark. Tell the children that after the ark was set up in Jerusalem, Jerusalem became the center of the life of the nation.

---
The second king of Israel was David. David lived in Bethlehem, the same place where the Lord was born long afterward. The Lord sent Samuel to Bethlehem to anoint David, who was then hardly more than a boy. And after David was anointed, the spirit of the Lord was with him instead of with Saul. You have heard the story of how David killed the giant Goliath.

David was a shepherd boy, but he was also a warrior.

The people praised him so much that Saul became jealous and tried to kill him.

But Jonathan and David had become fast friends, and Jonathan saved him.

David had to run away and live in hiding, but he was loyal to Saul as long as Saul lived.

Finally, however, Saul and Jonathan were both killed in battle by the Philistines, and then David became king.

During his reign he conquered all the enemies of Israel. This was because he always obeyed the Lord.

He captured Jerusalem and made it his capital.

Then he wanted to bring the ark to Jerusalem.

The ark was at Kirjath-jearim, also called Baale.

How did they take it from Kirjath-jearim?

What did Uzzah do?

What happened to him?

Why was his act so bad?

Into whose house was the ark taken for a time?

What did it do for the household?

What effect did this have on David?

David went before the ark all the way to Jerusalem with singing and dancing, stopping every so often to offer sacrifices to the Lord. This is how the ark finally came back to be the very center of the life of the Israelites.

David built a new tabernacle for the ark on Mount Zion, one of the hills in the city of Jerusalem.
