=== Introduction

The transition from Saul to David should be centered about Jonathan. The loyalty of both David and Jonathan to Saul, in spite of Saul's jealousy and hatred, should be stressed, and the fact that David could win victories because, like Jonathan, he trusted and obeyed the Lord. The sin of Uzzah and its punishment is the most dramatic part of the lesson for today, but it should not be allowed to dwarf the importance of the actual bringing of the ark to Jerusalem.
