=== Doctrinal Points

In the Bible the East is a symbol of nearness to the Lord.

The first seven chapters of the Bible were taken from the Ancient Word and are pure symbol stories.

If we build on our own ideas instead of on truth from the Word, we are always in a state of confusion.

The desire to set ourselves above others is destructive.
