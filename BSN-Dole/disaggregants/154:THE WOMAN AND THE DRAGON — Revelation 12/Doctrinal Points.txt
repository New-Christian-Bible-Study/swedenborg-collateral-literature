The great red dragon of materialism is always present, testing our sincerity by trying to get us to ignore divine truth.

If we study our doctrines and remain true to them in our daily life, the dragon cannot harm us.

Even the New Church is not free from the temptation to live by the doctrine of "faith alone."
