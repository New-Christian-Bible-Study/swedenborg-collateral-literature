=== From the Writings of Swedenborg

@AC 5280: "In order that man may be regenerated he must first be reformed, and this is done by means of the truths of faith; for he has to learn from the Word and from doctrine therefrom what good is. The knowledges of good from the Word, or from doctrine therefrom, are called the truths of faith, because all the truths of faith spring from good, and flow to good, for they look to good as an end. This is the first state, and is called the state of reformation. During their childhood and youth most of those who are in the church, are introduced into this state, and yet few are regenerated; for most in the church learn the truths of faith or the knowledges of good for the sake of reputation and honor, and also for gain; and when the truths of faith have been introduced by means of these loves, the man cannot be born anew or regenerated until these loves have been removed. In order that they may be removed, the man is let into a state of temptation, and this in the following manner. The loves referred to are excited by the infernal crew ... but the affections of truth and good that have been insinuated from infancy ... are then excited by angels. The result is a conflict ... which is felt in the man as temptation."
