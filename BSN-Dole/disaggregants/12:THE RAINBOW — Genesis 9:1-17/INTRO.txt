The review of the temptation by the serpent leads directly into the story of the decline of the Most Ancient Church and the necessity of the Lord's stepping in to save the remnant of good people from destruction. The story of the ark and the flood can be told briefly with the emphasis this time on the Lord's new promise and on the rainbow as the token of it.
