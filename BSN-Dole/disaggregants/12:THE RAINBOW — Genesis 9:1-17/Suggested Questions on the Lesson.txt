== THE TOWER OF BABEL — Genesis 11:1-9

With all classes above Primary the teacher will need to prepare in his mind a brief summary of the story of the flood and of Noah. Present the flood as the inevitable end of those who turn away from the Lord and rely on their own judgment, and the saving of Noah as the Lord's provision for the preservation of the race He had created. Then show how history repeated itself because of human conceit and folly and so introduce the lesson for today. The teacher should have in mind an example of a modern building of a Tower of Babel which will come close to the experience of his particular class.
