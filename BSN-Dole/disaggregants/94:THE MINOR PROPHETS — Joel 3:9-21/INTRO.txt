=== Introduction

This is a survey lesson primarily for background. All the classes should know the difference between the major and the minor prophets, how many of each there were, and where their books are found in the Bible. Even the youngest children should be able to say that a prophet is one who speaks for the Lord, and all above the Primaries should know the general tenor of a prophet's message.
