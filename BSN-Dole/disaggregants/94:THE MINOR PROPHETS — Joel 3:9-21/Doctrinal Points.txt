=== Doctrinal Points

It is not the Lord who judges us; we judge ourselves by our own choices.

Anyone who reads the Bible believing it to be the Word of God and wishing to live as the Lord would have him live receives enlightenment from it.

Faith is not genuine unless we try to live according to the truth we learn.

Any selfish feeling, if unacknowledged and unchecked, leads to more and more selfishness.
