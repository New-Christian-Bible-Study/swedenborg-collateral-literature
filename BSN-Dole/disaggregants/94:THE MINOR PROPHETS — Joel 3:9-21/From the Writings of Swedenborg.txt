=== From the Writings of Swedenborg

Doctrine of the @DSS, n. 57: "Enlightenment is from the Lord alone, and exists with those who love truths because they are truths and make them of use for life. With others there is no enlightenment in the Word. The reason why enlightenment is from the Lord alone is that the Lord is in all things of the Word. The reason why enlightenment exists with those who love truths because they are truths and make them of use for life, is that such are in the Lord and the Lord in them. For the Lord is His own Divine truth, and when this is loved because it is Divine truth (and it is loved when it is made of use), the Lord is in it with the man ... 'Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.' These are they who are in enlightenment when they are reading the Word, and to whom the Word shines and is translucent."
