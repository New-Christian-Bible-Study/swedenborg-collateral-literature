== INTRODUCTION

=== INTRO

For anyone who loves the church there is no more rewarding experience than teaching a Sunday School class. Like every other worthwhile undertaking it has its problems, its difficulties, and its disappointments; it demands time, effort, and self-sacrifice. But the teacher feels that he is performing a use second only to that of the minister. He is constantly inspired and stimulated by the responsibility of guiding young, open minds into an understanding of spiritual things. His own grasp of the Word and the teachings of the church grows and deepens from Sunday to Sunday. And his understanding of individuals other than himself, as it develops through this experience, enables him to be more and more helpful to friends and acquaintances as well as to his pupils. All these things take time; so let no one feel discouraged if he fails to find immediate enjoyment and success in the work. Be patient, and count the failures as stepping stones.

The Teacher's Equipment

Every Sunday School teacher should have a teacher's Bible.

Cross-references and varying translations in the center column, a concordance at the back, tables and historical summaries, Bible dictionary, and maps are invaluable. There are many collateral works which have been produced for the special purpose of aiding teachers and students. Your minister can make these available to you and advise you as to their use. Information concerning special visual aids may be obtained from the Sunday School Association's committee on visual aids.

Preparing the Lesson

The teacher should realize that more preparation is necessary than merely reading through the lesson notes for his class. There is no substitute for personal study and thought. The first essential is to study the Bible story. In this, too, it is not enough for the teacher to read the lesson assignment for the day, for this is always somewhat curtailed and leaves many details and connections to be filled in by more extended reading. If chapters have been omitted, the teacher should be familiar with at least their general content and should know as much as possible of the history and relationships of the characters involved in the lesson and the location of the places mentioned. His own interest in the lesson will be deepened by looking up the cross-references, and often he will find points in which his class also will be interested. The meanings of the Hebrew names (found in a concordance) are significant, whether they are of persons or of places.

Next, the pupils' notes for all ages should be read, as this course is planned in such a way that both the understanding of the lesson and the knowledge of its background build up progressively from Beginner to Adult notes. [In this publication of these lesson materials, the notes for the Beginner and Primary children have been combined.] 

If possible, the teacher's personal study should be supplemented by a teachers' meeting under the supervision of the minister, who can supply a great deal of helpful information and also make suggestions as to the presentation of the lesson and give advice concerning specific class problems as they appear. Also, the exchange of ideas among the teachers at a weekly meeting has great educative value.

Finally, the teacher should think about the lesson in its relation to his own particular class and, with the help of the teachers' notes, decide just how he is going to present it. In this try to think always of what will be most valuable and helpful to your pupils rather than of what has proved most interesting and stimulating to yourself. Remember that their background and their states are quite different from yours. Pray for help in presenting the lesson. Our failures come most often either from lack of proper preparation, or from obtruding our own ideas between the Word and the children and trying to impress them with ourselves rather than with the lesson. Remember that the power for good is not in yourself but in the Word.

Subject Matter

The primary task of the church is "to keep the Divine among men." And we know that our access to the Divine is through the Word. Therefore the first goal of our Sunday Schools should be to acquaint the pupils with the letter of the Word. There is no other agency except the Sunday School which can be counted on to perform this task. The schools do not do it, and even in the New Church few homes attempt it in any systematic way. The child is taught morals and certain common ethical values by many of his contacts outside of the church, but only in Sunday School can we be sure he will be taught to build his character on the Word of God. The child whose experience does not include systematic instruction in the letter of the Word is cheated of his birthright. So the Word is our primary subject matter. Our supplementary material is found in the writings of the Second Coming which enable us to understand the Word. All our other objectives may be carried out in connection with this study. The stories of the Word are not mere fairy tales or fables or ancient history: they are messages from the Lord to us — our life textbook. As teachers we must feel their power and see their applications, and always try to inspire in the children the love of hearing and studying the Word.

Suggested Goals for the Sunday School

1. Knowledge of the letter of the Word.
2. Introductory knowledge of the spiritual sense of the Word.
3. A working knowledge of New Church doctrines.
4. A desire for worship and an understanding of its forms.
5. Instruction in the Christian way of life in emotion, thought, and conduct.

This outline does not imply that there should be separate lessons in doctrine, in worship, and in Christian living, but that these objectives should all be in the teacher's mind as he prepares and teaches the lesson, so that the particular Bible story being taught will come to the children with present meaning and urgency, and so that no opportunity will be wasted of furthering the spiritual development of the children.

To achieve these goals the teacher of each age group should have in mind specific things under each heading which he may hope to impart to the children of his class before they pass on to the next age group. A further definition of these requires that we consider each age group in turn.

The Age Groups

Traditionally the children in our Sunday Schools are divided into five age groups: Beginner (ages 3, 4, and 5), Primary (ages 6, 7, and 8), Junior (ages 9, 10, and 11), Intermediate (ages 12, 13, and 14), and Senior (ages 15, 16, and 17). At the age of eighteen the young person should be ready for the Adult class.

Children vary, of course, in their individual mental and emotional development at any given age, and the occasional slow or advanced child in a group presents a special problem, and may need to be placed temporarily with another age group. But in general there are certain characteristics of each age group which are fairly constant.

Beginner: Beginners are still in the infant states of trust and love, and are peculiarly sensitive to the atmosphere of the class. We know that some of the deepest and most lasting impressions are made on children at this age — without the child's knowing how or why. Even though the children may not at the time be able to recall — or at least to express — any of the specific facts we give them, we know that these facts together with the states in which they were received are stored up in the children's minds as "remains" on which heavenly attitudes are built. The teacher's own attitude toward the Lord, the Word, and the Church will largely determine the kind of impression which the Sunday School makes on little children. We should never feel that these little ones are in our care merely to be "looked after" and amused. If we do, the church will be to them just another place where they may play. Instead, their first contacts with the church should give them a sense of wonder and reverence. They should be happy, but happy in a special way. We cannot teach this by words, but only by the example of our own feeling.

So the specific goals for this group are simple and general:

1. The Word. Although each lesson should be taught as it comes, special pains should be taken to impress upon the children the Creation story, the story of the Garden of Eden, the story of the flood, stories of Bible children, and the Christmas, Palm Sunday, and Easter stories.

2. Spiritual Sense. Nothing specific should be given at this age level, but if the teacher has the correspondence in mind in discussing things in nature, what he says will inevitably be put in such a way as to prepare for later instruction. For example, the plants and animals of the Bible will be emphasized.

3. Doctrine. Jesus is our heavenly Father. The world was made by Him. The Bible is His book. He wants us to be good. He takes care of us.

4. Worship. The church is the Lord's house. Teach the Lord's Prayer and other simple Bible verses. Teach the simpler Sunday School hymns. Develop a reverent feeling about the Sunday School service.

5. Christian Living. We should be kind and loving. We should learn what is right and good. We should obey our parents.

Primary: Primary children retain much of the same responsiveness to atmosphere, but they are beginning to acquire in school tools of learning, and they need to be allowed to exercise their new tools and abilities and to be kept busy. This does not mean just handwork. Their minds need to be kept busy, too. They like to be able to answer questions, and they like to memorize. They can stand any amount of repetition of the lesson — in fact that is the way in which it is impressed upon them. Pictures and other visual aids should never be chosen just to give the children something to do, but always as aids to the lesson; for at this age children are quick to recognize discrepancies between a picture and what the teacher is telling them, and if pictures and handwork make a false impression, it is hard to correct it later. This is one reason why Bible stories should never be embroidered by the teacher's imagination. Let the child's own imagination do the embroidering, if it will, but do not encourage it.

The specific goals for this group may be:

1. The Word. The emphasis should be on the literal story, with the attempt to fix important names in the memory. Read as much as possible of the story from the Word itself. Teach the Blessings and other verses.
2. Spiritual Sense. Suggest the correspondence of the sun to the Lord and of its heat and light to His love and wisdom. Bring this out a little at a time by speaking of the effects of the sun in the world and of the Lord in our souls.
3. Doctrine. The Lord is always with us and knows our thoughts. He teaches us through His Word. Talk about heaven and the life that leads to it.
4. Worship. Reverence for the Lord's house. Care of the Word. Why the Word is on the altar. The Sunday School service, with participation in its conduct.
5. Christian Living. 
(a) Moral principles: honesty, obedience, industry, trustworthiness. 
(b) Where our good and bad thoughts come from, and their power. 
(c) What unselfishness is, with practical guidance in unselfish conduct.

Junior: Children of this age are hungry for factual information. They are beginning to be somewhat self-assertive, and if their minds are not fed, and fed rather fast, they become restless and look about for some other occupation. They are interested in maps and in pictures of places and people — real pictures, not "baby work." The teacher should be particularly careful not to "talk down" to them, but to respect their growing mental ability. Their questions are usually intensely practical and the teacher needs to study as much as possible of the geographic and cultural background of the lesson. Frequent reviews help to hold the interest of the class, and this is also an excellent age at which to teach the children how to look up verses in the Bible and how to use Bible helps.

1. The Word. The literal story in detail, with emphasis on geography and attention to background, especially the past history and the relationships of the people in the story. Learn the Commandments and several Psalms.
2. Spiritual Sense. Some simple correspondences, such as high and low, heat and light, animal, vegetable, and mineral, gold, silver, and brass, water, stone, bread and wine, the seed-plant series. Quite often the general inner meaning of the story can be suggested. Watch the notes for such opportunities.
3. Doctrine. The doctrine of use. The meaning of baptism. The origin of evil. The Lord's part and ours in our getting to heaven.
4. Worship. The parts of the church building. The service. Why we come to church.
5. Christian Living. Application of religious principles to the children's everyday problems. How to live together.

Intermediate: This is in some ways the most difficult age to teach with any degree of satisfaction. It is indeed an "in-between" age. The pupils are still really children, and yet they like to think of themselves as "grown-up." They should be taken very seriously from Sunday to Sunday, but the teacher himself should not worry too much about any untoward attitudes they may express, for they experiment and change constantly. They need mental challenge, teaching which makes them think in new terms and new ways, the feeling that the teacher believes them capable of understanding rather deep and difficult ideas. And it is surprising how much they do understand and remember. Anyone who has taught this age group over a period of years has had the experience of being reminded by a former pupil of some teaching of his which he was sure no one in his class had taken in when it was given. At this age pupils may be apparently quite unresponsive and yet may be taking in a great deal for private consideration. Their occasional questions are searching ones. The teacher needs much more knowledge of the doctrinal and philosophical aspects of the church teachings than one might imagine.

1. The Word. In the literal story place the emphasis on individual character and historical sequence. Stress daily reading of the Word and the use of memorizing for our individual needs.
2. Spiritual Sense. The general internal sense of each lesson, with as much detail as time and the ability of the class permit.
3. Doctrine. Preparation for confirmation. Doctrine of the Lord, of the Word, of Life, the Second Coming, the Lord's Supper, the Church.
4. Worship. Function of the church. Duty to the church. History of the New Church. Learn the Faith. Study the church service and principles of chanting.
5. Christian Living. What true leadership is. Responsibility in home and community. Boy-girl relationships (if indicated).

Senior: While these young people are still adolescents, they have passed beyond the stage of wishful thinking about adult life and are really trying to live as independent human beings. They are genuinely grasping at principles by which they may live good lives. The teacher should take for granted that their intentions are uniformly good and their mistakes mistakes of judgment, and should give them all the help possible both spiritual and natural. In school they are exposed to all sorts of civic and social attitudes and theories, and they need as clear and complete an understanding as possible of the basic philosophy of the New Church. "Jerusalem is builded as a city that is compact together," not as a helpful idea here and there, but a consistent doctrine of life which can guide our thinking in every field. The teacher of the Seniors has a very great opportunity and a very serious responsibility, for if he is able to lead these seeking young people to the treasure which the Lord has given us in His Second Coming, he is doing both them and the church the greatest service possible.

1. The Word. Emphasize throughout the Lord's part in the Bible story.
2. Spiritual Sense. More detailed study of the internal sense of the lessons, with some suggestion of the celestial sense.
3. Doctrine. Doctrine of degrees, the spiritual world, repentance, reformation, and regeneration, doctrine of marriage. Start them reading Swedenborg.
4. Worship. Deeper study of public worship and home devotions. Study of prayer.
5. Christian Living. Application of religious principles to adolescent problems. Some consideration of the cause of community and world problems.

Adult: One of the first duties of the teacher of the Adult class is to appraise his particular class as to their basic knowledge of the Bible and of the teachings of the church. It is unfortunately true that in most of our Sunday Schools the adults are fully as much in need as the children of instruction in this field. There are usually two or three well-read laymen and women in a Society, and sometimes these tend to monopolize the discussion and to carry it at a level which is beyond the understanding of the rest of the class. Such a situation also discourages the young people from graduating into the Adult class, and if the Sunday School is taking the place it should in the church life, there are always new people, often young couples, becoming interested who have not been brought up in the New Church and especially need instruction of the informal discussion type, based on the Bible. The attitude of the teacher should be that every member of the class is to be taken seriously and that each is able to make worthwhile contributions to the discussion. He should also be able to establish the fact that we are never any of us too old or too wise to need further Bible and doctrinal study, and that the Sunday School is the place especially for Bible study. Even with the Adults the Bible lesson is the first thing to cover each Sunday, and discussion of current topics and of special problems should grow out of the Bible lesson — not be substituted for it. The five goals should be kept in mind, the particular methods of fulfilling them being determined by the states and needs of the members of the class. Perhaps one more goal should be added for the Adults: that of developing the ability to communicate to others the New Church understanding of the Word and the New Church answers to individual and social problems. Every New Churchman should be a missionary, not merely for the sake of building up the church organization (although that in itself is a worthy endeavor), but because we have so much help to give, and the responsibility of giving it wherever and whenever it is needed is laid upon each one of us. We cannot fulfill this responsibility without constant study and intelligent thought about the problem of communication. This need should always be in the teacher's mind.
