=== Doctrinal Points

It is the Lord who gives us all good things, and we must keep this fact always in mind.

The books between 2 Kings and Psalms do not have an inner sense.

It is truth from the Lord which turns us from our natural selfishness. "Fear of the Lord" does not mean fear of punishment.

Our hearts need cleansing as well as our thoughts and conduct.
