== TRUST IN THE LORD — Psalm 91

The lesson may be introduced by showing the position of the book of Psalms in the Bible — between the historical books and the Prophets — and this is a good opportunity to remind the younger children that all the books in our Bible are not part of the Word. Then point out that the Psalms were written not to portray any historical sequence but to express ever-recurring states of feeling and thought. All classes above the Primary should be told the belief of the Jews about the Psalms and why we know that they are a part of the Word.
