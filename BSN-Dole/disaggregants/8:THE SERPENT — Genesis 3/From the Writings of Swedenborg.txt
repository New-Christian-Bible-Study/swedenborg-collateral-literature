=== From the Writings of Swedenborg

@AC 194-195: "By the 'serpent' is here meant the sensuous part of man in which he trusts; by the 'wild animal of the field,' here, as before, every affection of the external man; by the 'woman,' man's Own; by the serpent's saying, 'Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree?' that they began to doubt. The subject here treated of is the third posterity of the Most Ancient Church, which began not to believe in things revealed unless they saw and felt that they were so. Their first state, that it was one of doubt, is described in this and the next following verse. The most ancient people did not compare all things in man to beasts and birds, but so denominated them; and this their customary manner of speaking remained even in the Ancient Church after the flood, and preserved among the prophets. The sensuous things in man they called 'serpents,' because as serpents live close to the earth, so sensuous things are those next to the body. Hence also reasonings concerning the mysteries of faith, founded on the evidence of the senses, were called by them the 'poison of a serpent,' and the reasoners themselves 'serpents'; and because such persons reason much from the sensuous, that is, from visible things (such as are things terrestrial, corporeal, mundane, and natural), it is said that 'the serpent was more subtle than any wild animal of the field.'"
