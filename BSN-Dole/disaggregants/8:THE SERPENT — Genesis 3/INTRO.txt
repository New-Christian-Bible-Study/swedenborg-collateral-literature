=== INTRO

In all classes the connection with past material may be made by reviewing the order of creation, pointing out the difference between men and animals, and then speaking of the Garden of Eden as the beautiful state in which men came to dwell and in which they might have remained if they had been obedient and had not begun to trust in self instead of in the Lord. Speak of the two trees and of the Lord's command with regard to the tree of knowledge of good and evil.
