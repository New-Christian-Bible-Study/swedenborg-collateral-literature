=== From the Writings of Swedenborg

@AC 9182[10]: "That 'the sons of the wedding do not mourn so long as the bridegroom is with them' denotes that they are in a blessed and happy state, thus with the Lord, when they are in truths conjoined with their good; 'they shall fast when the bridegroom is taken away from them' denotes that they are in an unhappy state when good is no longer conjoined with truths."

@AE 376[28]: [referring to new wine and old bottles] "This comparison, like all others in the Word, is from correspondences, 'wine' signifying truth, 'old wine' the truth of the old or Jewish Church, and 'wineskins" things that contain, 'old wine—skins' the statutes and judgments of the Jewish Church, and 'fresh wine—skins' the precepts and commandments of the Lord. That the statutes and judgments of the Jewish Church, which related especially to sacrifices and representative worship, are not in agreement with the truths of the Christian Church is meant by 'they do not put new wine into old wine—skins, else the wine—skins burst and the wine is spilled; but they put new wine into fresh wine—skins, and both are preserved together' (Matthew 9:17)."
