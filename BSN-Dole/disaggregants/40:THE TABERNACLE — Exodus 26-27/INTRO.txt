=== INTRO

The children of Israel reached Sinai three months after they left Egypt, and they remained there almost a year. The departure does not come until Numbers 10:11. The pupils should get a clear idea of this year at Sinai and what it accomplished. The giving of the laws and especially the establishment of the external forms of worship welded the people into a nation.
