=== From the Writings of Swedenborg

@AC 9643: "The reason why the bases were of 'silver,' and the planks were overlaid with 'gold,' was that by the 'planks' is signified good, and by the 'bases' truth, and good has power and thus support through truth ... also that 'gold' signifies good, and 'silver' truth ... That good has power through truth, is because truth is the form of good ... for where there is quality, there is form."
