The older children should be able to take all three stories, although the most time should be spent on the raising of Jairus' daughter. The Lord's power to help and the necessity of faith in it and of going to Him for help will coordinate the lesson. The lesson contained in verse 39 is the most important one.

What were the three parts of the Lord's ministry?

Who were the scribes and Pharisees?

Which disciple was a publican or tax gatherer?

What did the Lord say about new wine? 

What did He mean?

What did He say about the sabbath? 

Our lesson today is about miracles.

Do you remember what a miracle is? It is a wonderful thing done by the Lord to teach us a lesson. The Lord, when He was in the world, did many miracles, and they were of different kinds. See if you can remember some of them we have read about. Do you remember how the Lord healed the man who had the palsy, and the man whose hand was withered? Besides these, He made blind people see and cured leprosy — a terrible disease that many people had in those times — and He multiplied a few loaves and fishes so that they fed five thousand people, and He calmed a storm at sea.

In our lesson for today He does still more wonderful things. He cast out evil spirits from a man whom they had possessed. And He brought back to life a little girl who had died.

Who was the little girl's father?

When they came to the house of Jairus, what did the Lord tell the mourners? Did they believe Him?

How did He bring her back to life?

This miracle teaches us that all life is from the Lord and He controls it. And we never really die.

The world we see around us now is just our beginning — a world given us to live in for a few years so that we may learn what is right and get rid of some of our selfish ways in order that we may be happy in heaven.
