@DP 250[5]: "In the spiritual sense 'the mammon of unrighteousness' means the knowledges of truth and good possessed by the evil, which they employ solely in acquiring for themselves dignities and wealth; out of these knowledges the good, or 'the sons of light,' must make to themselves friends; and these are what will receive them into the eternal tabernacles."
