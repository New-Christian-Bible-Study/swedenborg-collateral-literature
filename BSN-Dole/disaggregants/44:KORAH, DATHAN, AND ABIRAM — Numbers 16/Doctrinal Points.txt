=== Doctrinal Points

The Lord is the source of all creation and sustains us from moment to moment.

The Word is given for our guidance, and we cannot safely set up our own judgment in place of its teachings.

True faith is not just saying we believe in God or even just going through the forms of worship.

Any good thing we do from selfish motives is not really good.

Charity is love to the Lord and the neighbor in the heart.
