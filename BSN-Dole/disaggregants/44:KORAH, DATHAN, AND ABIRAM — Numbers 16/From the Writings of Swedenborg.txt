=== From the Writings of Swedenborg

@AE 3246: "Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, with their company, were swallowed up by the earth, although they took fire from the altar and burnt incense, because 'their murmuring against Moses and Aaron' signified profanation of the good of celestial love; for 'Moses' and 'Aaron' represented the Lord; and 'to murmur' (that is, to rebel) against the Lord and at the same time to perform holy offices, is profanation; but as they took the fire from the altar, that fire was cast out, and their censers were made into a covering for the altar."
