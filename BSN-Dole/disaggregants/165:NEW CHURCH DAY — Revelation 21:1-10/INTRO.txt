(@TCR 791, 846-847)

This lesson is an additional special lesson to be used following the regular season, on June 19, or the nearest Sunday to that date. It is based on Swedenborg's statement in @TCR 791 that "after this work [the book @TCR ] was completed, the Lord called together His twelve disciples who followed Him in the world; and the next day He sent them all forth throughout the whole spiritual world to preach the Gospel that the Lord God Jesus Christ reigns ... This took place on the nineteenth of June, 1770 ... "
