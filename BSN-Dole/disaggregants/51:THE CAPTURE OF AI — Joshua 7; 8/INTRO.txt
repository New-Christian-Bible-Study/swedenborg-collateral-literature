=== Introduction

The teacher will need to review carefully chapters 2-6 and prepare himself to tell briefly the story of the events contained in those chapters. The emphasis in this summary should be on the fact that the Lord was showing the people His power to give them victory, and warning them against trusting in themselves or allowing the thought to linger in their minds that their victories were in any sense theirs. Then make the transition to today's lesson by calling attention to the Lord's command as to the spoils of Jericho.
