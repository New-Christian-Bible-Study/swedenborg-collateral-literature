=== Doctrinal Points
----
• The Lord wants us to enjoy the good things of this world, but not to put them first. He created the world for our happiness.
• We must give up the thought that we can know the truth of ourselves without constantly learning it from the Lord through the Word.
• We must examine our motives systematically according to the truth.
