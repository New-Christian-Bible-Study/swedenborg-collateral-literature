=== From the Writings of Swedenborg

@AC 5622[2]: "Almonds signify goods of life corresponding to the truths of good of the interior natural ... This tree itself signifies in the spiritual sense a perception of interior truth which is from good, its 'blossom' interior truth which is from good, and its 'fruit' good of life thence derived. In this sense the almond tree is spoken of in Jeremiah ... a 'rod' denotes power; 'almond tree' the perception of interior truth."

@AC 6000: "Revelations were made either by dreams, or by night visions, or by day visions, or by speech within the man, or by speech without him from angels that were seen, and also by speech without him from angels that were not seen."

@AC 8408[3]: "Here a 'boiling pot' denotes a people whom falsities have taken possession of; 'the north' denotes the sensuous and corporeal of man from which evil springs. The end of the church is here treated of, when the external, consequently the sensuous and corporeal, and with these falsity and evil, rule; for the Lord's church goes successively from internal to external, and then expires."
