@AE 706[16]: "This sign was given to king Hezekiah as an attestation that the Lord would defend him and Jerusalem from the king of Assyria ... that king signifying the perverted rational destroying all things of the church; therefore this sign represented also a new church that must be established by the Lord, but here that the time would be extended beyond that indicated to Ahaz just above; 'bringing back the shadow that had gone down on the steps of Ahaz before the sun' signifies a holding back of the time when this should be done, 'the steps of Ahaz' signifying a time, here until the coming of the Lord, and the 'shadow' signifying the progress of time from the rising to the setting; that the shadow 'should be brought backwards ten degrees' signifies the extension of the time for many years still, 'ten' signifying many, and the 'sun' which should go back signifying the Lord's coming. But this shall be further illustrated. The Lord's coming took place when the Jewish church was at an end, that is, when there was no good or truth left in it. ... The entire period of the duration of the Jewish church was represented by 'the steps of Ahaz,' its beginning by the first step, which is when the sun is in its rising, and its end by the last when it is at its setting. This makes evident that by 'the bringing back of the shadow' from the setting towards the rising means the extension of the time. This would take place 'in the steps of Ahaz,' because Ahaz was a wicked king, and profaned the holy things of the church, consequently if his successors had done the same, the end of that church would have quickly come: but as Hezekiah was an upright king the time was extended, for on that account the iniquity of that nation was not so soon to reach its consummation, that is, its end."
