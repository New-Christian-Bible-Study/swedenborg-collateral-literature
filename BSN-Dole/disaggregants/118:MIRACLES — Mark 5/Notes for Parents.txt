=== Notes for Parents

Have you ever said to one of your children, "I don't know what is the matter with you today; you just seem possessed"? We say it of ourselves, too, sometimes, when we have let temper or resentment get the better of us: "I don't know what possessed me to act that way." We know really what possessed our child, or us: it was the devil, which is just another name for the influence of evil in our hearts and minds. Have you ever felt that someone you loved very much who had passed into the other life was near you giving you a feeling of comfort and help? The spiritual world is not somewhere far off. It is around us all the time and close to our minds and hearts. But there are both good and bad people there, and both try to influence us. We are free to choose our spiritual companions, sometimes much freer than we are to choose our earthly ones. This is because the Lord, when He was in the world, conquered the hells and set them in order under His control, and He does not let them tempt us beyond our power to resist if we choose to resist. He keeps us free. But at the time when He came into the world, it was possible for evil spirits to possess a person against his will. Part of the lesson the children have for today is about such a person. It is a powerful story which gives us a great deal to think about.

The rest of the lesson tells of two other miracles: of a woman who was healed by just touching the Lord's garments, and of a child — the daughter of one of the rulers of the Jews — whom the Lord raised from the dead. The Lord is life itself, and all life and health are from Him. And none of us ever really dies. He said of the child, "The damsel is not dead, but sleepeth." He woke her again in this world. When we go to sleep for the last time, He wakes us in the other world.

The Lord performed all His miracles to teach us of things He is able to do for our souls if we are willing to believe in Him and obey Him. The choice is ours.
