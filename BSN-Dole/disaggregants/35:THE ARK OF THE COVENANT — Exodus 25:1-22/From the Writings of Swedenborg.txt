=== From the Writings of Swedenborg

@AC 9509: "And thou shalt make two cherubs. That this signifies no admission and approach to the Lord except through the good of love, is evident from the signification of 'cherubs,' as being guard and providence lest the Lord should be approached except through the good of love.

As this was signified by the 'cherubs,' they were placed over the propitiatory* that was upon the ark, and therefore they were made of solid gold; for by the 'ark' is signified heaven where the Lord is, and by 'gold,' the good of love. That there is no approach to the Lord except through the good of love, is because love is spiritual conjunction, and all good is of love. Therefore those who are in the good of love to the Lord are brought in to Him in heaven, because they are conjoined with Him, and so are those who are in the good of love toward the neighbor."

[*translated "mercy seat" in the King James Version. (Both the Vulgate and Schmidius [Latin] use "propitiatory." The New American Version, following the Vulgate, is the only English edition I am aware of which uses "propitiatory." -Editor]
