=== From the Writings of Swedenborg

@AE 600[14]: "The faces of the man and the lion were seen 'on the right side' because 'man' signifies Divine truth in light and intelligence, and a 'lion' Divine truth in power therefrom, such as it is in heaven in the south; and the face of the ox was seen 'on the left side,' to signify the good of truth in obscurity, for an 'ox' signifies the good of the natural man, which is in obscurity in those who in heaven dwell in the north."

@AC 3901[5]: "That the 'face of an eagle' is circumspection and consequently Providence is manifest; for the cherubs represented by the living creatures in Ezekiel signify the Providence of the Lord lest man should enter into the mysteries of faith from himself and his own rational ... This shows that when it is predicated of a man, the 'eagle' is in the internal sense the rational; and this for the reason that the eagle flies high, and from above has a wide view of the things that are below."
