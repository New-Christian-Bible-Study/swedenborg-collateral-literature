=== Introduction

Review the background material concerning the four Major Prophets. Be sure that the pupils know what a prophet is, why these four were called "Major," and that they can name the four. Even with the Primaries it is useful to say the names and have the children repeat them after you. Young children like to say new words, and most children will find the Bible names easy to speak and to remember if they become familiar with their sound early.
