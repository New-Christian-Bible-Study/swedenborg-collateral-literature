=== INTRO

The teacher should refresh his memory on the story of Jacob's experiences in Haran. It will be better to emphasize the length of time — twenty years — in Haran and the sons born there than to retell the story of Leah and Rachel, which cannot be explained briefly. Mention the Lord's promise to Jacob at Bethel and Jacob's longing to return to the Holy Land.
