=== Notes for Parents

David, the second great king of Israel, was very different from Saul. He had grown up as a shepherd boy in Bethlehem and, although he also became a great warrior, he never lost the attitude of childlike trust and reliance upon the Lord which is pictured by sheep and shepherds, and which is essential to our spiritual development. "Verily, I say unto you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child shall in no wise enter therein." David was also a player on the harp or lyre, and it was through him that many of the Psalms were written.

After David had come to the throne and established his capital at Jerusalem, he knew that he should bring the ark there because the ark was meant to be the center of Jewish life. The commandments are to be written on our hearts. For twenty years the ark had been at the city of Kirjath-jearim, where it had been taken from Bethshemesh after the Philistines returned it.

The strange story of Uzzah which is part of our lesson for today has often troubled people because to us it might seem quite natural and right that when the oxen shook the cart on which the ark was being carried, Uzzah should have put out his hand to steady it. It was natural but it was not right. The ark was the holiest thing the Jews possessed. Again and again its power had been demonstrated in their history. But Uzzah was thinking of it as just an ordinary chest, as his act showed. All the Levites knew that only the anointed priests were to touch it, but the people needed to be reminded of its holiness and power. The tables of stone on which the commandments had been written by the finger of God at Sinai were in the ark. The Lord's power comes to us only as we keep the commandments. They are not man-made laws, but the laws of God. We cannot tamper with them and we should trust them completely. They stand forever by their own power.
