=== Introduction

In order to connect with the last lesson, the point to emphasize is that Jacob and his family went down into Egypt to be fed and protected by Joseph just for a time, and then yielded to the temptation to stay there in comfort instead of going back where they belonged. It is another example of taking the easy way instead of the right way — like the choice Lot made. Reference to Lot will also give an opportunity for a brief review, which is always useful. Even the littlest children can get the idea that the thing which looks easiest is not always the right thing, and that to choose anything but the right thing always leads to trouble.
