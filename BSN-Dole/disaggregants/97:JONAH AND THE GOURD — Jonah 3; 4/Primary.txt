First tell the children in simple terms the whole story of the first three chapters. Then read them chapter 4 and draw from it the lesson that we should never want to see people suffer even if we do not like them. The moral lesson is the wrongness of Jonah's attitude toward the Ninevites, and the Lord's love for all people.

Way back in the days of the kings of Israel there lived a prophet whose name was Jonah. A prophet is one who speaks for the Lord. Jonah had been giving the Lord's message faithfully to the kings of Israel for some time when one day the Lord gave him a command which he did not want to obey. The Lord told him to go to the great city of Nineveh, the capital of Assyria, and rebuke the people there for their sins. But Jonah, like most of his countrymen, despised anyone who was not an Israelite; so he did not want to go to Nineveh. He tried to run away and hide from the Lord. Do you ever try to run away and hide when your mother wants you to do something you don't want to do?

Do you remember what happened to the ship in which he sailed?

What happened to Jonah?

How did the Lord save him?

Then Jonah was ready to take the Lord's message to Nineveh.

The people of Nineveh had never had a prophet from the Lord before to tell them what was right.

They listened to Jonah and believed him and repented of their sins.

So the Lord forgave them and did not destroy the city as Jonah had foretold.

You would think that Jonah would have been pleased at this, wouldn't you? But you see, Jonah did not like the people of Nineveh and he wanted to see them punished. Did you ever feel this way about some child you didn't like, and wish the teacher would punish him?

Where did Jonah go to see what would happen?

What grew up to give him shade?

Then what happened to the gourd?

How did the Lord use this to teach Jonah how wrong his feeling had been?
