=== INTRO

The lesson for today cannot be taught without first being sure that the class knows and understands the first part of the story, that of Jonah and the great fish. The teachers should therefore review the first two chapters of Jonah and also read the summary given in the Junior notes, which answers questions commonly raised concerning the story of Jonah. New Church people should have a clear understanding of this story because it is so often questioned and even ridiculed.
