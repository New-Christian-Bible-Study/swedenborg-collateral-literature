=== From the Writings of Swedenborg

@AC 9372: "In the Word there are many who represent the Lord in respect to truth Divine, or in respect to the Word; but chief among them are Moses, Elijah, Elisha, and John the Baptist ... by the wilderness of Judaea in which John was is signified the state in which the Word was at the time when the Lord came into the world ... the Word in the ultimate, or such as it is in the external form in which it appears before man in the world, is described by the 'clothing' and 'food' of John the Baptist ... by 'camel's hair' are signified memory—truths such as appear there before a man in the world; by the 'leathern girdle' is signified the external bond connecting and keeping in order all the interior things ... by 'locusts' are signified ultimate or most general truths; and by 'wild honey,' their pleasantness." 

@TCR 677-684: "The first use of baptism is introduction into the Christian Church, and at the same time insertion among Christians in the spiritual world ... That it is merely a sign of introduction into the church, is made clear by the baptizing of infants, who are wholly destitute of reason and are no more able to receive anything pertaining to faith than the young branches of a tree ... But in the heavens infants are introduced by baptism into the Christian heaven, and angels are there assigned them by the Lord, to take care of them ... The second use of baptism is, that the Christian may know and acknowledge the Lord Jesus Christ, the Redeemer and Savior, and follow Him ... 'The name of the Lord Jesus Christ' means in the Word nothing else than acknowledgment of Him, and a life according to His commandments ... The third use of baptism, which is the final use, is that man may be regenerated. This is the essential use for the sake of which baptism exists, and thus the final one."
