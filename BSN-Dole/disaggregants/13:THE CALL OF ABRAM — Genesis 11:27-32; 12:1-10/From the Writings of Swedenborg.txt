=== From the Writings of Swedenborg

@AC 1461: "And Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn. That this signifies instruction in knowledges from the Word, is evident from the signification of 'Egypt,' and from the signification of 'sojourning.' That 'Egypt' signifies the memory-knowledge of knowledges, and that 'to sojourn' signifies to be instructed, will be seen presently. ... The external man is corporeal and sensuous; nor does it receive anything celestial and spiritual unless knowledges are implanted in it, as in ground; for in these celestial things can have their recipient vessels. But the knowledges must be from the Word. Knowledges from the Word are such that they are open from the Lord Himself; for the Word itself is from the Lord through heaven, and the Lord's life is in all things of the Word, both in general and in particular, although it does not so appear in the external form."
