=== From the Writings of Swedenborg

@TCR 754: "The church is consummated by various means, especially by such things as cause falsity to appear as truth; and when falsity appears to be truth, good that is essentially good, such as is called spiritual good, is no longer possible. The good that is then believed to be good is merely natural good, such as is brought forth by a moral life. The chief cause of the consummation of truth and of good along with it, is the two natural loves that are diametrically opposed to the two spiritual loves, and that are called the love of self and the love of the world. Love of self when it is predominant is the opposite of love to God, and love of the world when it is predominant is the opposite of love to the neighbor. Love of self is a wishing well to oneself alone, and not to any other except for the sake of self; and the same is true of love of the world; and these loves when they are fostered spread like gangrene through the body, gradually destroying every part of it. That such love has invaded the churches is manifest from Babylon and the way it is described (Genesis 11:1-9; Isaiah 13, 14, 47; Jeremiah 1; Daniel 2:31-47, 3:1-7, seq., 6:8-28, 7:1-14; and Revelation 17 and 18 from beginning to end of both)."
