[.underline]#*Teacher Notes:*# 
Review briefly the birth and call of Moses, but be sure to leave time for reading part of the current lesson from the Word. Read at least Exodus 8:1-15. If you can leave sufficient time, the list of the ten plagues may be read to the class from the Junior Pupils' notes, although you cannot discuss any but the second in detail.

---
The children of Israel stayed on in Egypt after Jacob and Joseph had died, and they had many children and became a very numerous people. After a while the Egyptians became jealous of these strangers in their land and began to be afraid that they were enemies. The Pharaohs forgot Joseph and all he had done for Egypt. They began to make slaves of the Hebrews. So then the Hebrews remembered their own land and wanted to go back there. The Lord told Moses that he was the one who should lead them out of Egypt.

He gave Moses power to work miracles, and his brother Aaron to help him.

Pharaoh did not want to let the Hebrews go.

It took ten terrible plagues to make him consent to their departure.

In the first plague Moses turned all the waters of Egypt to blood so that the people could not drink it.

What was the second plague?

How did Moses and Aaron bring it about?

Who else showed the same power to bring frogs out of the river?

But the first and second plagues were the only ones in which the magicians could do what Moses did.

What did Pharaoh ask Moses to do?

What did Pharaoh promise?

Did he keep his promise?

We ourselves often go on stubbornly doing wrong in spite of the lessons we have had.

It was only after the tenth plague, when all the firstborn in the land died in one night, that Pharaoh actually let the Hebrews go.

Don't you think he was very foolish? Did you ever suffer from being naughty and then go right back and do the same thing over again? We are sometimes just as foolish as Pharaoh was.
