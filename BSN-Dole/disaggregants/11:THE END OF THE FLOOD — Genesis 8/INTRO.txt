=== Introduction

Every teacher should read for background the chapters which have been omitted, Genesis 5 and 7, and should study the brief explanations of this transition period in the notes for the various age levels. From the Junior level up, emphasis should be placed on the difference between the Most Ancient Church and the Ancient Church as to the nature of the people. Throughout our study of the Bible there will be many references to these two churches and to the "celestial" and "spiritual" types, and the children should become familiar with them. The simplest illustrations come from their knowledge of the difference between a baby and an older child.
