=== Doctrinal Points

When a church perverts the truth given it, the Lord always prepares the way for the reception of truth in a new form.

The Ancient Word, which preceded our Word, was given for the instruction of the Ancient Church.

After man's will became wholly perverted, the Lord separated the will and the understanding so that a new will could be formed in man's understanding through the development of conscience.

We must form the habit of doing right before the Lord can give us a love for doing it.
