== THE MESSAGES TO THE CHURCHES — Revelation 2; 3

There are some general facts concerning John's messages to the seven churches which can be presented to all but the youngest children. These have to do with the similarities of all the messages: 
(1) Each picks out a particular feature of the vision of the Lord; 
(2) Each commends the church for what it is doing that is good; 
(3) Each rebukes the church for its particular evil and shows what the resulting punishment will be if the evil persists; 
(4) Each offers a special promise if the evil is put away; 
(5) Each closes with the words, "He that hath an ear, etc.," leaving the church free to choose whether it will obey or not.

=== Doctrinal Points

We can see the rightness and wrongness in our lives to the extent that we are "in charity and faith."

The church in itself is one, but various according to reception.

The Lord is always standing at the door knocking. It is up to us to open it to Him.

=== Notes for Parents

We remember that the Lord told John that the seven golden lampstands among which He stood were "the seven churches" and that the seven stars in His right hand were "the angels of the seven churches." The word angel, we recall, means "messenger." Now He gives John a special message for each of the churches.

The seven churches mentioned were actual churches. They had been founded in Asia Minor by the early Christians, and had developed especially after the destruction of Jerusalem by the Romans in A.D. 70, when the remaining apostles and their followers were dispersed. The messages sent to them by the Lord through John show us plainly that the early Christians were much like ourselves, prone to differences of opinion, to worldliness, and to spiritual laziness. We have already seen how little even the twelve apostles understood of the Lord's teachings, and how easily they were induced to save themselves rather than to remain faithful. Although the resurrection gave them new faith and courage and some of them afterward suffered martyrdom for their faith, they did not suddenly become perfect and infallible. The Christian Church almost from its beginning went astray because it looked to men for its teaching rather than to the Lord, relying on the Epistles rather than on the Gospels, and in later times basing its whole structure on decisions arrived at by men at the Council of Nicea three hundred years after the time of the Lord. We need to go to the four Gospels and the book of Revelation for our knowledge of what the Lord actually teaches.

But the messages to the seven churches are of more than mere historical interest to us. The seven churches show us seven types of people. Each one of us has his own special qualities and abilities and also his own special weaknesses and faults. The Lord sees both, and in these messages He says to us, "Hold fast the good which has developed in you, but recognize also the evil and repent and change your ways, lest you lose the place prepared for you in heaven." Each one of the churches was given a special promise if it was faithful, as each one of us has a special heavenly character which it is possible for him to attain. And we might notice that the church of Laodicea, which received the most severe condemnation because it was "lukewarm," was promised the greatest reward for overcoming its fault. This is because their fault was the hardest to overcome. Is not this same "lukewarmness" in spiritual things the besetting sin of most of us? We acknowledge what we ought to do but we excuse ourselves for not doing it. We take the easy way. The Lord is always standing at the door of our souls. We often hear His knock. But how often we are too busy with our own affairs to open the door!

The Lord has a special message for each one of us. He tells us plainly that if we go our own way, we shall find only unhappiness in the end, and that if we follow His way, it will lead us to eternal joy; but He leaves us free to make our own choice. He says to each one of us, as He said to each of the seven churches, "He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches."

=== Primary

Spend a little time recalling to the children's minds John's vision of the Lord, ending with the explanation given in the letter of the stars and lampstands. Then tell them that there really were seven churches and that the Lord gave John a different message for each one. Read them the following verses, stopping at each to make the connection with John's vision: Revelation 2:1, 8, 12, 18 and Revelation 3:1, 7, 14. Then tell them that the closed door is the little door which we close in our minds when we are naughty and do not want to hear what is right, and make the connection between this and the memory verse. Also call attention to the five similarities in all the messages, and illustrate by reading the messages to the churches in Philadelphia and Laodicea (Revelation 3:7-22).

The book we are studying now is about a wonderful vision which was given to the apostle John when he was an old man.

Where was John at this time?

What was the first thing he saw?

What did the Lord say about Himself?

To how many churches was John given messages?

They were the seven Christian churches which had been founded in Asia Minor, over which John was the head.

Our lesson today is about messages which the Lord gave to John for these seven churches — a different message for each church.

The Lord sees what is in the heart of every one of us — what is bad and what is good — and does His best to lead every one of us to heaven. We all have good things in us but we also have bad ones, and we cannot get to heaven unless we are willing to be told when we are doing wrong and to admit it and try to change. So the Lord told each of the seven churches what its good qualities were and also what its bad ones were and what it must do to be truly heavenly. Finally He made each church, if it would be faithful, a special beautiful promise.

Like the seven churches, each one of us does some good things and some bad ones.

So the Lord has a special message for each of us, and we need to listen and obey.

And for each of us He has some special beautiful thing in store, if we are faithful.

What two doors are mentioned in our lesson? (Revelation 3:8, 20) The open door is the door of heaven.

The closed door is the one we close in our minds when we do not want to hear what the Lord is trying to tell us.

Revelation 3:20 is a very important one, for each one of us has to choose whether he will just do as he pleases — in which case he cannot possibly get to heaven — or take the right way, the Lord's way, which is harder but which leads to true happiness. The Lord is always standing near us ready to come into our minds and hearts if we will just open the door to Him.

=== Junior

The Juniors are old enough to understand that the messages are to us as well as to the churches of long ago, although they will be interested in looking at a map which shows the location of those churches and the relative position of Asia Minor and the Holy Land. Be sure to point out Patmos. Something of the spiritual meaning can be given simply by pointing out that we are all different and that the Lord treats each of us in a special way, that we all have some good things in us which the Lord tries to encourage and some bad ones which He points out to us so that we can fight them, and that the choice of what we become must be our own.

Where was the vision recorded in the book of Revelation given?

To whom was it given and when?

What was the beginning of the vision?

What was John commanded to do?

What were the seven stars said to be?

What were the seven lampstands?

Find these seven cities on a map. John was in charge of the church at Ephesus, but he was probably head of all seven. Find the island to which he had been banished when he received his vision.

The business of every church on earth is to uphold the truth the Lord has given it, so that it will give light to men's minds. So each church is like a lampstand. And also each church has a special spiritual character, a living spirit which connects it with heaven and the Lord; this is its "angel" - its "messenger." It was to this living spirit in each church that John's message was given.

The seven churches were different from each other just as the churches of today are, and just as individual Christians are. Each had some virtues and some faults, and the Lord commended the virtues and pointed out the faults, and to each church He gave a special promise if it would overcome its faults. Philadelphia was described as the most faithful of them all, though there were some in it who were hypocrites. The door of heaven was said to be open to the people of this church and it was told only to hold fast its truth and goodness. Notice that those who did hold fast were to take the name "New Jerusalem."

Laodicea, on the other hand, was severely rebuked because it was "lukewarm." We are lukewarm Christians when we slide along through life not trying very hard to learn what the Lord would have us do, but always taking the way that seems to us easiest at the moment. It is to such people that the Lord says, "Behold, I stand at the door, and knock," because they are keeping the doors of their minds closed to the truths which they need. But if they will open the door and change their ways, He makes them one of the best of the promises. This is because it is very hard to overcome the temptation to take the easy way, and victory over that temptation brings a high reward. If you will stop to think, you will realize that it is the people who are willing to work hard and to stand firmly for what is right who become great.

Now read Revelation 3:13. We all have ears, haven't we? But do we always hear what is said to us? Did you ever try to hear — for instance when your mother wanted you to stop playing and do something for her? All people who really want to be good must listen and obey.

=== Intermediate

Develop in some detail, with illustrations from any one of the seven messages, the general outline suggested, and emphasize the fact that we are all different and that the Lord expects each of us to do his best to develop his individual capacities and to fight his particular temptations. Encourage the young people to read the two chapters carefully at home for themselves.

Everything in the Word has, in addition to its literal sense, three major inner meanings, one within the other, relating (1) to the spiritual history of the human race, (2) to the development of our own individual souls, and (3) to the life of the Lord. This is just as true of the book of Revelation as of the Old Testament and the Gospels.

In the first sense, which is called the internal historical sense, the seven churches in Asia Minor picture various types of Christian organizations which developed as a result of the spread of the Gospel by the apostles and early Christian leaders and the various types which will exist in every age. In the second sense, which is called the spiritual sense, they picture the various states in which each one of us may find himself at one time or another as to his religious life. In the third sense, which is called the celestial sense, they picture the Lord's dealing with churches or individuals in these various states, the accommodation of His love and wisdom to meet all human needs and to lead all men to the highest states which they will freely choose to attain.

In general we can see that the Lord is telling each of us in what ways he is right and in what ways wrong. This rightness or wrongness depends on how far we are "in charity and faith"; that is, how far we have the Lord's unselfish love in our hearts and the truths of His word in our minds. And these must go hand in hand. If we have more love than truth or if we have more truth than love, we fall into certain temptations and need to repent and restore the true balance. And if we recognize and fight our temptations, we prepare ourselves for the very place in heaven which will give us the greatest happiness.

Notice that in each of the messages the Lord describes Himself in a slightly different way. All the attributes He mentions are details of John's original vision of Him, but in each He stresses just the divine qualities which will most appeal to the people in the state described by that particular church. For example, to the church of Philadelphia — which, Swedenborg tells us, pictures those "who are in truths from good from the Lord" — the things mentioned (Revelation 3:7) all have to do with truth, and it said of these people that the "door" is open before them. But the church of Laodicea, which pictures those who "alternately believe from themselves, and from the Word, and so profane holy things," is reminded that the Lord is the source of all things and told to open the doors of their minds to Him. The temptation to trust in our own wisdom instead of in the Lord's truth is the deepest of all temptations, but if we overcome it, the Lord will guide all things for our eternal welfare. This is what is meant by the promise, "To him that overcometh will I give to sit with me in my throne."

Just as the Lord presents Himself in a different way to each type of person — each of the seven churches — so the promise of reward for victory is a different promise for each. Each of us has his own possibilities, his own weaknesses, and his own temptations; no two people are ever just alike. The Lord knows each one of us through and through and deals with each in a little different way, to give each the best chance of attaining the stature and place for which he was created. And He says to each one of us: "He that hath ears to hear, let him hear."

=== Basic Correspondences

Ephesus = those who regard truths of doctrine, not good of life
Smyrna = in good of life but falsities as to doctrine
Pergamos = place everything in good works, nothing in truths
Thyatira = both faith from charity and faith separate from charity
Sardis = dead worship
Philadelphia = in truths from good 
Laodicea = those who profane holy things

=== Senior

Study with the class the meaning of each of the seven churches as stated in the quotation in their notes, discussing different types of churches in the world today and different types of minds, in the effort to help the young people to see themselves and other people more clearly. Study the message to Laodicea in more detail, showing them what is meant by "lukewarm" in their religion.

In the @AR Swedenborg says of the opening chapter of the book of Revelation: "This Revelation is from the Lord alone; and it is received by those who will be in His New Church, which is the New Jerusalem, and who acknowledge the Lord as the God of heaven and earth."

And he tells us there briefly, as well as in detail elsewhere, that the messages to the seven churches are messages to the churches in the Christian world: "To those there who primarily regard truths of doctrine, and not goods of life, who are meant by the Ephesian Church. To those who are in goods as to life, and in falsities as to doctrine; who are meant by the church of Smyrna. To those there who place all of the church in good works, and not anything in truths; who are meant by the church in Pergamos. And to those who are in faith from charity, as also to them that are in faith separated from charity; who are meant by the church in Thyatira. All these are called to the New Church, which is the New Jerusalem. ... They in the Christian world who are in dead worship, which is without charity and faith, who are described by the church in Sardis. They who are in truths from good from the Lord; who are described by the church in Philadelphia. They who alternately believe from themselves, and from the Word, and so profane holy things; who are described by the church in Laodicea. All these likewise are called to the New Church of the Lord." The general meaning of the messages and their application to us could not be stated more briefly and clearly than this.

With this quotation at hand each of us can study the messages in detail for himself. In making this study note that in each case the Lord identifies Himself by signs which, by correspondence, would touch a responsive chord in the minds of people of that particular character; that He calls attention to the special good qualities and the special temptations of each; and that in return for fidelity He promises a reward exactly suited to the highest desire of those of that type. Swedenborg tells us that the heavens are divided into many societies, each society being made up of congenial people and each society performing a particular use to the whole heaven which no other could perform. No two societies are alike, yet all work together in harmony because all accept the Lord alone as their God and desire above everything else to do His will.

Further we need to remember that each one of us is, as Paul said, "a temple," or as Swedenborg says, "a church in its least form." The messages are not only to groups associated into churches but to each individual who desires to be good or who in any way recognizes the necessity of religion. So as we study these two chapters, we are studying ourselves, our particular virtues and weaknesses, the particular aspect of the Lord we need to dwell on, and the particular goal of character toward which we should strive. Each one of us is a child of God and has a direct personal relationship to Him, a special set of faculties and possibilities, and a special place to fill both in this world and in heaven. Our highest happiness will be in the attainment of this place and use.

But we must also realize that the Lord has left it to our own free choice whether or not we shall strive for and attain this place. Our freedom of choice is the thing which the Lord has given us as the essential human quality, which distinguishes man from the animals, and in everything He does He guards this freedom of choice for us. It is an inner freedom — we know that many things prevent our carrying out in external life all our desires. But each of us is free to desire and to think as he pleases and to try to accomplish his own desires. Our fundamental choice is between self and the Lord. If we choose to put self first, we shall reject belief in the Lord and in His Word, so closing our ears to His warning voice. If we choose to believe in the Lord, we shall study the Word to find the way of life, and we shall find it. So each of the seven messages ends with the words, "He that hath ears to hear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches."

=== Adult

This is a lesson in which the teacher may well use the passages from the writings quoted in the Adult notes as the basis for discussion. Call attention to the fact that, although the seven types are discussed with reference to the beginning and mission of the New Church, they already existed before the end of the first century A.D. To find the truth for the Christian Church we must go to the Gospels, not to the decisions of later church leaders.

In the first chapter of Revelation we are given the clue to the meaning of our lesson for today: "The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches: and the seven candlesticks which thou sawest are the seven churches." In numbers 65 and 66 of the @AR Swedenborg says: "The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches, signifies the New Church in the heavens, which is the New Heaven. The church is in the heavens equally as on the earth; for the Word is in the heavens equally as it is on the earth, and there are doctrines from it, and preachings from it ... In the spiritual world there appears an expanse full of stars, as in the natural world, and this appearance is from the angelic societies in heaven. Each society there shines like a star before those who are below; hence they know in what situation the angelic societies are ... by 'angels of the seven churches,' is meant the entire church in the heavens, consequently the New Heaven in the aggregate. And the seven lampstands which thou sawest are the seven churches, signifies the New Church on earth, which is the New Jerusalem descending from the Lord out of the New Heaven ... by 'the seven lampstands' are not meant seven churches, but the church in the aggregate, which in itself is one, but various according to reception. Those varieties may be compared to the various jewels in the crown of a king; and they may also be compared to the various members and organs in a perfect body, which yet make one. The perfection of every form exists from various things being suitably arranged in their order. Hence it is, that the whole New Church is described as to its varieties by 'the seven churches.'"

This is the ideal picture, and we note that although the church is one, there are varieties within it which are distinct, as are the societies in the heaven with which they are associated. We should keep this in mind today when we are considering the ecumenical movement. Also we should note that it is not said that the churches on earth were ideal in themselves, for the messages actually point out how far each had fallen from the ideal. And although it was undoubtedly true that the Christian organizations which by the end of the first century after the Advent had developed in the seven cities of Asia Minor were actually in the various states described in the letter of the Word, in the internal historical sense our attention is directed to the states existing in the various branches of the first Christian Church as it was at the time of the Second Coming and the conditions on which the people of these branches might be expected to respond to the invitation to the New Church. And in the spiritual sense we are to think of the various types of Christians today to whom the message of the New Church is offered and to the same types as we find them also in the organized New Church.

We should note the similarity in pattern of all seven messages: (1) the presentation of the Lord in the particular aspect which would appeal most strongly to the type of person addressed; (2) the Lord's commendation of the good characteristics of that type; (3) the pointing out of the evils to which that type is most subject, and the command to recognize these and repent; (4) the promise to each of that particular "place in the sun" which it is possible for him to attain if he does repent and regenerate; (5) the reminder that our reception or rejection of the message will be of our own free choice: "He that hath ears to hear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches."

Swedenborg's own words — from the contents at the beginning of chapters 2 and 3 of the Apocalypse Revealed — are the clearest and briefest possible statement of the distinct meaning of the seven churches: "To the churches in the Christian world: To those there who primarily regard truths of doctrine and not good of life, who are meant by the church of Ephesus. To those there who are in goods as to life and in falsities as to the doctrine, who are meant by the church of Smyrna. To those there who place the all of the church in good works, and not anything in truths, who are meant by the church in Pergamos. To those there who are in faith from charity, as also to those who are in faith separated from charity, who are meant by the church in Thyatira. ... (Chapter 3) This chapter treats of those in the Christian world who are in dead worship, which is without charity and faith; who are described by the church in Sardis. Those who are in truths from good from the Lord; who are described by the church in Philadelphia. Those who alternately believe from themselves, and from the Word, and thus profane holy things; who are described by the church in Laodicea. All of these likewise are called to the New Church of the Lord."

The last sentence points to the fact that each of the seven emphases can be useful in the New Church, indeed is necessary to the perfection of the church. It is only when one aspect is emphasized at the expense of the others that condemnation is pronounced. It is useful to any church to have within it some whose primary interest is in doctrine, some who emphasize good will, some who insist on good works, some who wish to define the relation between faith and charity, some who love the ritual of the church, some who are well—balanced Christians, and some whose shortcomings keep the church reminded of the necessity of self-dedication and sincere, steady devotion. But if the church is to work together in harmony and perform its full use each of these types must recognize and applaud the contribution of all the others. None must assume that his own emphasis is sufficient in itself. One of the most noticeable characteristics of both the Word and the writings is the constant insistence on the balanced life. For example, the parable of the Good Samaritan (Luke 10:30-37), which can so easily be interpreted to mean that external good works are the all-important thing, is immediately followed in the Word by the incident of Mary and Martha (Luke 10:38-42) in which Martha, who was "cumbered about much serving," is told that Mary, in sitting at the Lord's feet hearing His words, has chosen "the better part." And in the writings statements on the importance of truth and those on the importance of good works are so constantly alternated that one cannot exalt one at the expense of the other except by lifting sentences or parts of sentences entirely out of their context.

The most scathing condemnation of all is meted out to the church of Laodicea which is "lukewarm." And yet to him who overcometh in Laodicea is promised the highest reward of all, "to sit with me in my throne." Does not this point to the fact that the most universal and persistent of our temptations and the most difficult to overcome is the temptation to take the easy way, to refuse to take up wholeheartedly and courageously the Lord's cause, to see how little responsibility we can assume instead of how much, how small a contribution we can "get by with" instead of how much we can give, to travel the path of religion with our ear to the ground! It is to this church that the Lord says, "Behold, I stand at the door, and knock." To look for the easy and popular way closes the door against the Lord's truth. Read what Jeremiah says of Moab (Jeremiah 48:11). The heavenly character is not attained by "settling on our lees," by taking the easy way. The Lord gives each of us special abilities, particular opportunities, an individual use to serve, and a particular crown to attain — if we will. He has for each one of us a direct, personal message, searching and challenging — if we have ears to hear.

=== From the Writings of Swedenborg

@AR 202-204 (concerning the church in Laodicea):

"That thou art neither cold nor hot, signifies that they who are such, sometimes deny that the Word is Divine and holy, and at other times acknowledge it .... They are also such concerning God, at one time they deny, and at another time acknowledge Him; in like manner as to all things of the church; for which reason they are sometimes with those who are in hell, and at other times with those who are in heaven. They fly as it were between both, up and down, and wherever they fly, thither they turn the face. They become such who have confirmed with themselves the belief in the existence of God, of heaven and hell, and of life eternal, and afterwards recede from it. When the first confirmation returns, they acknowledge, but when it does not return, they deny. They recede because they afterwards think only of themselves and the world, continually aspiring to pre—eminence, and thereby they immerse themselves in their proprium; thus hell swallows them up. I would thou wert cold or hot, signifies that it is better for them either from the heart to deny the holy things of the Word and the church, or from the heart to acknowledge them. ... The reason is, because they have mixed truths with falsities, and goods with evils, thus holy things with profane, even so that they cannot be separated. And since man cannot then be prepared, either to be in heaven or in hell, the whole of his rational life is destroyed, and the ultimates of life alone remain, which, when separated from the interiors of life, are mere phantasies."

JOHN'S VISION OF THE THRONE — Revelation 4

Review briefly what is known about the apostle John and his situation at the time the visions of the book of Revelation were given.

=== Doctrinal Points

Spiritual warfare is going on all the time in this world.

Divine providence, by means of the truths of the Word, protects the good and separates them from the evil.

The Lord is the only judge.

=== Notes for Parents

The book of Revelation is the final book of the Word of God.

It is also sometimes called the Apocalypse, which is just the Greek work for revelation. It is the record of a long and wonderful vision which was given to the apostle John when he was a very old man, probably ninety years old. Tradition says that he was the only one of the apostles — except Judas, who hanged himself from remorse - who did not die a martyr's death, because both the leaders of Judaism and the Roman government were afraid of the growing Christian Church and tried to stamp it out. John was not put to death, but he was exiled to the little island of Patmos off the coast of Asia Minor, where the vision was given him.

The word revelation means an "unveiling." John says that when this vision was given him, he was "in the spirit," and he was told to write "the things which thou hast seen, and the things which are, and the things which shall be hereafter." So this book is first of all a description of spiritual conditions, states which exist in the hearts and minds of men, and it is a prophecy of what these states will inevitably lead to.

It is such a strange and powerful vision that it has always captured the imaginations of men and led them to try to think what it can mean, and many things in it have been applied at one time or another to events which have been taking place in the world, especially to great wars and battles, for all through the book conflicts are described. But we should realize that all these things are given us as symbolic pictures of a spiritual conflict which goes on all the time, the conflict between good and evil in our hearts and between truth and falsity in our minds. It is a picture of judgment given to show us the inevitable results of evil and falsity and to help us choose what is good and true.

The chapter the children have for today sets the stage for this great conflict, for it shows us that in heaven it is the Lord who reigns and that everyone and everything there loves to acknowledge and worship Him.

=== Primary

The children will be interested in John and in the vision itself; so the reading of the chapter should come early in the lesson. They may remember the word cherubim in our study of Ezekiel and should be reminded of it. Tell them the colors of the precious stones mentioned and connect Revelation 4:8 with its use in the church service.

The Lord when He was on earth chose twelve of His disciples to receive special instructions and powers from Him so that after He left them they could go out all over the world and preach the Gospel — the "good news" — that He had overcome evil and would give to all who would learn of Him and obey Him the power to overcome their temptations and become heavenly people. These twelve men were called the apostles, which means men "sent out." The three apostles who were closest to the Lord were Peter, James, and John. All the apostles except Judas were faithful, and did the work the Lord had given them to do.

The apostle who apparently lived longest was John. He is believed to have lived to be nearly ninety and he was in charge of several of the early churches. Before he died he was given a wonderful vision of what would happen to this new church which was called Christian. We have been studying this vision as described in the book of Revelation, the last book in the Bible.

First John saw the Lord as He may be seen in the heavens, and he recognized Him as the same Lord he had known and followed on earth.

Then he was shown how everyone is judged according to the truth which is in the Word.

Our lesson today is the beginning of this vision of the judgment.

Read the chapter and then see how many of the details of the vision you can remember.

Do you remember our lesson about Ezekiel's vision?

Nearly seven hundred years before John, Ezekiel had seen some of the same things.

The "beasts" [KJV] in our chapter are the same "living creatures" seen by Ezekiel.

They are also called cherubim.

We can easily see that the Lord himself was the king sitting on the throne, whom everyone and everything in heaven worships. Do you go to church with your parents? If you do, listen carefully to the singing, and you may hear some of the very words that John heard in heaven. This is because when we are in church, we are worshiping the Lord with the angels.

=== Junior

After your introduction, in connection with which you should use a map, have the class look up the Bible references and compare the various visions, picking out the similarities. Stress the fact that everyone in heaven worships the Lord.

Between the Gospels and the book of Revelation we find in our Bibles twenty-two books. The first — the only one of any length - is called the Acts of the Apostles, and is an account of the first beginnings of the Christian Church and also many things about what the apostles themselves thought. If we read these books attentively, we shall find that the apostles and others who went out to preach the Gospel did not always agree as to just what the Lord meant people to do. So we cannot take our instruction from them, although they said many fine and helpful things. We must study the Word itself. And after the Acts and the Epistles there comes one more book of the Word, the book of Revelation.

The book of Revelation, as we have already noted, is the record of the visions given to the apostle John when he was a very old man. Tradition says that he was the youngest of the apostles and outlived all of them. Judas, we remember, hanged himself before the crucifixion, and again tradition says that all the others except John were martyred sooner or later. This was because the Christian Church grew so fast that the Roman government was afraid of its power and tried to stamp it out.

John was no doubt protected by the Lord so that he might be the instrument through whom the final book of the Word might be given. But he, as we learned from Revelation 1:9, was finally exiled to the island of Patmos off the coast of Asia Minor. You can find this island on a map of the area, as well as the part of the world covered in the journeys of the apostles and the location of the seven churches in Asia Minor over which John himself had supervision. That these churches were quite different — people are bound to differ in their opinions and likes — we have learned from the messages which the Lord gave John for them (Revelation 2, 3) praising them for their good characteristics but also pointing out certain evils into which they had already fallen, and warning them to correct these evils.

John was first given a wonderful vision of the Lord as He is seen in the heavens, and yet John could recognize Him as the same master he had followed in the world (Revelation 1:13). Then followed the messages to the seven churches in Asia Minor, and then a long and detailed vision of the spiritual course which the Christian Church would take, the war within it between the forces of the Lord and the forces of evil, the judgment which would be executed upon it, and the final coming of a new church. We may think of this amazing vision as a sort of tremendous moving picture acted out before John's spiritual eyes to teach him and us deep spiritual lessons. John says he was in the spirit (Revelation 1:10, 4:2) when he saw these things. Our chapter for today is the beginning of the picture of the judgment.

What was the first thing John saw after the door was opened in heaven?

Who do you think was the one who sat upon the throne?

What men were around the throne?

How were they dressed?

What other creatures were about the throne?

Do you remember one of our lessons from Ezekiel? Ezekiel, nearly seven hundred years before John, saw a very similar vision. If you have forgotten, read Ezekiel 1:4-18 to see how many things were similar, and then read Ezekiel 10:1 to see what the four living creatures were called. We should know that the Greek word translated "beasts" [KJV] in our chapter for today might better be translated "living creatures" as the Hebrew word is in the first chapter of Ezekiel. In our church service some of us use the words which the living creatures spoke (Revelation 4:8), and also we may be familiar with Revelation 4:11 because it is sung in some of our responsive services.

We may think of the whole chapter as picturing the fact that the Lord Jesus Christ reigns in heaven and that everyone in heaven worships Him and is governed by Him.

=== Intermediate

Take up the outline of the correspondence, enlarging on it as the young people show interest. Stress the fact that judgment is according to truth, as this will be good preparation for later lessons.

In Mark 16:19 we are told of the Lord's ascension. This took place forty days after the resurrection and is most fully described in Acts 1:1-12. The book of Acts — the Acts of the Apostles — tells the story of the beginnings of the Christian Church. This book and the twenty-one Epistles — letters written by the apostles and others to the groups of Christians which they organized — do not have an inner sense and so we do not study them in Sunday school, but they are very valuable historical books and interesting to all Christians. The apostles did go out all over the then—known world and preach the Gospel. Everywhere they went they found some people who were hungry for the good news they had to give of the life of the Lord and the salvation He had made possible. And the Christian Church grew so fast that the Roman government soon began to be suspicious of it and tried to stamp it out. Tradition says that all the apostles except John died martyrs' deaths.

Tradition also says that John was the youngest of the apostles and lived to be about ninety. Near the end of his life he was exiled by the Romans to the little island of Patmos off the coast of Asia Minor. John had been in charge of seven of the Christian churches which had been organized in Asia Minor. At Patmos he was given the vision which is recorded in the book of Revelation, the last book in our Bible and the final book of the Word. We are told in Revelation 1:19 and in the first verse of our chapter for today that it is a book of prophecy. As we have seen, it begins (chapter 1) with a vision of the Lord — whom John recognized as the same master he had followed in the world — reigning in heaven. Then (chapters 2 and 3) John was given messages to his seven churches in Asia which show us what their inner states were. They were all different; they had good characteristics and bad ones, and they were warned to repent and correct their faults if they wished to remain true representatives of the Lord in the world.

In the Acts and Epistles we learn that very soon after the Lord left them the apostles began to come into differences of opinion as to how His teachings were to be applied to life. They remembered His words but interpreted them differently. We can understand from this why there are so many Christian sects today. The Lord does not force any one of us to think in one way or another, and we are all different; so we draw different ideas from the Lord's teaching. Still we should all be studying the Word and doing our best to understand and obey it. If we are, the Lord can lead us to heaven, even though we may sometimes misunderstand what we read. But if, instead of this, we are forming our opinions according to our own desires and then trying to find in the Word only what confirms our own chosen opinions, we are not open to the truth in it and the Lord cannot lead us. In the Christian Church — in all Christian churches — there have always been true followers of the Lord and others who only pretended to follow Him. And we know that in each one of us there are tendencies both to good and to evil. The Lord and the angels are working to protect the good and to control the evil both in the individual and in the church. So there is a spiritual war going on all the time, and when we come into the other world there is a time of judgment when the good and the evil are separated. It is this war and the resulting judgment which were shown to John in a series of wonderful living pictures of which the first is our chapter for today.

This vision is very much like one which the prophet Ezekiel had had long before. Read Ezekiel 1:26-28. Read also Exodus 19:16 and 24:10. A trumpet always means the power of the Lord's truth speaking, and a throne is the picture of judgment. It is of course the Lord who sits upon the throne, executing judgment by means of the truth. The precious stones picture the way in which the truth appears to those who love it, showing many different beauties, like the different colors, but always clear and shining, and the sea of glass pictures the clear atmosphere in which even the people of the natural heaven live. The rainbow which Ezekiel saw appeared to John, too. A rainbow is formed by the rays of the sun reflected from raindrops. For us the truths we learn from the Word are spiritual raindrops, and when we realize that the Lord is speaking to us in them, they become shining and beautiful and many—colored.

Now read Ezekiel 1:5-14. The "living creatures" Ezekiel saw are the same "beasts" which John saw. In fact the Greek word translated "beasts" [KJV] would be better translated "living creatures." See if you can remember from our lesson on Ezekiel what the lion, the calf, the man, and the eagle picture. These living creatures are not actual, even in the spiritual world: they are "cherubim," symbolic figures representing the protecting power which divine providence exercises through the letter of the Word. That is why they are said to be "full of eyes before and behind," because the Lord sees everything, past, present, and future. Their wings picture the power of the Word to lift out thoughts above the earth.

The twenty-four elders in white garments represent all the good people who have made their thoughts clean by learning the truth, and the crowns of gold show that they have overcome their temptations by means of unselfish love. "Elders" is a name given to people in churches who are looked up to as wiser than others. If we live rightly, we all may grow to be "elders" in this sense, because we become wiser with every year. But if we do not live rightly, we do not become wise with age.

The chapter closes with the worship of the Lord by the creatures and the elders. So John was assured at the beginning of his vision that the Lord rules everything in heaven. He was to see some terrible dangers, and he needed to be sure from the start that the Lord would win the victory. We need to be sure of this, too. The book is written for us.

=== Basic Correspondences

This class will be interested in the fact that differences in belief and practice began early in the Christian Church, and also in the way in which the letter of the Word serves as a guard to the genuine truth within. They should learn that the whole book of Revelation is a prophecy of the end of the first Christian dispensation and the beginning of the New Church era.

The book of Revelation is also called the Apocalypse, which is a Greek word meaning "revelation." The Jews think of the Old Testament as composed of the Law and the Prophets. In the New Testament the four Gospels may be thought of as the Law and the book of Revelation as the Prophets. For the "new covenant" for the Christian Church is given in the Gospel record of the Lord's life and teaching, and the book of Revelation is a prophecy of what would happen to the first Christian Church, founded on a literal interpretation of this new law, and a prophecy of the final coming of a new Christian Church when the true spiritual interpretation could be revealed to men.

The beginning of the external history of the first Christian Church is given us in the book of Acts and the twenty-one Epistles which, although they are books which lack the inner sense, are very valuable to all Christians not only as history but because they give us some idea of what the apostles themselves thought about the Lord's teaching. We do not study them in Sunday school because we should draw our instruction from the Word rather than from the thoughts of men, but you should become familiar with them because they contain many fine statements and much useful information and because they are regarded as authoritative by other Christians who do not have our doctrine of the Word.

John, as we learn from Revelation 1:9, was in exile on the island of Patmos. He was the last of the apostles. The Roman government had tried to suppress the Christian Church from the beginning, and tradition has it that all the apostles except John died a martyr's death. If this is true, no doubt John was providentially protected so that he might be the instrument through whom the Lord could give this final prophecy.

John's mind was led step by step into the prophetic details of his vision. First (chapter 1) he was given to see that the master whom he had followed in the world was indeed the almighty God. Then (chapters 2 and 3) by the messages to the seven churches under his care he was shown the inner condition of the groups of Christians which already existed and their relation to the future of the church.

Then, in the first verse of our chapter for today, we read that he saw a door opened in heaven and heard the trumpet—like voice telling him to come up and see there a vision of things to come. And the first thing he saw was again the Lord, this time seated on His throne, the Lord executing judgment by means of the truth.

Every detail of the vision has to do with the beauty and power of truth: the throne itself, which represents judgment; the precious stones, which represent truths made clear and brilliant by love of them; the rainbow, truth as it is reflected in the knowledges of the letter of the Word which we receive in our minds; the white raiment of the elders, truth expressed in life, "the righteousness of saints" (Revelation 19:8); the sea of glass, the clear atmosphere of the ultimates of heaven; and the four "beasts" or cherubim, which picture the Lord's protection of inner truth by means of the letter of the Word.

The chapter should be compared with Ezekiel's vision (Ezekiel 1 and 10), Isaiah's (Isaiah 6:1-3), Daniel's (Daniel 7:9-10); and with the vision granted to Moses and the elders of Israel at Sinai (Exodus 24:10).

John needed this vision of the glory and power of the truth he was to proclaim. He was to see terrible things portrayed, but he knew from the beginning that the armies of evil would inevitably fail.

We need this reassurance also. Our world today is shaken by fear of the future. Evil forces seem to be abroad, and the voices which speak for love and peace seem weak. But the Lord is with those who proclaim His truth. They may have great tribulation, but they will conquer in the end. "For there is no restraint to the Lord to save by many or by few." (1 Samuel 14:6) Each of us can do a great deal of good in our world today by speaking and living without fear, believing in the Lord's Word with its laws and its promises, and putting our whole trust in Him. We can worship every Sunday with the very words of this vision: "Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, which was, and is, and is to come." So we help to establish the Lord's kingdom on earth. We cannot establish it by looking to men for wisdom.

=== Adult

The relation of the Acts and Epistles to the Word is important for all adults because we hear so much emphasis placed on the Epistles by non—New Church people. Many interesting points are suggested in the sections from the @AR , which may be read and discussed one by one.

In our study of the Gospel we saw how little the apostles, devoted though they were, understood the Lord's teaching, and how prone they were to forget things that He told them, and also at the end how weak was the flesh, however willing the spirit may have been. Only their contact with Him after the resurrection and their witness of His ascension (Mark 16:19) could have inspired in them the courage and perseverance with which they afterward accomplished their assigned task of preaching the Gospel to all the world (Mark 16:15). The record of their accomplishment is preserved for us in the book of the Acts of the Apostles, which is the basis of our knowledge of the beginnings of the Christian Church. Although the book of Acts — written by Luke — does not have an inner sense, and for this reason we do not study it in Sunday school, it gives us a certain background for our approach to the book of Revelation. It shows the bitterness of the opposition to the early Christians both by the Jews and by the Romans, and it also shows that the apostles did not always agree as to just what the teachings of the Lord were and how they should be applied in the daily life. The Epistles are further evidence of this, and while they contain many fine and helpful statements and much valuable information, we must still for our doctrine go to the Word itself.*

[*But several New Church doctrines are succinctly stated in the Epistles. -Editor]

Tradition says that all of the eleven apostles except John were martyred. John, the youngest of them, was the only one who lived to very old age. No doubt he was providentially protected that he might be the instrument through whom the great prophetic vision might be recorded which concludes our Word. This vision is thought to have been given him in the year A.D. 95, when he was about ninety years of age. Although he was living in exile on the island of Patmos, he was still looked to as the head of seven churches in Asia Minor. From the messages given him for these churches (chapters 2 and 3) we learn that even at that early date the different groups of Christians had developed different characteristics and ideas. Although we recognize these messages as applying in their inner meaning to the different types of Christian discipleship in all times, still they should show us how foolish it is for anyone to imagine that unanimity of belief and practice is possible today. One of the lessons of our chapter for today is that the Lord provides in the letter of the Word a guard over its inner truths for the very purpose of permitting differences of interpretation. In @AR 239 Swedenborg says: "The sense of the letter of the Word serves as a guard for the genuine truths which lie within; and the guard consists in this, that the literal sense can be turned hither and thither, that is, can be explained according to everyone's understanding, without its internal being hurt or violated; for no harm ensues from the literal sense being understood differently by different people; but it does harm when the Divine truths which are within are perverted, for it is by this that the Word suffers violence. To prevent this, the literal sense guards, and it guards with those who are in falsities from religion, but yet do not confirm them, for from these the Word suffers no violence. This guard is signified by 'cherubim,' and is also described by them in the Word."

The whole vision is a vision of judgment, a picture of how divine providence by means of the truths of the Word protects the good and separates them from the evil. This judgment goes on in each individual, but we know that the book of Revelation particularly describes the judgment which was to take place at the end of the first Christian dispensation, and the beginning of a new dispensation through the opening of the Word. Chapter 4, Swedenborg says, "treats of the arrangement and preparation of all things in heaven for the judgment, to be executed from the Word, and according to it; likewise concerning the acknowledgment that the Lord is the only judge" (Apocalypse Revealed introduction to chapter 4).

In studying this chapter we should begin by comparing it with earlier visions of very similar nature: Exodus 19:16, 24:9-10; Ezekiel 1 and 10; Isaiah 6:1-3; and Daniel 7:9-10. If we wish to study it in greater detail we should go to the @AE , but we shall find a condensed explanation, including a very brief summary interpretation, in the @AR Here we shall note that the voice of the trumpet always pictures the power of truth speaking, the throne judgment, and the four "beasts" or cherubim the guard the Lord provides against profanation.

In @AR 233 we read: "He who does not know the spiritual sense of the Word, and at the same time the genuine truths of the church, may believe, that when the Last Judgment shall come, the Lord will sit upon a throne, and that there will be other judges also upon thrones around Him. But he who knows the spiritual sense of the Word, and at the same time the genuine truths of the church, knows that the Lord will not then sit upon a throne, and that neither will there be other judges about Him; and further, that neither will the Lord judge anyone to hell, but that the Word will judge everyone, the Lord moderating that all things may be done according to justice ... 'Twelve' signifies all, and is predicated of the truths and goods of heaven and the church (n. 348); the same is signified by 'twenty-four'; therefore 'the twelve apostles' and the 'twenty-four elders' signify all things of the church; and 'twelve,' as also 'twenty-four thrones,' signify the all of judgment."

We are told in @AR 237 that by the seven lamps are signified "the New Church in heaven and on earth from the Lord through the Divine truth proceeding from Him," just as by the seven stars and the seven lampstands in Revelation 1:20, and in @AR 238 that "Before the throne there was a sea of glass like unto crystal, signifies the New Heaven from Christians who are in general truths from the literal sense of the Word." The New Heaven referred to in the last quotation is the heaven which was formed at the time of the Second Coming from all the good souls of the first Christian Church who are described in Revelation 6:9-11.

We recognize in Revelation 4:8 one of the familiar responses which is sung in some of our churches, and another in Revelation 4:11 which appears in some of our responsive services. When we sing these, it will be helpful to remember that they are sung in heaven also and especially that if we sing them with sincere hearts, the Lord can make them a bulwark for us against many temptations.

=== From the Writings of Swedenborg

@AR 231: "'A stone,' in the Word, signifies truth in ultimates, and 'a precious stone,' truth transparent from good (n. 915). There are two colors fundamental of the rest in the spiritual world, the color white and the color red. The color white derives its origin from the light of the sun in heaven, thus from spiritual light, which is shining white; and the color red derives its origin from the fire of the sun there, thus from celestial light, which is flamy ... This is the reason why precious stones, in the Word, signify such things as are of the truth of wisdom, or of the good of love, and that 'the jasper,' because it is shining white, signifies the things which are of the truth of wisdom; and 'the sardius,' because it is red, the things which are of the good of love."

@AR 232: "In the spiritual world there appear rainbows of many kinds, they appear of various colors as upon the earth, and they appear of one color; here of one color, because it is said 'like unto an emerald.' ... The Divine sphere which surrounds the Lord is from His Divine love, and at the same time from His Divine wisdom, which, when it is represented in the heavens, appears in the celestial kingdom red like a ruby, in the spiritual kingdom blue like the lapis lazuli, in the natural kingdom green like the emerald; everywhere with ineffable splendor and radiance."

@AR 238: "And before the throne there was a sea of glass like unto crystal, signifies the New Heaven from Christians who are in general truths from the literal sense of the Word. In the spiritual world there appear atmosphere, and also waters, like as in our world; the atmospheres, in which the angels of the highest heaven dwell, are as it were ethereal; the atmospheres, in which the angels of the middle heaven dwell, are as it were aerial; and the atmospheres, in which the angels of the lowest heaven dwell, are as it were aqueous; and these last appear as seas at the boundaries of heaven, where they dwell who are in general truths from the literal sense of the Word. ... by 'the sea of glass' which was before the throne, is meant the church among those who are at the boundaries ... It is called 'a sea of glass like unto crystal,' from the pellucidity of the Divine truth proceeding from the Lord."
