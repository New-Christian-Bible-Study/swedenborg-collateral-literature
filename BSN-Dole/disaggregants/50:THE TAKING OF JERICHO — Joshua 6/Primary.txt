Remind the children of what the ark was and what was contained, and tell the story of Jericho with emphasis on the power of the ark. But be sure to give the children an opportunity to tell what they know about Moses, the Passover, the wilderness journey, the crossing of the Red Sea, the manna, and the ark with the commandments. It is a good lesson for review, and more will be obtained from the story of Jericho if it comes as a climax.

The people had camped near the river at a place called Gilgal and celebrated the feast of the Passover to mark their thanksgiving to the Lord for delivering them from slavery and bringing them back to the Promised Land. Then they prepared to attack the first city which stood in the way of their progress into the land. This was a strong city surrounded by a great wall.

What was the name of this city?

Did the Lord tell Joshua to attack the city of Jericho?

What were they to carry around the city each day for six days?

Who were to go ahead of the ark?

What were they to do on the seventh day?

When Joshua finally told the people to shout, what happened?

All the gold, silver, brass, and iron which they found in Jericho was to be devoted to the Lord.

Everything and everybody else was to be destroyed, except a woman named Rahab and her family.

They were spared because Rahab had saved some of Joshua's men when they were sent ahead to spy out the city.

Jericho was burned to the ground, and a curse placed upon it. Read verse 26.

It was really the Lord who conquered Jericho for the Israelites, wasn't it? When we do as the Lord tells us to do, He will always help us.
