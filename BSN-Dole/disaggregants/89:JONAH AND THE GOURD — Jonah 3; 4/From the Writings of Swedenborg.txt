=== From the Writings of Swedenborg

@AE 401[36]: "This evil in that nation is signified by the gourd which the worm smote so that it withered. 'The sun that beat upon the head of Jonah' signifies the love of self which prevailed in that nation; and 'the scorching east wind' falsity therefrom; and 'the worm that smote the gourd' signifies the destruction of this evil and its falsity."
