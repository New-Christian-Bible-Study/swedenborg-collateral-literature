=== Doctrinal Points

It is God's intent for us to enjoy the good things of this world; it is shortsighted automatically to see evil in such enjoyment.

If we will trust in the Lord's power, attacking our evils with the strength we have, the Lord will help give us the victory.

A king represents the principle that we should obey the Lord's truth.

Even our first idea of truth — imperfect as it is — will produce some good.
