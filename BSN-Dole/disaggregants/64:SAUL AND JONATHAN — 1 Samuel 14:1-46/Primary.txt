A simple lesson which can be drawn from this story is that it is not size or physical strength that counts and that the Lord always helps those who try to learn what is right and do it. The teacher, in pointing out the difference between Saul and Jonathan, should use as an illustration the story of the rest of the chapter. The people's support of Jonathan against Saul prepares the way for the fact of their later admiration of David.

---
We find that the Philistines, after they had returned the ark, went right on trying to conquer the Israelites. Samuel, you remember, was recognized as Judge by all the people, but Samuel had been brought up in the tabernacle and he was not a fighting man. So the people had asked him to give them a king who could lead them in battle against their enemies, and the Lord told Samuel to grant their request. The Lord also showed Samuel whom to anoint as the first king, the powerful young man named Saul, who stood head and shoulders taller than all the other men. The people thought he would make them a fine leader; so they accepted him as their first king.

But you know we cannot always judge things or people by their appearance. Saul was brave, but he was not wise.

He very soon won a victory over the Ammonites, and this made him self-confident.

He did not fully trust the Lord; so the Lord could not always be with him. But he had a son named Jonathan who did trust the Lord.

First Jonathan and part of the army captured a city from the Philistines. But Jonathan was not depending upon the army.

What did he tell his armor-bearer about the Lord?

What did the Lord enable the two young men to do?

The rest of the chapter tells us how Jonathan's victory threw the army of the Philistines into confusion so that they attacked each other.

Then Saul and his army overcame them.
