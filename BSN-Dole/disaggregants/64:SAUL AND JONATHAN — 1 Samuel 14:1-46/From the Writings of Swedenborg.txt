=== From the Writings of Swedenborg

@AE 619[8]: "There was also much honey in the land of Canaan at that time, because at that time the church of the Lord was there, as can be seen from the first book of Samuel, where it is said that they came into a forest, where there was honey upon the face of the ground, and there was a stream of honey, and Jonathan's eyes were opened by tasting the honey (14:25-27,29). 'Jonathan's eyes were opened by tasting the honey' because 'honey' corresponds to natural good and its delight, and this good gives intelligence and enlightens, from which Jonathan knew that he had done evil; as we read in Isaiah, 'He shall eat butter and honey, that he may know to reject the evil and to choose the good.' For at that time correspondences exhibited their effects outwardly, since all things of the Israelitish Church consisted of correspondences, which represented and signified things celestial and spiritual."
