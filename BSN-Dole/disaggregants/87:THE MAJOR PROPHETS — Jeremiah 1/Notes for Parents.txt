=== Notes for Parents

In our Bible the Prophets are the last seventeen books of the Old Testament. There are four Major and twelve Minor Prophets, "Major" and "Minor" referring to the length of their books. Two books, Jeremiah and Lamentations, are attributed to Jeremiah. A prophet is one who speaks for the Lord. Again and again — more than fifty times — Jeremiah says "the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah." The Lord has always spoken to men through prophets, giving them the divine truth which they needed to correct their mistakes and lead them to heavenly happiness. In Luke 1:70 Zacharias says, "As he spake by the mouth of his holy prophets, which have been since the world began." All the prophets, however, were not given messages for people of all time. Only a few were chosen for this work, and the Lord provided that their messages should be preserved and recorded in the Bible.

The four major prophets are Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and Daniel. All of them prophesied to the people of Judah. We have seen that Isaiah lived in the time of king Hezekiah. Jeremiah lived about a century later in the last days of the kingdom of Judah. He prophesied its fall and lived to see his prophecies literally fulfilled. The book called Lamentations was written through him after the destruction of Jerusalem and the temple. Ezekiel and Daniel were both among the captives carried away to Babylon, and they prophesied to their people there. But all four of these prophets have a message for us within the message which they delivered to the people of their day.
