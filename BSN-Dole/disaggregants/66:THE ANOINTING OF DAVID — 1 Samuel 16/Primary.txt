Tell the children that Saul could not keep the kingship because, although he meant well, he was in too much of a hurry and would not do exactly as Samuel told him to do. Little children often have this same failing. Then center the lesson around the difference between Saul and David, David's occupation as a shepherd and his skill in playing the harp, and finally the meaning of anointing. Read aloud 1 Samuel 16:6-7 to show that even Samuel was tempted to judge by outward appearance. Tell them that David did not actually become king for some time, that Saul later became jealous of him and even tried to kill him, but that David was always Saul's friend, and mourned for him when he died.

When Saul was first told by Samuel that he was to be king, he was very humble and wondered why he should have been chosen. But after all the people had welcomed him as king and after he had, with the Lord's help, been successful in his first battles, he began to think too well of himself. As we say today, "his head was turned" by success. He forgot that Samuel was the one who spoke for the Lord, and he thought he did not have to obey Samuel.

Now the Lord tells Samuel to anoint a new king.

Where does he send him?

What do you know about Bethlehem?

Why did Samuel think Jesse's oldest son must be the new king? 

What did the Lord tell Samuel?

How many of Jesse's sons were rejected? Why was his youngest son David not present? What did David look like?

What happened to him when Samuel anointed him?

What happened to Saul at the same time?

David is called "the sweet psalmist of Israel."

Most of the Psalms were given through him.

David did not become king immediately after he was anointed.

Saul was still on the throne and David had to prove himself to the people before they could accept him. Let us read how this proving started. Read 1 Samuel 16:14-23.
