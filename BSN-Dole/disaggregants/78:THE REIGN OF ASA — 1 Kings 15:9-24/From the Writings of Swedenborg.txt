=== From the Writings of Swedenborg

@AE 411[12]: "'In that day they shall reject every man the idols of his silver and the idols of his gold which your hands make for you .. .' This treats of judgment upon those who from self-intelligence believe themselves to be wise in Divine things. Such are those who are in the love of self and the world, and who seek after a reputation for learning for the sake of self; these, because they are unable to see truths, seize on falsities and proclaim them as truths. The falsities that favor their principles and their loves are signified by 'the idols of silver and the idols of gold'; that these are from self-intelligence is signified by 'which your hands have made for you.'"

@AC 6435[11]: "In very many passages of the prophetic Word mention is made of 'mountains and hills,' and by them in the internal sense are signified the goods of love ... Because 'mountains' and 'hills' signified such things, in the Ancient Church their Divine worship also was upon mountains and upon hills; and afterward the Hebrew nation set altars upon mountains and hills, and there sacrificed and burnt incense; and where there were no hills, they constructed high places. But because this worship became idolatrous, through holding the mountains and hills themselves holy, and thinking nothing at all about the holy things which they signified, this worship was therefore forbidden the Israelitish and Jewish people ... In order however that this representative which had been in ancient times might be retained, the mountain of Zion was chosen, and by it in the supreme sense was represented the Divine good of the Lord's Divine love, and in the relative sense the Divine celestial and the Divine spiritual in His kingdom."
