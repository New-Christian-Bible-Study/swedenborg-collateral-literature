=== Notes for Parents

In our chapter for today we have an opportunity to see how different kinds of people reacted to the Lord's presence and teaching. We are apt to think that if we had been in the Holy Land when the Lord was on earth, we should certainly have loved and followed Him. But would we? Everyone certainly did not. The scribes and Pharisees resented Him so bitterly that they said that it was the devil from whom He got His power, and they even plotted against Him with their own avowed enemies, the Herodians, who approved of the Roman rule. The Lord's own family thought He was "beside Himself" — crazy — and wanted to force Him to stop His work. The crowds were so much more interested in being healed of their diseases than they were in what the Lord taught that He had to have a ship at hand in which He could get away from them if necessary. Only a very few people really followed Him to learn the truth He came to teach. In which group would we have been?

We can answer this if we ask ourselves honestly in which group we are today. Do we, like the scribes and Pharisees, try to silence the voice that tells us we ought to be kinder and more faithful than we are? Do we, like the Lord's human relatives, think the Lord's teachings are too impractical to believe in? Do we, like the crowd, follow the Lord only for what we can get out of it for ourselves? Or do we, like the true disciples, put the Lord first in our thinking and in our lives and try to learn more and more of what He would have us do?

It was from these true disciples that the Lord chose twelve to be His apostles, to go out into the world after He should leave them and carry the Gospel — the good news — to all people, thus founding the Christian Church.
