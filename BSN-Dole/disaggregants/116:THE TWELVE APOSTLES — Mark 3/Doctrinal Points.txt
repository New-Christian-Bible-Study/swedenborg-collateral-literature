=== Doctrinal Points

The Lord sees to it that everyone receives enough truth to save him if he tries to live according to what he learns.

The Word produced the church, not the church the Word. 

Faith belongs to the understanding or thought plane. 

Charity belongs to the plane of the heart or will.

Selfish motives in the heart destroy charity, no matter how many outwardly good deeds a person may do.
