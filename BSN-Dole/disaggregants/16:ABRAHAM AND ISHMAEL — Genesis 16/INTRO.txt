=== Introduction

Review briefly the story of the Most Ancient Church and its destruction as a preparation for describing the decline and fall of the Ancient Church. Then review the raising up of the remnant called Noah and go from that to an account of the call of Abram. The thought of the Lord's stepping in while a remnant of good remained can be connected with the promise of which the rainbow was the token. Be sure the classes understand why Abram is used in our chapter and why we always speak of him as Abraham.
