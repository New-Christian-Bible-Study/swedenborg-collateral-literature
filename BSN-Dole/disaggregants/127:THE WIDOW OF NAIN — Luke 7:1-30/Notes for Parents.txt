=== Notes for Parents

There are two very wonderful stories in our lesson for today.

One is about a Roman soldier who heard of the Lord's miracles and, believing what he heard, knew that such power could come only from God and so it was not limited by any earthly conditions. We see evidences all about us of the Lord's power in the lives of other people. Are we as willing as the centurion was to acknowledge it and turn to the Lord ourselves, sure that He can help us?

And the other story is of a poor widow whose only son had died, and the Lord "had compassion on her" and with the one word, "Arise," brought her son back to life. Nothing that is recorded in the Bible is there by accident. It is the Lord who gives us this story. He gives it to us to show us that He has power over life and death, and that we never really die. When He sees that it is best for us and for others to pass out of this world, our bodies die. But to each one of us He then says, "Arise," and, like the widow's son, we sit up and begin to speak. In the sight of the angels, the thing which we call death is resurrection, for they then see us rising to active consciousness in their world. We should never fear death. It is always a blessing to the one who goes. We should look forward to it. And we will, if we believe and trust the Lord and try to live the kind of life which is taught in His Word. Shall we be like the people in our chapter whom John had baptized, or like the Pharisees and lawyers who rejected his counsel?
