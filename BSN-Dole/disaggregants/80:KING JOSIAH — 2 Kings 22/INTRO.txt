=== Introduction

Israel did not heed the warnings of Elijah and Elisha and was finally taken captive by the Assyrians. All her people were carried away captive and never came back. But in Judah, although there had been a number of wicked kings, and worship of the Lord had declined and idolatry flourished, there had also been several good kings who instituted reforms and tried to restore true worship. Assyria was not allowed to overcome Judah. This brings us to our lesson. All teachers should read chapter 23 as well as 22.
