=== Doctrinal Points
----
• There must be truth in the mind if the good intentions of the heart are to survive.
• Whenever we let our minds accept worldly ideas, selfishness begins to creep back into our hearts.
• As long as we are really trying to do right, the Lord can protect us. If we are sincerely trying to uncover and correct our faults, we do not count the cost.
