The story of the repair of the temple and the finding of the book is simple and interesting. Many of the details of Josiah's reign can be covered in this class. Tell them also about Josiah's death (2 Kings 23:29-30) and that his sons were evil kings, so that the Lord very soon permitted Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, to conquer Judah.

Our story today is about one of the good kings of the line of David and Solomon. He reigned in Jerusalem over the part of the country which had remained faithful to Solomon's son. This part was called Judah. Many things had happened since the kingdom was divided. The kings of Israel — the other division of the country - had not been willing to listen to the warnings of Elijah and Elisha. Things in their part of the land had gone from bad to worse until finally — not long before Josiah's time — the Assyrians conquered Israel. They carried all the people away captive and sent foreigners in to take their place.

The descendants of these foreigners were the Samaritans of the Gospel story. In Judah also there were many evil kings, and idolatry sprang up.

But in Judah there were some good kings too.

Who is the king in our story today?

How old was he when he came to the throne?

What was the first good thing he undertook to do?

What was found when they were repairing the temple?

As soon as the book of the law was read to him, Josiah realized how many wrong things the people had been doing. He had the law read to the people and then he destroyed all the idols, even the altar to the golden calf which Jeroboam had set up in Bethel. Then, when the land was in order again, he had the people celebrate the Passover, the greatest Passover that had been celebrated for many years.

Do you remember when and why the first Passover was celebrated? The Lord spared Judah as long as Josiah lived.

But when he died, the people went right back to their evil ways. Judah was later conquered by Babylon.
