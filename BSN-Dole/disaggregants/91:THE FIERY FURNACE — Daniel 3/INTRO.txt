=== INTRO

The teacher should study the sections in the various graded notes on the decline of Israel and Judah and the captivities. This is the background against which today's lesson must be taught because of Daniel's origin and his position in Babylon. It is also important that all the children above the Primaries should know at least the simple facts concerning the captivities. A few minutes should be spent in reviewing the names and periods of the four great prophets so as to place Daniel among them, but most of the lesson time should be occupied with the story for the day.
