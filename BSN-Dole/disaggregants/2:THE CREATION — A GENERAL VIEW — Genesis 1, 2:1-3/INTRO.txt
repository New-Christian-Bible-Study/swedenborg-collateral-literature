=== INTRO

The introduction for this first lesson in all classes should be a few words about the Bible as the book we study in Sunday School. It is different from all other books in the world. The Lord is its Author, and in it He tells us about Himself and the things we need to know so that we may learn to be heavenly people and live in heaven when we die. So we call it the Word of God. It is made up of many books written through many men. The first book is called Genesis, which means "the beginning."
