=== Doctrinal Points
----
[Summary doctrinal points will be found at the beginning of each lesson. They are especially recommended for the use of teachers of Intermediate and Senior classes. Their listing in this way merely brings them together for the teacher's convenience; they are not meant to be taken up as the main feature of the lesson, but to be brought in by the way. Each point will be identifiable as related to one of the four principal doctrines of the Church: the doctrines of the Lord, the Word, Faith, or Charity.]
• The Lord is the beginning of everything. He created heaven and earth.
• The Word is the Lord's revelation to us of all that we need to know about our Creator and our relation to Him.
• Faith in the Lord means trust in Him and obedience to His commandments even against our own will and judgment.
• We cannot do any real good of ourselves. All good is in and from the Lord.
