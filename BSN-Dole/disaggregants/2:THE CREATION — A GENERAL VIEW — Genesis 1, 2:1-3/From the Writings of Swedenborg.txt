=== From the Writings of Swedenborg

@AC 16, 20: "The most ancient time is called 'the beginning.' By the prophets it is in various places called the 'days of old [antiquitatis]' and also the 'days of eternity.' The 'beginning' also involves the first period when man is being regenerated, for he is then born anew, and receives life. Regeneration itself is therefore called a 'new creation' of man. The expressions to 'create,' to 'form,' to 'make,' in almost all parts of the prophetic writings signify to regenerate, yet with a difference in the signification. . . . That 'heaven' signifies the internal man; and 'earth' the external man before regeneration, may be seen from what follows."

"And God said, Let there be light; and there was light. The first state is when man begins to know that the good and the true are something higher. Men who are altogether external do not even know what good and truth are; for they fancy all things to be good that belong to the love of self and the love of the world; and all things to be true that favor these loves; not being aware that such goods are evils, and such truths falsities. But when man is conceived anew, he then begins for the first time to know that his goods are not goods, and also, as he comes more into the light, that the Lord is, and that He is good and truth itself."
