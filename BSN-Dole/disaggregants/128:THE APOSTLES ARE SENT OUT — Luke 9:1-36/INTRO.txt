=== INTRO

There are really four parts to this lesson. We have chosen the sending out of the apostles as the center of our study because we have had a lesson on the feeding of the multitude and one on the transfiguration in our studies of the other Gospels. Both these stories, as well as the Lord's question and Peter's answer can easily be taken up in direct relation to the assigned topic, as examples and types of the Lord's preparation of the apostles for their life work.
