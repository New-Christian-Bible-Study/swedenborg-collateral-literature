=== From the Writings of Swedenborg

@AE 4559: "'Midian' here means those who do not care for truth, because they are merely natural and external: therefore Midian was smitten by those who 'lapped the waters in the hand with the tongue like a dog'; these mean such as have an appetite for truths, thus who from some natural affection seek to know truths, a 'dog' signifying appetite and eagerness, 'waters' truths, and 'lapping them with the tongue' to have an appetite for and eagerly seek. So it was by these that Midian was smitten. Anyone can see that such things would not have been commanded unless they had been significative."

@AC 8815: "The Divine truth which passes through heaven is also represented by ... the trumpets with which the three hundred men who were with Gideon sounded round about the camp of Midian, Amalek, and the sons of the east (Judges 7). The reason why the trumpets produced this effect was that they represented the truth Divine through the heavens, which is such that it perfects the good, but destroys the evil; the reason why it perfects the good is that these receive the Divine good which is in the truth; but that it destroys the evil is because these do not receive the Divine good which is in it .... 'Midian, Amalek, and the sons of the east,' round about whose camp the three hundred men of Gideon sounded the trumpets, signified those who were in evils and in the derivative falsities."
