=== From the Writings of Swedenborg

@AC 6988: "That this signifies no utterance, is evident from the signification of 'dumb,' as being no utterance. ... By 'utterance' is not here meant that of the voice, or speech, for this utterance is natural; but by 'utterance' is meant confession of the Lord, and the profession of faith in Him; for this utterance is spiritual. Hence it is evident [inde patet] what is signified in the internal sense by the 'dumb,' namely, they who cannot confess the Lord, thus cannot profess faith in Him, by reason of ignorance, in which state are the nations outside the church, and also the simple within the church."
