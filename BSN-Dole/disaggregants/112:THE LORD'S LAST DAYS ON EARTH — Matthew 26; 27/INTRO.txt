=== Introduction

Part of the lesson time must be spent upon the literal story of the the trial and crucifixion to be sure the order of events is known. The principal effort should be to bring out the thought that the cross symbolizes victory, the victory of the Lord's goodness and truth over all the forces of evil. It should also be pointed out that the Lord's victory can enable us to conquer, if we accept His guidance and look to Him for strength. We must obey Him if we are to be partakers in His victory. In telling of the betrayal suggest that we also may betray the Lord by not trying to live according to the teachings we profess to believe. All the classes should be told that the Holy Supper was instituted by the Lord during His last celebration of the Passover, and that it takes the place of the Passover for the Christian Church.
