=== From the Writings of Swedenborg

@TCR 412-416: "Those who do not know what the term neighbor means in its true sense, suppose that it means nothing else than the individual man, and that loving the neighbor means conferring benefits upon him. But the neighbor and love to him have a wider meaning and a higher meaning as individuals are multiplied ... Thus, a community smaller or greater is the neighbor because it is a collective man; and from this it follows that he who loves a community loves those of whom the community consists; therefore he who wills and acts rightly towards a community consults the good of each individual ... One's country is more a neighbor than a single community ... Moreover, loving one's country is loving the public welfare ... It should be known that those who love their country and render good service to it from good will, after death love the Lord's kingdom, for then that is their country, and those who love the Lord's kingdom love the Lord Himself, because the Lord is the all in all things of His kingdom ... Since man was born for eternal life, and is introduced into it by the church, the church is to be loved as the neighbor in a higher degree. ... This does not mean that the priesthood should be loved in a higher degree. ... The priesthood merely serves, and is to be honored so far as it serves. ... The Lord's kingdom is the neighbor that is to be loved in the highest degree. ... He who loves the Lord's kingdom loves all in the world who acknowledge the Lord and have faith in Him and charity towards the neighbor; and he loves also all in heaven. Those who love the Lord's kingdom love the Lord above all things ... Therefore love towards the Lord's kingdom is love towards the neighbor in its fullness."
