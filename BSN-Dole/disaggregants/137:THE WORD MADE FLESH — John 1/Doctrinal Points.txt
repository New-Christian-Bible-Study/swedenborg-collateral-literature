=== Doctrinal Points

The Lord came into the world as divine truth. Jesus Christ was God Himself incarnate.

The Lord's life on earth was the fulfillment of the Old Testament Scriptures.

We become "sons of God" as we make His truth the director of our thought and conduct. We receive the truth only when we want to obey it.

The Lord's love can come into our hearts only as we obey His truth.
