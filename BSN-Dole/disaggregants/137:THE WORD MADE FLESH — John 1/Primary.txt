=== For Younger Children

[.underline]#*Teacher Notes:*# 
After the introduction and the reading of the lesson an attempt should be made to show why we call the Bible "the Word," and what the first verse means. Impress upon them that Jesus Christ was God Himself come into the world. You will also be able to show them why we think of the Word on the altar in the church as the presence of the Lord with us, and why the minister opens it at the beginning of the service and closes it at the end.

Do you remember the story of Jonah?

How did Jonah feel about people like the Assyrians who were not of his own nation? The religious leaders after Jonah's time went right on feeling the same way. They were the only people in the world who had the Scriptures, and the Lord had told them over and over again to teach the people around them, but they would not.

In time most of the people did not know what the Scriptures really said, because most of them could not read, and the learned men — the scribes and Pharisees — taught them instead a great many rules which they had made up themselves. So the Lord could no longer reach people here in this world through the Scriptures. He had to come into the world Himself to correct the false teachings of the scribes and Pharisees and show the people by His example just how they ought to live.

You know the stories about the Lord's birth in Bethlehem and about the Wise Men and the shepherds.

The Gospel of John tells us something still greater. Let us read the first verse of our chapter.

This tells us two things: It tells us that the Bible is the Lord Himself speaking to us; and it tells us that the Lord Jesus was God Himself come into the world to live out the truth that is in the Bible, so that men can see it and always be sure what it is and what it means.

How did the Lord show John the Baptist that Jesus was the promised Messiah?

When you say something, you yourself are in the words you say.

Speaking is the way you let other people know what you think and how you feel. So the Bible is the Lord speaking to us, telling us His thoughts and feelings, and we call it the Lord's Word. When the Lord came into the world, He came to show people the same things He had taught in the Word.
