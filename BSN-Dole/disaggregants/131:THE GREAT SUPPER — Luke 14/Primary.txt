=== For Younger Children

[.underline]#*Teacher Notes:*# 
Even the little children can get a glimpse of the spiritual meaning in this parable. It is good to emphasize with them the idea of the church as the Lord's house to which they are invited every Sunday.

---
The Pharisees were the Lord's enemies, but they pretended to be His friends because so many of the people believed in the Lord and followed Him. The Pharisees were a group of people who pretended to be especially religious, and so considered themselves better than anybody else. They would not associate with poor people. But the Lord told them over and over again that their attitude was wrong.

Why did the Lord rebuke them at the feast?

In the parable the Lord told them the man who invited his friends to dinner means the Lord.

The Lord invites all of us to receive instruction and goodness from Him. Do we ever refuse His invitation?

What three excuses were given in the parable?

Sometimes people today think they are too busy to go to church.

But the church is the Lord's house and it is He who invites us to come there.

Whom did the man in the parable find to sit at his table?

The poor and maimed and halt and blind picture the people who realize how much they need the Lord.

You see, the Lord came into the world to help everybody, but He could not help the people who were so satisfied with themselves that they thought they did not need His help. Such people were like the ones in the parable who were so interested in their own affairs that they could not take time to have dinner with the friend who was kind enough to invite them.

Remember this when you think you would rather stay home and play than go to church and Sunday school. You know that the church is the Lord's house. It is really the Lord who is inviting you to come to church every Sunday and hear the good things He has to tell you in His Word.
