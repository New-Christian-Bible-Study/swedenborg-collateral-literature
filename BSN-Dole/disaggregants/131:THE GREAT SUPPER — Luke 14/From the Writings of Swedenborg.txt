=== From the Writings of Swedenborg

@AE 252: "As suppers signify consociations by love and consequent communication of delights, therefore the Lord compared the church and heaven to a 'supper,' and also to a 'wedding'; to a 'supper' in Luke ... (14:16-24). (Nearly the same is meant by the wedding to which invitations were given in Matthew 22:1-15.) 'Supper' here means heaven and the church; 'those called who excused themselves' mean the Jews with whom the church then was; for the church specifically is where the Word is, and where the Lord is known through the Word. 'The poor, the maimed, the halt, and the blind,' mean those who are spiritually such, and who were then outside the church. Heaven and the church are here likened to 'a supper' and to 'a wedding,' because heaven is the conjunction of angels with the Lord by love, and their consociation among themselves by charity, and the consequent communication of all delights and felicities; the like is true of the church, since the church is the Lord's heaven on the earth."
