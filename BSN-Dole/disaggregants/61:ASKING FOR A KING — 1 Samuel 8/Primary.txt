Point out why the people wanted a king and, if you have time, read them verses 11 to 18. Be sure they make the distinction between the names Samson and Samuel. See how much they remember of the Samuel story. In the lesson itself, stress the Lord's words to Samuel.

---
Samuel was not only the last of the Judges, he was the greatest of them. The others had been leaders over one or two of the tribes, but Samuel was recognized as leader of the whole people. For by Samuel's time the Israelites were beginning to see that they were strong only when they looked to the Lord for guidance, and Samuel was a religious instead of a military leader.

Do you remember where he was brought up?

Do you remember the story of how the Lord spoke to him in the night? Because of this all the people recognized Samuel as the one through whom the Lord would speak to them and direct them — a prophet of the Lord. His home was at Ramah near the center of the land.

From there he went about hearing the people's problems and judging them. When he was old, what did he do which displeased the people?

What did they ask him to do?

Was Samuel pleased?

What did the Lord tell him?
