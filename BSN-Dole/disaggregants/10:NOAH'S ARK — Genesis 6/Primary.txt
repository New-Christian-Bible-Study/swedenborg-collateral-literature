Even young children can get the idea that disobedience always leads to trouble. The fact that people got so bad that they had to be destroyed is the introduction for the lesson today. But Noah was good, and the Lord always takes care of us when we are good. The children will enjoy hearing about the ark and the people and animals in it. They should learn the name Noah, and, if possible, also Shem, Ham, and Japheth.

You remember how kindly the Lord took care of the first people in the beautiful Garden of Eden. Do you remember what was the one thing He told them not to do? They began to think about this tree, and its fruit looked very good to them, and so finally they disobeyed the Lord and ate of the fruit. They thought the Lord would not know, but He did. The Lord knows everything we do and He knows our thoughts and feelings, too.

So the first people had to leave the beautiful garden and go out and work for their food. The Lord cannot give us things if we do not use them as they are meant to be used.

When we once begin to disobey our parents, we are very likely to begin to do more and more wrong things. So the early people, after they were sent out of the Garden of Eden, went from bad to worse until finally they became so bad that the Lord had to get rid of them altogether. They were destroyed by a great flood.

But there were a few people who still wanted to obey the Lord, and the Lord made plans to save them from the flood. Let us read the story of Noah and what the Lord told him to do. [Read Genesis 6:7-22.]

Who were Noah's three sons?

What did the Lord tell him to make?

An ark is a box or chest made to hold something and keep it safe. What was Noah's ark made of?

How was it divided inside?

Where was the window?

Where was the door?

What people went into the ark?

What else was Noah told to take into the ark?

When the flood came, the ark floated on top of the water, and so they were saved.
