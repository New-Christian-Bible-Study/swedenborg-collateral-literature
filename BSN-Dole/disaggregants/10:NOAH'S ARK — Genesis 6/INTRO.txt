=== INTRO

In the internal sense, the stories of the serpent and of Cain and Abel tell of the origin of evil in man's turning from the Lord to self, of the consequent loss of the innocent, celestial state, and of the loss of charity as men became more and more confirmed in self-esteem and self-will. It will be easy in all the classes to introduce the story of Noah by a question concerning the tree of knowledge of good and evil and a brief statement concerning man's first disobedience and its results.
