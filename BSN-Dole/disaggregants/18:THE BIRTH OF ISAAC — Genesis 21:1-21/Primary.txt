Center the story on Ishmael's being sent away because he mocked at the baby Isaac. Even little children have this tendency to make fun of younger brothers and sisters and need to be taught to be gentle and kind. The story of both Ishmael and Isaac will interest the children. They should learn the names Hagar, Ishmael, and Isaac.

By this time Abraham and Sarah were very old people. Abraham was nearly a hundred years old and Sarah was nearly ninety.

The Lord had made a promise to Abraham that his descendants would inherit the Holy Land and become a great nation, but Sarah had never had a child. Therefore, as we learned recently, she had finally given Abraham her Egyptian servant Hagar for his wife, and Hagar bore him a son, who was named Ishmael.

Abraham loved Ishmael dearly, but the Lord told him that Ishmael was not to be his heir, and that Sarah herself should have a child.

When Ishmael was fourteen, Sarah finally had a son. What was his name? Isaac means "laughter."

How old was Abraham when Isaac was born?

What did Ishmael do which made Sarah ask Abraham to send him away?

Where did Hagar and Ishmael go?

What promise did the Lord make for Ishmael?
