== JACOB AND ESAU — Genesis 25:19-34; 27

Again we have a story about two brothers, but this time they are twins with the same mother as well as the same father. The teacher should fill in a little of the background by telling how Abraham sent his servant up to Haran, where his brother Nahor had settled, to bring back a wife for Isaac from his own people. Sarah had already died, and after Isaac married Rebekah, Abraham died also.

=== Doctrinal Points

The Lord is merciful to us, and uses even our selfishness to teach us spiritual lessons.

The people in the Bible are not meant to be examples for us to imitate. Only the Lord's life is our example.

=== Notes for Parents

Rebekah, Isaac's wife, came from Haran. When Abraham and his family took the long journey from their home in Ur of Chaldea to the land of Canaan, his brother Nahor started the journey with him but stopped part way at Haran, and decided to settle there. Rebekah was Nahor's granddaughter. The Jews were many times commanded not to intermarry with the people among whom they happened to live. In this way their line was kept pure. The deeper reason for the prohibition was, of course, that they might not be drawn away into other religions.

Isaac and Rebekah had no children for twenty years, and then the twins Esau and Jacob were born. They were not identical twins. Esau was red and hairy — his other name Edom means "red" — while Jacob was a "smooth" man. And Esau was a "cunning hunter, a man of the field," while Jacob stayed at home tending the flocks and herds. Esau was his father's favorite, and Jacob was his mother's.

We have seen in past lessons that the people in the Bible stories were far from perfect. This is clearly illustrated in our two stories for today. Jacob in the first place drove a shrewd bargain with his brother, but Esau's fault was even greater, in being willing to sacrifice his proper future in order to satisfy his immediate physical hunger. Esau, as the firstborn, was entitled to the birthright, the right to be his father's heir. He was also entitled to the better blessing from his father, and here both Jacob and Rebekah obviously did wrong. But when the deceit was successfully carried out, Esau was so angry that he determined to kill his brother. There was not much to choose between Esau and Jacob.

In the Bible we often find stories about pairs of brothers: Cain and Abel, Joseph's two sons Ephraim and Manasseh, and in the New Testament Peter and Andrew and James and John. In our progress through life everything we "bring forth" has a twofold character, including both intention and thought, will and understanding. We know that Abraham represents our innocent little childhood; and Isaac, the development of our reasoning faculty. Esau and Jacob follow. They represent the period when young people are beginning their independent lives in the world, taking jobs or going away to college, standing on their own feet for the first time apart from their parents. Esau, the firstborn, is the natural will at this time, and Jacob is the understanding. Both are faulty. The point of our Bible story is that although the will is primary — we never do anything which is not prompted by a desire of some kind — it is always necessary for us to set our understanding before our will, to think before we act, even when our thoughts are very imperfect, and to control our impulses until we have learned to be really wise and to prefer to do the right things.

=== Primary

The lesson can be centered on the first story about the selling of the birthright. Be sure to explain what a birthright was. The later story can be read at the end, if there is time. Try to teach the children the names Esau and Jacob, but keep in their minds especially the series of names Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. They should be able to see that both Esau and Jacob did wrong, and that they both suffered as a result.

You remember that when Abraham started out from his home in Ur to go to the land of Canaan, his brother Nahor went with him but did not go all the way. He stopped about halfway, at a place called Haran, and settled there.

After Isaac grew up, Abraham did not want him to marry any of the Canaanite women; so he sent his most trusted servant back to Haran to find a wife for Isaac in his own brother's family. The servant brought back Nahor's granddaughter Rebekah, and Isaac was very happy to marry her.

Isaac and Rebekah had no children for twenty years. But finally they had twins, whom they named Esau and Jacob.

Which was the firstborn?

Were the twins alike?

What did Esau like to do?

What did Esau ask Jacob to give him?

What bargain did Jacob make with him?

Esau was very foolish to sell his birthright just to satisfy his hunger, and Jacob did wrong to take advantage of his brother in this way. And later he did something still worse.

Which of the twins was Isaac's favorite?

Which was Rebekah's favorite?

When Isaac was old, what did he ask Esau to do?

Rebekah helped Jacob to deceive his father by pretending to be Esau.

When Esau came back with his venison, his father was very much upset, but he told him he could not take back the blessing he had given Jacob. He gave Esau a different blessing — really a better one (see Genesis 27:39-40) - but Esau was still so angry that he said he was going to kill Jacob. So Rebekah persuaded Isaac to send Jacob away to Haran, her former home, for a long visit.

=== Junior

Have the children trace again on a map the journey of Abram from Ur to Canaan, find Haran, and remind them of Nahor's settling there. This will introduce Rebekah, as Nahor's granddaughter. There are several lessons suggested in the Junior notes which children of this age can easily understand. Stress especially the fact that when we do wrong, we always suffer for it sooner or later, even though at the time we may seem to "get away with it."

Whom did Isaac marry?

Where did she come from?

Isaac and Rebekah lived together for twenty years before they had children. Then they had twin sons.

What were their names?

Which was the firstborn?

Were they identical twins?

Esau means "hairy," and Edom, the other name by which Esau is called, means "red." You want to remember that Esau was the father of the Edomites, who appear several times in the Bible story, usually as enemies of the Israelites.

Verses 29 to 34 of chapter 25 tell how both Esau and Jacob did wrong. In the King James Version there are some unfamiliar words in the story. Pottage is something cooked in a pot, like soup or stew. Sod is an old past tense of the verb seethe and means "boiled." The birthright was the right of the oldest son to become head of the family after his father's death. Lentils are any kind of bean or pea; there are several varieties, one of which is red.

Jacob did wrong in taking advantage of his brother's hunger and weakness to drive a sharp bargain, and Esau did wrong in giving up a valuable privilege to satisfy his appetite. Whenever we do something wrong in order to get something we happen to want very much at the moment, we are "selling our birthright for a mess of pottage"; this is a common expression taken from this story. What do you think our "birthright" really is? Read Matthew 25:31-34. We are different from animals in that we are capable of learning about the Lord and obeying Him, and thus of coming to love Him and be "inheritors" of His kingdom in heaven. We can think about His will and judge whether the things we want to do are good or bad in His sight. Animals cannot think about God or about right and wrong. They are governed by their instincts and appetites. So whenever we let ourselves be governed by our natural desires, we are putting ourselves on the level of animals and "selling our birthright."

Which son was the favorite of Isaac? 

Which was Rebekah's favorite?

When Isaac was very old and almost blind and knew it was nearly time for him to die, he wanted to give Esau his blessing — the special blessing which was the right of the firstborn. This was customary among the Jews. The Bible records several instances of it. The father's final blessing was very precious to the son.

What did Isaac ask Esau to do for him?

Why did Rebekah want Jacob to deceive his father?

How did she help him do it?

Isaac was doubtful. He said, "The voice is Jacob's voice, but the hands are the hands of Esau." Still, he gave him the blessing. When Jacob was gone and Esau came in with his venison and Isaac knew that he had been deceived, he said he could not take back the blessing.

Does it seem strange that Jacob should have been permitted to get his blessing by deceit? Jacob did not go unpunished for his wrongdoing. He had to flee from his brother's anger and spend many long years far from home, and finally he had to bow down before his brother and ask his forgiveness. The Lord used the people in the Bible just as they were, to teach lessons which you will understand when you are a little older. He made even their wrongdoing serve a use. We must study the stories carefully to find the lessons and not think that because someone was blessed by the Lord, everything he did was right. We know that we often do wrong things, and yet think of all the blessings the Lord gives us!

Read carefully the blessing Isaac gave Jacob and the blessing he gave Esau. We shall see that both these blessings were fulfilled. Esau's plan to kill his brother shows something of his character, just as his willingness to sell his birthright does.

Rebekah's plan to save Jacob was also used by the Lord. It started a whole train of circumstances which we shall study in our later lessons. Everything we do, every decision we make, changes the course of our lives. We should try hard, therefore, to learn to make wise and right decisions.

Where was Haran?

Who lived there?

=== Intermediate

In this lesson the general correspondence of Jacob and Esau is taken up first because it completes the Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob series. The young people should have these patriarchs and their general meaning very clearly in mind before they go on. The reason for Jacob's taking precedence over Esau can be related to the correspondence of Isaac. That is, we need to know truth and to reason from spiritual principles. This is a good opportunity to be sure that the young people understand that the New Church does not teach that all Bible characters are examples to be imitated. The Intermediates are old enough to understand how this can be, and to recognize it without losing any of their reverence for the Word.

Abraham died and was gathered to his people. The childhood state of simple obedience in our lives passes away finally and is replaced by the rule of the rational, which is Isaac. As we grow out of our young childhood, our minds develop and we begin to think for ourselves and finally to act independently. Isaac represents the thinking and Jacob and Esau the acting period. Our independent lives are developing and progressing, but at the same time they are coming down from the high plane of innocence and trust which characterized our infancy to the level of the outside world. Here our life is clearly divided between our desires and our knowledge — Esau and Jacob. The Lord wants both to be good, to be led by Him, but by nature we are selfish and lacking in wisdom. Both Esau and Jacob were faulty. And our desires and our knowledge conflict, just as there was trouble between Esau and Jacob.

Esau, Isaac's firstborn son, pictures the love or desire side and Jacob the truth or thought side of our activity in the world. Desire comes first. If we had no desires, we should neither think nor act. But in order to do what we want we must first learn how. So actually Jacob has to take the first place for a time. Jacob means "supplanter." He supplants his older brother.

The character of Jacob in the Bible has puzzled some people; they have assumed that anyone the Lord prospered must have been a thoroughly good person and meant for us to copy. But this is not so. The people in the Bible had good and bad qualities, just as we have, and we are to learn from their stories, even in the letter, what not to do as well as what to do, and about the Lord's tender and merciful dealing with men even when they make serious mistakes. Jacob took a mean advantage of his brother, but Esau also did wrong in despising his birthright — the cherished right of the firstborn to follow his father as head of the family — and giving it away to satisfy his hunger. It may seem to us very unlikely that he would really do this. Yet we do the same sort of thing constantly. We are always giving up something important which we might have at some future time for the sake of some unimportant thing we happen to want right now. Our birthright is the right to know and love the Lord — that is what makes us men instead of animals — to be "sons of God" and to "inherit the kingdom of heaven." Whenever we sacrifice our Christian ideals for the sake of some worldly satisfaction which we want at the moment, we are selling our birthright for a mess of pottage. Jacob could not have cheated Esau if Esau had not yielded to temptation. We sometimes feel, as Esau did, that we shall "die" if we do not get what we want, but the Lord will always give us strength to resist temptation if we really try.

In the second part of our lesson Jacob pretends to be Esau.

We often pretend to be the kind of people we wish we were. The Lord knows our real motives. But He does not take away his blessing, since it is better for us to do right from selfish motives than not to do right at all, and this is one of the ways in which we form good habits and gradually come to love doing what is right. Esau, too, was a mixture of good and bad. He wanted to be blessed and was willing to obey his father and to take a great deal of trouble to procure the blessing. But he was also ready to kill his brother because of his disappointment. When we do not get what we want, don't we sometimes want to hurt somebody? Esau and Jacob in their youth were both thoroughly selfish just as we are in the beginning.

It was a long time before Jacob and Esau were reconciled, and both had to go through years of hard work and discipline first. It takes all our lives in this world to bring our desires and our thinking together in the service of the Lord.

=== Basic Correspondences

Esau = good on the natural plane of life
Jacob = truth on the natural plane of life

=== Senior

Call the attention of the Seniors to the collateral lines which develop from the characters who are dropped by the way: the Moabites and Ammonites from Lot, the Ishmaelites from Ishmael, and now the Edomites from Esau. These tribes represent thoughts and feelings which we develop at various stages and which remain in our background and come up to trouble us later. We are tracing one thread — the Lord's influence in our lives — but there are other "side lines" branching off here and there from the true line, all of which must eventually be brought into order and under the control of the Lord. This will help to relate the Sunday school lessons to the young people's school and home and recreational activities, and will help to show them the primary importance of religious instruction.

The obvious lesson of the literal story of our first chapter is summed up in the common expression "selling one's birthright for a mess of pottage"; for everyone can see that Esau made a foolish trade, and we know, if we really look at ourselves honestly, that we are all frequently tempted to grasp at some present outward satisfaction at the sacrifice of a future great and more interior good.

But the deeper lessons of the chapter are hidden. We need first to realize that with the birth of Esau and Jacob, we reach the third and final stage in our development from infancy to manhood. We all like to look back upon our early childhood, and we recognize the beauty of its innocent, trusting spirit; but the time comes when our thinking must be made actual in deeds. The rational stage of our development — the Isaac stage — must end, and we must begin to seek an independent place in the external life of the world. Esau and Jacob represent this external, "practical" plane of life. And because it is in the carrying out of our purposes that we must finally be specific, it is here that the separation between will and thought, desire and knowledge, becomes evident.

So now instead of a single son we have twins. Esau pictures the will and Jacob the intellect: twin brothers yet often in conflict. The will is the firstborn because there must be motive before there can be any thought. But because the human will is by birth selfish, the intellect must for a time take first place. The selfishness and shortsightedness of our natural affections and impulses are pictured in Esau's willingness to give up his whole future to satisfy his present physical hunger.

In our second story Isaac is old and his eyes are dim. When we pass from the thinking stage of our teens to active, independent life, we are likely to become so absorbed in the external affairs of every day that we do not see clearly for a time. We are easily deceived by appearances. Our wills are not yet unselfish. The wild game which Esau brought for his father represents our own ideas of goodness with which we like to be satisfied. Jacob is permitted to substitute two kids of the goats, which represent genuine goodness, though of a natural kind. So our minds help us, although at this stage it is necessary that the truth be made to seem desirable: Jacob puts on Esau's clothing and puts the skins of the goats on his hands and on the back of his neck to make himself appear like Esau.

This does not mean that Jacob did right. The Lord permitted the deception to teach us that a selfish will must not be allowed to lead us. We must learn the truth and follow it even though we at first imagine that the truth came out of our own minds, and praise ourselves for thinking of it. This is what is represented by Isaac's words, "The voice is Jacob's voice, but the hands are the hands of Esau."

In the literal story Jacob paid a heavy penalty. He, the more home—loving of the two brothers, had to start off alone and serve many years in a strange land before he was allowed to return and enjoy his inheritance. Haran, to which he went, represents a state of simple obedience. After we have developed our faculties and begun our independent life in the world, we have to go through a long period of doing right just because we know we ought to, before the Lord can develop in us the real love of truth and goodness which enables us to enter into our true spiritual home.

=== Adult

There is plenty of discussion material here, especially in the thought that "natural good" - which is Esau — is never pure or trustworthy, and that our real spiritual progress is dependent upon Jacob, our interest in truth.

Swedenborg says: "There are in every man an internal man, a rational man that is intermediate, and an external, which is properly called the natural man. With the Lord these were represented by Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob" (@AC 1893). The Abraham stage with us is our infancy, when the internal man is open to the heavens and is filled by the Lord with "remains" — innocent, trustful, happy states which can later be used in our regeneration. Then we develop into the rational or Isaac stage, and finally are ready to carry out in everyday life the knowledges and affections which we have developed in the previous stages. The rest of our life, if we regenerate, is spent in developing and then in bringing into order this natural or external plane and in gradually bringing it to act as the servant of the inner planes. So, although Abraham and Isaac come first, and in one sense are higher than Jacob, their descendants are called the seed of Jacob or the children of Israel (Israel being the name later given to Jacob by the Lord), and their history occupies the rest of the Old Testament. Our story today deals with Jacob and his elder twin Esau, and of how Jacob instead of Esau came to be head of the family. We have spoken before of the two divisions of our lives, symbolized by the two rooms in the ark — the will and the understanding. The natural plane of our lives has these two divisions, and they are pictured by Esau and Jacob, Esau good in the natural plane, and Jacob truth in the same plane. They are twins because the will and the understanding, good and truth, go together as equals in us from the beginning.

Esau is actually the elder because all power is from the will, even the power to think, and influx from the Lord or from the hells primarily affects our wills. Throughout most of our life, however, Jacob supplants Esau, because we have to learn what is right before we can do it: our understanding appears to take first place. The Lord permits this change, this inversion of the true order, to meet the changed conditions caused by man's turning to self and perverting his will. That is, because by inheritance our will is selfish, we cannot safely be guided by it but must be taught what is right. Jacob instead of Esau must be head of our house. But we note that Esau eventually is to break off the yoke of his brother. This means that when we are regenerated, when we have practiced doing as truth teaches until the Lord has been able to give us a new will, then we may again be ruled by our will and do as we please freely.

The literal story of Esau and Jacob has proved a stumbling block to those who believe that all those in the letter of the Word whom the Lord favors must be exemplary characters. Here is a man who cheated, lied, and stole, and yet was allowed to keep the fruits of his deception and to become the ancestor of the Lord's chosen people. How can we "get around" this obvious fact? In the New Church we do not have to get around it. The Bible characters, with the exception of our Lord, are not in themselves exemplary. Many of them are evil men, doing evil deeds. But the Lord can make use even of their evil deeds to teach us the ins and outs of our own souls and the nature of the humanity which He assumed and glorified. He makes use of evil to show how His providence foresees and provides for all our states and tries to lead us back to Him, however far we may have departed. In the inmost sense, which relates to the life of the Lord, the Word is all true and beautiful. In the inner sense, which relates to our own states, we see the Lord's love and truth acting upon our degenerate human nature in the effort to save us. In the letter we see this struggle acted out upon the stage of real life by the Hebrew nation, the nation chosen to portray it. Thus even in the letter, if we keep the whole face of it in mind when studying any given story, we can see good and evil, truth and falsity at work and trace their effects. We must not expect the letter to portray ideal conditions.

The objection to the story of Jacob and Esau is based on the desire to have all evil punished immediately and obviously. This is not the Lord's desire; it is a very earthly one. The Lord desires to show us our evils and to turn us from them, never to punish. Evil punishes itself, often not immediately or obviously, but surely in the end. The results of Jacob's evils can easily be traced in his fear of Esau not only immediately after his deed but even twenty years later when he returned and sought reconciliation with his brother. Furthermore, Esau himself is far from exemplary. He is willing to sell his birthright — his proper future — to satisfy his immediate physical hunger. Here is a lesson which all can see and understand. How often we put present pleasure above future good! How often for the sake of some trivial thing which we want now we do what we know is injuring our character and our prospects, and even what we know will bring us pain and sorrow later! We know that our eternal happiness depends upon our keeping the commandments, yet we continually allow carelessness, laziness, cowardice, and selfishness to lead us to break them. We know that our spiritual progress depends upon our learning about the Lord and doing His will, yet we let ourselves become absorbed in worldly pursuits and pleasures and neglect our regular reading of the Word and the writings and our worship of the Lord. We know that we are higher than animals just because we have spiritual possibilities which they do not have, yet we choose to live on the level of earthly satisfactions like animals. We think Esau was very foolish, but we do as he did every day.

We have seen that Esau pictures good, and Jacob truth, in the natural plane of our minds. We should all agree that the really important thing is to be good. Esau is the elder twin and the rightful head of the family. Why then does the Lord permit Jacob to supplant Esau? Why do we have to try to keep on learning truth, studying the Word and trying to understand it more and more deeply? If we do what we think is right, is not this all that can be expected of us? Many people today answer this question in the affirmative. Yet have we not often done what we thought was right and found out afterward that it was just the wrong thing? This is our key to the true answer. There is indeed some good in everyone. The Lord has seen to that. But there is also in each of us by our natural inheritance a great deal of evil, and we cannot distinguish between good and evil without truth from the Lord. If we think of ourselves as naturally good and as competent to judge right and wrong without instruction from the Lord, we shall judge and act from evil impulses quite as often as from good ones, and presently we shall believe that whatever we think is true and whatever we want is good, and then we shall be unable to see any fault in ourselves or to improve ourselves in any way. No matter how well we are brought up, we never come to the point in this life when we can safely act from impulse without thought, and our standards are never perfect. Our wills are never wholly pure. We must keep on learning more and more of the Lord's truth and apply it to deeper and deeper states in ourselves. For all our time on earth, Jacob must be the head of our house and Esau must serve him. Not until we get to heaven, where our wills are wholly satisfied to serve the Lord, will Esau be able to take his rightful place.

=== From the Writings of Swedenborg

@DP 234: "There are no laws of permission by themselves or apart from the laws of the Divine providence, but the two are the same; therefore God is said to permit, which does not mean that He wills, but that on account of the end, which is salvation, He cannot avert. Whatever is done for the sake of the end, which is salvation, is according to the laws of the Divine providence. For the Divine providence ... is constantly moving in a way diverse from and contrary to man's will, continually intent upon its end; and in consequence, at every movement of its operation or at every step of its progress, where it observes man to be swerving from that end, it guides, bends, and directs him according to its laws, by leading him away from evil and leading him to good. That this cannot be done without the permission of evil will be seen in what follows. Moreover, nothing can be permitted without a reason, and the reason can be found only in some law of the Divine providence, which law teaches why it is permitted."

JACOB'S DREAM — Genesis 28

We have three easy points of connection between this story and those which have preceded it, points which help us to review. And we must review regularly if we are to present the Bible as a continued story and not just as a number of separate stories. The three points are: first, Jacob's relation to Isaac and to Abraham; second, the place Haran; and third, the place Bethel.

=== Doctrinal Points

The Lord is always present with us and watching over us. The Word is the connecting link between man and the Lord.

We find the basis of our faith in the truths of the letter of the Word.

Anointing with oil is the symbol of confirming truth by loving it.

=== Notes for Parents

This beautiful story is familiar to us all. We can picture the young man Jacob starting out on a long journey all by himself with no certainty as to where he would get food or how he would prosper, and also with the knowledge of the wrong he had done his brother and of his brother's anger. He could not have been in a very happy state of mind. We all have times when we are very much like Jacob. We too do wrong and carry burdens on our conscience, and we too often have to start out on new undertakings with very little assurance as to how things will turn out for us.

Have you ever thought how many stories there are in the Bible which concern sleep? Swedenborg tells us that the reason why we need so much sleep is that when we are asleep our minds are taken off the things of this world and of our own success and desires, and the Lord can draw closer to us and renew our souls. Our souls need sleep even more than our bodies do. Little children need a great deal of sleep because it is in infancy and early childhood that the Lord stores up in them states of trust and innocence which will help them all their lives.

So Jacob had a wonderful dream which gave him hope and courage and led him to promise to serve the Lord all his life. Jacob's dream is a picture of something we may have in our own lives which will give us courage and strength to face all our problems and troubles if only we will take advantage of it. The Bible is our "Jacob's ladder." Its foot is on the earth; that is, it is written in terms of everyday life, which we can understand. But its top is in heaven, and the Lord is there at the top. The ascending angels are our thoughts going up to Him as we read it and the angels that are descending on it are His truths which He speaks to us through it.

=== Primary

Teach the children the three names in the series Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. We can try also to teach them Haran and Bethel, which should be somewhat familiar from earlier stories. There will be no trouble in interesting them in the story of the dream, and they will probably be able to repeat it. Emphasize the fact that the Holy Land was the real home of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, so that Jacob hated to leave it and was looking forward to coming back.

It will also be a good thing to have them learn the names of the wives of Abraham and Isaac. Particularly connect Jacob's setting up of the stones after his dream with Abraham's building an altar at the same place. Tell them that Bethel means "house of God."

Isaac grew up to become a great man, as his father had been. His wife's name was Rebekah, and she was the granddaughter of Abraham's brother Nahor, who had settled in a place called Haran.

Isaac and Rebekah had twin sons, Jacob and Esau, You know that most twins look very much alike. But Jacob and Esau were very different in looks and also in character, and they didn't get along well together. So when they grew old enough, Isaac and Rebekah thought it would be a good thing to separate them for a while.

They sent Jacob to Haran to visit his uncle Laban. They hoped, too, that he would find a wife there. Abraham and Isaac had both been told by the Lord that they and their family ought not to marry any of the women who lived about them in the land of Canaan, because these women worshiped idols instead of the Lord.

The journey to Haran was a long journey for young Jacob to take alone, and he was not very sure that he would be safe on the way and would be able to find enough to eat. And then, too, Jacob loved his own home and wanted most of all to be sure he would return to it.

What was one of the places where Jacob stopped for the night?

What did he use for a pillow?

What did he see in his dream?

What did the Lord tell him?

How did Jacob feel when he woke?

What did he call the place?

Bethel means "house of God."

What did Jacob do with the stones he had used for his pillow?

Do you remember someone else who had built an altar at Bethel? 

What did Jacob promise the Lord?

The dream gave him courage for the long journey, because it showed him that the Lord was near him all the time and watching over him. The Lord is near us all the time, too, watching over us and taking care of us.

And we, too, have a Jacob's ladder which connects us with Him. Do you know what it is?

It is the Word.

When we study the Word, our thoughts go up to the Lord and the Lord's thoughts come down to us, just like the angels ascending and descending on the ladder.

Do you know that the word angel means "messenger"?

=== Junior

The meaning of the "ladder" can easily be taught to children of this age, and they will find it a new and striking way of thinking of the Bible. The correspondence of stones and of oil can also be given. Have them locate Beersheba, Bethel, and Haran on a map. By now they should be able to recall the past events connected with Haran and Bethel. Be sure they know the meaning of the word "angel." Have them look up the last book in the Old Testament and tell them the meaning of its name.

Isaac and Rebekah had twin sons, Esau and Jacob. Jacob was the one through whom the Hebrew nation was to be carried on; so Isaac sent him also to Haran to find a wife. He traveled all alone, and we find that when he started, he was not even sure that he would be able to find food and clothing.

How did the Lord encourage him?

Where was he when he had this wonderful dream?

Who had built an altar there a long time before?

What story have we had about something that happened at Bethel? Bethel means "house of God."

Why do you think Jacob named it that?

Can you tell the story of Jacob's dream? The Hebrew word translated "ladder" means a "way of steps." Jacob was lying on the earth with his head on a stone.

Who was at the top of the ladder?

Who were going up and down on it?

The word translated "angel" means "messenger."

Do you know that there really is a "way of steps" between us and the Lord? We are on the earth living every day, working and playing and going to school. And we think of the Lord as in heaven. But every time we read the Bible our thoughts go up toward the Lord and His thoughts come down to us. The Bible is our "Jacob's ladder." Stones on which things are built represent truths. The stones at the foot of Jacob's ladder are the truths we learn in the Bible. Our thoughts are the "angels" or messengers going up, and the Lord's thoughts are the angels coming down. How did Jacob feel about his dream?

What did he do to mark the place?

What did he pour on the stone?

The people of Jacob's time knew from tradition — that is, from things which had been passed down from father to son for many centuries — that there was something holy about olive oil, and that to pour it on anything meant to make the thing holy. This was called "anointing." People in the beginning knew that oil meant love and that all true love comes from the Lord. When we do anything for someone, if we put love into the doing, the Lord is in it through us, and the service is holy. We want to remember what anointing means and why, because we shall have many cases of it in our study of the Bible. Do you know the twenty-third Psalm? Look it up and read verse 5.

What did the Lord promise Jacob?

What did Jacob promise the Lord?

Both these promises were kept.

=== Intermediate

The spiritual meaning of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob should be taught at this point, as well as the general meaning of Jacob's journey and the particular correspondences of the dream. Stress Jacob's need of this encouragement, and our need of the Word to strengthen us for our daily living.

Isaac and Rebekah had twin sons, Esau and Jacob. Esau was the firstborn, but it was Jacob through whom Abraham's line was to descend. Esau and Jacob were not identical twins, and they did not get along well together. Jacob had to be sent away to escape the anger of Esau, whom he had tricked. Jacob's journey grew out of this incident, but it was also planned that he, like his father, should take a wife in Haran.

The journey was a long one for a young man to take alone, and there were no hotels along the way as there would be today. Jacob slept outdoors wherever he happened to be when night fell. From his words near the end of our chapter, we know that when he lay down to sleep at Bethel he was not feeling very confident about the future. But the dream showed him that the Lord was watching over him, and gave him new courage.

Bethel was one of the places where Abraham built an altar when he first came into the land, and it was also the place where Abram and Lot decided to separate and from which they looked over the land so that Lot might choose the part he preferred. It is called Bethel throughout the Bible story, but apparently the name was actually given it first by Jacob. Bethel means "house of God." The stones which Jacob took for his pillow picture truths, the foundation truths of the Word on which we may rest with confidence. And in the morning Jacob set up these stones for a pillar to mark the place where the Lord had encouraged him and given him a promise and where he also had made a promise to the Lord. Both these promises were kept.

The ladder is the most striking part of the story. The Hebrew word translated "ladder" means a "way" — the translators evidently assumed that a way from earth to heaven must be a ladder, especially since the angels were said to be ascending and descending on it. And the word translated "angel" means "messenger." Can you think what is the "way" by which our angels or messengers go up to the Lord and His angels come down to us? It is the Word. The angels are our thoughts and the Lord's thoughts. The foot of the way is on the earth. That is, the Word is written in human language and in terms of things we can understand. But the Lord is at the top. Jacob's lying down to sleep on stones of the place is a picture of our trusting in what we have learned of the Lord even when we feel alone and afraid. But after his dream, Jacob set the same stones up for a pillar of remembrance and poured oil on them. When we really see how the Word connects us with the Lord, we go forward without fear and we love to think of the truth He has given us. Oil corresponds to love. The custom of "anointing" or pouring oil upon something to signify that it was holy had come down from the times of the Ancient Church, when men knew correspondences. We shall find many instances of it in the Word, and even in our own day it is a part of the ceremony carried out in the coronation of kings and queens.

In the dream the Lord made a promise to Jacob, and Jacob - after he woke and set up the pillar — made a solemn vow to the Lord. This exchange of promises is a "covenant." The Lord's promise is made to all of us just as much as to Jacob, and if we make Jacob's vow and keep it, the Lord will fulfill His promise to us as surely as He did to Jacob. Sometimes people wonder why the Lord should have prospered Jacob, who was obviously such a faulty person. But the story should encourage us very much, for it shows that if we study the Word and try to live according to its precepts, then we too — who are full of faults — can eventually reach our heavenly home, and that the Lord is always close to us trying to show us the true way.

=== Senior

The deeper meaning of Jacob in relation to Abraham and Isaac is especially useful for young people of this age, as well as the need of going back to Haran to renew our childlike good intentions, but with a view always to becoming more and more serviceable to the Lord — coming back to the Holy Land.

This is one of the most striking and best—loved stories in the Bible. The picture is so clear that it has inspired artists: Jacob lying on the ground with his head on the stone, the shining ladder or "way" stretching up to heaven, the bright forms of angels ascending and descending on it, and a suggestion of the Lord's figure in the radiance at the top.

In the inner meaning the vision is still more beautiful. We know that stones represent truths. Truth is sometimes hard, yet we can always depend upon it. When we are in doubt or fear and are entering upon a new course which may bring us into difficulties and dangers, we can have confidence in the truths which we have learned from the Word, knowing that if we keep the Commandments with a desire to serve the Lord, we shall be given strength to meet whatever comes. In the series Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, Abraham represents the time when we are very little children, trusting wholly in our parents and knowing no law except obedience to them; Isaac represents the time when our reasoning faculty is developing and we are trying to decide what is right and wrong according to what we can learn from the Word with the help of our parents and teachers; and Jacob represents the time when we are beginning our independent lives, not perhaps entirely grown up yet, but no longer directly under our parents' control and guidance. So this journey of Jacob in its inner meaning comes very close to the experience of young people just leaving home for college or just beginning to earn their living. At this time we look forward eagerly to the future and yet we are a little anxious, a little fearful of our own powers, and in the back of our minds is the wish for assurance that someone is taking care of us still. We need Jacob's dream to encourage and sustain us.

What is our "way" from earth to heaven? It is the Word of God, which connects earth with heaven and man with God. Its foot is on the earth, the letter of the Word, written in human language about the earth and the people on it. At the top of the way is the Lord: "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God." What are the angels? We remember that the word "angel" means "messenger." Every time we open the Word with a sincere desire to learn of the Lord, our "angels" begin to come down to us. And it was during the dream that the Lord spoke to Jacob and promised him that he should return to his land in time and that the land would be his. As we read the Word, its promises speak to us clearly, telling us that if we are faithful heaven will be ours, whatever our experiences in life may be.

When Jacob woke in the morning, his first reaction was awe.

He realized that the Lord was not far away and unheeding, but present with him and watching over him. He promised to serve the Lord, and he set up the hard stones on which he had been lying as a pillar of remembrance and a witness of the covenant between himself and the Lord. In the same way, when we have once had a vision of what is in the Word, the truths of the letter stand in our minds as assurances, proved by experience. And we, like Jacob, "pour oil upon them"; that is, we love them and think of them as holy, and begin to yield willing service instead of obedience prompted by self-interest, in hope of reward or fear of punishment. Jacob's promise to give the Lord a tenth of all he received represents acknowledgment that all we have is from the Lord and should be used in His service. This is the meaning of the "tithe," which has played a prominent part in church finances even to this day.

We should learn to remember, whenever we seem to be alone and facing difficulties and perhaps dangers, that the Lord is really close to us, and that we can see Him if we go to His Word, lift our thoughts to Him, and try to learn what He has to say to us. Jesus, as He was about to leave His disciples, said: "Remember! I will be with you always, to the end of the age." (Matthew 28:20)

=== Adult

After the general meaning of the story, possible points of special interest may be the reason for going to Haran for wives, the reason why Isaac himself was not allowed to go there while Jacob was, and the meaning of "angel."

We recall that when Isaac grew up, Abraham sent his servant to Haran to find a wife from among his own kindred, and that the servant brought back Rebekah, the granddaughter of Abraham's brother Nahor. Isaac and Rebekah had twin sons, Esau and Jacob. They represent the will and the understanding on the natural plane. Swedenborg says (@AC 1893): "There are in every man an internal man, a rational man that is intermediate, and an external, which is properly called the natural man. With the Lord these were represented by Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob." The Abraham stage with us is our infancy, when the internal man is open to the heavens and is filled by the Lord with "remains" - innocent, trustful, happy states which can later be used in our regeneration. Then we develop into the rational, or Isaac, stage; and finally we are ready to carry out in everyday life the knowledges and affections which we have developed in the previous stages. The rest of our lives is spent, if we regenerate, in bringing into order first this natural or external plane and then successively the rational and the internal plane. So, although Abraham and Isaac come first and in one sense are higher than Jacob, their descendants are called the seed of Jacob or the children of Israel (Israel being Jacob's later name) and their history occupies the rest of the Old Testament. Esau was the firstborn, and we readily recall the story of how Jacob cheated him first of his birthright and then of his blessing. Esau was the firstborn of the twins because Esau represents the will; Jacob, the understanding; and the will actually comes first. All power is from the will, even the power to think. But throughout most of our lives Jacob supplants Esau because we have to learn what is right before we can do it. It is only late in life that Esau begins to break off the yoke of his brother — that is, when by long practice in doing the truth we finally come to love what is good. Esau and his descendants (the Edomites) play only a small part in the Bible narrative. This is because that narrative is concerned with our life in this world, when for the most part we must be under the guidance of truth.

After Jacob had stolen Esau's blessing, Esau threatened to kill him, and his mother Rebekah persuaded Isaac to send him to Haran to find a wife from the family of her brother Laban. We recall that Haran was the place where Abraham and his family stopped for a time on their journey from Ur to Canaan, that Abraham's brother Nahor settled there, and that Abraham's father, Terah, died there. Terah represents the old, idolatrous state; and Haran, the first stage of our progress toward a really good life, before we have reached any real understanding of the truth. That is, Haran represents good and truth of a very external kind, or goodness in an obscure state. Yet this simple goodness is the beginning of all our spiritual progress, and we must constantly be going back and renewing in ourselves this fundamental desire to "be good." Abraham was told by the Lord on no account to allow Isaac himself to go back to Haran; yet Jacob was sent there and spent twenty years there. The reason for this is found in the difference in correspondence between Isaac and Jacob. Isaac represents the true rational, which must remain in the Holy Land of spiritual thinking and lift external and natural knowledges up to itself, as Rebekah was brought out of Haran to the Holy Land to Isaac. Jacob, on the other hand, represents the Lord's working on the natural plane of our lives; so he necessarily must spend a great deal of time in Haran and must unite himself to affections on that plane. We live on the natural plane of thought most of the time. In that plane we try to do right, to distinguish between right and wrong, to form good habits, and gradually to bring that plane up to the level set by the Lord's own example when He lived in the flesh. This is Jacob living in Haran, marrying there, having children, and accumulating flocks and herds — but always with the knowledge that eventually he was to take them all back with him to the Holy Land.

Jacob knew he was to come back to the Holy Land because the Lord told him so in the dream which is the subject of our lesson for today, and at the same time the Lord promised him that land for his inheritance. This dream was given him at Bethel. Bethel, the site of the second altar which Abraham built after he entered the Holy Land, pictures a heavenly state in which there is knowledge of celestial things. Jacob's tarrying here is a picture of spiritual preparation for daily life. It was toward evening — the end of the former state — and he took some of the stones of the place for his pillows and lay down to sleep; that is, he rested upon fundamental heavenly truths, and his consciousness of worldly things was for a time suspended. Then he saw the vision of the ladder or "way" reaching from earth to heaven, with the Lord at the top and the angels ascending and descending upon it; and the Lord spoke to him, promising him protection and favor.

Jacob's dream is always a beautiful and appealing picture, and it is all the more beautiful when we see its deeper meaning. What is the "way" which connects earth with heaven and the Lord? It is the Word. Its letter is made up of things of earth and is read and learned by us while we are upon this earth. But within and above the letter are meanings, higher and higher — first about the history of man as a race, then about the development of each one's soul, then about the angels and their life — and highest of all about the Lord's own life and work. From the letter our thoughts can ascend gradually to some knowledge of the Lord Himself; and once we have gained this knowledge, the Lord's spirit and teaching can reach down to us and instruct us even in the little things of life on earth. Perhaps we recall that angel means "messenger." In the Old Testament the same word is used of earthly and of heavenly messengers, and Malachi, the name of the last book of the Old Testament, means "my messenger." The same is true of the Greek word used in the New Testament. Literally, John the Baptist sent "angels" to the Lord to ask if He really was the Messiah. Can we not see our thoughts — like messengers from our minds — climbing up by means of the Word to the Lord, and his thoughts — like messengers — coming down to us through it? We are at the bottom; the Lord is at the top. And if we listen to the Word, we can hear the voice of the Lord telling us that the Holy Land of heavenly life is meant for us, and that He is with us and will keep us wherever we go. But in order to have this vision, we must be in a state in which we rest on the foundation truths of our faith and put our concern for ourselves and the world to sleep.

Jacob needed this vision to keep him from becoming absorbed in the life of Haran. We need it to keep us mindful that heaven is our real home, and to keep us from becoming absorbed in the duties, cares, and pleasures of everyday life in the world. And when Jacob awoke, realizing that he had been granted a vision of the Lord, he set up the stone upon which he had rested as a pillar and poured oil upon it and vowed to serve the Lord and to give Him a tenth of all he should possess. This is a picture of what our reaction should be to the realization that the Word is our means of connection with the Lord. In our lives we should set up the simple, fundamental truths — the Commandments — as our testimony that we are to serve the Lord, and we should put love into the keeping of them, as Jacob poured oil on the pillar. And we should promise to obey the Lord, to worship Him, and to make everything that we have holy, recognizing that it comes from Him, by using it as He would have us use it; this is pictured by the giving of tithes.

=== From the Writings of Swedenborg

Doctrine of the Holy Scripture, n. 78: "It is through the Word that the Lord is present with a man and is conjoined with him, for the Lord is the Word, and as it were with the man in it. The Lord is also Divine truth itself, as likewise is the Word. From this it is evident that the Lord is present with a man and is at the same time conjoined with him, according to his understanding of the Word, for according to this the man has truth and the derivative faith, and also love and the derivative life. The Lord is indeed present with a man through the reading of the Word, but He is conjoined with him through the understanding of truth from the Word, and according thereto; and in proportion as the Lord has been conjoined with a man, in the same proportion the church is in him. The church is within man; the church that is outside of him is the church with a number of men who have the church within them. This is meant by the Lord's words to the Pharisees who asked when the kingdom of God would come: 'The kingdom of God is within you.' (Luke 17:21) Here the 'kingdom of God' means the Lord, and from Him, the church."

JACOB'S WIVES AND SONS — Genesis 29; 35:23-26

The early part of the story of Jacob and Esau and the incident at Haran should be reviewed very briefly. Then ask the pupils about the story of Jacob's dream, and go on from there to the lesson for today.

=== Doctrinal Points

The three planes of life: will, thought, and act, with their technical names: celestial, spiritual, and natural.

The order of development of these planes.

The natural plane has an internal and an external.

No act is genuinely good unless the motive within it is unselfish love for the Lord and the neighbor.

=== Notes for Parents

Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob are called the "patriarchs." The Jews looked to them as the fathers of their race. They were also regularly called in the Bible the "children of Israel." Israel is another name for Jacob. The story of how Jacob came by this name is found in Genesis 32:24-28.

You will remember that Jacob had to be sent away to visit his uncle Laban at Haran because he had taken away from his twin brother Esau — who was the firstborn — both the birthright and the blessing which Esau should have had, and Esau had threatened to kill him. Does it seem strange that the Lord should have allowed one who would do such things to become his father's heir and head of the family? If it does, we should think whether our lives have always been such that we deserve the blessings which the Lord has given us. There is only one perfect character in the Bible and that is the Lord Jesus. All the others are men and women like ourselves, with faults as well as virtues. The Psalmist writes: "If thou, Lord, shouldest mark iniquities, O Lord, who shall stand?"

And yet Jacob's sins were not without consequences to him.

He was the home—loving one of the twins, and he had to leave his home and spend twenty years serving his uncle Laban in Haran. He carried his fear of Esau all that time, as we learn from the story of his return in Genesis 32 and 33. If we repent, the Lord forgives our sins, but no sin is ever without consequences.

The story of Jacob's meeting and loving Rachel, of his long service for her, of his being given Leah first, and of the birth of his twelve sons is a true story, but it is also a parable. It teaches us how a young person, as he starts out in life, catches a glimpse of an ideal and begins to work eagerly for its achievement, and then finds the way unexpectedly long and hard, beset by difficulties and disappointments. Yet if he is faithful and patient, he will finally reach his goal. We should remember this lesson as we try to help our children choose their life work, and we should also remember that they will find lasting happiness in their work only if they undertake it with the motive of service to the Lord and the neighbor in their hearts. Work done for self never brings happiness or spiritual growth.

=== Primary

As you talk about the lesson, repeat the names Jacob, Leah, and Rachel as often as possible so that the children will become familiar with them. They should also hear about Jacob's long stay in Haran and the fact that he had twelve sons. Mention Joseph as the last son born in Haran, and the fact that Benjamin was not born until after they returned to the Holy Land.

Isaac and Rebekah had twin sons, Jacob and Esau. Even though they were twins, they were not at all alike, and as they grew up they did not get along well together. Once Esau even threatened to kill Jacob. So Isaac and Rebekah sent Jacob away on a visit to Rebekah's old home in Haran.

Do you remember the story of the dream Jacob had on the way? 

When he came to Haran, where did he stop first?

Who came out to water her father's flock?

How did Laban receive Jacob?

What other daughter did Laban have?

What did Jacob ask of Laban?

When the seven years were over, Laban deceived Jacob and gave him Leah instead of Rachel.

So Jacob served another seven years for Rachel.

After that he served another six years, and took his pay in sheep and cattle. How many years does that make altogether?

Leah bore Jacob six sons.

She also gave Jacob her handmaid Zilpah, who bore him two sons. Rachel's handmaid Bilhah bore him two sons.

Eleven sons were born to him in Haran and a twelfth after he got back to the Holy Land. Only the last two were the children of Rachel, the wife whom Jacob loved best.

These last two were Joseph and Benjamin. Joseph was the last one born in Haran. Benjamin was born near Bethlehem. Do you know who else was born at Bethlehem a long time afterward? It was the Lord, when He came into the world to show us how we ought to live.

=== Junior

Get as much of the review as possible from the children themselves. Then cover rapidly the whole story of Jacob's sojourn in Haran, of his wives and sons, and of his return to the Holy Land. Have the children look up Genesis 32:24-28 so that they will learn that Jacob and Israel are the same person. It is important to fix this fact in their minds. They should also be told of Benjamin's birth and Rachel's death near Bethlehem, and about the cave of Machpelah where the three patriarchs and their wives were buried. Two simple lessons should be stressed: Jacob's tendency to think of himself in everything he did, and its long-lasting results; and the fact that we have to work long and patiently to attain anything that is really worthwhile, and that our work should always be done from the desire to be useful to the Lord and the neighbor.

Our lesson today takes us to Haran again. You will remember that Isaac and Rebekah had twin sons, Esau and Jacob; that Esau, who was the firstborn and so should have been his father's heir, sold his birthright to Jacob; and that afterward Jacob, with his mother's help, deceived his father and stole Esau's blessing, and so had to be sent away to escape Esau's wrath. You will remember, too, about the dream Jacob had at Bethel on his way to Haran, and about the promise he made to serve the Lord if the Lord would prosper him and bring him safely home again.

We find now that Rebekah's brother Laban has become the head of the family in Haran.

Where did Jacob stop first when he came to Haran?

What did he find at the well?

What did the shepherds tell him?

Who came to the well with Laban's flock? How did Laban receive Jacob?

What other daughter did Laban have?

Which one did Jacob love?

How many years did he first serve for her?

At the end of the seven years how did Laban deceive him?

What excuse did Laban give?

How much longer did Jacob have to serve for Rachel?

Things do not always turn out just as we expect. Jacob had to learn this. He had made a bargain with the Lord and he had made one with Laban. When we do our work just for what we expect to get out of it for ourselves, we are often disappointed in the result. We need to learn to work for the love of being useful to others and to the Lord. Then our enjoyment in our work is a constant and lasting thing.

The people of this period had no feeling that it was wrong to have more than one wife at a time. So Jacob had two wives and two "concubines" — servants who also bore him children. He had in all twelve sons. You need not learn all their names at once, but you should read the list over often and become familiar with the names, for they appear constantly in the Bible story from this point on, since they became the heads of the twelve tribes of Israel.

Israel is another name for Jacob. El is one of the Hebrew words for God. Israel means "one who prevails with God." In the Bible story, Jacob is sometimes called Jacob and sometimes Israel, and when you are older, you will learn why this is so; for nothing in the Word is ever accidental. All through their history in the Bible the Jews are commonly called the "children of Israel."

Of Jacob's twelve sons six were the children of Leah: Reuben, Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, and Zebulun; and Leah also had a daughter, whose name was Dinah. Two of Jacob's sons, Dan and Naphtali, were the children of Rachel's handmaid Bilhah; and two, Gad and Asher, were the children of Leah's handmaid Zilpah. The two youngest sons, Joseph and Benjamin, were Rachel's children. Joseph was the last one born in Haran. After serving Laban fourteen years for Leah and Rachel, Jacob served him six years more for wages, which he received in sheep and cattle, and then he returned to the Holy Land. Benjamin was born in the Holy Land not far from Bethlehem. The story of his birth is found in Genesis 35:16-20.

The few verses from chapter 35 which we have as part of our lesson give the full list of Jacob's twelve sons. It is good to remember where you may find them. Padan-aram (Genesis 35:26) is a name for the plain in which Haran is situated. This part of the country was afterward Syria, and Aram is another name for Syria. It is also called Mesopotamia, a word which means "between the rivers," because it lies in the triangle between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers.

Jacob stayed with Laban at Haran for twenty years altogether, and yet when he returned home he was still very much afraid that Esau would try to kill him. When we have done harm to someone, one of our punishments is that we have to live with a sense of fear. But Esau, who was the one wronged, had long since forgiven Jacob and welcomed him with open arms. Jacob got back to Hebron in time to see his father Isaac again before he died. We are not told in the Bible just when Rebekah died, but in connection with the story of Jacob's own death in Genesis 49:28-33, we learn that Abraham and Sarah, Isaac and Rebekah, Jacob and Leah were all buried in the cave of Machpelah, which Abraham had bought from the Hittites for a family burial place when Sarah died. Rachel died when Benjamin was born, and was buried near Bethlehem.

=== Intermediate

The important lessons for this age group are the general meaning of the patriarchs as the three planes of our lives, and that these planes develop in order; then that nothing is really accomplished until will and thought are expressed in act; that the plane of conduct has its internal as well as its external; and finally that the external of the natural must be brought into order before any genuine spiritual affections and thoughts can be produced.

Jacob is the third of the men who are called "patriarchs"; Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. In our lesson about Hagar and Ishmael we spoke of the three planes of our lives: will, thought, and act. Everything we do involves all three. We must have some desire before we even think of doing a thing; then we must think about how to do it; and finally we must actually do it, or our desire and thought come to nothing. Again and again in the Bible we find groups of three which picture these three planes in one order or another. Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob represent them in the order of their development. Abraham pictures our infancy and little childhood when we are governed by our desires, Isaac our later childhood and early youth when our minds are being developed and trained, and Jacob our later youth when we are beginning to take up active duties in the world. More technical names for these three planes are celestial, spiritual, and natural. So in the development of a good life — the subject of the Bible in its internal sense — we have to pass through these three stages: we first have to want to be good, then we have to learn what is good, and finally we have to do what we have learned to be right. The story of Jacob is the story of the development of this outward or natural plane of goodness.

Jacob was by no means a model character. Like most of us, at the start he had his own interests in view and was willing to serve himself by getting the better of someone else. And even when his wonderful vision of the ladder induced him to decide to serve the Lord, he had his own safety and success in mind. We are all inclined to be selfish to begin with, and the Lord uses our very selfishness as a means of inducing us to lead orderly lives.

The same lesson is repeated in another form in our chapter for today. Jacob did reach Haran safely and stopped outside the city at the same well where Abraham's servant had found Rebekah. The well, you remember, pictures the letter of the Word. When we are trying to live good lives, our first stopping place must always be the Word, for that is where the water of truth from the Lord is found. As our chapter tells us, all the flocks must gather at this well to drink. The sheep represent innocent and trustful affections.

In the Bible husbands represent goods and wives the affection for the kind of truth which belongs with the particular good pictured by their husbands. Isaac had to have a wife from Haran, but Ishmael's wife — like his mother — was from Egypt. Our story has a very interesting meaning which you will probably not find too difficult to understand. Jacob meets Rachel at the well and loves her at sight. He is willing to serve seven years for her, "and they seemed unto him but a few days, for the love he had to her." But when the seven years are over, he is given her sister Leah first and has to serve seven more years for Rachel [although she was given to him after one week (see Genesis 29:27-28).]

Leah and Rachel both picture affection for truth, but for truth of different kinds. Leah, the older, represents "the affection of external truth" and Rachel "the affection of internal truth." Have you ever had beautiful thoughts about growing up to be a wonderfully fine person whom everyone would love? This is Rachel. Perhaps for a whole day you tried to be that kind of person and you were very happy and the day went like the wind. But somehow your beautiful ideal slipped away from you, and you began to find doing right much less beautiful and desirable because it involved so much everyday, plodding study and work. That is Leah, the "tender" (weak) eyed. Before we can attain the constant joy in serving the Lord, we have to form the habit of doing what is right even when we can't see clearly what it all leads to.

And this brings us to the sons of Jacob. In the Bible the birth of children pictures the producing of truth and good. As Jacob represents genuine goodness in the natural or outward plane of life, his twelve sons represent all the different goods and truths which can be produced in our souls by a good outward life, lived from the desire to serve the Lord. The sons of Leah are born first — faith and love and good deeds and good will of an external kind. Next are the sons of the two handmaids — lesser truths and goods which serve the higher ones. Last of all are born the sons of Rachel — true interior love and understanding, which are the means of our salvation and regeneration or rebirth as spiritual instead of merely worldly people. It is a long process, but that is just what our life in the world is for.

Study carefully the chart which shows the sons of Jacob with their mothers, and remember where it is for reference, because the twelve sons are the heads of the twelve tribes of Israel. Israel is another later name for Jacob (read Genesis 32:24-28). The names and correspondence of the twelve sons play a constant part in the Bible story, the last mention of them being in Revelation 21:12, where we find them written on the gates of the New Jerusalem. We cannot take them up individually now, but we shall study some of them in connection with later lessons. The order in which they are born is the order in which they develop in our lives if we are progressing spiritually, and when we are discouraged with our progress it may help us to remember that the highest goods and truths were the very last to be born. We shall have more to say about Joseph in our next lesson. He was the last one born in Haran. Benjamin was born after they returned to the Holy Land.

=== Basic Correspondences

Abraham = goodness on the celestial or will plane
Isaac = goodness on the spiritual or thought plane
Jacob = goodness on the natural or act plane
Leah = the affection of external truth 
Rachel = the affection of internal truth
the twelve sons = all things of truth and good which can be developed in our lives

=== Senior

The three planes of life and the order of their development should be stressed and then the fact that after these are developed, the natural plane must be brought into order before regeneration can proceed to higher planes. The difference between seeing an ideal and achieving it is an important point. But most important for this age is the point that our occupations should be chosen and pursued from the motive of service to the Lord and the neighbor rather than from the motive of self-advancement.

Each new development in our lives — both in our general progress and in every particular achievement — follows the same pattern. There must first be a desire in our will. We never do anything without some motive, good or bad. Then the desire must take form in our thought, and the means to accomplish it must be worked out by our reasoning powers. Finally, the desire and the thought must find expression in action if they are to accomplish anything. These three stages, with reference to our spiritual development and progress, are pictured by the three patriarchs, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Jacob represents the outward or natural plane of achievement. We ought to "want to be good." We ought to learn from the Word what is right and to think about how we should live in order to fulfill the Lord's purposes for us. But the desire and thought get us nowhere spiritually except as we actually do from day to day what we have found is right. And we all know from experience that it is not always an easy matter to carry out in our outward conduct our highest intentions and thoughts. Making the outward life heavenly is a long, slow process.

Jacob, as you may remember, was not an exemplary character.

He deceived his father and stole his brother's blessing and left home under a cloud, in fear of Esau's vengeance, a fear which stayed with him through his whole twenty-year sojourn in Haran.

The promise he made to serve the Lord, following the wonderful dream which he had at Bethel near the beginning of his journey, was given on condition that the Lord would make his journey successful and bring him safely home again. And in our lesson today we find that his service to his uncle Laban is a series of bargains. It is his own interest which he obviously has first in mind.

This is a characteristic of the external life of every one of us before we are regenerated. We are born with tendencies to selfishness, and in our first contacts with the world our efforts are centered on our external comfort and success. What happens to us in this world seems to us the essential thing.

And yet the Lord sees to it that we all have glimpses of something higher. The innocent, trustful states of our infancy and the instruction from the Word — direct or indirect — which we receive as children, are stored up by Him in our subconscious mind as the "remains" through which He can speak to us and help us. These stay with us as Jacob's vision must have stayed with him, always holding up an ideal which is higher than mere worldly success.

This fact is brought out by the story of Leah and Rachel, the two daughters of Laban whom Jacob married. We remember that daughters picture affections. Leah, the elder daughter, pictures the affection for truth on the external plane of life. She is the elder because this affection in us develops first, even when we know that there is a higher one. We saw this fact in our study of Ishmael and Isaac. This first affection does not see very far. Leah was "tender" (weak) eyed. Rachel, who was beautiful and well favored, is the affection for interior truth.

When Jacob stops at the well outside of Haran — which we remember pictures the Word in its letter — it is Rachel who comes with her father's sheep, and with whom Jacob immediately falls in love. When, with the intention of serving the Lord, we read the Word, our innocent "remains," like the sheep, are brought to our minds by the Lord and with them a delight in learning spiritual truth, which we immediately accept as our ideal. But Jacob, we remember, is goodness on the natural plane. He agrees to work seven years for Rachel; the years pass quickly, but then he finds that Leah is given him instead of Rachel, and he has to work seven years more for Rachel. Isn't this just like our own experience? We catch sight of a vision of a noble life and set out to attain it, but when we think we deserve to have achieved our goal, we find it still ahead of us.

Now comes the further lesson. Rachel was at first barren, and it was Leah who bore Jacob's first four sons and two more later. And each of the two handmaids also bore him two sons before Rachel was able to have a child. We have already seen that the birth of children pictures the bringing forth of truths and goods. Rachel, the affection for interior truths, must be our ideal from the beginning, but for a long time it is the affection of external truth and affections for the lesser knowledges that serve our progress in understanding which are productive in our lives. An example may help: Suppose a boy, through his early associations in home and church, catches a vision of the ministry as the work to which he really wants to give his life. He starts out eagerly to work toward that goal, but presently he finds that he must learn a great many other things before he can even begin his theological studies, and even after he becomes a minister, much of his work seems to be of an external and routine character, and it is only after years of patient service that he sees that he is beginning to accomplish the spiritual uses to which he looked forward in the beginning. In the choice of any life work, the ideal of service to the Lord and the neighbor should always be present from the start, but the achievement of the ideal is the work of a lifetime.

The twelve sons of Jacob represent "all truths and goods in the complex." Complex is from a Latin word meaning to "braid together." We sometimes speak of our modern life as being complex. But we seldom stop to think how truly complex, how interwoven, are all our thoughts and affections, how different each person's mind is from every other, and how our own minds vary from hour to hour in respect to what motive and what thoughts are uppermost and governing all the others. The twelve sons of Jacob are mentioned again and again in the Bible, and Swedenborg tells us that the order in which they are mentioned in any given place is very important in the interpretation of the events being narrated. We cannot take them up individually in any one lesson, but one or another of them will come up from time to time as we go on with our course.

As we should expect, Rachel's two sons, Joseph and Benjamin, who were the last to be born, represent spiritual good and truth. We shall follow this thought further when we study about Joseph. Joseph was the last one born in Haran. Benjamin was born near Bethlehem after Jacob and his family returned to the Holy Land.

=== Adult

Interesting discussion topics are: 
(1) the change in Jacob's correspondence as his story progresses;
(2) the necessity of developing an orderly outward life as a basis for any higher development; 
(3) the difference between seeking such a life for the sake of self and seeking it from the motive of love to the Lord and the neighbor; 
(4) the difference between recognizing an ideal and achieving it; 
(5) the general correspondence of the twelve sons of Jacob.

It should not confuse us to find the correspondence of Jacob apparently changing, for it is the story of the beginning of our achievement of the good external life and of its gradual development from apparent to genuine good — that is, from a life which is good in the eyes of our neighbors to one which is good in the sight of the Lord.

With reference to Abraham and Isaac, Jacob represents the time in our lives when we are beginning to direct our own affairs independently of our parents. If we have been developing in an orderly way, the simple, trustful states of our infancy have passed into our subconscious, and we have also judged and put behind us the boastful, self-confident state represented by Ishmael. Isaac, the genuine rational, is head of our house. But Isaac is growing old. This does not mean that we no longer have to think and reason, but that the faculty is adequately developed and the time has come when our primary business is its application to the outward conduct of life.

For the successful pursuit of our new activities we must acquire new truth but — as in the case of Isaac's marriage — this truth must not be sought for mere selfish and worldly purposes. Jacob's wife, like Isaac's, must be found in Haran. She must be an affection of truth springing from the same primary source, our original determination to serve the Lord. This is an important point to keep in mind in helping our children to begin their independent lives rightly. Whatever occupation they may choose, it should be chosen and pursued from a desire to serve the Lord and the neighbor rather than merely to find a secure and remunerative place in this world. In the historical interpretation, the representative church of the Jews had to be established in the line of Terah, who, we remember, signified the third and last Ancient Church.

There are differences between the story of Isaac's marriage and the story of Jacob's which are interesting. Isaac, we recall, was not under any circumstances to go to Haran himself. In the formative years when your higher rational is being developed, it must never be allowed to leave the Holy Land, the spiritual plane. Rebekah had to be brought to Isaac. But Jacob is driven to leave the Holy Land for a time in the search for his true wife. When we come to work out our religion on the plane of outward conduct, we must necessarily be concerned with external as well as with internal truths. Another difference is in the fact that Rebekah came to the well with her pitcher on her shoulder to draw water to be carried home. The emphasis here is on the acquisition of truth from the Word — the well — for later use. Rachel, on the other hand, came to the well bringing her father's flock, of which she was the shepherdess. As the family of Nahor, who left Ur with Terah and Abram but went no farther than Haran, picture simple, uninstructed goodness and obedience, so the flock of Laban, Rachel's father, pictures those who wish to be "led and taught" (@AC 3795). Rachel, therefore, represents a desire for truth for immediate, specific uses.

Swedenborg thus summarizes the meaning of the contents of chapter 29, one of our chapters, in @AC 3758 and 3759: "In the internal sense of this chapter by 'Jacob' is described the Lord's natural — how the good of truth therein was conjoined with kindred good from a Divine origin, which good is 'Laban'; at first through the affection of internal truth, which is 'Rachel.'" And in @AC 3793 he says: "Jacob therefore now puts on the representation of the natural, and Rachel the representation of truth; but as all conjunction of truth with good is wrought by means of affection, it is the affection of truth to be coupled with good that is represented by Rachel. Moreover in the natural, as in the rational, there is an interior and an exterior; Rachel representing the affection of interior truth, and Leah the affection of exterior truth."

The whole story of Jacob's marriages and of the birth of his sons is actually one of the orderly development of the good external life — which must have an internal in order to be good. Rachel is the ideal, glimpsed at first and then labored for long and patiently with inevitable delays and disappointments on the way.

In @AC 6335 occurs one of the simplest statements of the correspondence of the twelve sons as "all truths and goods in one complex." Another helpful definition of them is found in @AC 6448:

"By them are described all states of the church as to goods and truths, thus as to the spiritual life of everyone within the church." Individually their correspondence, like that of everything in the Word, changes slightly with the order and context in which they are mentioned. A very full statement of this variation in order of the twelve is found in @AC 3862 and a briefer one in @AC 6335. The general correspondence of the individual sons is briefly as follows:

Reuben = faith.

Simeon = faith in the will. 

Levi = charity.

Judah = the celestial church, or the Lord as to the Divine celestial. 

Zebulun = the cohabitation of good and truth.

Issachar = recompense from works.

Dan = those who are in the good of life from truth, but not yet from good.

Gad = works from truth and not yet from good. 

Asher = the blessedness of the affections.

Naphtali = temptation and the state after temptation.

Joseph = the spiritual church, the Lord as to the Divine spiritual. 

Benjamin = the truth of the good of the spiritual church.

Joseph was the last one born in Haran. Benjamin was born near Bethlehem after the return to the Holy Land, and Rachel died and was buried there. It is interesting also to find that it was Leah and not Rachel who was buried with Jacob in the cave of Machpelah along with Abraham and Sarah, Isaac and Rebekah. Rachel was Jacob's inspiring ideal, but Leah was apparently his true mate.

=== From the Writings of Swedenborg

@AC 3819: "Leah is called the 'elder' because external truth is first learned, and Rachel is called the 'younger' because internal truth is learned afterwards, or what is the same, man is first affected with external truths, and afterwards with internal ones; for external truths are the planes of internal ones, being generals into which singulars are insinuated; for without a general idea of a thing man comprehends nothing that is singular. This is the reason why in the literal sense of the Word there are general, but in the internal sense singular truths."

JACOB'S RETURN — Genesis 35

This lesson requires more preparation on the part of the teacher than some. The teacher should be sufficiently familiar with the whole story of Jacob (Genesis 25:19 through Genesis 34) so that he can review it rather fully. He should also think out carefully the particular points in the lesson for the day which he thinks can be presented most interestingly and usefully to his class.

=== Doctrinal Points

The Lord uses even our selfishness at first to lead us to good. Nothing in the Word is accidental or unimportant.

Everything comes to us first through our minds.

Nevertheless, our will is the primary cause of our thoughts as well as of our acts. 

=== Notes for Parents

One of the best—known stories in the Bible is the story of how the lone young traveler Jacob slept one night in the open at Bethel and was given a wonderful dream of a ladder set up on earth whose top reached to heaven, and of the Lord at the top and angels ascending and descending upon the ladder. And in the morning Jacob vowed that if the Lord would prosper him and bring him safely home again, he would always serve Him.

Jacob's desire then was only to be spared to come home. Yet when he reached Haran, he immediately fell in love with his uncle's daughter Rachel and forgot all about going home. He stayed in Haran for twenty years. He became rich through serving his uncle, and by his two wives, Rachel and her sister Leah, and their handmaids, Bilhah and Zilpah, he had eleven sons and one daughter. This story is a picture of something which happens in the lives of many young people. They are brought up in good homes, taken to Sunday school and church, and given the religious principles they need to guide them through life. Perhaps they join the church. They mean to be faithful. But when they finish high school, they leave home for college or for some occupation. They fall in love and marry and take on the responsibility of providing for a growing family, and their minds and lives are so occupied with what seem the necessities of life in the world that they forget their early ideals.

But men have deeper and higher needs which the world cannot meet. Sooner or later the man or woman who has been rightly brought up remembers that this world is not his final home, and, like the prodigal son in the parable, says: "I will arise and go to my father." Our chapter today tells of Jacob's return, of his putting away the false ambitions and worldly satisfactions he has been striving for, and coming back to Bethel to fulfill his vow. Then he is ready to be reunited to Isaac and to inherit the land promised him by the Lord. In this story the Lord is telling each one of us that if we will only realize how unsatisfying the things of the world are and return home to Him, we shall be among those who hear Him say: "Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world."

=== Primary

The younger children will not profit by so complete a review of Jacob's life as the older ones. In the introduction, dwell on Jacob's dream more than on the rest of the story, as the children may have some recollection of it, and it connects naturally with the return to Bethel.

Jacob was his mother Rebekah's favorite.

Once she saved him from Esau's anger by persuading Isaac to send him on a long visit to her brother Laban in Haran.

Jacob was welcomed by his uncle Laban and was so satisfied in Haran that he stayed there for twenty years. In those days people had forgotten that it is wrong for a man to have more than one wife at a time. Jacob married two of Laban's daughters, Leah and Rachel, and he had two other wives, who were the servants of Leah and Rachel — you may remember how Abraham had a son by Hagar, Sarah's Egyptian handmaid.

Eleven sons and a daughter were born to Jacob in Haran. The eleventh son was Joseph.

After Joseph's birth Jacob decided to go home with his family.

He stopped at Bethel, where he had had a wonderful dream on his way to Haran.

What did the Lord promise him there?

What son was born to him near Bethlehem? Who died there?

Joseph and Benjamin were Rachel's only children. Where did Jacob find his father?

How old was Isaac when he died?

Esau and Jacob had become friends again.

Try to remember that the Lord gave Jacob a new name — Israel.

That is how the descendants of Jacob came to be called "the children of Israel."

=== Junior

In this class review by questions and comments the whole factual story of Jacob, as this is the age at which children should become thoroughly familiar with the whole Bible story. Be sure the children look up the Bible references in their notes and go over the names of the twelve sons of Jacob. Point out on your own Bible map the four cities named in the chapter.

In Haran Jacob was welcomed by his uncle Laban and decided to stay and work for him. He married two of Laban's daughters, Leah and Rachel. The people of those times had forgotten that it is wrong for a man to have more than one wife. Leah bore Jacob six sons and a daughter. He had four more sons by Bilhah and Zilpah, the handmaids of Rachel and Leah. Finally Rachel had a son, Joseph. Then Jacob decided to go back to his home in the land of Canaan, after having lived in Haran for twenty years. He was still afraid of Esau, but he found that Esau had long since forgiven him and welcomed him gladly.

Do you remember the story of the wonderful dream which Jacob had when he first left home — the dream of the ladder reaching from earth to heaven, with the Lord at the top and angels ascending and descending upon it? Read in Genesis 28:16-22 about Jacob's vow. Bethel means "house of God." Now in our chapter for today we learn how Jacob kept his vow.

Where did the Lord tell Jacob to go?

How did Jacob prepare his family for worship? 

Who died at Bethel?

What other name did the Lord give Jacob?

What promise did the Lord make to him? 

Who died near Bethlehem?

Who was born there?

Who else was born at Bethlehem hundreds of years later?

Benjamin was the twelfth and last of Jacob's sons. You will find the names of all twelve in verses 23 to 26 of our chapter. You want to read them and become familiar with them, because these twelve sons became the heads of the "twelve tribes of Israel" about whom we shall hear a great deal as we go on. You want also to remember that Joseph and Benjamin were the last two of the twelve, and that they were the only children of Rachel, who was Jacob's favorite wife.

Where did Jacob find his father Isaac living?

Who buried Isaac when he died?

Isaac was buried in the cave of Machpelah, which Abraham had bought for a family burying place when Sarah died. After Isaac's death Jacob became head of the family. Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob are called the three patriarchs.

=== Intermediate

This class can be given the general correspondence of the Jacob period and something of the application of the particular incidents in his history. The important lesson for them in the chapter for the day is that mere worldly success never satisfies the mind and heart and that when we realize this, we must recognize and put away the thoughts and habits into which we have fallen as a result of putting worldly ambitions first.

In the Bible story Abraham represents our spiritual state in our infancy and very early childhood, and Isaac represents our state when we are old enough to have learned our need of recognizing the Lord's laws and have begun to form our judgments of right and wrong according to them. If we are developing properly, we should reach the Isaac stage before we are through high school.

But we know that after high school there is a time when we have to think a great deal about how we are to get along in the world. We leave home and go to college or into some occupation and, although we are not yet really grown up, we are pretty much "on our own." This period is called the development of the natural plane of life and is described in the stories about Jacob.

Jacob married the two daughters of Laban, Leah and Rachel, who represent affections for exterior and interior truths, and was also given their two handmaids. By these four women he had one daughter and twelve sons, only the last two of whom — Joseph and Benjamin — were the children of Rachel, Jacob's first love. He also became rich in flocks and herds. Jacob's sons picture the various faculties which we develop in this period of beginning our independent lives; and the flocks and herds, the abilities and knowledges which come to us.

Then suddenly after twenty years, Jacob decided to go home.

The young man or woman who is inwardly good cannot be satisfied just to enjoy his own success in the world. He knows that he must take his possessions and abilities home to his Father's house — back to the service of the Lord.

The first thing that happens in this homecoming — on the very border of the land — is Jacob's reunion with Esau. Jacob, remembering the wrong he had done Esau, was afraid, but Esau welcomed him gladly. This pictures the time when we realize that our good intentions and our understanding of the truth are really in harmony and can work together. Then comes our chapter for this lesson. You remember that when Jacob left home, he slept one night at Bethel and had the wonderful dream of the ladder reaching to heaven, and that in the morning he vowed that, if the Lord would prosper him and bring him safely home again, he would worship and serve Him. So now that he has been prospered and brought back, he goes first to Bethel, builds an altar there, and worships the Lord.

Two things come into the story before the altar can be built.

The first is easy to understand. All Jacob's people must put away "the strange gods that were in their hand and all their earrings which were in their ears" and these were hidden "under the oak which was by Shechem." In the first part of the Jacob period we develop a good many worldly ideas and ambitions; these are the "strange gods." And we listen to many worldly and selfish promptings and do wrong things because of them; these are the "golden earrings." We must recognize these as unworthy and put them away before our worship of the Lord can be pure.

The second incident seems a strange one: "Deborah, Rebekah's nurse, died, and she was buried beneath Bethel under an oak." Why should Rebekah's nurse, who came long ago with Rebekah from Haran (Genesis 24:59), appear suddenly in the middle of this story of Jacob? From the literal sense we find no explanation, but in the spiritual sense this incident has a wonderful meaning. Rebekah's nurse represents hereditary evil. We are all born with selfish inclinations, but the Lord uses this natural selfishness of ours to induce us to form good habits. A child is led to behave rightly mostly by fear of punishment and hope of reward, and in the Isaac stage these same selfish motives also lead him to learn what the Lord would have him be and do. So our affection for doctrinal truth, which is Rebekah, is nursed by our hereditary selfishness. But when, as adults, we decide to bring our worldly achievements back into the service of the Lord, this selfish motive is put away forever.

Then finally Jacob is ready to be united to his father Isaac in Hebron and to inherit his father's place as head of the family. Isaac dies, and his sons Esau and Jacob bury him. This does not mean that we stop using our spiritual rational which Isaac represents, but that it has now become so much a part of our everyday thought — so natural to us — that it no longer stands out as a separate function in our minds. It is in us just as Abraham — our early trust and obedience — is in us.

=== Basic Correspondences

Esau = natural good intentions
Jacob = natural understanding of truth
strange gods = worldly ambitions
Rebekah = affection for doctrinal truth
Rebekah's nurse = hereditary evil
golden earrings = promptings of selfishness which we have obeyed

=== Senior

The Seniors are themselves in the beginning of the Jacob state, and the spiritual lessons involved in our chapter are especially important for them. Many of them think now that they will never be led away from serving the Lord. Call their attention to the fact that Jacob's desire when he left home was only to return as soon as possible, but that he became so involved in his activities and accomplishments in Haran that it was twenty years before he actually made the effort to go back to the Holy Land.

In the writings Swedenborg explains the stories of Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Joseph for the most part in the celestial sense in which they tell us of the inner life of the Lord as He was developing from infancy to adulthood; but he tells us that our own individual development is analogous, and so they apply to us also. The Lord took on from Mary all the natural human heredity just as we have it, and dealt with its temptations one after another as they came to Him. So the Lord is our pattern.

After the period of Ishmael and Isaac comes the period of Jacob and Esau. Jacob and Esau represent the natural plane of our lives in its relation to the Lord — Jacob as to truth and Esau as to good — especially that period in our lives when we are just beginning to take our places in the world as independent individuals.

In our early childhood, represented by Abraham, we experience and store up in our subconscious the states of innocence and trust. In our early youth, represented by Ishmael and Isaac, we acquire knowledges and develop the power of reasoning, first in a very external and superficial way and later more deeply, with a truer perception of values. When we begin to grow up and to "live our own lives," we are at first necessarily very much concerned with establishing ourselves in the world. We turn our back on the Holy Land, so to speak, and devote ourselves to the practical problems of everyday life. This is Jacob's sojourn in Haran.

But Haran is not our home. Always in the back of our minds is the vision with which we started, and sooner or later we become dissatisfied with our bondage to the "practical" life, and turn our faces homeward. Like Jacob, we travel slowly, checked at first by the pull of old ideas and somewhat hindered by our flocks and herds, the very riches we have worked so hard to acquire in Haran. Finally we reach the borders of our homeland. But before we actually enter it, Jacob must be reconciled with Esau. Heavenly life consists in the union of both will and understanding in the Lord's service. Then follows our chapter for today.

We remember that when Jacob, fleeing from Esau, was granted his first encouraging vision at Bethel — the dream of the ladder — he promised that if the Lord would take care of him and bring him safely back to his home, he would serve Him. Now the Lord's part of the covenant is fulfilled. Jacob has been prospered and has come back with great wealth to settle peacefully in his own country. So he returns to Bethel and builds an altar there, requiring all his household to give up their idols and be clean and change their garments. This is a picture of the effort we should make, if we are trying to live a heavenly life, to reform all our worldly ways of feeling, thinking, and acting so that there shall be no divided allegiance to turn us astray. The people did give Jacob their idols and also the "earrings which were in their ears." This seems a strange addition, unless we know that the ear pictures obedience and the earrings the delight of obedience, so that what is pictured is the willingness to stop listening to and acting upon the dictates of self-will. Jacob buried all these things under the oak at Shechem before he went on to Bethel. Swedenborg tells us that to bury something under an oak pictures rejection of it forever. Jacob's stop at Shechem represents his coming to a state of peace, and we cannot come into this state so long as our minds are divided in their allegiance. "Ye cannot serve God and mammon."

After Jacob reached Bethel and built his altar there, it is written that Rebekah's nurse Deborah died and was buried at Bethel under an oak. This seems a completely irrelevant incident. In the letter we find no suggestion of a reason why Rebekah's nurse should suddenly appear in the story of Jacob. But her death and burial just at this point picture the rejection of the hereditary evils in which we have grown up. Deborah, you remember, was sent with Rebekah from Haran when Abraham's servant took Rebekah away to become Isaac's wife. It is part of the Lord's providence that our evils are never separated from us suddenly or violently but are allowed to go on until we see and reject them ourselves. The same lesson is taught in the Gospels in the parable of the tares among the wheat.

Benjamin is born at Bethlehem because he represents the highest type of good which can be exercised on the natural plane of our lives. This cannot be produced until we get back to the Holy Land, although Joseph — the truth which leads to this good — can be seen before we have attained our goal. Rachel's death, like Sarah's, pictures the end of one stage of our development, the affection proper to that stage subsiding into the background of our experience as we go on to new interests.

The death of Isaac is the final act in the drama of our development from infancy into a full adult state. From Genesis 49:31 we learn that Isaac and Rebekah were both buried in the cave of Machpelah, and that Jacob and Leah were both buried there also. This suggests that, although Rachel was Jacob's first love and his ideal, Leah — the affection for external truth — was actually his proper wife. The death of Isaac does not mean that at this stage we have given up our spiritual reasoning, but that this faculty has become a part of our everyday life. Jacob has come into the qualities possessed by his fathers, Abraham and Isaac. A truly good external life has within it both the innocence and trust which are Abraham and the rational understanding of spiritual values which is Isaac.

=== Adult

Most of the Adult class will be more familiar with the other stories about Jacob than with chapter 35; so the teacher should begin immediately with the current lesson, only touching in passing on the earlier part of Jacob's life. Call attention especially to the burying of the idols and earrings at Shechem, the burial of Deborah at Bethel, and the burial of Rachel at Bethlehem. These three burials, followed by the burial of Isaac and by Jacob's final entry into his birthright, form excellent discussion material, especially in relation to the popular tendency to make external good works the first thing of religion.

The story of Jacob is a very important one for our thought about our everyday life, for Jacob and Esau represent the natural plane of life — Jacob this plane as to truth and Esau the same plane as to good. There is much emphasis in churches today upon external good works, and we all know that these should be done. But if good works are genuinely good they must be an outgrowth of love to the Lord in the heart and an understanding of His nature and will in the mind — not a substitute for these inner qualities of religion. Those who love the Lord and the neighbor and think about their own shortcomings and the Lord's mercy do their external good works as a matter of course and do not talk about them.

Jacob and Esau were at first rivals and even enemies. Our natural good impulses are eager to express themselves and impatient of instruction, and our natural understanding of the truth is pleased with itself and not too scrupulous in its methods of advancing itself. Esau was a "hairy" man and Jacob a "smooth" man. Hair represents the part of the life which is most external. Jacob's long sojourn in Haran was necessary to teach him the true value of his home and the necessity of reconciliation with his brother. So a young person goes out self-confidently to make his place in the world, and it may take him a long time to realize that life is more than material success, and that he needs to go back and reclaim the good states and the spiritual principles of his childhood period of instruction.

In interpreting the story of Jacob, Swedenborg deals primarily with its celestial sense, in which it is a description of the Lord's progress toward the glorification of the natural degree. But he is careful to point out that the order of glorification with the Lord was the same as the order of regeneration with man. We recall that Jacob's name was changed to Israel after he wrestled with the angel (Genesis 32:28), and this change is repeated in our chapter for today. In the celestial sense this change marks the completion of another step in the Lord's glorification. Jacob represents the Lord's natural as to its external; Israel, His internal natural. This is why both names are used frequently in the rest of the Bible story, sometimes even in the same verse, Jacob coming to stand for the church of that day as a mere representative of a church, while Israel stands for the true internal which the ancient Hebrew rites represented. The names are not interchangeable and are never used in the letter of the Word without clear purpose.

The sons born to Jacob in Haran picture the faculties developed by each of us as he "finds himself" in the life of the world — Joseph being the final faculty of receiving and understanding genuine spiritual truth. It is after Joseph's birth that Jacob decides to return to Canaan. But Benjamin, who represents the good proper to genuine truth, is not born until after Jacob has returned, become reconciled to Esau, and performed his worship at Bethel.

Four very familiar places are mentioned in our chapter: Shechem, Bethel, Bethlehem, and Hebron.

The strange gods and the earrings which the people surrendered to Jacob were buried "under the oak which was by Shechem." The strange gods and the earrings represent falsities held in the mind and falsities made actual in life, and to bury under an oak is to put away forever. This was accomplished at Shechem because Shechem, Abram's first stop in the Holy Land, represents "the first of light, which is interior truth." Before we can worship the Lord truly we must be willing to put away every false idea and bad habit which we find to conflict with His wisdom and love.

Then Jacob advances to Bethel. Jacob in his return is following the same course which Abraham followed when he came into the Holy Land from Ur so many years before, stopping first at Shechem, then at Bethel, and finally at Hebron, and building altars as he went. This pictures of course an advance, little by little, into holy states of innocence and trust. Abraham's journey was a childlike following of the Lord. Jacob's is a more mature, though more worldly or natural obedience. Abraham was being led into these states out of ignorance and idolatry. Jacob is coming back to them after a long period of wandering, caused by his own transgression. The Lord tells us: "Except ye become as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven." When Jacob comes back to Bethel, the "house of God," the Lord appears to him again and renews the promises He had made to Abraham and to Isaac.

The death of Rebekah's nurse Deborah at Bethel tells of the passing of former affections when new ones are developed. Deborah is the hereditary evil from the mother. Hereditary evil lies back of all our acts in childhood. We do things largely for the sake of self. Though children are directed by their parents and led by the Lord through angel associates, yet hereditary evil is within everything they do. But it does not become actual because they do not act from their own free will. This is the innocence of infancy. The difference between the innocence of infancy and the innocence of wisdom is that in the former "the innocence of infancy is without, and hereditary evil within," whereas in the latter, "the innocence of wisdom is within and evil both actual and hereditary without." (@AC 4563) The natural, purified of its falsities and evils, has come into a new state. Bethel — "house of God" — signifies this new state of the natural, for the house in which truth dwells is good. The altar Jacob built at Bethel is the worship of the Lord by the natural mind.

Our lesson marks the first appearance of Bethlehem in the Bible story. The birth of Benjamin and Rachel's death are the first incidents we connect with it. Bethlehem is near the border of the two lots later assigned to the tribes of Benjamin and Judah. As the birthplace of Benjamin, and later of David, and still later of the Lord, it marks the beginning of great changes. The death of Rachel near Bethlehem in the celestial sense pictures the expulsion by the Lord of whatever was hereditary and human in the affection for interior truth. In the human affection from the mother is the glory of self and the world. Good is done for the sake of self. The Lord felt this temptation and put it away, and we should recognize this evil in ourselves and try to overcome it with His help.

Isaac died at Hebron and was buried by his sons Esau and Jacob in the cave of Machpelah. (See Genesis 49:29-32.) Jacob became head of his family. It is helpful to fix in our minds the fact that of the three patriarchs Abraham pictures the celestial, Isaac the spiritual, and Jacob the natural plane of life, the planes through which we pass from infancy through youth to maturity. When we first consider ourselves "grown up," we are in the Jacob stage, when natural and worldly things are most interesting and absorb our time and thought. We branch out into many fields of interest, as Jacob's twelve sons headed families and eventually divided the land. Still we have in us our inheritance from our infant and childhood states and we have in us the deeper affections, represented by Joseph and Benjamin, to link us to spiritual and celestial things. Our early states are in us and affect all we do. So the places that are mentioned in the early chapters of Genesis recur again and again throughout the Bible story.

=== From the Writings of Swedenborg

@AC 4563: "It is known that man derives evil from both his parents, and that this evil is called hereditary evil. He is therefore born into it, but still it does not manifest itself until the man becomes an adult and acts from his understanding and the derivative will, and meanwhile it lies hidden, especially during infancy. And as of the Lord's mercy no one is blamed for what is hereditary, but for what is actual [nos. 966, 2308], and what is hereditary cannot become actual until the man acts from his own understanding and his own will, therefore infants are led by the Lord by means of infants and angels from Him, and hence they appear in a state of innocence while hereditary evil still lurks in everything they do. This hereditary evil yields them nourishment, or is as a nurse, until the time when they judge for themselves; and then if they are being regenerated they are brought by the Lord into a state of new infancy, and at last into heavenly wisdom; thus into genuine infancy, that is, into innocence; for genuine infancy or innocence dwells in wisdom. The difference is, that the innocence of infancy is without, and hereditary evil within; whereas the innocence of wisdom is within, and evil both actual and hereditary is without."
