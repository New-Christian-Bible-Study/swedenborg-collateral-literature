== THE CHOOSING OF SAUL — 1 Samuel 9; 10

All but the youngest children should be able to tell about the characteristics of the period of the Judges and why the people were always getting into trouble in that period. The teacher in his preparation for the lesson should reread 1 Samuel 8 and be able to give the class this background for the lesson. Be sure the children understand that Samuel is now an old man and a very great man, who speaks to the people for the Lord — a prophet or "seer."

=== Doctrinal Points

The first principle under which we organize our adult lives in the Lord's service is limited by our superficial judgment.

=== Notes for Parents

We have studied the history of Israel under several types of government. First they looked for direction to the patriarchs — Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Then for a long time they were slaves in Egypt. Then they followed the two great leaders Moses and Joshua. During the period of the Judges we saw that they had no single ruler or leader, but looked to themselves and sought leadership only when they were in trouble. Most of the Judges were local and temporary leaders. Then came the last Judge — Samuel — who, because he proved to be the Lord's chosen prophet, was eventually looked to for direction by all the people.

Samuel judged the land for many years and was always wise and just and wholly faithful to the Lord. But when he grew old, he turned over some of his duties to his sons, who abused their power. Then, as we learned in chapter 8, the people became dissatisfied and asked Samuel to give them a king so that they might be like other nations.

Samuel was unhappy, for he felt that the people were forgetting all that he had done for them, but the Lord told him to let them have their king and that, because Samuel was known to be the Lord's prophet, it was really the Lord whom the people had rejected. And the Lord promised to show Samuel who should be king. Our lesson this time tells us how Saul was brought to Samuel, how Samuel first proved to Saul that the Lord had really chosen him, and then how the people were led to recognize and accept Saul as their first king.

We need to notice the reason why the people accepted Saul so willingly: "he was higher than any of the people from his shoulders and upward." In other words, they judged him by his appearance. Is not this the common experience of all of us when we first look for a general principle to direct our lives? We judge by appearances. We know that young adults sometimes feel that they have the answers to everything: if only other people would do as they think they should, the world would be all right. They see only the surface of things and have not enough experience to recognize the deeper issues and forces involved and to take account of them. They are "well—meaning," eager, and energetic, but they are not yet wise.

Older people, however, should have patience with this state.

There is a lesson for us all in our story. The Lord chose Saul. He knew that the people were not ready to accept and follow a really wise leader. They had proved it by turning against Samuel. They had to be allowed to learn by experience. So do our young people when they reject wise advice.

=== Primary

Tell the whole story very simply, explaining what "anointing" means, and then point out why the people liked Saul and were glad to have him for their king. Even little children need to be taught that we cannot always judge things by their appearance.

When Samuel grew old, he let his sons do some of the governing for him, and his sons were not good men. They did not govern the people fairly, and so the people came to Samuel and asked him to give them a king to rule them as the other nations were ruled. Samuel was unhappy about it, but the Lord told him to let the people have what they asked for, and the Lord promised to show Samuel who should be king.

Who did the Lord show Samuel was to be the first king? 

What tribe was Saul from?

What did he look like?

Saul was out looking for some lost donkeys of his father's when Samuel found him.

Samuel told him that the donkeys were found, and then that he was to be king. A little later he "anointed" him.

This means that he poured olive oil on his head as a sign that the Lord was with him.

Then Samuel sent Saul home and called the people together at Mizpeh. How did it seem to the people that their king was chosen?

Who really governed the way in which the lots fell?

Why were the people pleased with Saul?

=== Junior

The Juniors may like to trace on a map the wanderings of Saul and his servant in search of the donkeys. Stress the humility of Saul at the start, and the Lord's way of reassuring him and leading him to accept his office. Discuss the casting of lots and the part the Lord played in the choice of Saul. The Juniors also need the lesson concerning Saul's appearance.

Samuel was recognized as the Lord's prophet, and when he grew up, he was accepted as Judge by all the people. He served faithfully for many years, always obeying the Lord. But when he was old, he turned over some of his duties to his sons. They were not good men, but were greedy for money, and took bribes and did not judge the people justly. So finally the people asked Samuel to give them a king who would rule them as the other nations were ruled. Samuel was reluctant, but the Lord told him to let the people have their way, and that He would show Samuel who was to be their first king.

Who was this first king of Israel?

From what tribe was he?

What did he look like?

What was Saul doing when he first met Samuel?

We can see that the Lord was directing Saul's life. But Saul had to have some preparation before he was openly proclaimed king. He was very humble at first, for when Samuel told him he had been chosen, he answered that his tribe was the smallest in Israel and he himself the least in his tribe. After Samuel anointed him, the Lord gave him several unusual experiences to prove to him that he had really been chosen. We read about these in the first part of chapter 10. The Lord's providence is over each one of us just as much as it was over Saul. Each one of us was created to fill a particular place and to do some special work for the Lord, and nothing happens to us which cannot in some way help to prepare us for this work, if we use our experiences rightly.

Where did Samuel call the people together?

How was Saul chosen this time?

Samuel, of course, knew on whom the lot would fall, but all the people had to see for themselves that the Lord's choice was Saul. Saul knew also, and the fact that he hid himself showed that he was still in a humble frame of mind and thought himself unworthy of so high an office.

Why were the people pleased with Saul?

We shall find, however, that Saul was not as big a man inside as he was on the outside, and that his humility did not last; but the people did not know this. Do we ever, like the Israelites, judge things by their outward appearance without making the effort to look into them more deeply?

Even today kings are still consecrated by anointing, that is, by pouring oil on their heads. It is a very old custom and it comes from the knowledge of correspondence which the ancient peoples had from the Ancient Word. Oil is the symbol of love, and Samuel's act was a sign that Saul must rule from a love of serving the Lord and the neighbor. If everyone who had power used it with this love in his heart, the world would be a different kind of place.

=== Intermediate

This class will be interested in the correspondence of the donkey (remind them of the lesson on Balaam) and will be able to see what is meant by Saul's being called while he was hunting for his father's donkeys. Nothing in the Word is there by chance. Everything fits in when we see the internal meaning. The general meaning of Saul is not hard to teach to young people of this age.

In chapter 8 of 1 Samuel we learned that when Samuel was old, his sons — just as Eli's had done — became corrupt, and that the people became dissatisfied. So they came to Samuel, whose home was still at Ramah, and asked him to give them a king. They said they wanted a king so that they might be like all the other nations. A king represents truth ruling. A priest represents love. Samuel was a judge, but he was also a priest, so Samuel's government of the land pictures a state in which we are directed primarily by love to the Lord. If you think of this, you will understand what is meant by 1 Samuel 8:6-9. The Lord always leaves us free to choose our own way, but He does everything He can to protect and direct us.

Israel's desire for a king pictures our desire to choose our own ruling principle. We want to do right, but we want to understand why it is right and not merely to do as someone else — even the Lord — tells us to do. We think we are quite capable of judging. But the truth is that it takes many years of experience to become really wise. At first we judge according to appearances. The way which looks best on the face of it we believe to be best. We don't like to wait for results. We don't like to study a problem more deeply to see what really will be the best solution in the long run.

Saul pictures this first superficial standard of judgment. When he first came to Samuel, he was looking for his father's donkeys which had been lost. The donkey pictures our "natural" reason, our common sense. It is a very sure—footed animal but very stubborn, and not at all willing to be guided. Saul's search for his father's donkeys pictures our attempts to find a "common—sense" solution of our problems, one which will bring some immediate change in things, without waiting to see whether or not the change will really be for the better.

The people liked Saul for his apparent strength and size — they could "look up" to him literally, for he stood head and shoulders above everyone else. This is the way our own reason looks to us when we are young. We simply can't see how the world could fail to improve if others would do what we think they should.

The Lord really chose Saul, first by telling Samuel to anoint him, and then by governing the lots which the people cast. The Lord knew Saul's weaknesses, but he knew that Saul was the only kind of king the people would accept and follow until they had had more experience. In the same way He lets us try out our own judgment and do the things that seem to us right when we are young men and women, even though He knows our judgment is faulty.

The anointing of Saul by Samuel pictures the fact that in this first effort to set up a ruling principle there is a genuine desire to do right. Oil represents love. Any principle which is worthy to govern our lives even for a time must have love in it. If it has not, it is merely the old selfish desire to have our own way. Saul represents a genuine desire to serve the Lord and the neighbor, although not a wholly wise one. In all our first attempts to work out our lives for ourselves, we must be sure that our basic wish is to do good.

Most young people do want to do right. Their ideals are high. They want to do great things in the world for others as well as for themselves. And they mean to serve the Lord. Their ideals and enthusiasm are needed, and can be a great help to everyone so long as they do not assume that they are wise enough to direct affairs. So do not hesitate to offer your help and to try to "get into things" in your church as well as in other fields of activity. But try to be willing to listen to advice, remembering that real wisdom is acquired only by long and patient effort. Saul's reign is a picture of the time of eager and impetuous youth, and we shall see that he won some victories but also made some very serious mistakes.

=== Basic Correspondences

oil = love
a king = truth ruling
a priest = love directing
Saul = the rule of truth as we judge it to be from external observation

=== Senior

In this class dwell especially on the meaning of the people's asking for a king and read Samuel's description of what a king would be like (1 Samuel 8:10-18). This is a picture of what truth as a ruler does to our lives if we leave out love. The discussion of this and of the meaning of Saul as the first king will bring out questions and illustrations.

The story of Saul contains a lesson which is much needed both by us as individuals and by the world. We often hear it said that youth is the hope of the world, and of course in one sense it is. Those who are young now are the ones who will later control the destiny of the world. This is true of every new generation. But there sometimes seems to be a tendency to imagine that it is the young people who should be in control now. People — especially young people — say, "Look what a mess the older people have made of things! Youth has ideals; youth has energy. Let the young people take over the reins, and everything will be better." The story of Saul's reign over Israel is the Lord's answer to this mistaken idea.

In our individual lives we all go through the stage — from twenty to thirty perhaps — when we think we know how everything should be done. It seems to us so simple. If everyone would do as we suggest, the world's problems would be solved. The Lord knows, as wise parents and older leaders know, that young people must go through this period, must have this experience. And the ideals and energy and dissatisfaction of youth are needed to keep things stirred up, to keep us from settling down in old ways, to keep our minds open to change. But the judgment of youth is hasty and superficial. It is apt to ignore the deep problems presented by human nature in every situation, individual or social. It assumes that conditions can be corrected quickly by one or another external method, without the long, slow process of regenerating individuals.

That is, the first ruler we choose as young adults is chosen on the basis of external appearance — it is apparent rather than genuine truth, truth as our "natural rational" sees it. This is Saul as king of Israel. When Saul first came to Samuel, he was hunting for his father's donkeys, which had been lost. The donkey, sure—footed but stubborn, represents the natural reason, sometimes called "common sense." When we are young, we exalt common sense — as we see it — and look for what we consider the obvious solutions for our problems. We jump at any solution which seems to make sense. We have no patience with anyone who suggests that our solutions may not in the long run prove really practical. They promise quick results; so they look good to us. The people welcomed Saul as king because of his appearance — he stood head and shoulders above everyone else.

Saul "meant well." Samuel, at the Lord's command, anointed him. Anointing oil is a symbol of consecration by divine love. Saul entered upon the kingship knowing that he was dedicated to the Lord's service and under obligation to obey the Lord's commands. Youth also means well and intends to serve the Lord. (There are vicious young people as there are vicious adults, but they are a very small percentage of the whole.) The Lord chose Saul as Israel's first king because He knew the state of the people and that they were not prepared to recognize and follow a wiser leader at this time. We shall find that Saul was to lose his humility very soon with his first victory — and was to make many mistakes and lose his right to rule because he came to think he knew better than Samuel, the Lord's prophet. In much the same way young people, if given control, often make mistakes and learn by hard experience that lasting leadership must be based on deeper principles and more wisdom. And wisdom comes only slowly.

=== Adult

This lesson with the Adults may well be geared to improving the underlying attitude of the older people in the church toward the younger people. In many even of our own societies there is a cleavage between the two groups which is damaging to both and to the church as a whole, and which need not exist if the older people have understanding and patience.

With this lesson we enter a new phase of ancient Hebrew history, and we should have the general outline of the history to this point in mind, beginning with the patriarchal leadership of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob which in the individual life pictures the period of infancy, childhood, and early youth, when we are under the control of our parents albeit with ever-increasing understanding and initiative of our own. After the sojourn in Egypt a new type of leadership is introduced in Moses, who represents the Law. This is a period of self-compulsion which lasts until, by experience, we are so convinced of the effectiveness of an orderly life and the disastrous results of disobedience that external obedience to the commandments has become a matter of course in all ordinary affairs. Then we are ready to take the next step and attack the evils in our inner lives. Joshua comes to the fore — the truth fighting — and we follow him until we feel that we are really established in the good life — until the Holy Land is conquered.

But the book of Judges shows us that the conquest is not complete. As soon as we cease to examine ourselves and to fight temptation, our enemies both within and without begin to gain strength again and our lives become a series of battles waged under the leadership of one or another truth, represented by the various Judges, with periods of rest between. Throughout all the time from Moses to the end of the book of Judges the office of priest is separate from the office of leader, the priest representing good and the leader truth. So far as they work together the leadership of the people is sound, but if they are out of harmony — if either is corrupt — disorganization and disaster result. In Samuel the two offices are for a time united, but presently we read: "It came to pass, when Samuel was old, that he made his sons judges over Israel." And his sons were corrupt. Here we have the lesson of the necessity of constant watchfulness; our own ideas creep in and corrupt the divine order in which we think we are established. A new beginning must be made.

The desire for a king can be most easily illustrated from the experience of young people. They are often genuinely perplexed by their parents' reaction to their conduct. "Why should my mother allow this thing and forbid that? I can't see that there is more harm in the one than in the other. How can I tell what I ought to do?" It is the demand for a constant principle of action which will apply to all cases. They have reached the point where they wish to be able to judge for themselves what they ought and ought not to do. They do not want to be always asking permission. This is a natural development. The Lord foresaw its expression in the history of Israel. In Deuteronomy 17:14-20 it is foretold that Israel will demand a king, and the people are commanded to take the king whom the Lord shall choose.

There is an element of loss in this desire for independence from priestly authority. The celestial state desires nothing else than to look to the Lord as a little child to his parent. Self-dependence, even when the desire is to obey the truth, involves ignorance, mistakes, and disasters. Loving and wise parents often sigh when their children reach this stage, as Samuel disliked and feared the change. Yet it is a natural stage, and the Lord has provided for it. The Lord told Samuel to let the people have their way but to warn them that life under a king would not be easy. A king represents truth judging, apart from good, and truth apart from good is always a hard master. In @AC 8770[2] Swedenborg makes an interesting distinction; he says that the kingdom of the judges represents the rule of divine truth from divine good; the kingdom of priests who were also judges (Eli and Samuel), the rule of divine good from which is divine truth; but the kingdom of kings, the rule of divine truth without divine good. In @AC 1672, in making the distinction between the meanings of "nation" and "people," he says: "Before the sons of Israel sought for kings, they were a nation, and represented good, or the celestial; but after they desired a king, and received one, they became a people, and did not represent good or the celestial, but truth or the spiritual; which was the reason why this was imputed to them as a fault." See also @AE 2015[11] (below). The Lord tells Samuel, "Hearken unto the voice of the people in all that they say unto thee; for they have not rejected thee, but they have rejected me, that I should not reign over them." The desire for independent judgment goes deeper than mere rebellion against parental authority; it is rebellion against all authority which is not felt to be self-derived. Parents cannot prevent it; they can only point out the dangers and try to give their children principles in accordance with divine order — the king whom the Lord shall choose.

Saul was the Lord's choice as king. Not only did the Lord tell Samuel to anoint Saul, but the lot taken at Mizpeh fell upon Saul. Yet Saul's time of favor with God was to last only a short time. His victories would be few, and he would prove wholly inadequate to save Israel from most of their enemies. Why did the Lord choose Saul? Why did He not at once choose a David or a Solomon? Because the people were not ready. They would have rejected a wiser leader, while, except for a few "sons of Belial," they accepted Saul gladly. We have said that what young people demand is a consistent principle of action. There is only one such principle — the law of love — but they are not ready for it. We begin to understand and appreciate the law of love only after a lifetime of effort and experience. This may not seem to be so. We like to think we are acting from the law of love when we follow our natural good impulses, and many never outgrow this superficial idea of goodness. But the law of love is the law of divine love, which cannot be separated from divine wisdom. It has nothing to do with our natural impulses or with the outward appearance of things. The people accepted Saul gladly because of his external appearance of superiority. He stood head and shoulders above all the people. They had to learn by experience that he was not adequate to their needs.

Yet Saul had a measure of fitness for his office. He was to conquer some enemies. We cannot expect of young people the wisdom of experience. We can expect them to recognize the Lord and to try to do the Lord's will as they see it. They will inevitably at first judge by appearances. They will often be misled by specious arguments and apparent results. They do not like to wait for their results. Saul's size and power appeal to them. They must learn by experience — their own experience — in many cases. But we can help to prepare our children for states and experiences beyond their present knowledge, especially by means of these stories from the Word. The Lord did this with His disciples: "And now I have told you before it come to pass, that when it is come to pass, ye might believe." Saul represents divine truth in a natural and external form, suited to the needs and comprehension of certain states through which we all pass in youth and in which we sometimes remain long after we should have grown wiser. "By a king, or by the royalty which belonged to Saul, is signified Divine truth in respect to protection and judgment." (@AC 10540[7]).

=== From the Writings of Swedenborg

@AC 2015[11]: "As the kings represented truths, which ought not to have command, for the reason ... that they condemn, therefore the desire to have kings was so displeasing as to call for rebuke, and the nature of truth as regarded in itself was described by the rights [jus] of the king (1 Samuel 8:11-18); and at an earlier day it was commanded by Moses (Deuteronomy 17:14-16) that they should choose genuine truth which is from good, and not spurious; and that they should not defile it by reasonings and memory-knowledges [scientifica]. This is what is involved in the directions concerning a king, given in Moses in the place just cited; which no one can possibly see from the sense of the letter, but yet is evident from the several points contained in the internal sense; so that 'king' and 'kingship' evidently represented and signified nothing else than truth."

@AC 8770[2]: "In the representative church among the posterity of Jacob, there was first a kingdom of judges, afterward a kingdom of priests, and lastly a kingdom of kings; and by the kingdom of judges was represented Divine truth from Divine good; by the kingdom of priests, who were also judges, was represented Divine good from which is Divine truth; and by the kingdom of kings was represented Divine truth without Divine good."

SAUL'S IMPATIENCE — 1 Samuel 13

Samuel, his character and office, forms the link between the period of the judges and that of the kings. The difference between the time of the judges and the time of the kings can be brought out, and the children should get clearly in mind the difference in office between Samuel and Saul and the reason why Samuel really stood above the king and why he had to continue through Saul's reign and until David had gained the confidence of the people. The reason for the people's desire for a king should be pointed out, as well as Samuel's reaction to it and the reason for the Lord's permitting them to have a king even though it was in a sense a rejection of both Samuel and the Lord. In the older classes this should be discussed especially, as it brings out the necessity for our freedom of choice.

=== Doctrinal Points

Trust in the Lord instead of in self is the basis of spiritual progress.

=== Notes for Parents

Our lesson for today is about the first king of Israel. This, we recall, was a new kind of leadership. The first leaders were the patriarchs, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. The Jews then were really just a family, growing in numbers and developing several "collateral" branches, but still living together and recognizing as the head of their family its oldest male member. Then followed the period in Egypt when they had no leader, but were first protected and then enslaved by the ruler of Egypt. Then Moses was raised up to lead them out of Egypt and through the wilderness and to give them at Sinai the commandments and laws he received from the Lord for their guidance. Moses was the lawgiver. He died when they reached the border of the Holy Land, at which point Joshua, the military leader, took command and led them in the conquest of the Holy Land. Then followed the period of the Judges, a series of local leaders, whom the Lord raised up to conquer particular enemies. This was a time of disorganization when "every man did that which was right in his own eyes."

The last of the Judges was Samuel. Samuel was the only one of the Judges who was recognized by all the people, and this was because he was seen to be a prophet also, and they had not had a prophet for a long time. But Samuel was not a military leader, and the people wanted a king who would gather an army and lead them against their enemies. Samuel did not lose his position when the first king was chosen. He represented the Lord to the people all his life, and the Lord gave him the duty of anointing the second as well as the first king.

The first king was Saul. The people were delighted with him because he stood head and shoulders above all of them and they felt that surely he would be a leader whom their enemies would respect. But like many strong, brave young people, Saul was more energetic than wise. He won his first battle against the Ammonites and that made him self-confident. So when he was to fight against the Philistines, who had become the virtual rulers of the land, he did not wait for Samuel's help as he had been told to do. Samuel was to come and offer sacrifices, but Saul became impatient and offered them himself, afterward excusing himself to Samuel on the ground that his men were getting nervous and deserting, and he did not dare to wait. Most of us have had times when we were not willing to "wait on the Lord." We really know that the Lord's way is best, but in the stress of some difficulty we trust ourselves instead of the Lord. Saul was told by Samuel that his kingdom would not continue. We have to have a wiser leader than our own judgment. We have to learn patience and trust.

=== Primary

See what the children can remember of the story of Samuel's call. Then remind them why the people wanted a king and go on to the story for the day. There will be no difficulty here in teaching the whole story, and the lesson of Saul's impatience and its result can be understood even at this age. The children will also be interested in verses 19-22.

Who was the last of the Judges?

He was the last because the people decided they wanted a king, so that they could be like the other nations.

But Samuel would still be the Lord's prophet, the one who spoke for the Lord.

So the Lord told Samuel to anoint a man named Saul to be their king. The people were pleased with Saul because he was taller than any of the other men. The Bible says: "He was higher than any of the people from his shoulders and upward." So the fighting men were glad to have him for their leader, and he easily gathered an army.

But Saul did not turn out to be as good a king as they expected.

You know we can't always judge things by their looks. Saul was big and strong and brave, but he was not very wise. Samuel was still the Lord's prophet and Saul knew that he ought to do what Samuel told him to do.

So Saul easily gathered an army, and he won a great victory over an enemy called the Ammonites.

Then a very strong enemy, the Philistines, prepared to attack Israel. What had made them angry?

Jonathan was Saul's son.

Samuel had told Saul to go to Gilgal and wait for him seven days and he would then come and offer sacrifices.

Saul knew that Samuel spoke for the Lord and that he ought to obey. So he waited seven days at Gilgal for Samuel to come.

What did he do on the seventh day when Samuel had not arrived?

Are you ever in such a hurry to do something that you forget to obey? Saul had hardly finished his sacrifice when Samuel came.

What excuse did Saul give?

What did Samuel tell him?

What kind of man would the next king be?

Why did the Israelites not have swords and spears to fight with?

=== Junior

The Juniors will be interested in studying Israel's position in relation to the Philistines, the relative size of the armies, and the reasons why the people wanted a king and were pleased with Saul. They should look up the Bible references and study the map. Saul's strength and weakness make excellent lesson material for this age.

For a time the people were satisfied to have no leader except Samuel. Read 1 Samuel 7:15-17, and find on your map Ramah, Samuel's home, and the three places where he went to hold court. Samuel was a great judge, but he was not a fighting man, and the enemies of Israel were troubling the people. So they asked Samuel to give them a king. They saw that the other nations had kings who led them in battle, and they wanted one to lead them against their enemies. Samuel did not like the idea — he knew they should have been satisfied to let the Lord lead them — but the Lord told him to do as the people asked, and he told him whom to anoint as the first king. It was Saul.

Why were the people so pleased with Saul?

In chapter 11 we learn that Saul won his first battle, which was against the Ammonites. The people were delighted, and went to Gilgal and "renewed" Saul's kingship there. Then (chapter 12) Samuel made a solemn address to the people at Gilgal. He reminded them how he had served the Lord from his childhood, and asked them to say if he had ever done a wrong to any man. The people agreed that he never had. Not many people could win this reputation, could they? Then Samuel told them that if they hoped to prosper, they must obey the Lord, and he called down a storm of thunder and rain as a testimony to the people's wickedness. The people were very much frightened and begged him to pray for them. He promised to do this, but charged them solemnly that both they and their king must obey the Lord.

What enemy now rises against them?

What had made the Philistines angry?

Jonathan was Saul's son. The Philistines were camped at Michmash and Saul's army was gathered around him at Gilgal. Samuel had told Saul (1 Samuel 10:8) to wait for him at Gilgal seven days, and not to go into battle until Samuel had come and offered sacrifices. What did Saul do?

What excuse did Saul give?

We have seen before that people in the Bible are sometimes punished very severely for faults which seem to us not very great. But these faults always involve direct disobedience to the Lord, and that is never a small fault.

What did Samuel tell Saul?

In the Bible a king always pictures the principle, good or bad, which rules in our lives. A bad king is the principle that everybody else should do what pleases us; a good king is the principle that we should obey the Lord and help our neighbor. Saul, Israel's first king, was chosen for his looks. He meant well, but he was not very wise. Young people generally mean well, but like Saul they are sometimes in too much of a hurry. They do what seems right to them without taking time to think whether or not it is really right. It seemed to Saul that his men were leaving him and that if he did not hurry into battle, he would not be strong enough to conquer. Can you think of any stories in the Bible so far, that were in the history of Israel which Saul knew, which should have taught him better?

The Lord had often showed Israel that it was not their own strength which gave them victory. They could conquer only by means of the Lord's strength, as they obeyed Him. This is just as true of us. Whenever we think we know better than the Lord, we are headed for disaster. We have to make obedience to the Lord the first of our ruling principles. This was why Samuel told Saul that his kingdom would not continue.

What kind of man did Samuel say the next king would be?

Verses 19 to 22 tell us one of the ways in which the Philistines had been able to keep Israel in subjection.

What occupation did the Philistines keep in their own hands?

What was the result?

The relative correspondence of the earlier judges, of Samuel, and of the kings is the important study for this class. The correspondence of the Philistines should be touched upon and the reason why Saul was more successful against the Ammonites. The correspondence of weapons should especially be noted, as it will be important in later lessons.

Samuel was the only Judge whom all the people recognized as their leader. What do you think this means? It means that Samuel represents a truth which is meant to apply to every part of our lives. It is the truth that in every problem we have as the first thing to remember that we ought to trust and obey the Lord's commands, because our Heavenly Father is wiser than we can ever be.

The people should have been satisfied to obey Samuel, but they were not. The armies of their enemies seemed to them so strong that they could not quite believe in the Lord's power to save them. They wanted a king such as the other nations had, a king who would raise an army and lead them in battle. Samuel was displeased that the people wanted a king, because he felt they were rejecting him, but the Lord told him to let them have their way, and that the first king should be Saul. Samuel found Saul and anointed him and then, so that the people would be satisfied with the choice, he called them all together to cast lots, and the lot fell upon Saul. The people liked Saul as their king because of his appearance.

Saul was strong and brave, but he was not very wise. He meant well, but you know that people who mean well can make very serious mistakes if they act without thinking. Saul needed Samuel to guide him. Without Samuel he might have led the people into serious trouble. So Samuel lived and continued to be the Judge and the Lord's prophet almost to the end of Saul's reign.

The kings of Israel represent principles that rule our lives. They all represent the Lord's truth ruling, but we know that we see the truth in different ways at different times. For instance, when you read in the Sermon on the Mount (Matthew 5:39), "But I say unto you, That ye resist not evil: but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also," your first thought is that the Lord is giving you a command to be obeyed literally, and this is the way the early Christians took it. But presently you find that there are other statements in the Bible which show that we are certainly meant to resist evil, and you begin to try to find out what the Lord really does mean by this command. If you try hard enough, you will find that the word translated "resist" really means, in the Greek, to set something against itself, so that the thought is rather "oppose not evil with evil," and what the Lord is telling us is that we should not try to "pay back" wrongs that are done to us by doing wrong in return. So even the Lord's truth can be misunderstood by hasty and superficial judgment, and yet we have to read and learn the literal statement before we can try to understand it.

Saul represents the truth as it first appears to us. He won his first battle and that made him self-confident. So when Samuel did not come to Gilgal just as soon as Saul expected him, Saul went ahead and offered sacrifices himself. Read verses 11 and 12 to see how he tried to excuse himself. He was like the thing he represents. He judged by external appearance and did not wait to be sure he was doing the right thing. So Samuel had to tell him his kingdom would not continue. Whenever we make decisions hastily without taking time to be sure we are right, we are heading for trouble. We have to learn to think carefully and to wait until we are sure.

The enemy attacking Israel this time was the Philistines. They were a very strong and prosperous people who lived in the Holy Land along the Mediterranean seacoast. They had caused the Israelites much trouble, and at the time of our lesson were really ruling over them. We can see this in verses 19 to 22 of our chapter. Agricultural tools picture truths used in developing the mind and character. In the parable of the Sower the development of plants is explained by the Lord Himself as teaching about the growth of truth and goodness in our lives. Weapons picture truths used to overcome our weaknesses and bad habits, the spiritual enemies we all have. The Philistines are one of the most dangerous of these enemies — our tendency to be satisfied with knowing what is right without doing it. Do you see how true it is that this enemy keeps us from possessing and using effectively our spiritual weapons? Even in the literal story this was a serious handicap. It meant that Saul not only had a much smaller army than the Philistines, but that his men did not have proper weapons. Saul should have known that his army was helpless by itself, and that his strength was not in his army but in the Lord. He did really know it, for he felt that he must make sacrifices to the Lord before he went into battle; but his fear made him forget that he and his people had been solemnly warned by Samuel (1 Samuel 12:20-25) that they must obey the Lord in all things.

The story of Saul is given us in the Bible to teach us that we must never set up our own judgment above the Lord's command.

=== Basic Correspondences

the Philistines = the temptation to be satisfied with knowing what is right without doing it
Saul = truth from the Word understood in its letter only
Samuel = childlike trust and obedience to the Lord
weapons = truths used to defend us in our temptations or falsities used against truth
agricultural tools = truths used to develop character

=== Senior

The correspondence of Samuel and Saul, their relation to each other, and Saul's weakness and its results are particularly important for this age. The recollection of this lesson may save them from making serious mistakes after they leave home. They will meet the Philistine temptation very soon and need to recognize it for what it is and to be armed against it.

Samuel was the last of the Judges and the only one of them to be recognized by the whole nation as its Judge. The other Judges represent particular truths drawn up by the Lord from our memories to help us overcome particular faults that are bothering us. When the fault is overcome, the particular truth drops back into our general knowledge. But Samuel represents a general truth which our experience with our faults and weaknesses finally leads us to recognize. It is the truth that in relation to the Lord we are always little children, weak and ignorant, and that we ought to look to Him as our Father and trust and obey Him whether we understand His commands or not.

This does not mean that we should not go on trying to understand. The Lord has given us our brains and He expects us to use them, even though He knows we shall make mistakes. So long as we try to do right and recognize Samuel as our Judge, the Lord can help us to profit by our mistakes and to understand more and more. This is what is meant by the fact that Samuel lived to anoint the first two kings of Israel, Saul and David, and that he continued to judge Israel even while Saul was king. Read 1 Samuel 7:15-17. Saul is believed to have reigned nearly forty years, although the exact time is not stated in the Bible, and Samuel lived until about four years before Saul's death.

The three great kings of Israel represent successive ruling principles, the Lord's truth understood in three different ways. Saul represents a natural understanding of the truth, such as younger people are apt to have. It desires to serve the Lord and is eager for action but impatient under delays and, reasoning from appearances, is liable to set itself up as a better judge of what should be done than even the Lord. Saul was able to overcome the Ammonites, but not the Philistines. Chapter 11 tells about his first great victory. The Ammonites were descendants of Lot and picture external evils. Even a superficial understanding of the truth is able to show us that we must live outwardly moral and useful lives.

But the Philistine temptation is of a different kind. It is possible for a person to lead a very upright external life and still be inwardly selfish and self-satisfied and proud of his own intelligence. The Philistines represent the temptation to think that such an external knowledge and acceptance of the truth is all that is necessary. The only way in which Saul could have been successful against the Philistines was by keeping constantly before him the remembrance that his power came from the Lord and that only as he obeyed implicitly the Lord's directions as they came to him through Samuel, the Lord's prophet, could he hope for victory. Saul did not have this kind of wisdom and courage. His real trust was in external strength and not in the Lord. So when he saw his army deserting him, he thought he must take things into his own hands. This is just what our first understanding does. It wants quick results. When things do not seem to be going well, it wants to hurry into some new course. It is not willing to trust the ultimate wisdom of simple obedience to the Lord.

Saul's punishment seems severe, but it simply means that our early understanding of the truth is not an adequate guide. It lacks depth of insight and patience. It must be superseded by another ruler, "a man after the Lord's own heart." Notice verses 19 to 22. Israel's dependence upon the Philistines at this period for all its weapons and tools is a clear picture of bondage to self-intelligence. This comes out in young men and women in their tendency to exalt the findings of natural science and humanistic reasoning and to think religion impractical.

Saul as king does represent the rule of truth, but it is truth seen and understood in an external and natural way. This understanding has definite weaknesses and limitations; so it is to be superseded by a deeper and more spiritual understanding. But it wins some victories, and it produces some genuine truth or doctrine. This true doctrine to which our natural reason can lead us is represented by Saul's son Jonathan, about whom we shall study later.

=== Adult

Here again the Philistine temptation is an important topic, as well as the various aspects of truth presented in the lesson: the Judges, Samuel, the kings, the weapons, and the agricultural implements. The note on verse 21 can well be tied in with the discussion of the meaning of the Philistines.

In 1 Samuel 7:15-17 we learn that Samuel judged Israel "all the days of his life," holding court in a circuit of three towns near the center of the land. Samuel, we recall, represents a necessary return to a childlike state of trust and obedience after we have experienced the unhappy results of trying to direct ourselves. Samuel lived to anoint David as the second king of Israel. His death (1 Samuel 25:1) came before that of Saul but after David had risen to popularity. Samuel, as prophet and judge, represents the Word of the Lord, accepted in childlike faith, instructing and judging us as we pass from a state of reliance on our own ideas of right to one of intelligent acceptance of the Lord's guidance. Just as Moses had to remain in the land of Midian for forty years before he was prepared for his call to lead the children of Israel out of Egypt, so Samuel had to retain the actual power in the Holy Land until the people had reached the point when they would accept as king a man "after the Lord's own heart."

Throughout the Word a king represents truth (or falsity) ruling.

Recall the Lord's answer to Pilate in John 18:37. The three kings of Israel all represent the Lord's truth ruling in our lives, but they represent that truth seen by us in three different ways, at three different levels of understanding. All three of these levels are adult states and they are necessary stages in our regeneration. Ideally we might live out our lives under Samuel's direction, and some few people do. We recall that when the people asked for a king, Samuel was displeased because he felt himself rejected, but the Lord told him that the people, in rejecting him, were really rejecting the Lord. The Lord then told him to do as the people asked. We are not in an ideal state and we must choose our leaders in freedom, but the Lord provides that with each person who truly wants to do right, the childlike trust represented by Samuel shall remain in control until he has come by the way of experience into the recognition of the higher rational as his leader. David would not have been accepted by Israel at first. Only their experience with the results of Saul's weakness made them see David's strength.

Saul was accepted immediately because of his appearance, because "when he stood among the people, he was higher than any of the people from his shoulders and upward." The shoulder corresponds to power. The people were looking for a strong man to lead them against their enemies. Saul as king represents divine truth in its hard, external aspect, untempered by mercy, as it appears to those who have not yet gained any depth of experience and wisdom; to young adults, for example, who are just beginning to form their own independent judgments as to conduct. Saul was completely victorious in his battles with the Ammonites (1 Samuel 11) when they attacked Jabesh—Gilead, because Gilead, in the territory of Gad across the Jordan, represents good works, and even a superficial understanding of the truth is able to recognize and repel the false arguments which would blind and enslave the affection for doing external good works.

But the Philistines, who are the attackers in our lesson today, were an enemy of a different and more subtle character, an internal enemy, the ever-present and powerful temptation to rest satisfied with knowing what is right without making the effort to do it. It is obvious that truth understood only superficially cannot overcome this enemy. Samuel had told Saul to wait at Gilgal seven days, until he should come and sacrifice to the Lord and assure victory. But Saul was impatient. It appeared to him that his men were leaving him, that the delay was weakening his military strength, and finally he took matters into his own hands and offered the sacrifice himself without waiting for Samuel. Young people almost always feel a good deal of sympathy for Saul in his impatience, which is good evidence of the truth of the correspondence. When we are young and active, we do not like to wait for the right time and way of doing what we believe ought to be done. We may know that we ought to wait, as Saul did, but things seem to be going from bad to worse. We judge by appearances and act before our remains of childlike trust have had time to fulfill their true mission. Actually we put our own judgment before the Lord's. The failure which inevitably results shows us that the principle on which we have been depending is not adequate, that if our good intentions are to have good results they must have a new principle of a different degree from the mere external judgment, something which goes deeper. The kingdom is to be rent from Saul and given to another. "The Lord hath sought him a man after his own heart, and the Lord hath commanded him to be captain over his people, because thou hast not kept that which the Lord commanded thee."

Judgment from mere appearances fails, and the first lesson learned is: "Wait on the Lord; be of good courage, and he shall strengthen thine heart: wait, I say, on the Lord." (Psalm 27:14) The strengthening of the heart is what the Lord is waiting for. Patience is a virtue which is developed only through trial. Saul was impatient. Young people are impatient, for example, with the slow advance of reforms. To them any action seems better than no action. They must learn by experience to wait as well as to work. Saul's whole strength was in the Lord's help. When he set his own judgment before the Lord's command through Samuel, his efforts were doomed to failure. So it is with us whenever we judge by appearances only and imagine that the Lord's providence is failing and that our own way will bring success. Whenever we act contrary to the Lord's commandments, even though we tell ourselves that we are doing it to hasten the accomplishment of a good purpose, we cut ourselves off from the only power that can bring about good. For our only real strength is the Lord's strength in us. The Lord knows best. "A little one shall become a thousand, and a small one a strong nation: I the Lord will hasten it in his time." (Isaiah 60:22)

Saul's accomplishments were sufficient to accustom the people to the rule of a king, to arouse their loyalty, to establish their courage, to teach them to meet the demands made upon them; and Saul was able to overcome external enemies and partially to overcome more internal ones. But Saul was impatient and self-assertive, superficial in his judgments, and prone to place these judgments above the explicit commands of the Lord. In the same way, the external understanding of truth is sufficient to accustom us to accept the truth as our leader and to develop our ability to stand up for it bravely as occasion requires. But it is not sufficient to show us the necessity for delays or to get to the root of evils within ourselves and in the world. Verses 19 to 22 add an interesting thought. Tools of all kinds represent truths. Weapons of war are truths of use in fighting evils. Farm implements are truths necessary for developing and preparing uses, the "fruits and grains" to be made part of the life. The Philistines are those who like to know truths but have no desire to live them. In this passage they suggest the people who enjoy intellectual discussion — the sharpening of the mind — but are anxious to keep the "religious" people from doing the same thing except under their direction and control, and especially unwilling to have arguments developed which might expose their own weaknesses and selfish motives.

=== From the Writings of Swedenborg

@AE 7002: "The Philistines represented, and thus signified, those who make no account of good of love and charity, and thus no account of good of life, placing everything of religion in knowledge ... therefore they were like those at the present day who make faith alone, that is, faith separated from charity, the essential of the church and the essential of salvation. This is why they were called 'the uncircumcised,' for to be uncircumcised signifies to be destitute of spiritual love, thus of good.... This makes evident why the Philistines conquered, and sometimes the sons of Israel. The Philistines conquered when the sons of Israel departed from the statutes and precepts in not doing them; but when the sons of Israel lived according to these they conquered. To live according to the precepts and statutes was their good of love and good of life. At this time the sons of Israel had been conquered by the Philistines because they had gone away from the worship of Jehovah to the worship of other gods, especially to the worship of Ashtaroth, as can be seen from what Samuel said to them (1 Samuel 7:3)."
