=== INTRO

Remind the older classes that the book of Daniel, like the book of Psalms, is not in the Hebrew canon of Scripture but was given a proper place in the Word for Christians by the Lord Himself. For the younger children a reminder of the fall of Judah and the carrying away of the people to Babylon will lead into the story of Daniel.
