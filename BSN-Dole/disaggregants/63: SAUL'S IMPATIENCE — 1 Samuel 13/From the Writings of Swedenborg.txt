=== From the Writings of Swedenborg

@AE 7002: "The Philistines represented, and thus signified, those who make no account of good of love and charity, and thus no account of good of life, placing everything of religion in knowledge ... therefore they were like those at the present day who make faith alone, that is, faith separated from charity, the essential of the church and the essential of salvation. This is why they were called 'the uncircumcised,' for to be uncircumcised signifies to be destitute of spiritual love, thus of good.... This makes evident why the Philistines conquered, and sometimes the sons of Israel. The Philistines conquered when the sons of Israel departed from the statutes and precepts in not doing them; but when the sons of Israel lived according to these they conquered. To live according to the precepts and statutes was their good of love and good of life. At this time the sons of Israel had been conquered by the Philistines because they had gone away from the worship of Jehovah to the worship of other gods, especially to the worship of Ashtaroth, as can be seen from what Samuel said to them (1 Samuel 7:3)."
