=== Introduction

The book of Genesis ends with the death of Joseph. At that time the Israelites were settled comfortably in Egypt and still respected because of Joseph. But as the years passed, and the Hebrews grew in numbers, the Egyptians began to resent them until one of the Pharaohs ordered that all male children born to the Hebrews were to be killed. This is where the story begins in the book of Exodus.
