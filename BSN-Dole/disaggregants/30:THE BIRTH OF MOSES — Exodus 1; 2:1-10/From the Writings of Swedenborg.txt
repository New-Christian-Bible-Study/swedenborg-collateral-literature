=== From the Writings of Swedenborg

@AC 6751: "The law Divine in a wide sense signifies the whole Word; in a sense less extended the Historic Word; in a close sense, what was written through Moses; and in the closest sense, the ten commandments written on the tables of stone upon Mount Sinai. Moses represents the law in the less wide sense, also in the close, and likewise in the closest sense."

@AC 6723: "And she took an ark of rush. That this signifies what is of low value round about, but nevertheless derived from truth, is evident from the signification of 'an ark,' as being what is round about, or that in which anything is enclosed; and from the signification of 'rush,' as being what is of low value, but nevertheless derived from truth .... As it was provided that Moses should represent the Lord as to the law Divine, or the Word, specifically the historic Word, it was therefore brought about that when he was an infant he was placed in a little ark, but in one of low value, because he was in his first rising, and because his being there was only a representative; but that afterward when the law Divine itself had shone forth from Mount Sinai, it was placed in an ark which was called the 'ark of the testimony.'"
