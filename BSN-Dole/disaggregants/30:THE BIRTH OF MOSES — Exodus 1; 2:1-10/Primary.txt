The littlest ones can understand most of this simple story. Be sure they know that it was really the Lord who saved Moses by bringing Pharaoh's daughter to the river just at the right time. Impress upon them the name Moses. Show them what a mistake the Israelites made when they stayed in Egypt instead of going back to the land the Lord had given them, when the famine was over. The trouble they got into as a result leads directly to the story of Moses, which is always interesting to children and easy to tell.

---
During the days of Joseph, Pharaoh gave the Hebrews the best part of Egypt to live in, and they became so prosperous and comfortable there that they did not go back after the famine in Canaan was over, as they should have done. This proved a foolish mistake. For after Joseph died, the kings of Egypt became less friendly to the Hebrews, and finally the Egyptians became so afraid of this growing nation of strangers in their land that they decided to make slaves of them and keep them down in other ways.

What happened about two hundred years after Joseph died?

What order did the new Pharaoh give?

What child was saved?

How was he saved?

Who adopted him?

Who was his nurse?

Let us read the story from the Bible. [Read Exodus 1:6-22; 2:1-10.] We shall hear much more about Moses in our next lessons; so you want to be sure to remember his name. You see the Lord took care of Moses just as He had taken care of Joseph.
