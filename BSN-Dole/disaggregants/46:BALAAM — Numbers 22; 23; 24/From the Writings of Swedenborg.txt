@AC 3762: "And went to the land of the sons of the east. That this signifies to the truths of love (that is, elevation thereto) is evident from the signification of the 'land of the sons of the east.' That Aram, or Syria, was called the 'land of the sons of the east,' is evident, because it was thither that Jacob betook himself. That by 'Syria' in general are signified the knowledges of good, was shown above; but specifically, by 'Aram-Naharaim' (that is, 'Syria of the rivers') are signified the knowledges of truth ... These truths, that relate to charity toward the neighbor and to love to the Lord, must be learned before it is possible for a man to be regenerated; and must also be acknowledged and believed; and insofar as they are acknowledged, believed, and ingrafted in the life, so far the man is regenerated, and insofar they are at the same time implanted in the man's natural, in which they are as in their own ground ... That the wise men from the east who came to Jesus at His birth were of those who were called 'the sons of the east,' is evident from the fact that they were in the knowledge that the Lord was to be born, and that they knew of His advent by a star which appeared to them in the east ... That from ancient times such a prophetic knowledge had existed among the sons of the east, who were of Syria, is evident from Balaam's prophecy concerning the Lord's advent ... (Numbers 24:17). That Balaam was from the land of the sons of the east, that is, from Syria, is evident from these words: 'Balaam uttered his enunciation and said, Balak hath brought me from Syria, out of the mountains of the east' (Numbers 23:7)."
