=== Introduction

For review it is enough for the children now to recall that the Israelites wandered in the wilderness for forty years in all and had many adventures and trials, and that the events of our lesson for today took place close to the end of the forty years and constitute the last of their trials before they entered the Holy Land. In all classes stress the prophecy of the Star and point out that Balaam and the Wise Men came from the same country and possessed knowledge handed down from the Ancient Word.
