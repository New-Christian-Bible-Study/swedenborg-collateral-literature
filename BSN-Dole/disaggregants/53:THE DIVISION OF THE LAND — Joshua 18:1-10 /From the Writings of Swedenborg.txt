=== From the Writings of Swedenborg

@AC 3913: "By the twelve sons of Jacob are here described the twelve general or cardinal things by means of which while being regenerated or made a church, man is initiated into what is spiritual and celestial. For when a man is being regenerated, or made a church (that is, when from a dead man he is becoming alive, or from corporeal heavenly), he is led by the Lord through many states. These general states are what are designated by the 'twelve sons,' and afterwards by the 'twelve tribes'; for which reason the 'twelve tribes' signify all things of faith and love ... for generals involve all the particulars and singulars, and these latter bear relation to the former. When a man is being regenerated, the internal man is to be conjoined with the external, consequently the goods and truths of the internal man with the goods and truths of the external; for from truths and goods man is man. These cannot be conjoined without means. Means are such things as derive something from the one side, and something from the other, and which are attended with the effect that in so far as the man accedes to the one, the other becomes subordinate. These means are what are signified by the 'handmaids,' the means on the part of the internal man by the handmaids of Rachel; and the means on the part of the external man by the handmaids of Leah."
