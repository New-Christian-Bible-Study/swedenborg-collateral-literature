=== Introduction

This lesson should cover the conquest as well as the division of the land. With the younger classes the statement that the land was conquered will be enough. The Juniors should be told the fact that there were three campaigns, and their order. A little more should be done in the three older classes. Suggestions as to outstanding points will be found in the pupils' notes.
