=== From the Writings of Swedenborg

@AR 410-411: "And the name of the star is called Wormwood; and the third part of the waters became wormwood, signifies the infernal falsity from which their own intelligence is derived, and by which all the truths of the Word are falsified. By 'a star' is signified their own intelligence springing from pride from infernal love ... By 'name' is signified its quality ... ; by 'wormwood' is signified infernal falsity concerning which something will be said presently; by 'waters' are signified truths ... , here the truths of the Word, because the subject relates to faith; by 'the third part' is signified all ... A Christian man has spiritual life from no other source than from the truths of the Word, for in them there is life; but when the truths of the Word are falsified, and man understands and views them according to the falsities of his religion, then spiritual life with him is extinguished. The reason is, because the Word communicates with heaven; therefore when it is read by man, the truths therein ascend into heaven, and the falsities to which truths are adjoined or conjoined, tend towards hell, whence there is a rending asunder, whereby the life of the Word is extinguished. But this is the case only with those who confirm falsities by the Word, but not with those who do not confirm them. I have seen such rendings asunder, and have heard the noise like that of wood split by the fire on a hearth."
