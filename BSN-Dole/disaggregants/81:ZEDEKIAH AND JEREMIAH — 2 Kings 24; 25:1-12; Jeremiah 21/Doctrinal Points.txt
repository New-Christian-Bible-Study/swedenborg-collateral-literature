=== Doctrinal Points

The Lord cannot save a person against his will.

The books of the prophets often help us to understand the historical books of the Word.

We cannot turn to the Lord and expect Him to save us if we are not willing to obey Him.

When the mind turns from truth to falsity, goodness in the heart cannot long survive.
