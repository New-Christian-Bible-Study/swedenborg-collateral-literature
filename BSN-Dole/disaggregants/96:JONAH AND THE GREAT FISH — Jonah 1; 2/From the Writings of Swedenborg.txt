=== From the Writings of Swedenborg

Spiritual Diary, n. 1391: "That representations in the other life are actual in the world. Moreover, similar [things] exist also in the world, for all those things actually exist upon earth; so that it cannot but be that they signify [spiritual things], as that Jonah was swallowed by a whale, which actually happened in the world; as also did the miracles of Egypt, and many other [things] called miracles." [This was written in March 1748, the year before Volume 1 of the Arcana was published. -Editor]
