[.underline]#*Teacher Notes:*# 
The story of the spies is not hard to tell. The children will be interested in the fruits which they brought back and in the fact that they saw some giants in the land. Stress the fact that the Lord would have helped them if they had not been afraid to try to conquer the land. Discuss the point that the Lord cannot help us to do what we ought to do unless we are willing to try. Nothing good is ever accomplished if we think we can't do it. This applies to lessons in school, tasks at home, and to the overcoming of our faults as well.

The children of Israel stayed nearly a year at Mount Sinai. Then the pillar of cloud and fire led them on through the wilderness. From there they were led to camp at a place called Kadesh.

Kadesh was close to the border of the Holy Land.

What did the Lord tell Moses to do?

How many were chosen to spy out the land?

How long were they gone?

What did they bring back?

Did they say the land was a good land?

What did they find there that was not good?

Which of the spies differed from all the others?

What did these two advise?

What did the others say?

But the people would not listen to Joshua and Caleb, and even tried to stone them. They believed the ten cowardly spies, and rebelled against Moses, and talked of going back to Egypt. So the Lord said that they should never enter the Holy Land. Only their children, the ones under twenty at the time of our lesson, who were not old enough to have a voice in the people's decision, and Joshua and Caleb would be allowed to enter the land.

What punishment came to the ten cowardly spies?

What was the people's punishment?

What reward was promised for Joshua and Caleb?
