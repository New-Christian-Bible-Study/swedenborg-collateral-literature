=== Notes for Parents

When we think about the crucifixion of the Lord, it is likely to seem to us a terrible crime which was committed long ago, in which we are glad that we had no part. We live in a nominally Christian nation after centuries of recognition of the Lord. And we live in an age which has learned — as a result of Christianity — to think of physical torture as barbarous. But the people in the Lord's time took cruel punishments for granted, and to the chief priests the Lord was just a Nazarene who was stirring up the people and threatening their own authority. They did commit a cruel crime, but our thought should be about the motives which prompted them and about how far we may have those same motives in our own hearts.

Do we ever refuse to recognize the truth because it would interfere with what we want to do? Do we ever try to discredit and silence someone who presumes to criticize us? Do we ever try to ridicule other people into agreeing with us?

The Lord had power to save Himself from His enemies. He had proved it many times. He could have performed a great miracle which would have forced everyone to believe in Him. But this would not have changed their hearts. Nothing really brings people happiness but love freely given, and the Lord wants us to be happy. So He leaves us free. He came into the world to show us the whole way of life, and that had to include the way through death. He had said to His disciples, "Be not afraid of them that kill the body, and after that have no more that they can do." If we will learn this lesson from Him and try always to follow His example, evil will have no power over us, and we shall be what He wants us all to be, inheritors of the kingdom of heaven.
