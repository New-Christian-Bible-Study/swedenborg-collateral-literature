=== From the Writings of Swedenborg

@AC 8391: "He who leads a life of faith does repentance daily; for he reflects upon the evils that are in him; acknowledges them, guards himself against them, and supplicates the Lord for aid."

@AC 8394: "After a man has examined himself, and has acknowledged his sins, and has done repentance, he must remain constant in good up to the end of life. If however he afterward falls back into his former life of evil, and embraces it, he commits profanation, for he then conjoins evil with good, and consequently his latter state becomes worse than his former one." (See Matthew 12:43-45.)
