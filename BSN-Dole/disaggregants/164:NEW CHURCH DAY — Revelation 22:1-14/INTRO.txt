=== Introduction

"New Church Day" presents a good opportunity to emphasize man's fundamental need of recognition and worship of the Lord, constant study of the Word in the light of the Writings, and the daily effort to live as the Lord teaches us to live instead of from our own selfish ideas of what is best. Try to keep this major objective in mind as you teach the various classes. None are too young to have it impressed upon them.
