=== Doctrinal Points
----
• The Samaritans in the New Testament were descendants of the "strangers" (foreigners) brought in to take the place of the captured people of Israel. This means that when we give up right thinking, wrong thinking takes its place, and this has long-lasting consequences.
• Our good intentions cannot long survive when our minds are captivated by worldly reasoning.
• External good works are not in themselves "charity."
