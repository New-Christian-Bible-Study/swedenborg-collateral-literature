=== INTRO

This is a chapter characteristic of the history of Judah. Start by reminding the children of Elijah and Elisha, and telling them of the captivity of Israel to Assyria. Remind them that all the kings of Israel were wicked kings, and point out that Judah survived longer because several of its kings were good kings like Hezekiah. This is clearly pictured in the story of the prolonging of Hezekiah's life.
