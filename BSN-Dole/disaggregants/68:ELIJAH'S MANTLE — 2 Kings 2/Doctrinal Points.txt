=== Doctrinal Points

The power of the Word is exercised through its literal sense.

It is of divine providence that one becomes aware of the teachings of the Second Coming.

We never reach a point where we no longer need to study the Word. If we see the spiritual meaning and God's love speaking through it, the letter of the Word will have new and much greater power in and through us.
