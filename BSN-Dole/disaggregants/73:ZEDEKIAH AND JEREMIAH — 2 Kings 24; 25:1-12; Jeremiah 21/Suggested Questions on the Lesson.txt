== THE BOOK OF PSALMS — 2 Samuel 23:1-2; Psalm 1

In connection with the study of Psalm 19 [next lesson], we shall deal in some detail with the history of the book of Psalms and with the use of the Psalms in the temple worship. There we shall emphasize rather the spiritual character of the book and the use of the Psalms in our personal life. In all classes the testimony of David in 2 Samuel 23:1-2 and of the Lord in Luke 24:44 should be read, and our use of the Psalms in our church service should also be pointed out.
