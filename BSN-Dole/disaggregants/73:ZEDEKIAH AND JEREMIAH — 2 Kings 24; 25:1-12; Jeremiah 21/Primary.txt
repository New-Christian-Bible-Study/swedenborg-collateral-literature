Even the little children should get the idea that the Lord cannot prosper people who turn against Him and refuse to obey Him. Teach the name Jeremiah, as well as the names of the two kingdoms, Judah and Israel, and try to tell the story in such a way that Assyria will be connected in their minds with Israel and Babylon with Judah. The carrying off of the people and the fate of the great city of Jerusalem and of the temple should interest them. Tell the children who the Samaritans of Gospel days were.

Do you remember the names of the two great prophets whom the Lord sent to warn the people of Israel? They were Elijah and Elisha. Elisha cured a Syrian captain named Naaman of a terrible disease by telling him to wash seven times in the Jordan River. You would think that the people of Israel would have listened to the warnings of such a great prophet as Elisha, but they didn't. They went right on worshiping the golden calves and doing all sorts of wicked things, and so the Lord could not help them against their enemies. These enemies became more and more powerful, and finally the king of Assyria conquered Israel and carried all the people away captive and brought foreigners in to settle the land in their place.

The kingdom of Judah lasted longer than the kingdom of Israel. This was because some of them worshiped the Lord in the temple. But many of them worshiped idols instead.

Finally Judah, too, became so wicked that the Lord could not save it.
