=== Doctrinal Points

The Lord is life itself.

The "stone is rolled away" when we see that the letter of the Word was not man-made but was given by inspiration by the Lord for the sake of the inner meaning.

True faith is eager to understand.

Love in the heart is the first thing necessary if we are to see the glorified Christ.
