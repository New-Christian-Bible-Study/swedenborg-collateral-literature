@AC 9965: "Lest they bear iniquity, and die (Exodus 28:43). That this signifies the annihilation of the whole of worship, is evident from the signification of 'bearing iniquity,' when said of the priesthood of Aaron and his sons, as being the removal of falsities and evils with those who are in good from the Lord ... But when they are said 'to bear iniquity and die,' it signifies the annihilation of all worship ... for representative worship died, because nothing of it appeared any longer in the heavens ... Moreover that they died when they did not act in accordance with the statutes, is plain from Aaron's sons, Nadab and Abihu, who were consumed by fire from heaven when they burned incense, not from the fire of the altar, but from strange fire ... The fire of the altar represented love Divine, thus love from the Lord, whereas the strange fire represented love from hell. The annihilation of worship was signified by the burning of incense from this latter fire, which resulted in their death. It is said in many passages in the Word that 'they would bear iniquity' when they did not act according to the statutes, and by this was signified damnation, because their sins were not removed; not that they were damned on this account, but that they thereby annihilated the representative worship, and thus represented the damned who remain in their sins. For no one is damned on account of the omission of external rites; but on account of evils of the heart, thus on account of the omission of them from evil of heart."
