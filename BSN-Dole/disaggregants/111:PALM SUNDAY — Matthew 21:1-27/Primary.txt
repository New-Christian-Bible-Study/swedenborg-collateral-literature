Talk about the Lord, the donkey, the garments on the donkey, and the palm branches.

---
Dwell on the joy of the people, especially of the children, in welcoming the Lord. The lesson should end with at least a statement of the fact that within a few days the very people who welcomed the Lord on Palm Sunday turned against Him and put Him to death. The children can also understand that when they are good, they are welcoming the Lord into their hearts as king, and that whenever they are naughty, they are turning against Him.

This week is called "Holy Week," and today is Palm Sunday.

Can you tell why this is called Palm Sunday? (see John 12:13)

It was the beginning of the Lord's last week on earth.

On the first day of that week the Lord came to Jerusalem.

What did he tell two of His disciples to do?

How did He enter Jerusalem?

It was the custom of kings and judges to ride upon donkeys.

And it had been prophesied that the Messiah would come riding on a donkey. Suppose we read this prophecy in Zechariah 9:9.

The people welcomed the Lord gladly, and especially the little children.

The chief priests and scribes did not like to hear Jesus praised.

But He told them that the little children who sang hosannas were wiser than they.

The priests, however, were very powerful, and the people listened to them. They very soon turned against the Lord.

What did the Lord find in the temple?

Many of the people were making money for themselves out of the gifts that were brought to the temple for the Lord. They were really stealing from Him.

Before the week was over, they put Him to death.

The Lord knew they were going to do this, but He went to Jerusalem just the same.

If we love the Lord, we shall accept Him as our king and try to learn what He tells us is right.

And we shall try to be strong and brave enough to do right even when it is hard.
