=== From the Writings of Swedenborg

@AC 2781: "To 'ride upon a donkey' was a sign that the natural was made subordinate; and to 'ride upon a colt, the son of a she—donkey' was the sign that the rational was made subordinate ... From this their signification, and because it belonged to the highest judge and to a king to ride upon them, and at the same time that the representatives of the church might be fulfilled, it pleased the Lord to do this. ... From all this it is now evident that all and everything in the church of that period was representative of the Lord, and therefore of the celestial and spiritual things that are in His kingdom — even to the she—donkey and the colt of a she—donkey, by which the natural man as to good and truth was represented. The reason of the representation was that the natural man ought to serve the rational, and this the spiritual, this the celestial, and this the Lord: such is the order of subordination."
