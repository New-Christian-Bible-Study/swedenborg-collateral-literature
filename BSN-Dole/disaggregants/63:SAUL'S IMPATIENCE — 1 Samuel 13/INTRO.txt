=== Introduction

Samuel, his character and office, forms the link between the period of the judges and that of the kings. The difference between the time of the judges and the time of the kings can be brought out, and the children should get clearly in mind the difference in office between Samuel and Saul and the reason why Samuel really stood above the king and why he had to continue through Saul's reign and until David had gained the confidence of the people. The reason for the people's desire for a king should be pointed out, as well as Samuel's reaction to it and the reason for the Lord's permitting them to have a king even though it was in a sense a rejection of both Samuel and the Lord. In the older classes this should be discussed especially, as it brings out the necessity for our freedom of choice.
