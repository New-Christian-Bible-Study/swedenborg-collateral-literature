=== Doctrinal Points
----
• The Lord took on a human nature from Mary and glorified it, or made it Divine, by overcoming the temptations which came to Him through it.
• The inmost or celestial sense of the Word describes the inner life of the Lord when He was on earth.
• The Lord keeps our early states of belief stored up within us as a basis for our later salvation.
• Good will must really be first, although we have to learn what is right before we can do it.
