=== From the Writings of Swedenborg

@AC 6222: “It is believed that those have an intellectual in the things of the church who are skillful in confirming the tenets or doctrinals of their own church by many things, and this even to persuasion that it is so, and who also are skillful in dexterously confuting many heresies, but this is not the intellectual of the church, for to confirm a tenet is not of the intellectual, but of memory in the sensuous, and it is sometimes found in the worst of men, and can also be done by those who believe nothing whatever, and also by those who are in very falsities. Nothing is more easy than for all such persons to confirm whatever they please, even to the point of persuading the simple. But the intellectual of the church is, to perceive and see, before any tenet is confirmed, whether it is true or not, and then to confirm it. This is the intellectual which is represented by Ephraim, but the good of the church, which is represented by Manasseh, is the good of charity which is insinuated by the Lord into the man of the church by means of the truths of faith, for these, together with the good of charity, are what flow into the intellectual and enlighten it, and also make the intellectual and the will constitute one mind. ... All the affection of good and truth, by which comes enlightenment, flows from no other source, and thus is born from no other source, than the internal, that is, through the internal from the Lord."
