=== For Younger Children

[.underline]#*Teacher Notes:*# 
Joseph is almost the only individual in the Old Testament story of whom no unworthy actions are recorded; so his story is easy to present to young children. Be sure they get the name Joseph and know whose son he was and that he himself had two sons who were specially favored by Jacob. The crossing of Jacob's hands will interest the children, and help to fix the story in mind. It may be illustrated by action to impress it on their minds. Call their attention to the fact that Jacob himself had been put ahead of his twin brother Esau, who was actually the firstborn.

When a great famine came to the Holy Land, Jacob sent his sons down to Egypt to buy food, and they had to buy it from Joseph. Joseph was kind to them and forgave them for what they had done to him, and told them to bring Jacob and their families and all their flocks and herds down to Egypt, and he would take care of them until the famine was over. And the king of Egypt, who was called the Pharaoh, loved Joseph so much that he gave Joseph's family the land of Goshen, which was the best land in Egypt. In fact, they were so prosperous there that they did not want to go home and they stayed on in Egypt for many years.

Jacob and Joseph both died in Egypt, but they were finally buried in the Holy Land.

Their bodies were embalmed, a method the Egyptians had for preserving the body.

An embalmed body is called a "mummy." You may have heard about them.
