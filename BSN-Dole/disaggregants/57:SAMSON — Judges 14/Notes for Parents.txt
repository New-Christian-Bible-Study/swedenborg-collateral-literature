=== Notes for Parents

Almost everyone thinks of Samson as a synonym for strength and Delilah for treachery, but many have not read the whole story of Samson and so do not know that he had his strength only so long as he obeyed the Lord, and that if he had not yielded to his lower desires, he could not have been overcome by Delilah's wiles.

The last verse of the book of Judges gives us the key to the meaning of the whole book, as well as of the story of Samson:

"In those days there was no king in Israel: every man did that which was right in his own eyes." You may have heard people say, "If I do what I think is right, that is all that can be expected of me." That sounds reasonable, but it is really just an excuse for doing what we want to do without testing our desires and thoughts by the Lord's truth. We should have a king — the Lord Jesus Christ — by whose laws we intend to be governed. When each man is a law unto himself, there is anarchy, and only trouble and conflict result.

Samson was a Nazarite, a man set apart for the service of God.

The principal sign of a Nazarite was that he never cut his hair. As long as Samson kept this sign, the Lord could be with him and give him strength to overcome any enemy. So his strength was in his hair. The first victory given him — over a lion — means to us that the Lord can give us strength to resist any temptation, and the honey he afterward found in the carcass represents the happiness which comes from overcoming temptation. Anyone who steadily tries to learn truth from the Word and to obey the commandments has had this experience and knows the answer to Samson's riddle. Our strength is in keeping the letter of the law of the Lord, which is the outmost form of the Lord's truth, as the hair is the outmost manifestation of the body's life.
