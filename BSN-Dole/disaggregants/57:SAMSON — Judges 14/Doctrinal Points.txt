=== Doctrinal Points

Samson represents the power of the Lord in our outward life. 

The Word is in its power in the sense of the letter.

The Philistines represent knowing spiritual truth but not caring to live according to it. This is what is called "faith alone."

There is no real strength apart from love in the heart.
