=== From the Writings of Swedenborg

@AE 14: "To 'hear' is to obey and to live, because with celestial angels the things that are heard enter into the life; but as this is unknown, I would like to explain it briefly. There are two senses given to man which serve as means of receiving the things whereby the rational is formed, and also the things by which man is reformed; these are the sense of sight and the sense of hearing; the other senses are for other uses. The things that enter by the sense of sight enter into man's understanding and enlighten it, for which reason by 'sight' is signified the understanding enlightened, for the understanding corresponds to the sight of the eye, as the light of heaven corresponds to the light of the world. The things, however, that enter by the sense of hearing enter both into the understanding and into the will, and for this reason by 'the hearing' is signified perception and obedience. Consequently, in human language, to 'hear' anyone, and to 'give ear' to anyone, also to 'listen to,' and 'hearken to,' are common expressions; and by 'hearing anyone' is meant to perceive, and by 'giving ear to,' as also by 'listening to' is meant to obey; while 'hearkening to' means either perceiving or obeying. These expressions flowed down into human language out of the spiritual world, where man's spirit is."
