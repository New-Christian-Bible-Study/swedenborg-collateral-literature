=== Doctrinal Points

The Lord is constantly trying to reach those in evil and falsity.

The Word is written in such a way that it may reach those in evil. People who are in falsities may be saved if there is charity in their hearts.

True charity reaches out to everyone but does not treat the good and the evil just alike.
