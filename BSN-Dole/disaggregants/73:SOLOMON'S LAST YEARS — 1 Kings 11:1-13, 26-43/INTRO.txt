=== Introduction

Solomon was the second son of David and Bathsheba and the third king of Israel. The meaning of his name should be told in all classes, as well as the difference between his reign and David's. His wisdom and glory and his building of the temple should be noted. In the lesson for today stress the fact that his wives led him into the worship of idols, rather than the fact that he had a great number of wives. Connect the rending of Jeroboam's garment with the rending of Samuel's robe by Saul (1 Samuel 15:27-28).
