[.underline]#*Teacher Notes:*# 
Teach the children about Solomon's reign and the meaning of his name, and drill them in the names of the three great kings. They will be interested in the rending of Jeroboam's garment. The lesson proper should be taught as a preparation for the story of the division of the kingdom.

---
After David died, his son Solomon became king. The Old Testament was not first written in our English language. It was written in Hebrew. In that language all names have meanings. See if you can remember that the name Solomon means "peace." We have learned that both Saul and David were fighting kings, and that David, because he obeyed the Lord, was given victory over all the enemies of Israel. So when Solomon became king, the country was at peace, and Solomon had no enemies to fight.

One night, not long after Solomon became king, the Lord appeared to him and told him to make a wish for whatever he most wanted. Solomon did not ask for riches or power, but for wisdom to rule his nation well. The Lord was pleased with Solomon's wish, and told him that he should have great wisdom and also the riches and power he had not asked for. And so his wish came true.

Solomon was so great and had so many beautiful treasures and was so wise that other kings and queens came to see his glory and to ask him the answers to the questions that were bothering them. He married the daughter of Pharaoh, king of Egypt, and built her a house, and he built himself another house. And the Lord also allowed him to build a beautiful temple in Jerusalem for the ark, to take the place of the tabernacle.

But it is not always good for a person to have everything he wants. What did Solomon do that was wrong?

Why should he have known better?

What did the Lord tell him?

Was all the kingdom to be taken from Solomon's son? Who was to have part of it?

How was Jeroboam told what was to happen?
