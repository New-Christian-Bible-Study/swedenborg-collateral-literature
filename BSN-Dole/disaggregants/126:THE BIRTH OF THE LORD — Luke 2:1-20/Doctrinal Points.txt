=== Doctrinal Points

The New Testament is the fulfillment of the Old.

If the Lord had not come in the fullness of time mankind would have destroyed itself.

The Lord must be born in our "Judea" (hearts), grow up in our "Galilee" (outer lives), and frequently pass through our "Samaria" (thoughts).
