=== Introduction

Although the Christmas lesson follows in order here, it probably will be studied separately, making it necessary to tell the classes that you are interrupting your regular sequence just for the Christmas lesson and that you will go back to it next Sunday. Be sure that they know what the next lesson will be. Then tell them that the Lord came into the world many hundred years later than the time about which they have been studying.
