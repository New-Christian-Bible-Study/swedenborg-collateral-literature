=== From the Writings of Swedenborg

@AE 706[12]: "It is said in the seventh verse of the same chapter that this was done 'because there was no place in the inn,' an 'inn' signifying a place of instruction. Because this was the state with the Jews, who were then in mere falsities, through the adulteration of the Word, this was signified by 'there was no place in the inn'; for if it had pleased the Lord He might have been born in a most splendid palace, and have been laid in a bed adorned with precious stones; but He would thus have been with such as were in no doctrine of truth, and there would have been no heavenly representation. He is also said to have been 'wrapped in swaddling clothes,' because 'swaddling clothes' signify first truths, which are truths of innocence, and which are also truths of the Divine love."

@TCR 92: "The Lord frequently says that the Father sent Him, and that He was sent by the Father ... and this He says, because 'being sent into the world' means to descend and come among men; and this was done by means of a human which He took on through the virgin Mary. Moreover, the Human is actually the Son of God, because it was conceived from Jehovah God as its Father ... He is called 'the Son of God,' 'the Son of man,' and 'the son of Mary'; 'the Son of God' meaning Jehovah God in His Human; 'the Son of man' the Lord in respect to the Word; while 'the son of Mary' means strictly the human He took on. ... In regard to the Lord, the Divine that He had was from Jehovah the Father, and the human from the mother. These two united are the Son of God. ... That the Divine Trinity — God the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit — is in the Lord, and that the Father in Him is the Divine from which, the Son the Divine Human, and the Holy Spirit the Divine going forth, will be seen in the third chapter of this work where the Divine Trinity is treated of."
