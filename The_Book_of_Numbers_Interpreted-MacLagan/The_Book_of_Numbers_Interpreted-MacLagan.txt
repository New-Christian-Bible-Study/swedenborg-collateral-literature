PREFACE

After the publication of The Two Books of Kings Explained, in the early part of the year 1905, several 
very favourable notices of that work appeared in various periodicals; and this fact, combined with the 
expressed wishes of some ministers and friends, induced the writer to attempt and carry to a completion
a similar work on the books of Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy. And these were selected for the 
purpose, in order that the internal or spiritual sense of all the books of the Pentateuch might thus be 
before the public, and might show clearly the inner signification of all the laws of Moses.

With sincere thankfulness to the Lord, therefore, Who alone can enable any one to perceive, explain, 
and apply daily to life the hidden treasures of His Holy Word; and, at the same time, with due 
acknowledgments to those friends who have so highly appreciated the former work, the present 
volumes are now placed before the Church.

But some introductory and explanatory remarks are necessary. The general plan of this work is as 
follows: the summary of the spiritual sense of each chapter is placed first, so that the reader may have a
general idea of its contents to begin with, and may thence proceed to the study of the particulars in each
verse as given in the connected series, which immediately follows, printed in a parallel column with the
text of the Revised Version, permission for its use having been kindly granted by the authorities of the 
universities of Oxford and Cambridge, all editorial responsibility, however, resting with the author. The
advantage of this arrangement is obvious, as it affords a ready means of comparing, sentence by 
sentence, the internal sense of each verse with the text, and, besides this, adequately shows how well 
the continuity of the spiritual sense is sustained. And, indeed, this is not a slight advantage, as it is not 
always easy, when the mind is intent upon the sense of a particular part, to see that well, in connection 
with what goes before and with what follows. No doubt it is a spiritually profitable and delightful thing 
to be able to read a long portion of the Word itself and perceive the inner sense as we read, without 
much concerning ourselves with the literal sense, or appearing to notice it; but comparatively few have 
this faculty at present, and this is another reason why the aid here supplied is valuable. And in addition 
to this, the student who learns by means of this regularly written series to apprehend the connection and
continuity of the spiritual sense, may thus be aided in following the order of that sense while reading 
the text; and as he becomes more and more familiar with the correspondences, and especially as he 
comes to understand the various spiritual principles that combine to make up the complex life of man, 
will he find himself enlightened concerning spiritual laws in relation to his own progress and 
regeneration.

Now these remarks are made to show the value of a connected statement of the internal sense expressed
in ordinary language, and also to indicate the way in which any work like this may be studied with 
advantage. And lastly, on this point, if, as we know, the summaries of the internal sense written by 
Swedenborg himself, and the interesting general outlines thereof written by the Rev. John Clowes, 
M.A., and others, have been found so valuable, much more must a complete exposition be of use, if it 
is carefully expressed, in humble reliance on the Divine aid.

But before quite leaving this subject of the continuous connected series, one or two possible objections 
and difficulties connected with it may be noticed. For it may be asked why such a plan was not adopted
in the writing of the Arcana Coelestia? That a continuous series is there given is evident, but it was not 
connected, so as to appear as such. The reason for this, however, is also evident. It was because the 

3

writer had not only to give and explain the internal sense of each verse and each sentence as he 
proceeded, but it was also necessary, in his case, to give abundant demonstrations from the Word as to 
the particular correspondences occurring; and this he did by sometimes covering several pages with 
illustrations of the signification of one expression, thus providing the means for interpreting the Word 
generally as well as specifically, in Genesis and Exodus. And, in addition, his first great work is taken 
up with an account of things concerning the other life, and with expositions of doctrines and important 
spiritual principles! But the very fact that he gives general summaries shows that the full series is 
involved, and can be worked out with proper care and expressed intelligently; and it is evident that this 
might be done with any of the Prophets, or with portions of the Psalms; for the Lord has provided that 
there should be power given to do this; for it is written: "A time is about to come when there will be 
illustration" (A.C. 44023).

Again, it must be remembered that the connected series as given in ordinary language in the following 
work, although it involves, does not express, the full internal sense. Only the correspondential 
expressions of the Word itself can do both. And hence the internal sense, say, of any particular verse or 
sentence must itself be regarded as a summary. For ordinary language is not adequate to the full 
expression of Divine, celestial, and spiritual truths. But, on the other hand, care must be taken by no 
means to look upon the connected series as merely a commentary on the inner sense, and not a definite 
statement of it; for this would be a great mistake. And in order to see this, take here an illustration from 
the Arcana Coelestia: "And Abram went as Jehovah had spoken unto him, signifies that the Lord, in 
His Human, made progression to things Divine." Now is this a commentary on the internal sense? It is 
neither a commentary nor an explanation of it; but it is only a statement of what the internal sense is. 
And it is so in all the other cases where the writer makes similar statements, and afterwards explains 
them, and comments upon them. Exactly so it is, therefore, with every statement of the "contents of 
each verse," given in a regular manner throughout the chapters of this work. What is contained in the 
right-hand parallel columns all along is a continuous, or running statement of the internal sense in its 
series. And the illustration has been given in order that the reader may not confuse the explicit 
statements of what the spiritual sense of a verse is, with any explanation of them or commentary upon 
them that is afterwards given. The next division of this work consists of the references, with some notes
combined. These are to the Arcana Coelestia, with a few exceptions, which occur in cases where the 
signification of certain terms has not been found there, or where a passage from some other book has 
been thought to be especially helpful. The order of the references also requires a word of explanation. 
Very often they are given separately at the end of the sentence, which states the internal sense as 
deduced from the correspondences, as in Lev. 1:7—8; but in other cases it has been found more 
convenient to give several references together, and indeed those relating to one whole verse at the end 
of it; and then the order is, as a rule, according to the order of the terms in the verse; and examples of 
this are to be seen in Lev. 23:12-13. Again, the reader will find that the references are not all given to 
demonstrate the correspondence of a term, or to show that Swedenborg himself has given us the 
explanation of certain passages, but often the place indicated illustrates some great spiritual principles 
involved in the verse under consideration. And again, the reason why the same reference is so 
repeatedly named is, not only because this is natural and easy, but because it shows that the general 
signification of a term is universally applicable, and also that the reader who consults, and wishes to 
develop any particular verse, may have all the particular correspondences before him.

And here it will be proper to observe that, by means of the references, and through them by means of 
the literal sense of the Word, which is written entirely in correspondences, the spiritual sense as 
contained in each verse, and stated in the right-hand parallel column, is TRULY DOCTRINE FROM THE 

4

WORD, being legitimately deduced from those correspondences; and is not the private opinion of the 
writer, any more than is a statement of the established laws of the material universe, legitimately 
deduced from the facts of that universe by a man of science like Sir Isaac Newton, the private opinion 
of that man of science.

The purpose of the notes, combined with the references, is, for the most part, to explain some points 
relating to doctrine, or to illustrate the spiritual sense; but those following the references at the end of 
each chapter are intended to form a fourth division of the work, involving a review of the subjects that 
have been explained, in order to show the application of the internal sense to the uses of life, and in 
connection with man's experience in regeneration.

I have been generously assisted in the reading of the proof-sheets by the Rev. Joseph Ashby of 
Southport, and he has my hearty thanks for his very valuable help.

INTRODUCTORY NOTE

Having now completed the proofs of the internal sense of the book of Leviticus according to the law of 
correspondences as revealed by the Lord in the Arcana Coelestia; and having been greatly helped in 
the accomplishment of this work by perception from Him, according to the requirement in every case 
of difficulty, and indeed, in the interpretation of every sentence,—since it is well known that all life is 
continually from Him, with the power to perform every useful work, of whatever kind it may be,—it is 
next proposed to proceed in the same way with the book of Numbers, and as an introduction, to make 
some general remarks on the order in which the tribes of Israel are variously named in the Word, three 
distinct examples of which occur in the first two chapters. The twelve tribes signify the universal 
principles of good and truth from the Lord which make heaven and the church in man; and the various 
order in which they are named, indicates differences as to the state of man in the reception and 
application of those general and universal principles. "When the order commences from love, 
everything which follows thence, in genuine order, appears flaming: when, however, the order 
commences from faith, then everything which follows, in genuine order, appears lucid; but with every 
difference according to the things which follow. But, if not according to genuine order, everything 
appears obscure, with every difference. . . . Hence it is that the Lord gave answers by means of the 
Urim and Thummim, and that, according to the state of the case, they received answers by means of 
lights, and by the glittering thereof from the precious and transparent stones on which were inscribed 
the names of the twelve tribes, for, as has been stated, on the names were inscribed the universals of 
love and faith which are in the Lord's Kingdom, consequently the universals of flame and light 
whereby the things that belong to love and faith are represented in heaven," 3862. 

Examples are then given of the different order of the tribes in different parts of the Word, showing that 
it is according to the subject in the internal sense, and among these the order of the encampment of the 
tribes as described in Num 2. And this order is particularly stated to be heavenly order, and the "camp 
of God" is said to signify heaven in another place, 4236. 

Hence, then, we are sure that the general internal sense of this particular chapter is descriptive of 
heaven and the heavenly life; and we may be equally certain from this that the two orders in chap. 1. 
describe man's state in preparation for the heavenly life; and, in short, we may conclude that the first 
has reference to man in his state of instruction, and the second to his experiences when passing through
regeneration, and when enduring spiritual temptations. And therefore it is to be observed that the first 
and second orders commence from faith, represented by Reuben, and the third from love, represented 
by Judah. Notice, also, that Levi does not appear at all in these three orders, the reason for which will 
be found in the spiritual teaching of chap. 1:49, 50, and in chap. 2:33. Again, it appears that the first 
order is not so perfect as the second, and that the second is not so perfect as the third, and yet that there 
is a general similarity, there being four triads in each order. If, however, the first order be considered, 
the triads will appear irregular, thus:

Reuben, 
Simeon, 
Judah,

Issachar, 
Zebulun, 
Ephraim,

Manasseh, 
Benjamin, 
Dan,

Asher,
Gad,
Naphtali.

6

But in the second order we have:

Reuben, 
Simeon, 
Gad,

Judah,
Issachar,
Zebulun,

Manasseh,
Ephraim,
Benjamin,

Dan,
Asher,
Naphtali.

This order, it will be seen, is more harmonious, and agrees altogether with the third, as far as the last 
six tribes are concerned, thus:

Judah,
Issachar,
Zebulun,

Reuben, 
Simeon, 
Gad,

Ephraim,
Manasseh,
Benjamin,

Dan,
Asher, 
Naphtali.

Now what does this indicate? It is that, during regeneration, the natural degree, internally and 
externally, is brought into heavenly order, as to the outward appearance, before the spiritual and 
celestial man. The man who is passing through regeneration is not as yet so perfect internally as he 
appears externally. His outward life is orderly because, generally speaking, he is compelling himself to 
do what is orderly, but still his motives are not altogether pure, and faith is still his leading principle, 
rather than charity or love: hence Reuben and Simeon and Gad, in the second order, precede Judah and 
Issachar and Zebulun. A man, in fact, must be reformed before he can be fully regenerated; and, on this
account, the quality of his good works, represented particularly by Gad in these orders, will vary. At 
first they are merely natural, and so his name appears in the triad which denotes the external of the 
natural degree; next, they are from a principle of faith, and his name appears, therefore, under that of 
Reuben in the first triad of the second order; and lastly they are from love as well as faith, and 
consequently the name appears in the third order as the ultimate degree of the second triad. Thus the 
internal sense of these orders describes the varying states of the life of man during regeneration, and 
when it is completed; and we need only further remark that the tribe of Naphtali has its position 
constant in each order, because it signifies, first of all, simple resistance to evil, as arising from the fear 
of the consequences under the state of instruction; secondly, resistance from a principle of faith, and 
under temptations; and, lastly, as resistance to evil in the full state of freedom which properly belongs 
to the heavenly life. But he who is in good does not so much resist evil as he contemns it, because 
temptations have ceased with him, and he enjoys heavenly freedom, while yet the sphere of good itself,
in which he is from the Lord, is a full protection against the incursion of evil. For evil spirits cannot 
endure the heavenly atmosphere, but flee away from it, on which account those who are in heaven 
enjoy an eternal sabbath; nor can they any more fluctuate between good and evil.

SUMMARY OF THE SPIRITUAL SENSE

1. There is revelation from the Lord by Divine Truth, that man ought to know from the Lord, 

who ordinates and arranges all his states, what his true quality is in general and in particular, 
by means of Divine Truth and by the instrumentality of the general principles of the church, 
each grounded in its own good, vers. 1-4. 

2. These principles are described according to their quality, and their state as to spiritual and 
celestial life, and according to their specific quality in respect to intelligence in truth, the 
acquirement of the good of truth, and individual experience, vers. 5-19. 

3. Concerning the quality of those who are in faith in the understanding; faith in the will; good 

works; celestial love; mutual love; the heavenly marriage; the new understanding of truth; the 
new will of good; the medium between the spiritual and natural man; the affirmation of truth; 
inmost natural delight; and resistance to evil, temptation and freedom thence, vers. 20-43. 

4. Concerning the quality of the Spiritual Church, as to truths, in its entirety, vers. 44-46. 

5. But, lastly, man cannot as yet know his quality as to good or charity, which ministers to the 
Lord, and to celestial good in all the changes which take place during regeneration, vers. 47-
54. 

THE CONTENTS OF EACH VERSE

1. AND the LORD spoke to Moses in the
wilderness of Sinai, in the tent of 
meeting, on the first day of the 
second month, in the second year 
after they were come out of the land 
of Egypt, saying, 

1.

2. Take you the sum of all if 

2.

congregation of the children of 
Israel, by their families, by their 
fathers' houses, according to the 
number of the names, every male, by
their polls; 

There is revelation from the Lord by Divine 
Truth, or the Divine Law, to the man of the 
Spiritual Church, through the heavens, when he is
in a state of obscure good because truths are not, 
as yet, implanted in good; and this revelation 
gives the perception, in a state of faith about to be
conjoined with charity, and in a state of 
deliverance from evil by the Lord's work of 
redemption. 

That man ought to know from the Lord, who 
ordinates and arranges all his states, what his true 
quality is, not only in general but also as to 
particulars, which particular quality is discerned 
from his truths by investigation, and according to 
a certain order, 

8

3. From twenty years old and upward, 
all that are able to go forth to war in 
Israel, you and Aaron shall number 
them by their hosts. 

3.

In those who are in a state of intelligence, and in 
those who are in the good of truth and who are 
prepared to engage in conflict against evil. And 
this quality is discovered from the Word, and by 
the influx of Divine Good, according to general 
and particular associated goods and truths, 

4. And with you there shall be a man of
every tribe; every one head of his 
fathers' house. 

4. And by the instrumentality of the general 

principles of the church, each grounded in its own
good. 

5. And these are the names of the men 
that shall stand with you: of Reuben;
Elizur the son of Shedeur. 

5. And the quality of these principles, thus 

subordinated to Divine Truth and Divine Good, is 
as follows: faith in the understanding which is the 
foundation of the church and is derived from 
charity; 

6. Of Simeon; Shelumiel the son of 

6. Obedience giving interior peace with God, and 

Zurishaddai. 

founded on this protecting faith; 

7. Of Judah; Nahshon the son of 

Amminadab. 

8. Of Issachar; Nethanel the son of 

Zuar. 

7.

8.

9. Of Zebulun; Eliab the son of Helon. 

9.

Celestial love endowed with the perception of 
truth, derived from primary truth from good; 

The same externally, the good of celestial 
conjugial love, which is mutual love in the 
celestial heavens, derived from a state of 
profound humility which is the gift of God, or of 
the Divine Providence. 

The heavenly marriage, or truth conjoined with 
good and derived therefrom; 

10. Of the children of Joseph: of 
Ephraim; Elishama the son of 
Ammihud: of Manasseh; Gamaliel 
the son of Pedahzur. 

10. The inmost good of the spiritual heaven, or 

celestial spiritual good, from which springs the 
new state of truth, embodied in obedience to truth 
derived from the love of good; and the new will 
of good embodied in the love of reward as if from
self, the knowledge of the truth and separation 
from evil; and derived from the Lord through the 
work of redemption; 

11. Of Benjamin; Abidan the son of 

11. The truth of the spiritual heaven, the medium 

Gideoni. 

between the spiritual and the natural, appearing as
truth from good springing from opposition to evil;

12. Of Dan; Ahiezer the son of 

12. The truth of the natural man, which is the 

Ammishaddai. 

affirmation of truth, grounded in good which aids,
derived from Divine Truth which protects man in 
temptation; 

9

13. Of Asher; Pagiel the son of Ochran. 

13.

Inmost natural delight, appearing as opposition to 
evil by the power of Divine Truth, and derived 
from a state of spiritual trial and affliction; 

14. Of Gad; Eliasaph the son of Deuel. 

15. Of Naphtali; Ahira the son of Enan. 

14. Good works, or the good of life, the perfection of 
good and truth in act derived from the revelation 
of truth from God; 

15. And resistance to evil, temptation, and freedom 
thence, appearing as a principle of good derived 
from the Divine Word. 

16. These are they that were called of 

16. These are the general truths of the church, and 

the congregation, the princes of the 
tribes of their fathers; they were the 
heads of the thousands of Israel. 

their order with man during a state of instruction, 
having relation respectively to the celestial, 
spiritual and natural degrees of his mind. 

17. And Moses and Aaron took these 

17. And these are subordinate to Divine Truth and 

men which are expressed by name: 

Divine Good, having each a specific quality. 

18. And they assembled all the 

18. But when these truths are to be arranged under 

congregation together on the first 
day of the second month, and they 
declared their pedigrees after their 
families, by their fathers' houses, 
according to the number of the 
names, from twenty years old and 
upward, by their polls. 

19. As the LORD commanded Moses, so 
he numbered them in the wilderness 
of Sinai. 

20. And the children of Reuben, Israel's 
firstborn, their generations, by their 
families, by their fathers' houses, 
according to the number of the 
names, by their polls, every male 
from twenty years old and upward, 
all that were able to go forth to war; 

21. Those that were numbered of them, 
of the tribe of Reuben, were forty 
and six thousand and five hundred. 

good during the process of regeneration they are 
arranged according to the state as to their spiritual
and celestial life, and according to their specific 
quality in respect to intelligence in truth, the 
acquirement of the good of truth, and individual 
experience. 

19. And this can only be done by the Lord Himself 

from His Divine Love by His Divine Truth, when 
man is passing from a state of instruction in which
he is in obscure good from deficiency of truths, to
a state of regeneration in which he advances 
towards a state of good. 

20. And during regeneration faith in the 

understanding, which has priority according to 
spiritual birth, as to its spiritual and celestial life, 
and according to its specific quality, individual 
experience, intelligence in truths, the reception of 
the good of truth, and capacity for spiritual 
conflict, 

21. Has a quality according to ordination and 

arrangement, of truth confirmed by victories in 
temptation both as to understanding and will in all
fullness.

their fathers' houses, those that were

45. So all they that were numbered of 

the children of Israel by their fathers'
houses, from twenty years old and 
upward, all that were able to go forth
to war in Israel; 

45. And thus they are ordinated and arranged with the

proceeding through conflicts against

48. For the LORD spoke to Moses, 

48. For it is according to Divine Good, giving 

saying, 

perception to those who are in Divine Truths, 

49. Only the tribe of Levi you shall not 

49. That man, at first, shall not be in his true order 

number, neither shall you take the 
sum of them among the children of 
Israel: 

and arrangement as to good, and that neither can 
he know his genuine quality as to good by means 
of truths. 

50. But appoint you the Levites over the 
tabernacle of the testimony, and over
all the furniture thereof, and over all 
that belongs to it: they shall bear the 
tabernacle, and all the furniture 
thereof; and they shall minister to it, 
and shall encamp round about the 
tabernacle. 

50. While yet good shall minister to Divine Truths, as

to internals, as to exteriors, and as to externals; 
and moreover, all procedure and progress shall be 
according to good internally and externally, and 
good shall be primary as proceeding from Divine 
Truth through the heavens. 

51. And when the tabernacle sets 

51. And thus when changes of state occur in the 

forward, the Levites shall take it 
down: and when the tabernacle is to 
be pitched, the Levites shall set it up:
and the stranger that comes near 
shall be put to death. 

course of regeneration, the old state shall pass 
away, and the new state shall be inaugurated 
according to good, and by no means according to 
truths separated from good; for a state of truth 
without good is a state of spiritual death. 

52. And the children of Israel shall pitch 
their tents, every man by his own 
camp, and every man by his own 
standard, according to their hosts. 

52. For the man of the church will take up his 

position, during regeneration, according to the 
state of good in which he is as to general 
principles, and of truth as agreeing therewith; and 
this as to particulars and generals together. 

14

53. But the Levites shall pitch round 
about the tabernacle of the 
testimony, that there be no wrath 
upon the congregation of the 
children of Israel: and the Levites 
shall keep the charge of the 
tabernacle of the testimony. 

53. But love and charity shall be the central 

principles, immediately subordinate to Divine 
Truth proceeding from the Lord through the 
heavens, in order that man may not be averted 
from Him; and love and charity shall be the 
governing principles in heaven and the church, 
whose inmost is Divine Truth from the Lord 
Himself. 

54. Thus did the children of Israel; 
according to all that the LORD 
commanded Moses, so did they. 

54. And thus the man of the church is obedient to 

Divine Good manifested in Divine Truth, and is 
established in the heavenly life.

36. The children of Benjamin denote those who are in the inmost truth of the spiritual man, called 
the spiritual of the celestial, and the medium between the spiritual and the natural, 45855, 
4592; their generations, denotes during regeneration, 1145; by their families, by their fathers' 
houses, denotes as to spiritual and celestial life, 7833; according to the number of the names, 
denotes according to specific quality, 10217; from twenty years old and upward, denotes as to 
intelligence in truths and the reception of the good of truth, 2280, 10225; and all that were able
to go forth to war, denotes as to capacity for spiritual warfare, which is temptation, 1664. 

20

37. Those that were numbered of the tribe of Benjamin, being thirty and five thousand and four 

hundred, denotes quality, according to ordination and arrangement of fullness of rest and peace
for the natural man, as the result of its conjunction with the spiritual through the activity of 
ultimate spiritual life, because Benjamin denotes spiritual truth and the medium between the 
spiritual and natural, 45855, 4592; being numbered denotes ordination and arrangement, 
10217; thirty-five thousand denotes fullness of rest and peace, since thirty-five is compounded
of five and seven, 5708, 19881; and four hundred denotes the conjunction of the spiritual and 
the natural through the activity of the ultimate spiritual life, which is denoted by Benjamin, 
4341. 

38. The children of Dan denote those who are in the affirmation of truth in the natural man, 3923; 
their generations, denotes during regeneration, 1145; by their families, by their fathers' houses,
denotes as to spiritual and celestial life, 7833; according to the number of the names, denotes 
according to specific quality, 10217, 144; from twenty years old and upward, denotes as to 
intelligence in truth and the reception of the good of truth, 2280, 10225; and all that were able 
to go forth to war, denotes as to capacity for spiritual warfare, which is temptation, 1664. 

39. Those that were numbered of the tribe of Dan, being threescore and two thousand and seven 

hundred, denotes that such have a quality according to ordination and arrangement, of fullness 
of the conjunction of truth with good in the natural man, producing a state of holiness and 
peace there, because Dan denotes those who are in the affirmation of truth, 3923, being 
numbered denotes ordination and arrangement, 10217; three score and two, or sixty-two, 
thousand, denotes fullness of the conjunction of truth with good in the natural man, 53352, 
5194; and seven hundred denotes a state of holiness and peace, 716, 19881 

40. The children of Asher denote inmost natural delight, 3939; their generations, denotes during 
regeneration, 1145; by their families, by their fathers' houses, denotes as to spiritual and 
celestial life, 7833; according to the number of the names, denotes according to specific 
quality, 10217, from twenty years old and upward, denotes as to intelligence in truths and the 
reception of the good of truth, 2280, 10225; and all that were able to go forth to war, denotes 
as to capacity for spiritual warfare, which is temptation, 1664. 

41. Those that were numbered of the tribe of Asher, being forty and one thousand and five 

hundred, denotes that such have a quality, according to ordination and arrangement, of delight 
derived from a full course of spiritual temptations, a new state, and full conjunction with truths
affirmed, because Asher denotes a full state of natural delight, 3939; being numbered denotes 
ordination and arrangement, 10217; forty denotes a full course of spiritual temptations, 730; 
the one added to the forty, denotes a new state following, 2044, 8400, 92965; and five hundred
denotes a full conjunction of good with truths affirmed, 10253. 

42. The children of Naphtali denote those who are in resistance to evil, temptation, and freedom 

thence, 3928; their generations, denotes desiring regeneration, 1145; by their families, by their 
fathers' houses, denotes as to spiritual and celestial life, 7833; according to the number of the 
names, denotes according to specific quality, 10217; from twenty years old and upwards, 
denotes as to intelligence in truths, and the reception of the good of truth, 2280, 10225; and all
that were able to go forth to war, denotes as to capacity for spiritual warfare, which is 
temptation, 1664. 

21

43. Those that were numbered of the tribe of Naphtali being fifty and three thousand and four 

hundred, denotes that such have a quality, according to ordination and arrangement, of fullness
and completeness as to good conjoined with truth, and perfect freedom even in ultimates, 
because Naphtali denotes resistance to evil, temptation, and freedom thence, 3928; being 
numbered denotes ordination and arrangement, 10217; fifty-three thousand denotes fullness 
and completeness as to good conjoined with truth, 2252, 2788; and four hundred denotes 
conjunction with perfect freedom even in ultimates, 4341. 

44. These being they that were numbered, denotes that all these involve the particular truths of the
church, which are ordinated and arranged, 10217; Moses and Aaron denote Divine Truth and 
Divine Good, 7010, 9946; and the princes of Israel being twelve men, each one for his fathers' 
house, denotes man's co-operation in the process of regeneration by means of primary truths, 
each grounded in its own good, ver. 4. 

45. All they that were numbered of the children of Israel, denotes that thus truths and goods are 
ordinated and arranged with the man of the Spiritual Church, 10217, 1654; by their fathers' 
houses, denotes according to primary good, 37032, 7833; from twenty years old and upward, 
denotes commencing from an intelligent perception and reception of the truths and goods of 
faith, 2280, 10225; and all that were able to go forth to war in Israel, denotes proceeding 
through conflicts against evil, 1664. 

46. Even all they that were numbered being six hundred thousand, and three thousand and five 
hundred and fifty, denotes that, by this process, man acquires, through a full course of 
temptation, perfection of character both as to truth and as to good or as to understanding and 
will, 737, 7973, 10492, 10253, 2252. 

47. The Levites, after the tribe of their fathers, not being numbered among the children of Israel, 
denotes that, as yet, man is not permitted to know his quality as to love and charity, 3875, 
3877, 10217. 

48. The Lord speaking to Moses, saying, denotes that it is according to Divine Good, giving 

perception to those who are in Divine Truths, 2001, 2951, 7010, 1791, 1822. 

49. The tribe of Levi not being numbered, nor their sum taken among the children of Israel, 

denotes that man, at first, shall not be in his true order and arrangement as to good, and that 
neither can he know his genuine quality as to good, by means of truths, 3875, 3877, 10217, 
683. 

50. Appointing the Levites over the tabernacle of the testimony, and over all the furniture thereof, 
and over all that belongs to it, denotes that good shall minister to Divine Truths, as to internals,
as to interiors, and as to externals, 3875, 3877, 9613, 9503; the Levites bearing the tabernacle 
and all the furniture thereof, denotes that all procedure and progress shall be according to good
internally and externally, because motion from place to place signifies change of state. 1457, 
the Levites signify good, or love, 3875, and since the tabernacle denotes good which is 
internal, its furniture denotes truths which are external, 2576; and ministering to the 
tabernacle, and encamping round about it, denotes that good shall be primary as proceeding 
from the Lord by the Word through the heavens, because the tabernacle denotes the heavens, 
3210; ministering is predicated of good, 10083; and the Levites encamping in the first place 
round the tabernacle denotes what is primary, and also orderly arrangement, 4236. 

22

51. When the tabernacle sets forward, the Levites taking it down, and when it is pitched, the 

Levites setting it up, denotes that when changes of state occur in the course of regeneration, 
the old states shall pass away, and the new state shall be inaugurated according to good, 1457, 
3875, 153; and the stranger coming near being put to death, denotes "by no means according 
to truth separated from good, for a state of truth without good is a state of spiritual death," 
7996, 5883, 2687. 

52. The children of Israel pitching their tents, every man by his own camp, and every man by his 
own standard, according to their hosts, denotes that the man of the church will take up his 
position, during regeneration, according to the state of good in which he is as in general 
principles, and of truth as agreeing therewith; and this as to particulars and generals together, 
3654, 1616, 4236, 8624, 7236. 

53. The Levites pitching round about the tabernacle of the testimony, denotes that love and charity
shall be the central principles immediately subordinate to Divine Truth proceeding from the 
Lord through the heavens, 3875, 1616, 9613, 9503; that there be no wrath upon the 
congregation of the children of Israel, denotes in order that man may not be averted from Him,
5798, 6338, 3654; and the Levites keeping the charge of the tabernacle of the testimony, 
denotes that love and charity shall be the governing principles in heaven and the church whose
inmost is Divine Truth from the Lord Himself, 3875, 3382, 9613, 9503. 

54. "Thus did the children of Israel; according to all that the Lord commanded Moses, so did 

they," denotes that thus the man of the church is obedient to Divine Good manifested in Divine
Truth, and is established in the heavenly life, 3654, 2001, 5486, 7010. 

DISCUSSION

It is not the province of this work to provide an elaborate reply to the merely rationalistic views on the 
Word, or to the arguments of the Higher Criticism, as to the character and origin of its various parts; but
as our subject is the development of the spiritual teaching thereof, we adhere, as a rule, to that. We 
cannot refrain, however, from pointing out and emphasizing the integrity of the literal sense. For if the 
literal sense has not been preserved since it was written, as to all its particulars, then it follows that it 
will not be a proper vehicle for the conveyance of the spiritual sense; and, moreover, if it is not, 
generally speaking, true history, then we have no authentic history of the states of the ancient churches, 
of the lives of the patriarchs, of the Israelites and their worship, of the Lord Himself in human life, or 
of the first establishment of the Christian Church, with the promise of its revival in the consummation 
of the age. It is as important, therefore, to recognize and acknowledge that, on the one hand, the Word 
in its literal sense is true history, and the work of the Lord, as it is, on the other, to understand and apply
to life the spiritual sense, 1408, SS 13. And this first chapter in the book of Numbers, considered in its 
connection with the last chapter of the book of Leviticus, supplies us with another example of the 
continuity of the Word, because both have reference to the same subject internally, if not quite to the 
same subject externally. Now this is evidently not the effect of an accident, but is really owing to the 
continuation of the series in the internal sense. For the literal sense is the result of the internal sense, 
and thence corresponds to it. The estimation, therefore, in Leviticus and the numbering in Numbers, 
refer respectively to internal and external things. The former is a valuation as to capacity for 
worshiping the Lord, and the latter as to capacity for engaging in the conflict of temptation.

23

Now, one of the most profound, comprehensive, and practical of the doctrines of the Word and the 
teachings of the Writings of the church is that man is created and regenerated into the image and 
likeness of the Lord; and that on this account heaven, taken all together, resembles one Grand Man; that
every society in heaven is a man in a less form; and that every angel is a man in the least form; from all
which it follows that all men are created, and each man is created, with a capacity for heaven, while at 
the same time no one is created or born, distinctly, for heaven or for hell, but the final condition of each
must be the result of his own free choice, all this being involved in the idea of a human being. And 
from this we may see how the twelve sons of Jacob, and thence the twelve tribes of Israel, may 
represent all human beings, while, also, each human being, or each angel, may be a miniature heaven, 
and yet have a specific quality or ruling love of his own, just as no single son or tribe represented and 
signified exactly the same general principle. And when we come to see, also, that no two human beings
can be exactly alike to eternity, because of the infinity of the Creator, and because no one born can 
possibly have the same hereditary basis as another, we also see why, in the Word, the signification of 
each tribe is not always exactly the same. For the Word is infinite as well as the Lord, and, therefore, 
the infinite meaning of each tribe cannot be denied. And thus, to take one or two examples, the faith in 
the understanding, denoted by Reuben, or the resistance to evil denoted by Naphtali, cannot be exactly 
the same in two persons; and yet the correspondence is exact and true and good. And this should 
convince each of us of his own importance in the best sense, and induce each of us above all things to 
be himself from the Lord by earnest, constant, and patient endeavour.

Next, we want a comprehensive and practical view of the series of things so often unavoidably 
repeated, and yet in each case expressing a different quality, according to the tribe in connection with 
which it is used.

Natural generations represent spiritual regenerations, or the new birth (John 3:5). To attain to heaven 
we must be born again, or from above; that is, from the Lord or by the Spirit, and through our own co-
operation, by means of the truths of the Word, which are like the water that cleanses, and also quenches
the thirst. Do not let any one imagine, then, that either the Spirit will do without the water, or the water 
without the Spirit. For there must be both. Hence, then, the things that we all require are the constant 
acknowledgement of the Lord, and the constant practice of the truth, even, as it were, by our own effort
(Matt 7:21).

But there are, in heaven, families and houses, that is, general and particular states of good. And we 
cannot separate these, although they are to be distinguished. We must belong, for example, to some 
heavenly society, and, also, we must have our own specific use or function in it. How relatively 
imperfect are the associations of this world; and how often does it happen that a person has a business 
in which he is engaged many years, or throughout life, which is quite uncongenial. But it is not so in 
regeneration, nor will it be so in heaven. Can we imagine anything so delightful as right associations, 
and the perfect suitability of the function to the person, and of the person to the function? Now this 
makes us understand how heaven is what it is from state, and not from place. And therefore the Lord 
leads the regenerating man, by a way that he knows not, into this true liberty of the children of God, 
even through the adverse circumstances in which, nevertheless, he is faithful and obedient.

Again, by their polls, every male, must join the army of the Lord. This means that a man must do so, as
to his own particular understanding of truth, and as to his own life thence derived, because the new life 
is formed by truths, into which good is insinuated by the Lord; for the life which a man has by natural 
birth cannot be regenerated, and vitiates the truths first received into the memory and understanding. 
The reason is, because it is the selfish life. And hence it is said, "by their polls," every male, evidently 

24

involving good conjoined with truth, by the removal of evil internally, since faith in the best sense 
implies this, 30, and the polling, or counting by heads, involves the influence of good in the selection 
and arrangement of truths, 10217, 3728. The practical teaching here involved, therefore, is that each 
ought carefully to cultivate his own capacity for good.

But, further, the male must be from twenty years old and upward, rind this, as we have already seen, 
denotes a state of intelligence as lo truths; and he must be able to go forth to war, or, spiritually, to 
engage successfully in temptations. What a very extensive and active life do these two requirements 
include! He is not intelligent as to truths, who is simply a great man of science, or a natural 
philosopher, or even a great theologian. Very few indeed, comparatively, can be such. But every one is 
intelligent in truths, if he only knows a few, and at the same time knows how to use them from the best 
and highest motives. And hence it is said of the king that should one day reign over the Israelites, "He 
shall not multiply horses to himself," because the horse denotes intelligence, and multiplying horses 
signifies intelligence that is active from selfish motives, or for the sake of worldly glory. And then, 
again, consider what is implied in spiritual conflicts of the right kind. A man who has a strong natural 
tendency to be passionate, has been known suddenly to restrain, and apparently to overcome that 
tendency from a strong selfish desire not to offend a person in whose presence he was; and thus to 
overcome the temptation, as we might say; but this was not properly a spiritual temptation, which 
requires that the person tempted should resist evil, because to do evil is to sin against the Lord; because
he loves the truth; or because he desires to be good.

With regard to the signification and order of the tribes, we do not need to say more than is contained in 
the introductory note; but it is necessary to consider the numbering of each tribe. Spiritually to number 
is to perceive the quality of things; and, of course, the power to do this is from the Lord. And it is 
interesting to observe, in this chapter, that the numbers of each of the tribes do describe its quality in 
harmony with the signification of the tribe. And this is easily ascertained by going through the series of 
the internal sense of each verse and making the comparison, at the same time noting that the 
correspondence of each number is according to the signification of the fundamental numbers in each 
case, as the references show. And this holds good not only as to each tribe, but also as to all the tribes 
taken together in ver. 46. 

The great lesson, therefore, that we may all learn from the study of this subject, is that names and 
numbers are particularly applied and accepted, in the Word throughout, to the requirement of the 
internal sense; and yet that, by Divine Providence, they are harmonious also in the literal sense, since 
the sum of all the numbers in each tribe is exactly equal to the total number for all the tribes together. 
Now some people, while admitting a general providence, are not disposed to think that there is a 
particular providence in regard to all things, although we are assured that the very hairs of our head are 
numbered, in order to impress this upon us. But the government of the Infinite Lord is not like that of 
an earthly sovereign, who rules by means of subordinate officials; for this is contrary to a just and 
intelligent idea of the Infinite. The Lord, therefore, rules in particulars as the Infinite and not as the 
finite, at the same time that there is also an orderly subordination on account of Divine Providence 
being general as well as particular. And hence we arrive at the truth that the Lord's operation is as much
in particular things, as in general things, and that He cares for each individual as much as for the whole 
community. And, undoubtedly, the more we realize this particular providence of the Lord, the more we 
shall feel content in Him. But if we indulge the notion that, so to speak, He is too busy in governing 
generally to watch over ourselves and provide for us, it follows that we must fall into doubts and 
anxieties. We have only to look back over our own lives, however, in order to discover that unless we 
had been particularly taken care of, we should certainly have been ruined by our own waywardness and

25

folly. And this is felt even by the angels, 868. We cannot think, therefore, that any human being either 
in heaven or in hell is not constantly protected by the infinite mercy and lovingkindness of the Lord in 
a most particular manner. And all this happens without interfering in the slightest degree with the 
proper exercise, by every one, of his own life.

But now, there is one more point which has not been considered. It is that the tribe of Levi was not 
permitted to be numbered along with the other tribes, but, as we shall see, afterwards distinctly by 
itself. What, then, does this indicate spiritually? It is that, during regeneration, no one can know fully 
what his true spiritual position is. That is, no one can discern his own particular good, except very 
obscurely, in this life. For it is good, or charity, or love, which is specifically denoted by the tribe of 
Levi. But this want of perception, which is sure to cease in the end, need not discourage us. It arises 
from our imperfect preparatory states; and every one knows that, in his early life, he had not any idea, 
even of his natural capacities, such as he knows them to be later on in life. In due time, therefore, we 
shall reap the reward of all our earnest labours to attain to the higher life, if we faint not.

Numbers Chapter 2

SUMMARY OF THE SPIRITUAL SENSE

1. Revelation is made that each individual of the Spiritual Church has his specific position in his 

own heaven according to the general principles thereof, vers. 1-2. 

2. There are four general principles, namely, celestial love, ver. 3; faith from charity, ver. 10; the 
same in the natural degree, ver. 18; and the affirmation of truth in the natural degree, ver. 25. 

3. Their principles of action are as follows: Truth immediately proceeding from good; faith from 
charity which is the foundation of the church; obedience to truth from the love of good; and 
truth which aids, derived from Divine Truth which protects man in temptations, vers. 3, 10, 18,
25. 

4. All changes of state with the angels and with the man of the church are effected from the 

central principle of love, ver. 17. 

5. The general quality, according to ordination and arrangement by the Lord, of those in the four 
leading divisions is described, as well as the quality of each division subordinate to these, and 
the quality of the whole heaven or of the whole church taken together, vers. 4-32. 

6. But good itself, apart from truth, cannot be known as to its quality, ver. 33. 

7. And thus the angels are always obedient to Divine Truth, or to the laws of Divine Order; and 
they become more and more perfected according to the ordination and arrangement of truths 
as depending on the state of good, ver. 34. 

THE CONTENTS OF EACH VERSE

1. And the LORD spoke to Moses and to

1. And there is revelation from the Lord by Divine 

Aaron, saying, 

Truth and Divine Good giving further perception, 

2. The children of Israel shall pitch 

2. That each individual of the Spiritual Church has 

every man by his own standard, with
the ensigns of their fathers' houses: 
over against the tent of meeting shall
they pitch round about. 

his specific position in his own heaven, according 
to the general principle thereof, and according to 
the truth as derived from its corresponding good, 
subordinate to essential Divine principles which 
are immediately from the Lord and make heaven. 

3. And those that pitch on the east side 
toward the sunrising shall be they of 
the standard of the camp of Judah, 
according to their hosts: and the 
prince of the children of Judah shall 
be Nahshon the son of Amminadab. 

3. Those who are in celestial love which is love to 

the Lord, and in the truths immediately proceeding
from that love, have their positions in the inmost 
heaven in orderly arrangement; and the primary 
principle from which they act, is truth, 
immediately proceeding from good. 

27

4. And his host, and those that were 

4. And their universal quality, according to 

numbered of them, were threescore 
and fourteen thousand and six 
hundred. 

ordination and arrangement, is a state of rest and 
peace, arising from the conjunction of good and 
truth through victory in temptation. 

5. And those that pitch next to him 

shall be the tribe of Issachar: and the 
prince of the children of Issachar 
shall be Nethanel the son of Zuar: 

6. And his host, and those that were 
numbered thereof, were fifty and 
four thousand and four hundred: 

7. And the tribe of Zebulun: and the 
prince of the children of Zebulun 
shall be Eliab the son of Helon: 

8. And his host, and those that were 
numbered thereof, were fifty and 
seven thousand and four hundred. 

9. All that were numbered of the camp 
of Judah were an hundred thousand 
and fourscore thousand and six 
thousand and four hundred, 
according to their hosts. They shall 
set forth first. 

5. Those who are in mutual love, which is celestial 
conjugial love, have their position in the middle 
degree of the third heaven; and the general 
principle from which they act is the good of 
inmost truth derived from inmost love which is a 
state of profound humility. 

6. And their universal quality, according to 

ordination and arrangement, is full conjunction as 
to good and truth resulting from a state of celestial 
love and peace internally. 

7. Those who are in the heavenly marriage, which is 
the conjunction of goodness and truth, have their 
position in the ultimate degree of the third heaven; 
are also the medium of conjunction between the 
third heaven and the middle heaven; and the 
general principle from which they act is truth 
conjoined with good and proceeding from it. 

8. And their universal quality, according to 

ordination and arrangement, is fullness of 
conjunction as to good and truth in the celestial 
heaven involving the same between the celestial 
and spiritual heavens with a state of rest and peace 
in the spiritual and natural degrees as well as in the
celestial. 

9. And the quality of the third heaven from celestial 
love is perfection of good and truth in conjunction,
acquired through a full course of spiritual combat 
and victory in orderly arrangement, celestial love 
really ruling both in the course of regeneration, 
and in the progressions of life in heaven to 
eternity. 

10. On the south side shall be the 

10. Those who are in faith from charity and conjoined 

standard of the camp of Reuben 
according to their hosts: and the 
prince of the children of Reuben 
shall be Elizur the son of Shedeur. 

therewith, have their position in the middle 
heaven, in orderly arrangement; and the general 
principle from which they act, is faith from charity
which is the foundation of the Church. 

28

11. And his host, and those that were 

11. And their universal quality, according to 

numbered thereof, were forty and six
thousand and five hundred. 

12. And those that pitch next to him 

shall be the tribe of Simeon: and the 
prince of the children of Simeon 
shall be Shelumiel the son of 
Zurishaddai: 

ordination and arrangement, is truth confirmed by 
victory in temptation both as to understanding and 
will in all fullness. 

12. And those who are in the principle of obedience 
from the good of truth, have their position in the 
middle degree of the middle heaven; and the 
general principle from which they act is obedience 
giving peace with God, and founded on the power 
of faith from charity. 

13. And his host, and those that were 
numbered of them, were fifty and 
nine thousand and three hundred: 

13. And their universal quality, according to 
ordination and arrangement, is incipient 
conjunction and completeness as to truths. 

14. And the tribe of Gad: and the prince 
of the children of Gad shall be 
Eliasaph the son of Reuel: 

15. And his host, and those that were 
numbered of them, were forty and 
five thousand and six hundred and 
fifty. 

16. All that were numbered of the camp 
of Reuben were an hundred thousand
and fifty and one thousand and four 
hundred and fifty, according to their 
hosts. And they shall set forth 
second. 

17. Then the tent of meeting shall set 
forward, with the camp of the 
Levites in the midst of the camps: as 
they encamp, so shall they set 
forward, every man in his place, by 
their standards. 

14. Those who are in good works, not from simple 

obedience as in a state of instruction, nor from a 
principle of faith as in the course of regeneration, 
but from the conjunction of faith and charity, have 
their position in the ultimate degree of the second 
or middle heaven; and the general principle from 
which they act is the perfection of good and truth 
in conjunction derived from Divine knowledge 
now seen from a state of charity. 

15. And their universal quality, according to 

ordination and arrangement, is fullness of the 
conjunction of good and truth through temptations.

16. And the quality of the second or middle heaven 

from faith conjoined with charity, is fullness as to 
these in that conjunction, as distinguished from the
fullness of celestial love in the inmost heaven. 

17. But all changes of state with the man of the church

and with the angels, are effected from the central 
principle of love which is immediately from the 
Lord, while yet progress as to individual life is at 
once in freedom and in harmony with general 
truths. 

29

18. On the west side shall be the 

standard of the camp of Ephraim 
according to their hosts: and the 
prince of the children of Ephraim 
shall be Elishama the son of 
Ammihud. 

19. And his host, and those that were 
numbered of them, were forty 
thousand and five hundred. 

20. And next to him shall be the tribe of 
Manasseh: and the prince of the

inmost of the natural man, have their position in 
the obscure good of the ultimate heaven, which is 
celestial-natural in orderly arrangement; and the 
general principle from which they act is obedience 
to truth from the love of good.

numbered of them, were thirty and 
five thousand and four hundred.

standard of the camp of Dan 
according to their hosts: and the 
prince of the children of Dan shall be
Ahiezer the son of Ammishaddai. 

25. Those who are in the affirmation of truth, in the 

natural man, have their position in the obscure 
truth of the ultimate heaven, which is spiritual-

of the children of Israel by their 
fathers' houses: all that were 
numbered of the camps according to 
their hosts were six hundred 
thousand and three thousand and five
hundred and fifty. 

32. Thus the combined quality of the Spiritual Church 

in the heavens, as to ordination and arrangement 
from celestial love, including that love as 
operating in every degree and on every plane, is 
the totality of good acquired through a full course 
of spiritual temptations and completeness and 
fullness as to truths conjoined with that good. 

33. But the Levites were not numbered 
among the children of Israel; as the 
LORD commanded Moses. 

33. But good itself, apart from truth, cannot be known 
as to its quality, this being according to Divine 
Truth from Divine Good. 

34. Thus did the children of Israel: 
according to all that the LORD 
commanded Moses, so they pitched 
by their standards, and so they set 
forward, every one by their families, 
according to their fathers' houses. 

34. And the man of the Spiritual Church in the 

heavens is always obedient to Divine Good as 
manifested by Divine Truth, the orderly 
arrangement of the heavens being perfect in all 
respects; and progress in life being more and more 
perfect according to the arrangement of truths as 
depending on the state of good.

in orderly arrangement, celestial love really ruling both in the course of regeneration, and in 
the progressions of life in heaven to eternity; because Judah denotes celestial love, 3880; a

that the general principle from which they act is the perfection of good and truth in 
conjunction derived from revelation, or from Divine knowledge, now seen from a state of 
charity, chap 1:14; and the reason why Simeon and Gad, denote, respectively, those who are in

that the general principle from which they act is truth from good springing from opposition to 
evil, chap 1:11; and the reason why Manasseh and Benjamin denote, respectively, those who

according to their fathers' houses, denotes according to the arrangement of truths as depending
on their state of good, 7833, 9807. 

DISCUSSION

In commencing our reflections on this chapter, we have to go back to the last and consider the names of
the persons who were the captains of the army of each of the four camps, and the names of their 
fathers, because they are repeated here. It is well known that the name of a person or thing, denotes its 
quality; that a father denotes good, and his son truth thence derived; but the thing to be particularly 
noticed is the spiritual signification of the names derived from the correspondence of their meanings. 
For the correspondence cannot be with a mere name, but must depend upon its meaning. Hut this 
correspondence, whenever it occurs in the Word, must necessarily agree with the series of the things 
spoken of, and therefore, we find that this is the case with the names in the subject before us; and thus 
we have another remarkable example and an illustration of the operation of Divine Providence in the 
composition of the Word and also in the affairs of the Israelites. For these people were, generally 
speaking, quite at liberty in choosing the names of their children, and also in choosing their captains, 
except in some particular instances mentioned in the Word, as here; and yet it must have been 
providential that the name chosen, and the captain chosen in each case, was the right one for giving the 
correspondence required.

Let us now consider the four camps, namely, Judah, Reuben, Ephraim, and Dan. And here it is to be 
observed that the general correspondence of three things has to be in harmony, these being the position,
the name of the camp, and the name of the leader. And as the position, or quarter, comes first, it 

37

determines the specific quality of the- other two. Now, the east, as we have seen, signifies this, the 
Lord, celestial love from Him and thence the inmost or third heaven. It is this love therefore that 
determines the position of every one in heaven, to whichever kingdom, and to whatever heaven he may
belong. It is love from the Lord, and thence to th Lord, that makes heaven. And if, therefore, we know 
what the Lord's love is, then, and then only, shall we know what heaven is in general and in particular. 
It is no slight matter properly to be able to distinguish between good and evil. In general, many things 
may be considered good which are really evil, and the reverse. But coming to the universal thing, and 
thus to the universal love, which is the Lord, and is from Him, we can thus grasp the character of true 
love, or real goodness. The Lord's love is the love of communicating life, joy, happiness and peace; and
in His pure love there is no shadow of selfishness. The Lord is good to every one and His tender 
mercies are over all His works. And this being so, it follows that such ought to be the love of man, who 
by creation is an image and likeness of the Lord, and should become so by regeneration. But man 
cannot communicate life, except mediately, and thus he can only communicate joy, happiness, peace 
mediately. And yet if he desires and determines to do this, from the Lord, then he will, in some 
measure, realize what the love of the Lord, and love to the Lord, is. And also, then he will realize that 
the opposite of this love, namely, selfishness, is what constitutes evil, and that it is entirely from man, 
by the abuse of the Lord's life or love that flows continually into him. From the Lord's love then, we 
know the difference between good and evil, and we know also that we ourselves are the origin of evil. 
But because we are human beings and are free, we are not obliged to be evil; and we may be good, like 
the Lord, each in his own degree, and upon his own plane if we choose. And hence now we see why the
east, or why love, comes first.

But, secondly, this is the camp of Judah, who had his name from concession. And celestial angels of the
third heaven are they who, in the highest and best sense, acknowledge that they have no love but the 
Lord's love, and that, of themselves, they are nothing but evil. But remember, we can all do this in our 
measure, because the Lord enters into us all, immediately from Himself, and mediately through the 
heavens, and never forsakes us.

And, thirdly, we must also remember that love never fights, although it is, as we shall see, the centre of 
the camps. And on this account it is, that there must be a captain of the camp of Judah, whose name, we
have discovered, means, spiritually, the capacity to perceive the truth in the light of truth proceeding 
immediately from good. But even this high state is imaged in the lower heavens, and in the church 
generally; for the Lord says, "If any man wills to do His will, he shall know of the teaching" (John 
7:17). And yet Samson, who represents the celestial man, was remarkable as a fighter, slaying a 
thousand men with the jawbone of an ass. The lesson is, that truth from love, operating in a lower 
sphere, overcomes all evil and falsity by the genuine literal sense of the Word; and therefore we 
observe, too, the peculiar meaning of Nahshon as a serpent in this connection, chap 1:7. The fact is that
truth proceeding from love on a lower plane resists evil, very powerfully, evil from its very nature 
being averted from it, or repelled without conflict, and therefore the heavens are, all of them, secure 
against the incursions of evil spirits (Matt 10:16).

The second camp was on the south, and denotes the spiritual heaven and church, because, as the east 
signifies the highest state of love, so the south, where the sun is in the meridian, signifies the greatest 
state of light thence derived in the next lower degree, which is faith grounded in charity. And thus the 
spiritual heaven is derived from the celestial, and, generally, our state as to the knowledge and love of 
truth is derived from our state as to love and charity. Hence, then, it was the camp of Reuben, who was 
named from seeing, that was on the south; while the leader Elizur the son of Shedeur had a name which
signifies faith, which is the foundation of the Church, and is derived from charity, chap 1:5. Our 

38

practical lesson, therefore, in this connection is, that the truth by means of which we overcome evil is 
from the Lord by means of the Word. For no amount of natural light only, or of natural intelligence, 
will enable us to see spiritually, or to discern our spiritual enemies in ourselves, which are to be 
overcome. The foundation of our faith must be on the Rock: "You are Peter, and upon this rock I will 
build my church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it" (Matt 16:18).

The third camp was on the west; and from the references we learn that the west denotes a state of good 
in obscurity, that quarter being where the sun sets. And thus the camp of Ephraim was there, because he
was the son of Joseph born in Egypt, and therefore he denotes those who are in intelligence from 
affection in the inmost of the natural man which, compared with the state of the spiritual man, is 
relatively obscure, and thus he signifies the intelligence derived from the good of those in the ultimate 
heaven. And if we consider the name of the leader of this camp, we find that its signification is 
harmonious with that of the quarter and the camp. For Elishama the son of Ammihud, means God 
hearing, and people of praise, and therefore he signifies obedience to Truth from the love of good, 
while Ephraim means fruitfulness, and thus denotes the same, chap 1:10. And indeed, obedience may 
be called the peculiar good of the ultimate heaven and the natural man, just as charity, and love to the 
Lord are the peculiar goods of the spiritual and celestial heavens, and of the spiritual and celestial man 
respectively. Hence, then, we learn that simple obedience to the commandments of the Lord in the 
Word, from a principle of religion, without the strong affection for truth which distinguishes the 
spiritual, or the ardent love of good which distinguishes the celestial man, secures admission into 
heaven, and gives conjunction with the Lord because it involves those higher loves, and is their 
expression.

And, lastly, now, the fourth camp was on the north, and denotes, as we have learned, the obscure truth 
of the ultimate heaven and of the natural man. But this was the camp of Dan, and Dan was named from 
judging, and denotes the affirmation of truth, while the leader's name, Ahiezer the son of Ammishaddai,
means the brother who aids, and the people of the Almighty, and thus spiritually, good which aids 
derived from Divine Truth which protects man in temptations, chap 1:12; and this is perfectly 
harmonious with the name of the quarter, and the name of the camp. But it may be thought, what is 
meant by the affirmation of truth, which according to the reference, is the first thing of the church with 
him who is to be regenerated? It means that truth in general, wherever and whatever it is, ought to be 
obeyed, because it is the universal law of both the natural and spiritual worlds from the Divine Being. It
must surely be quite clear to every one that unless this affirmation is made in the first place, and that 
unless the Divine Being is thus acknowledged, a man will not feel himself under any obligation to obey
the truth; for he cannot feel himself responsible to a mere law, although he may be sensible that to 
violate it brings pain and discomfort. But when he feels and acknowledges that all the laws of order in 
the universe are from the Divine Being, then he affirms the truth and begins to obey it from religion, 
and not only because disobedience is painful, or obedience is advantageous.

And this consideration shows us now, that these four camps according to the order in which they are 
named describe all the heavens from the highest to the lowest, and thus also all the principles which 
form the human mind into a heaven by beginning at the lowest step of the ladder of progress, and then 
advancing to the highest. For every one may embody all these principles in his life, since each human 
being may become a heaven in the least form, according to his degree, as an angel in any of the four. 
And we see from this study, moreover, how each sentence in the Word is truly correspondential; 
wonderfully harmonious, and in a perfect series. And hence, we can see, therefore, the importance, 
spiritually, of what is said about the tent of meeting setting forward, with the camp of the Levites in the 
midst of the camps. For, in the highest sense, Levi denotes the Lord, and the pure love proceeding from

39

Him; and it is this love that gives conjunction with Him, this conjunction being signified by the name 
Levi, which means cleaving or adhering. 

But, finally, only a few words are necessary in regard to the numbering of the camps. For a careful 
consideration of the correspondence of the numbers, as given in their proper places, shows that the 
quality of each heaven is correctly described thereby, according to the genius of those who constitute it,
and according to the conjunction of one heaven with another. And the whole of this interesting account 
clearly shows, how perfectly the unity and the variety of the heavens is maintained, and also that the 
perfection of each heavenly society, and of every individual therein is constantly intensified and 
increased to eternity through the most perfect combination and adjustment of general and particular 
uses. Let each of us, therefore, while in our preparatory states on earth, be stimulated by our reading of 
the Word in its higher senses, to a more earnest co-operation with the Lord in the work of our eternal 
salvation.

THE CONTENTS OF EACH VERSE

1. Now these are the generations of 

1. The following are the derivations of Divine Good 

Aaron and Moses in the day that the 
LORD spoke with Moses in mount 
Sinai. 

2. And these are the names of the sons 

of Aaron; Nadab the firstborn, and 
Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar. 

and Divine Truth when revelation is made to the 
church which is capable of receiving instruction: 

2. From Divine Good proceeds celestial good in the 
inmost heaven; spiritual truth and good in the 
middle heaven; and natural truth and good in the 
ultimate heaven. 

41

3. These are the names of the sons of 
Aaron, the priests which were 
anointed, whom he consecrated to 
minister in the priest's office. 

3. And each of these has its specific quality as 

manifested in truths from good, and united with 
good, and devoted to the ministry of good in the 
worship of the Lord. 

4. And Nadab and Abihu died before 

the LORD, when they offered strange 
fire before the LORD, in the 
wilderness of Sinai, and they had no 
children: and Eleazar and Ithamar 
ministered in the priest's office in the
presence of Aaron their father. 

4. But when spiritual truth and good are profaned by 
the man of the church, spiritual death is the 
consequence; and this occurs in the obscurity of 
good from the lack of truths, so that spiritual truth 
and good are not productive; yet still the church is 
amended, on the natural plane, by the ministry of 
natural truth and good, which are from the Lord 
through the celestial heaven. 

5. And the LORD spoke to Moses, 

5. And there is revelation from the Lord to the man 

saying, 

of the church, by Divine Truth giving the 
perception, 

6. Bring the tribe of Levi near, and set 

them before Aaron the priest, that 
they may minister to him. 

6. That charity must be acknowledged as the living 
principle of the church from celestial good, and 
that truths from good must minister thereto. 

7. And they shall keep his charge, and 
the charge of the whole congregation
before the tent of meeting, to do the 
service of the tabernacle. 

7. Also that the inmost worship of the Lord from 
celestial good; the interior worship of the Lord 
from spiritual good; and all the externals of 
worship shall be from charity and truth united; 

8. And they shall keep all the furniture 
of the tent of meeting, and the charge
of the children of Israel, to do the 
service of the tabernacle. 

8. For all the externals of worship and all its 

internals, with the man of the church must make 
one and be conjoined in the outward act. 

9. And you shall give the Levites to 
Aaron and to his sons: they are 
wholly given to him on the behalf of 
the children of Israel. 

9. And charity must be acknowledged as proceeding 
from celestial good and truth, and this not only in 
general, but as to every particular with the man of 
the Spiritual Church. 

10. And them shall appoint Aaron and 
his sons, and they shall keep their 
priesthood: and the stranger that 
comes near shall be put to death. 

10. But celestial good and truth alone are essentials of 
worship; and there can be no genuine worship 
from selfish love and worldly love; for the 
profanation of good and truth by these is spiritual 
death. 

11. And the LORD spoke to Moses, 

11. And there is further revelation from the Lord by 

saying, 

Divine Truth giving the perception, 

42

12. And I, behold, I have taken the 

Levites from among the children of 
Israel instead of all the firstborn that 
opens the womb among the children 
of Israel; and the Levites shall be 
mine: 

13. For all the firstborn are mine; on the 

day that I smote all the firstborn in 
the land of Egypt I hallowed to me 
all the firstborn in Israel, both man 
and beast: mine they shall be; I am 
the LORD. 

12. That the Lord alone is the origin of charity with 
the man of the church, and that this charity is 
primary with him in reality, although faith appears 
to be so in the order of regeneration; 

13. Because faith proceeds from the Lord through 
charity, when, by the work of redemption faith 
without charity is exterminated; then faith 
conjoined therewith is sanctified with the man of 
the church both as to Internals and Externals, all 
good being from the Lord; and the Lord alone 
being good itself. 

14. And the LORD spoke to Moses in the 

14. Again there is revelation from the Lord by Divine 

wilderness of Sinai, saying, 

Truth, with man, when he is in states of obscure 
good from lack of truths, and this gives the 
perception, 

15. Number the children of Levi by their
fathers' houses, by their families: 
every male from a month old and 
upward shall you number them. 

15. That truths from the good of charity are ordinated 
and arranged by the Lord, according to man's co-
operation in the order of celestial and spiritual 
good, and this, too, as to every truth of faith in its 
commencement and in its progress. 

16. And Moses numbered them 

according to the word of the LORD, 
as he was commanded. 

16. And this ordination and arrangement is by Divine 
Truth from Divine Good through the influx of 
good into truths. 

17. And these were the sons of Levi by 
their names; Gershon, and Kohath, 
and Merari. 

17. And the quality of truths from the good of charity 
is threefold, namely, those from the good of 
charity in obscurity; those from that good in 
brightness; and those from the faith of charity in 
obscurity, 

18. And these are the names of the sons 
of Gershon by their families; Libni 
and Shimei. 

18. The quality of truths from good in obscurity being,
according to general principles, such as appertain 
to the understanding and to the life; 

19. And the sons of Kohath by their 

19. The quality of truths from good in brightness, 

families; Amram, and Izhar, Hebron,
and Uzziel. 

according to general principles, being such as have
relation to inmost good, interior good, exterior 
good, and external good; 

20. And the sons of Merari by their 

20. And the quality of truths from the good of faith in 

families; Mahli and Mushi. These 
are the families of the Levites 
according to their fathers' houses. 

obscurity being such as are internal and external 
respectively. These are the derivations of charity 
according to its various general forms of good. 

43

21. Of Gershon was the family of the 
Libnites, and the family of the 
Shimeites: these are the families of 
the Gershonites. 

21. For from the good of charity in obscurity are 
derived the general goods arising from the 
reception of truth in the understanding and truth in 
the life. And those who are in the general goods 
are relatively in greater obscurity. 

22. Those that were numbered of them, 

22. And the quality of these according to ordination 

according to the number of all the 
males, from a month old and 
upward, even those that were 
numbered of them were seven 
thousand and five hundred. 

and arrangement as to truths from the 
commencement of faith to the acquisition of 
charity, is a holy state of good and fullness as to 
truth, 

23. The families of the Gershonites shall

pitch behind the tabernacle 
westward. 

good in the ultimate heaven, 

24. And the prince of the fathers' house 
of the Gershonites shall be Eliasaph 
the son of Lael. 

24. And their governing principle being obedience to 
the literal sense of the Word derived from its 
internal sense. 

25. And the charge of the sons of 

25. But the functions of this obscure good in the 

Gershon in the tent of meeting shall 
be the tabernacle, and the Tent, the 
covering thereof, and the screen for 
the door of the tent of meeting, 

worship of the Lord and the work of salvation, are 
the preservation of the Word; of its genuine literal 
sense; of external worship thence, and of the 
doctrine concerning the Lord contained therein; 

26. And the hangings of the court, and 
the screen for the door of the court, 
which is by the tabernacle, and by 
the altar round about, and the cords 
of it for all the service thereof. 

26. Of external worship generally, and of the doctrines
of external worship in particular, which have 
relation to good internally and externally; also of 
the confirmation and conjunction of truth with 
good in such worship. 

27. And of Kohath was the family of the 
Amramites, and the family of the 
Izharites, and the family of the 
Hebronites, and the family of the 
Uzzielites: these are the families of 
the Kohathites. 

28. According to the number of all the 
males, from a month old and 
upward, there were eight thousand 
and six hundred, keeping the charge 
of the sanctuary. 

27. From the good of charity in its brightness are 

derived the general goods constituting the inmost, 
interior, exterior, and external thereof; and those 
who are in these general goods are, relatively, in 
less brightness. 

28. And their quality according to ordination and 

arrangement as to truths from the commencement 
of faith to the acquisition of charity, is a new state 
of the life of charity, and fullness as to truths, from
victory in temptations for the preservation of 
worship, 

44

29. The families of the sons of Kohath 
shall pitch on the side of the 
tabernacle southward. 

29. Their position corresponding to that of the middle 
heaven which is in the light of truth from charity. 

30. And the prince of the fathers' house 
of the families of the Kohathites 
shall be Elizaphan the son of Uzziel. 

30. And their governing principle is confidence in the 
Divine protection, from the interior truth of the 
Word confirmed in the life, 

31. And their charge shall be the ark, 
and the table, and the candlestick, 
and the altars, and the vessels of the 
sanctuary with which they minister, 
and the screen, and all the service 
thereof. 

31. Their function being the preservation of the Word 
in its interiors, and of internal worship by the 
preservation of the essential principle of the Word, 
the good and truth thence derived, the worship of 
the Lord therefrom, the externals of worship in 
accordance therewith, the doctrine of interior truth,
and the good of obedience from interior principles.

32. And Eleazar the son of Aaron the 

32. And Divine Good as manifested in Divine Truth 

priest shall be prince of the princes 
of the Levites, and have the 
oversight of them that keep the 
charge of the sanctuary. 

protecting man from evil is the primary truth of the
spiritual heaven, and the governing principle of 
those who are in the interior good which 
constitutes that heaven. 

33. Of Merari was the family of the 
Mahlites, and the family of the 
Mushites: these are the families of 
Merari. 

33. From the good of faith in obscurity are derived 
external obedience from a sense of duty, and 
reverence for truth from the literal sense of the 
Word, according to its appearances; and those who
are of such a character are, relatively, in a greater 
degree of obscurity. 

34. And those that were numbered of 

34. And their quality, according; to ordination and 

them, according to the number of all 
the males, from a month old and 
upward, were six thousand and two 
hundred. 

arrangement as to truths, from the commencement 
of faith to the acquisition of charity, is victory over
evil and the conjunction of faith and obedience, 

35. And the prince of the fathers' house 
of the families of Merari was Zuriel 
the son of Abihail: they shall pitch 
on the side of the tabernacle 
northward. 

35. Their governing principle being faith founded on 
the ultimate truth of the Word from the love of 
truth on the natural plane for its own sake, and 
their position being in the external of the ultimate 
heaven. 

45

36. And the appointed charge of the sons

of Merari shall be the boards of the 
tabernacle, and the bars thereof, and 
the pillars thereof, and the sockets 
thereof, and all the instruments 
thereof, and all the service thereof; 

37. And the pillars of the court round 
about, and their sockets, and their 
pins, and their cords. 

38. And those that pitch before the 

tabernacle eastward, before the tent 
of meeting toward the sunrising, 
shall be Moses, and Aaron and his 
sons, keeping the charge of the 
sanctuary for the charge of the 
children of Israel; and the stranger 
that comes near shall be put to death.

39. All that were numbered of the 

Levites, which Moses and Aaron 
numbered at the commandment of 
the LORD, by their families, all the 
males from a month old and upward,
were twenty and two thousand. 

40. And the LORD said to Moses, 

Number all the firstborn males of the
children of Israel from a month old 
and upward, and take the number of 
their names. 

36. And the function of those who are in the obscurity 
of truth from good by faith, is the preservation of 
the Word in its outward form according to 
appearances, and of external worship in agreement
therewith, involving the preservation of good and 
truth on the lowest plane, and of the ultimate truths
by which the church is supported, as well as those 
things, intellectual and voluntary, by means of 
which the regeneration of man is promoted, such 
as worldly knowledges and merely natural uses; 

37. With the preservation also of the goods and truths 

by which the forms of such external worship are 
supported, the conjunction of those with things 
internal, and the strengthening of such support and
conjunction as to particulars in every sphere. 

38. And those who have their position in the inmost 
heaven which is celestial, and who are thence in 
the highest light of truth from good, are in Divine 
Truth and Divine Good and the truths thence 
derived immediately proceeding from the Lord; 
and their function is the preservation of the 
supreme love of the Lord and the neighbour, or of 
the love of truth conjoined with good in the 
highest degree; nor is it possible that those who are
out of the church, or in evil, can fulfill their uses, 
or occupy their position without spiritual death. 

39. And the quality of all those who are in love and 
charity of every degree, as to Divine Good and 
Truth by influx from the Lord, and according to 
general principles as embodied in truth, from the 
commencement of faith to the acquisition of 
charity, is that of the full conjunction of goodness 
and truth in every degree and on every plane of 
life. 

40. And further still, there is revelation from the Lord 
by Divine Truth, or the Divine Law, that the man 
of the Spiritual Church should know from the 
Lord, his quality as to faith, which is first with him
in the order of time, even from its commencement 
to the acquisition of charity, by careful self-
examination. 

46

41. And you shall take the Levites for 

me (I am the LORD) instead of all the
firstborn among the children of 
Israel; and the cattle of the Levites 
instead of all the firstlings among the
cattle of the children of Israel. 

41. And at. the same time with the acknowledgement 
that all charity or love which is the essence of 
faith, is entirely from the Lord, Who alone is life 
itself; and that, therefore, charity is really the 
firstborn, spiritually, and this not only as to 
interiors, but also as to exteriors, with the man of 
the church. 

42. And Moses numbered, as the LORD 

commanded him, all the firstborn 
among the children of Israel. 

42. And thus man, by Divine Truth from the Lord, is 
enabled to know his quality as to faith, and as to 
charity. 

43. And all the firstborn males according
to the number of names, from a 
month old and upward, of those that 
were numbered of them, were twenty
and two thousand two hundred and 
threescore and thirteen. 

43. This being in general, according to Divine 
ordination and arrangement, from the 
commencement of faith to the acquisition of 
charity, fullness of conjunction as to good with 
truth, and truth with good reciprocally, and also a 
holy state, with fullness as to remains. 

44. And the LORD spoke to Moses, 

44. Also there is revelation from the Lord, by Divine 

saying, 

Truth giving the perception, 

45. Take the Levites instead of all the 
firstborn among the children of 
Israel, and the cattle of the Levites 
instead of their cattle: and the 
Levites shall be mine; I am the 
LORD. 

45. That charity is truly the primary principle of the 
church, both as to internals and externals, as 
derived from the Lord, Who alone is life itself. 

46. And for the redemption of the two 

hundred and threescore and thirteen 
of the firstborn of the children of 
Israel, which are over and above the 
number of the Levites, 

46. And, therefore, all those who are in faith from 
charity in the external of the church, and are in 
fullness as to remains, and are thus in faith leading
to charity, or in truth leading to good, regarding 
faith as primary. 

47. You shall take five shekels apiece by
the poll; after the shekel of the 
sanctuary shall you take them (the 
shekel is twenty gerahs): 

47. Shall yet be saved, If they acknowledge the Lord 
sincerely from remains of good, individually and 
into the particulars of life, and by a holy state of 
truth derived; from good; for truth is essentially 
from good, and thus faith is essentially from 
charity. 

48. And you shall give the money with 
which the odd number of them is 
redeemed to Aaron and to his sons. 

48. And, on this account, must be ascribed by the man 
of the external church to the Lord, through the 
internal of the church. 

47

49. And Moses took the redemption-

money from them that were over and
above them that were redeemed by 
the Levites: 

50. From the firstborn of the children of 
Israel took he the money; a thousand
three hundred and threescore and 
five shekels, after the shekel of the 
sanctuary: 

51. And Moses gave the redemption-
money to Aaron and to his sons, 
according to the word of the LORD, 
as the LORD commanded Moses. 

49. And this actually takes place, according to Divine 
Law, with the man of the external church, who 
regards faith as primary, and yet acknowledges the
Lord, and who is distinguished from those who are
in the faith of charity, or in faith conjoined with 
charity. 

50. For these also acknowledge the Lord, although 

they regard faith as primary; and their quality is, 
relatively, a full state as to faith, through conflict 
against evil according to their state. 

51. And they truly ascribe their life to the Lord, and 
have conjunction with the internal of the church, 
according to Divine Truth from Divine Good by 
the influx of Divine Good into their life of 
obedience. 

REFERENCES AND NOTES

1. These being the generations of Aaron and Moses in the day when the Lord spoke with Moses 
in Mount Sinai, denotes that the following are the derivations of Divine Good and Divine 
Truth when revelation is made to the church which is capable of receiving; instruction, 1145, 
9946, 7010, 2001, 2951, 8753. 

2. These being the names of the sons of Aaron, denotes that from Divine Good proceeds celestial
good in the inmost heaven, for Aaron denotes the Lord, and also celestial good, which is 
Divine Good in the heavens as proceeding Divine Truth, the son in the highest sense denoting 
the Divine Truth proceeding, 9946, 9408, 8309, 2803; Nadab the firstborn and Abihu, denote 
spiritual truth and good in the middle heaven, 9811; and Eleazar and Ithamar denote natural 
truth and good in the ultimate heaven, 9812. 

3. These being the names of the sons of Aaron, denotes that each has its specific quality as 

manifested in truths from good, 144, 489, 9946; the priests which were anointed denote truth 
united with good, 9954; and being consecrated to minister in the priest's office, denotes to be 
devoted to the ministry of good in the worship of the Lord, because the consecration of Aaron,
or the "filling of his hand," denotes the state when man begins to act from good and no longer 
from truth leading to good; and this is represented by the offering of the second ram in the 
inauguration of Aaron into the office of the priesthood in Lev 8:10057. 

4. Nadab and Abihu dying before the Lord when they offered strange fire, denotes "when 

spiritual truth and good are profaned, spiritual death is the consequence," because by dying is 
denoted spiritual death, 2908, by offering strange fire is denoted profanation, 9475, and Nadab
and Abihu denote spiritual truth and good, 9811; the wilderness of Sinai denotes the obscurity 
of good from the lack of truths, 8753; not having any children, denotes not to be productive 
spiritually, 9325; and Eleazar and Ithamar ministering in the priest's office in the presence of 
Aaron their father, denotes that yet still the church is amended on the natural plane by the 

48

ministry of natural truth and good which are from the Lord through the celestial heaven, 9812, 
9946, 9925. 

5. This is evident because by Jehovah is denoted the Divine Being as to His love, 2001; by 

speaking is denoted influx, 2951; by Moses is represented Divine Truth, or the Word, 7010; 
and by saying is denoted perception, 1791, 1822. 

6. Bringing the tribe of Levi near, denotes that charity must be acknowledged as the living 
principle of the church, 3875, 3877, 3572; setting them before Aaron the priest, denotes 
acknowledgement of subordination to celestial good, 9946; and ministering to Aaron denotes 
that truths from charity must minister to celestial good, 9925, 9946

7. Keeping the charge of Aaron, denotes the preservation of the inmost worship of the Lord from 

celestial good, 3382, 9946; keeping the charge of the whole congregation, denotes the 
preservation of the interior worship of the Lord from spiritual good, 7843; to do the service of 
the tabernacle, denotes to preserve all things of external worship, as appears from the 
representation of the tabernacle, 3216, and from the series; and it is said "from charity and 
truth united" because external worship when genuine, or the external act when genuine effects 
this union or conjunction, as the next verse shows.

8. The Levites keeping all the furniture of the tent of meeting and the charge of the children of 
Israel to do the service of the tabernacle, denotes that all externals of worship, and all its 
internals, with the man of the church, must make one and be conjoined in the outward act, 
because the furniture of the tent of meeting evidently denotes the externals of heaven and the 
church, 35403; and in this connection the children of Israel denote their internals, 3654; while 
doing the service of the tabernacle or holy place, 3210, denotes the conjunction of the external 
with the internal by the outward act, 5947, 9776. 

9. Giving the Levites to Aaron and his sons; and their being wholly given to him on the behalf of 
the children of Israel, denotes that charity must be acknowledged as proceeding from celestial 
good and truth, and this not only in general but as to every particular with the man of the 
Spiritual Church, 3875, 9946, 10227, 3654. But it is said "not only in general but as to every 
particular," because of the repetition, which indicates that the acknowledgement is to be made 
both by the will and understanding, or by the internal and external man, and thus as to the 
whole man, 683. 

10. Appointing Aaron and his sons, and their keeping their priesthood, denotes that celestial good 
and truth alone are the essentials of worship, 9946; and the stranger that comes near being put 
to death, denotes that there can be no genuine worship from selfish love and worldly love, 
4544; while by the stranger being put to death, is denoted that the profanation of good and 
truth by these is spiritual death, 2908. 

11. This is evident, because by Jehovah is denoted the Divine Being as to His love, 2001; by 

speaking is denoted influx, 2951; by Moses is represented Divine Truth, or the Word, 7010; 
and by saying is denoted perception, 1791, 1822. 

12. "I, behold, I have taken the Levites from among the children of Israel instead of all the 

firstborn that opens the womb among the children of Israel; and the Levites shall be mine," 
denotes that the Lord alone is the origin of charity with the man of the church, and that this 

49

charity is primary with him in reality; although faith appears to be so in the order of 
regeneration, 3875, 3654, 3325. 

13. All the firstborn being the Lord's, denotes that faith proceeds from the Lord through charity, 
8042, 8043; the day of smiting all the firstborn in Egypt, denotes that, by the work of 
redemption, faith without charity is exterminated, 7882, 7948; hallowing all the firstborn both 
man and beast, denotes that faith conjoined with charity is sanctified with the man of the 
church, both as to internals and externals, 8042, 7872; "mine they shall be," denotes that all 
good is from the Lord, 8042; and "I am the Lord," denotes that He alone is good itself, 2001. 

14. The Lord speaking to Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, saying, denotes, that again there is 

revelation from the Lord, by Divine Truth, with man when he is in states of obscure good from
lack of truths; and that this gives perception, 2001, 2951, 7010, 8753, 1791, 1822. 

15. Numbering the children of Levi, denotes that truths from the good of charity are to be 

ordinated and arranged by the Lord, 10217; by their fathers' houses and by their families, 
denotes according to man's co-operation in the order of celestial and spiritual good, 7833, 917;
and every male from a month old and upward, denotes as to every truth of faith in its 
commencement and in its progress, 725, 851, 10225. 

16. Moses numbering them, according to the word of the Lord, as he was commanded, denotes 

that this ordination and arrangement is by Divine Truth from Divine Good, through the influx 
of good into truths, 10217, 7010, 2001, 5486. 

17. These being the sons of Levi by their names, Gershon, and Kohath and Merari, denotes that 

the quality of truths from the good of charity is threefold, namely, those in the good of charity 
in obscurity; those from that good in brightness; and those from the faith of charity in 
obscurity, as appears from the meaning and signification of each name as follows: by sons are 
denoted truths, 489; by Gershon is meant his banishment and change of pilgrimage, and 
therefore he denotes the good of charity in obscurity, 996020, 1463; by Kohath is meant 
congregation, and therefore he denotes the good of charity in brightness, 6338, 7843; and by 
Merari is meant bitterness, and therefore he denotes the faith of charity in its obscurity, 7854. 

18. These being the names of the sons of Gershon by their families, that is, Libni and Shimei, 

denotes that the quality of truths from good in obscurity is, according to general principles, 
such as appertains to the understanding and to the life, because by name is denoted quality, 
144; by sons are denoted truths, 489; by families are denoted general principles of good and 
truth, 7833, 72302; by Gershon is denoted good in obscurity, ver. 17; Libni means whiteness, 
and therefore by him is denoted the truth which relates to the understanding, 3993; and Shimei
means my reputation, or my fame, and therefore by him is denoted the merely natural love of 
approbation, and thus, in the best sense, good which appertains to the life or will, 1308. 

19. The sons of Kohath by their families being Amram, and Izhar, and Hebron, and Uzziel, 

denotes the quality of truths from good in brightness, according to their general principles, 
which are such as have relation to inmost good, interior good, exterior good, and external 
good, because sons denote truths, 489; families denote general principles or derivations of 
good and truth, 7833, 72302; by Amram is meant an exalted people, and therefore he denotes 
inmost good and truth, 795, 1259; by Izhar is meant, fine olive oil, and therefore he denotes 
interior good, 886; by Hebron, is meant association, or friendship, and therefore he denotes 

50

exterior good, 38755; and by Uzziel is meant the strength of God or the kid of God, and 
therefore he denotes external good, 6343, 7832; and in addition, the order in which these 
names are mentioned indicates successive degrees of good.

20. The sons of Merari by their families being Mahli and Mushi; and these being families of the 
Levites according to their fathers' houses, denotes that the quality of truths from the good of 
faith in obscurity, is internal and external respectively; and that these are the derivations of 
charity according to its various general forms of good. The proofs are as follows: sons denote 
truths, 489; families denote general principles or derivations of good and truth, 7833, 72302; 
by Mahli is meant weak or diseased, and therefore he denotes the quality of the internal good 
derived from the good represented by Merari, as compared with the good denoted by the other 
families of the Levites, 3820, 5712; by Mushi is meant that which touches or takes away, and 
therefore he denotes the most external good, which is disposed to separate itself from higher 
good and is sensual, or corporeal, 10130, 1581; and the families of the Levites according to 
their fathers' houses, denotes the derivation of charity according to the various forms of good, 
7833, 72302. 

21. Of Gershon there being the family of the Libnites and the family of the Shimeites; and these 
being the families of the Gershonites, denotes that from the good of charity in obscurity, are 
derived the general goods arising from the reception of truth in the understanding and of truth 
in the life; and that those who are in these general goods are relatively in greater obscurity, 
vers. 17, 18, 5114. 

22. Numbering them denotes quality according to ordination and arrangement, 10217; according 
to the number of the males, denotes as to truths, 725; from a month old and upward, denotes 
from the commencement of faith to the acquisition of the good of truth which is incipient 
charity, 851, 10225; seven thousand denotes a holy state of good, 716; and five hundred, 
denotes fullness as to truths, 10253. 

23. The families of the Gershonites pitching behind the tabernacle westward, denotes that their 
position corresponds to the obscurity of good in the ultimate heaven, 3708, 9755, 1616. 

24. The prince of the fathers' house of the Gershonites being Eliasaph the son of Lael, denotes that
their governing principle is obedience to the literal sense of the Word, derived from its internal
sense, because Eliasaph means increased of God, and the Word is completed in its literal 
sense; and Lael denotes that from which the literal sense is derived, namely, the internal sense,
4981, 10331, 8944. 

25. The charge of the sons of Gershon in the tent of meeting, denotes the functions of this obscure 
good in the worship of the Lord and the work of salvation, 3382, 35403; the tabernacle denotes
the Word, 3439; the tent denotes the genuine literal sense, 3439, the covering denotes external 
worship thence, 9632; and the screen for the door of the tent denotes doctrine concerning the 
Lord contained therein, 2576. 

26. The hangings of the court, denote external worship generally, because they signify the truths 
of the ultimate heaven, 9743; the screen for the door of the court, denotes the doctrines of 
external worship in particular, because it signifies introduction into the ultimate heaven, and 
also a guard lest it should be entered by any except by those who are prepared, truths adapted 

51

to that heaven being the means, 9763, 25767; which is by the tabernacle, and by the altar round
about, denotes which have relation to good internally and externally, 3210, 9714; and the cords
of it for all the service thereof, denotes the confirmation and conjunction of truth with good in 
such worship, 9777, 5947. 

27. Of Kohath there being the family of the Amramites, and the family of the Izharites, and the 

family of the Hebronites, and the family of the Uzzielites; and these being the families of the 
Kohathites, denotes that from the good of charity in its brightness, are derived the general 
goods constituting the inmost, interior, exterior, and external thereof; and that those who are in
these general goods are relatively in less brightness, vers. 17, 19, 5114. 

28. According to the number of all the males, denotes their quality according to ordination and 
arrangement as to truths, 10217, 725; from a month old and upward, denotes from the 
commencement of faith to the acquisition of the good of faith, which is incipient charity, 851, 
10225; eight thousand and six hundred denotes a new state of the life of charity and fullness as
to truths from victory in temptations, 2044, 737, 7973; keeping the charge of the sanctuary, 
denotes for the preservation of worship, 3210, 3382. 

29. The families of the sons of Kohath pitching on the side of the tabernacle southward, denotes 
that their position corresponds to that of the middle heaven which is in the light of truth from 
charity, 9684, 1616. 

30. The prince of the fathers' house of the families of the Kohathites being Elizaphan the son of 
Uzziel, denotes that their governing principle is confidence in the Divine protection from the 
interior truth of the Word confirmed in the life, because a prince denotes primary truth, and 
thus a governing principle, 1482; by Elizaphan is meant one whom God protects, and therefore
he denotes confidence in the Divine protection, 8975; and by Uzziel is meant the power of 
God or the kid of God, and therefore he denotes the interior truth of the Word confirmed in the 
life, there being no protection from truth only in the understanding, and not in the will or love, 
6343, 7832. 

31. The charge of the Kohathites, denotes the functions of the spiritual, ver. 29; the ark denotes the

Word in its interiors, because it denotes the Lord especially as to His Divine Truth, 9485; the 
table denotes the good of love, and the good, of faith", which is charity, and thus it denotes the
essential principle of worship and of the Word, 9527, 9545; the candlestick denotes the 
spiritual heaven, and also the truth of faith, which enlightens the mind, and thus the table 
signifies good, and the candlestick truth, 9548; the altars denote worship, 9714, 10177; the 
vessels of the sanctuary, denote the externals of worship, 10340; the screen denotes the 
doctrines of interior truth, 25764, 9670; and the service thereof, denotes the good of obedience 
from interior principles, 3409. 

32. Eleazar the son of Aaron, the priest, denotes Divine Good as manifested in Divine Truth, 9946;
the word Eleazar means the help of God and the court of God, and therefore denotes the Lord 
protecting man from evil, 8652; a prince denotes a primary truth, and thus a governing truth, 
1482; and governing the princes of the Levites, and having the oversight of them that keep the 
charge of the sanctuary, denotes the governing principle of those who are in the interior good 
which constitutes that heaven, 3875, 3210. 

52

33. Of Merari there being the family of the Mahlites, and the family of the Mushites; and these 
being the families of Merari, denotes that from the good of faith in obscurity are derived 
external obedience from a sense of duty, and reverence for truth in the literal sense of the Word
according to its appearances; and that those who are of such a character are, relatively, in a 
greater degree of obscurity, vers. 17, 20, and 5114.

34. Those that were numbered of them according to the number of all the males, denotes their 
quality as to ordination and arrangement according to truths, 10217, 725; from a month old 
and upward, denotes from the commencement of faith to the acquisition of the good of faith, 
which is incipient charity, 851, 10225; and six thousand and two hundred, denotes victory over
evil and the conjunction of faith and obedience, 737, 5194. 

35. The prince of the fathers' house of the families of Merari, being Zuriel the son of Abihail, 

denotes, 1482, that the governing principle of those in the good of faith in obscurity, is faith 
founded on the ultimate truth of the Word from the love of truth, on the natural plane, for its 
own sake, because by Zuriel is meant God is my rock, and therefore he denotes faith founded 
on the ultimate truth of the Word, 2760 preface, and by Abihail is meant the father of strength,
and therefore he denotes the love of truth, 3703, 3727 end; and their pitching on the side of the
tabernacle northward, denotes that their position is in the external of the ultimate heaven, 
3708, 9648, 1616. 

36. The appointed charge of the sons of Merari, denotes the function of those who are in the 

obscurity of truth from good by faith, 3382, 489, 3708; the tabernacle denotes worship and the 
Word, here, in their outward form and appearances according to the series, 3210; the boards 
denote the good which supports heaven, 9634; the bars denote the power of good by truths, 
4024, 94963; the pillars and sockets denote the ultimate good and truth by which the church is 
supported, 9757; and the instruments and the service, denote those things, intellectual and 
voluntary; by means of which the regeneration of man is promoted, such as worldly 
knowledges and merely natural uses, 5948, 5949, 3409. 

37. The pillars of the court round about, and their sockets, or bases, denote the goods and truths by
which the forms of such, external worship are supported, 9741, 9757; and the pins and cords, 
denote the conjunction of those things with what is internal, and the strengthening of such 
support and conjunction as to particulars in every sphere, 9854, 9777. 

38. Those that pitch before the tabernacle eastward, before the tent of meeting towards the sun 

rising, being Moses and Aaron and his sons, denotes that those who have their position in the 
inmost heaven, which is celestial, and who are thence in the greatest light of truth from good, 
are in Divine Truth and Divine Good, and the' truths thence derived immediately proceeding 
from the Lord, because "before the tabernacle eastward, and before the tent of meeting toward 
the sun rising," denote the inmost heaven as to its internal and external, 3708, 9668, 683; and 
Moses and Aaron and his sons denotes Divine Truth and Divine Good and the truths thence 
proceeding, which are immediately from the Lord, 7010, 9946; their keeping the charge of the 
sanctuary for the charge of the children of Israel, denotes that their function is the preservation
of the supreme love of the Lord and the neighbour, or of the love of truth conjoined with good 
in the highest degree, 3210, 9680, 3654, 3382; and the stranger that comes near being put to 
death, denotes that it is not possible for those who are out of the church, or in evil to fulfill 
their uses, or occupy their position without spiritual death, 1097, 2049, 9378, 2908. 

53

39. All that were numbered of the Levites, denotes the quality of all those who are in love and 

charity of every degree, 3875, 10217; which Moses and Aaron numbered, denotes as to Divine
Truth and Good, 7010, 9946; at the commandment of the Lord, denotes by influx from the 
Lord, 5486; by their families, denotes according to general principles, 7833; all the males, 
denotes as embodied in truths, 725; from a month old and upward, denotes from the 
commencement of faith to the acquisition of the good of faith which is incipient charity, 851, 
10225; and twenty and two thousand denotes the full conjunction of good and truth in every 
degree and on every plane of life, because twenty-two is a multiple of two, 5194. 

40. By the Lord saying to Moses, is denoted revelation by Divine Truth, 2001, 7010, 1822; 
numbering denotes knowing, from the Lord, the quality of our spiritual life, 10217; the 
firstborn males, denote faith, which is first in the order of time, 352; from a month old and 
upward, denotes from the commencement of faith to the acquisition of charity, 851, 10225; 
and taking the number of the names, denotes the discovery of quality by careful self-
examination, 144, 10217. 

41. Taking the Levites for the Lord, denotes the acknowledgement that all charity or love is really 
the firstborn, 3875; "I am the Lord," denotes that the Lord is love itself and that charity is from
Him, 2001; instead of the firstborn of the children of Israel, denotes instead of faith which is 
apparently primary with the man of the Spiritual Church, 352, 3654; and the cattle of the 
Levites instead of all the cattle of the children of Israel, denotes that this is true, not only of the
internal of the church, but also of the external, 7424. 

42. Moses numbering, as the Lord commanded him, all the firstborn among the children of Israel, 
denotes that thus man, by Divine Truth from the Lord, is enabled to know his quality as to 
faith and as to charity, 7010, 10217, 5486, 352. 

43. All the firstborn males, according to the number of the names of those that were numbered of 
them, properly denotes the quality of faith, or truth, according to Divine ordination and 
arrangement, 352, 144, 725, 10217; from a month old and upward, denotes from the 
commencement of faith to the acquisition of charity, 851, 10225; and twenty and two thousand
and two hundred and three score and thirteen, denotes fullness of conjunction as to good with 
truth, and truth with good, reciprocally, and also a holy state with fullness as to remains. For 
twenty-two thousand denotes the full conjunction of good with truth being spoken of the 
Levites, ver. 39, and two hundred denotes the conjunction of truth with good, being spoken of 
the Israelites, 5194; and three score and thirteen denotes a holy state and fullness as to 
remains, since sixty denotes fullness of remains, 5335, and thirteen denotes a holy state of 
remains, 2109. 

44. This is evident because by Jehovah is denoted the Divine Being as to His love, 2001; by 

speaking is denoted influx, 2951; by Moses is represented Divine Truth, or the Word, 7010; 
and by saying is denoted perception, 1791, 1822. 

45. Taking the Levites instead of all the firstborn among the children of Israel; and the cattle of the
Levites instead of their cattle; and the Levites being the Lord's, denotes that charity is truly the
primary principle of the church, both as to internals and externals, as derived from the Lord 
Who alone is Life Itself, ver. 41. 

54

46. The redemption of the two hundred and three score and thirteen, of the firstborn of the 

children of Israel, which are over and above the Levites, denotes that all those who are in faith 
from charity, in the external of the church, are to be redeemed, because the Israelites signify 
the external of the church, and the Levites the internal, as is evident from their respective 
positions in the encampment about the tabernacle, and also from the signification of the 
Levites, 3875, 3654; two hundred denotes the reciprocal conjunction of truth with good, ver. 
43; three score and thirteen denotes fullness and holiness as to remains, 5335, 2109; and their 
being over and above the number of the Levites, denotes that they are in faith leading to 
charity, or in truth leading to good, and regard faith as primary, since the expression implies a 
distinction from those in faith conjoined with charity.

47. Taking five shekels apiece by the poll, denotes the sincere acknowledgement of the Lord from 
remains individually and as to the particulars of life, 2959; taking them after the shekel of the 
sanctuary, denotes from a holy state of truth derived from good, 10221; and the shekel being 
twenty gerahs, denotes that truth is essentially from good, and thus faith is essentially from 
charity, 10222. 

48. Giving the money with which the odd number is redeemed to Aaron and to his sons, denotes 
that the good and truth of remains is from the Lord, and must be ascribed to Him through the 
internal of the church, 10227, 9946, 2959. 

49. Moses taking the redemption money from them that were over and above them that were 

redeemed by the Levites, denotes that this, actually, takes place according to Divine Law with 
the man of the external church who regards faith as primary, and yet acknowledges the Lord, 
and who is distinguished from those who are in the faith of charity or in faith conjoined with 
charity, 7010, ver. 46, 3875. 

50. Moses taking the money from the firstborn of the children of Israel, denotes that these also 

acknowledge the Lord although they regard faith as primary, 10227, ver. 46; and one thousand 
three hundred, and three score and five shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary, denotes a full
state as to faith through conflicts against evil according to their state, 5955, 737, 5708, 10221. 

51. Moses giving the redemption money to Aaron and his sons, according to the Word of the Lord,

as the Lord commanded Moses, denotes that the external men as well as the internal, like the 
spiritual as distinguished from the celestial, truly ascribe their life to the Lord, and have 
conjunction with the internal of the church, according to Divine Truth from Divine Good by 
the influx of Divine Good into their life of obedience, 7010, 9946, 5486. 

DISCUSSION

Let us consider for a moment, the state in which mankind would be without any knowledge whatever 
of the Lord and of a future state.

It is true, that this cannot properly be said of the world in which we live. For mankind not only has such
a revelation, but the human race has never been without it. Traditions of a golden age, have been 
handed down from time immemorial; and there could not have been such a happy state with no 
knowledge of a Divine Being and a future life. And in the revelation made to this New Age we are told 
that the earliest inhabitants of this earth, who lived like wild animals, were, nevertheless, regenerated, 

55

286; and they could not have been regenerated apart from a revelation giving them a knowledge of the 
Lord, and of the future state.

But not only so. In the revelation that the world now has in the Bible, which has been acknowledged as 
a revelation ever since the first part of it was written by Moses, there is an allegorical description of the
spiritual state of that earliest race of men (Gen. i. - ii.); and we now may know from it, that they had 
definite instruction that it would be dangerous for them to ascribe their life to themselves, and not to 
the Lord (Gen 1:3, 2:16-17). Hence, then, our revelation contains a part of the most ancient one; and we
ought not to forget that.

But still we may know how lamentable is the state of those without a revelation, from thinking of that 
of those, who in the present day, as well as in all past time, are, or have been, ignorant of it, or who 
have denied it. And these remarks are made to show the great importance of the revelation given to 
Moses by the Lord in Mount Sinai, as the beginning of our chapter states. Do not let us then forget the 
strict historical statement here made. We need not, however, suppose, that when the Lord commanded 
Moses to number the Levites as He did, nothing else was contained in the directions given, but what 
concerned them and the Israelites. For surely revelation from the Divine Being involves a great deal 
more than such things. Hence, then, we must look for something more than the history in the Word of 
the Lord, and thus in the generations of Aaron and Moses. For these generations, as the references 
show, describe the derivations of Divine Good and Truth, which we are all capable of understanding to 
be such as they are described in the first section of the connected series to the end of ver. 4. For if these 
things were not true, neither the spiritual nor the natural worlds could have existed, nor could the 
human race have existed and have been regenerated. This, then, is our great lesson to begin with; and 
we now therefore may proceed to study the succeeding sections.

But how much more valuable is it to have the gift of charity, or love to the neighbour, and to 
acknowledge that it is from the Lord than it is to perceive, that we have a true revelation. Charity is the 
living principle of the church in ourselves. When we have it, it never fails, and is never idle. It loves to 
work for the good of all; and it regards all kinds and degrees of usefulness from those things that 
concern our souls to those which concern our bodies, as worthy of a proper share of attention. And this 
is all involved in the second section to the end of ver. 10. "All religion has relation to life, and the life 
of religion is to do good" (Doct. of Life, 2). The outward act, in which true charity is fully expressed, is 
at once the complex, the continent, and the basis of the higher life. But this outward act would be 
vitiated if celestial good, or love to the Lord, were not within it, as the essential. For you cannot 
separate this from charity. If you show me a man that is truly charitable I will affirm that that man loves
the Lord, even if he is ignorant of true doctrine concerning Him. Charity, however, is intermediate, and 
thus ministers on the one hand to celestial and on the other to natural things, as appears from ver. 7, 
where the full conjunction of all man's powers in action is expressed by doing the service of the 
tabernacle. Nor must we neglect the caution at the end of the section, by assuming the worship of the 
Lord merely outwardly, because such hypocrisy involves spiritual death, or in other words separation 
from Him.

The third section is short, but it is very weighty. We must not put faith before charity, although the 
former may appear to us exceedingly important in our early religious experiences; for who does not 
know that what a man loves, is of far more consequence than what he thinks or believes intellectually? 
Now this reminds us of Cain and Abel in the most ancient allegory, and warns us to beware lest we give
to faith undue pre-eminence, and destroy charity by neglecting the cultivation of the heart, and its 
affections, and at length by asserting that faith alone will save us. This contention has been the bane of 

56

all preceding churches. Let us not contaminate ourselves with it in our daily lives; for it is possible to 
do this by neglecting our obvious duty, while yet with our lips we loudly praise even the genuine 
doctrine that faith apart from charity, and good works expressing both together, is dead.

And therefore we are to pay attention to what follows in respect to the numbering of the Levites, not 
forgetting that these, considered as distinct from the priests on the one hand, and the people on the 
other, denote the worship of the Lord and the work of salvation among those in natural good derived 
from the Lord through celestial and spiritual good, 10017. For this is the reason why the families of the 
Levites represent different qualities of good in the ultimate heaven, as described from vers. 14-37, 
while yet it sometimes happens that they signify also either celestial good, or spiritual good as the case 
may be, 3875, 3877, chap 2:17. In fact, the camp of the Levites in the midst of the camps when the 
army set forward, is a fine symbolic description of the stimulating presence of Divine Love operating 
even in the natural man. But observe, before proceeding, that it is said, "Number the sons of Levi, 
every male," to indicate, ordination and arrangement as to truths, because the quality of good is 
according to truths, by which it is formed.

Now this description, therefore, involves a very great practical lesson, which, it is to be feared, many 
do not learn well enough as they journey through the wilderness of this world. For they often forget, in 
their anxiety about being good, that they cannot be good unless they act according to truths, since the 
truth every one loves best, is an indication of the good that he delights in. Or again, some are so very 
eager in their pursuit of truth, or in the acquisition of knowledge, that they are disposed to neglect 
charity, and therefore, if they proceed at all, they do so but slowly. And hence we may see the 
importance of conjoining faith with love and charity in definite actions. And as the whole camp of the 
Israelites could not have proceeded at all unless each division of the Levites, denoted by Gershon, and 
Kohath and Merari, had done its proper duty, so neither can the spiritual, or celestial man advance, 
when the natural affections and powers do not co-operate. Consider, therefore, how very much more is 
involved, in this description of the derivations, numbers, positions, governors and functions of the 
Levites, than appears upon the surface. And in reality, it shows that there is no action in our lives that 
we ought to consider insignificant to be used in order to promote our spiritual progress.

It is impossible indeed, in this short commentary, to speak at length on the particulars named up to the 
point just above indicated, but as an illustration of the value of applying: the correspondence of the 
names of persons, a comparison may be made of the spiritual signification of the princes of the four 
camps of the Levites in this chapter with that of the leaders of the four camps in chapter ii. Beginning 
with the east, we find that the leading principle of the celestial heaven is, according to the 
correspondence of Nahshon the son of Amminadab, truth immediately proceeding from good; and 
turning to the same quarter in this chapter we observe that, practically, the same principle is denoted by
Moses and Aaron and his sons, for they signify "Divine Truth and Divine Good, and the truths thence 
derived immediately proceeding from the Lord," ver. 38. Again taking the south, in the former chapter, 
we notice that the leading principle of the middle heaven, according to the correspondence of Elizur the
son of Shedeur, is faith from charity, which is the foundation of the church, and also that, in this 
chapter, the correspondence of Elizaphan the son of Uzziel is "confidence in the Divine protection, 
derived from the interior truth of the Word confirmed in the life," which amounts to the same thing, ver.
30. Thirdly, we come to the west, and in the former chapter we observe that the leading principle of the 
obscure good of the ultimate heaven is, according to the correspondence of Elishama the son of 
Ammihud, obedience to truth from the love of good, while in this chapter, the correspondence of 
Eliazaph the son of Lael, is "obedience to the literal sense of the Word, derived from its internal sense,"
ver. 24. And, lastly, taking the north in chap. ii, we see that the leading principle of those in the obscure 

57

truth of the ultimate heaven, according to the correspondence of Ahiezer the son of Ammishaddai, is 
good which aids, derived from Divine Truth which protects man in temptations, and also that, in this 
chapter, the correspondence of Zuriel the son of Abihail is "faith founded on the ultimate truth of the 
Word, from the love of truth on the natural plane for its own sake," ver. 35. 

And now, in conclusion, we have a very interesting subject to take into consideration, namely, the 
distinction between those who are in faith, and those who are in charity generally; and between those 
who are in faith alone from an evil life, and those who are in faith alone from doctrine only, and not 
from an evil life. For the Levites taken all together, clearly denote those who are in charity, as 
distinguished from those who are in love to the Lord, and who are represented by the priests; and we 
have already seen that although these are separate, yet they are conjoined by this, namely, that there can
be no true love to the neighbour, with one who does not love the Lord as well, nor can any one truly 
love the Lord, and not at the same time love the neighbour, this conjunction clearly arising from the 
nature of the Lord's love. But the number of the Levites was exactly twenty-two thousand; and when 
we reflect on this number, we perceive that it not only signifies "the full conjunction of good and truth 
in every degree and on every plane of life," ver. 39, but we recognize also, that while a thousand 
denotes fullness, 2575, twenty and two, which both signify conjunction, also may denote, since it is 
love by which only there is conjunction, love to the Lord as the inmost, and love to the neighbour as the
outward expression of love to the Lord. Hence, then, we can now proceed, and consider the difference 
between the Levites taken all together, and the children (or sons) of Israel taken all together. For the 
former denote all in charity, and the latter denote all in faith, or truth, a son, and a male, specifically 
denoting truth. But the whole number of the children of Israel, was twenty-two thousand two hundred 
three score and thirteen, thus showing, correspondentially, that love and charity were involved with 
those who were in faith, because twenty-two thousand was the number of the Levites. And therefore, it 
is said, that the children of Israel, taken all together, represent those in faith conjoined with charity, and 
not those in faith without charity in this case, these being denoted by the firstborn of the Egyptians who
perished, although not named here.

But now we have to notice, that although all in genuine faith are in faith conjoined with charity, yet 
some are disposed, in the beginning of regeneration especially, to give to faith an undue preeminence, 
and that these are represented by the persons numbered above twenty-two thousand, namely, the two 
hundred three score and thirteen. Again, however, by examining the correspondence of this number, 
which gives their real quality, we see that notwithstanding their exaltation of faith above charity 
externally, they do it not internally; for two hundred signifies their conjunction with the Lord, which 
can only be by charity or by love; that they have this love within them by virtue of remains, which are 
signified by the five shekels; and from the fact also that the shekel is called the shekel of the sanctuary, 
denoting thus the conjunction of truth with good a second time, or externally, by acknowledgement of 
the Lord and obedience to Him; and the reason is given, namely, that they act essentially from good, 
when yet ostensibly they are exalting faith. And that this is their state is fully confirmed from a study of
the number of shekels, which being exactly five times the number of persons in excess of the Levites, 
yet correctly signifies "a full state as to faith through conflict against evil according to their state," the 
five evidently denoting not much, but a little as compared with the quality signified by twenty-two 
thousand, and hence again we learn; that, according to the poet—

"There's a Divinity that shapes our ends, Rough-hew them how we will."

For the "Divinity" is essentially Divine Love in the inmost of all things collectively, and in the inmost 
of each person taken separately, interpenetrating all the lower affections, and stimulating all the 

58

derivative intellectual powers, wherever any individual is disposed willingly to do the Lord's will, 
notwithstanding the fact that he has been externally educated into the belief that nothing but faith alone 
saves him. Now we must remember this fact, therefore, of the universality of the Divine influence in 
order to discern clearly that there are thousands of good Christians, or may be such, in every 
denomination of the Spiritual Church, who are really in charity and love while earnestly exalting faith 
only as saving; and that such persons form, as it were, the border of the Lord's garment or of His robe 
of righteousness, where the bells and the pomegranates are in regular order, or where lowest truths are 
conjoined with good (Exod 28:31-35) in innocence and humility.

Numbers Chapter 4

SUMMARY OF THE SPIRITUAL SENSE

1. The ordination and arrangement of those in the spiritual heaven is distinguished from that of 
those in charity generally, and their function is the cultivation and preservation of the inmost 
affections of love and charity, vers. 1-16. 

2. But those who constitute the spiritual heaven are also not to be separated from those in charity 
generally; and although they minister to celestial things, they cannot perform the functions of 
the celestial, vers. 17-20. 

3. Concerning the ordination and arrangement of those who are in the obscure good which 

constitutes the internal of the ultimate heaven, and concerning their functions, vers. 21-28. 

4. The same in regard to those who constitute the external of the ultimate heaven, vers. 29-33. 

5. Concerning the ordination and arrangement of those in the spiritual heaven, who perform 

some function in the worship of the Lord and in the work of salvation, with a description of 
their quality, vers. 34-37. 

6. The same with regard to those in the internal of the ultimate heaven, 38-41. 

7. And the same with regard to those in the external of the ultimate heaven, vers. 42-45. 

8. Also the quality of all those who are in charity taken together, according to ordination and 

arrangement, is a new state of life through regeneration, fullness as to truths, and fullness of 
conjunction both as to good and truth mutually and reciprocally, vers. 46-49. 

THE CONTENTS OF EACH VERSE

1. And the LORD spoke to Moses and to

1. There is revelation from the Lord by Divine Truth 

Aaron, saying, 

and Divine Good giving the perception, 

2. Take the sum of the sons of Kohath 
from among the sons of Levi, by 
their families, by their fathers' 
houses, 

2. That the ordination and arrangement of truths in 
the spiritual heaven, or in the spiritual degree of 
the human mind, is to be distinguished from that 
of those who are in charity generally as to interior 
goods, as to inmost good, 

3. From thirty years old and upward 
even until fifty years old, all that 
enter upon the service, to do the 
work in the tent of meeting. 

3. And as to quality with respect to truths leading to 
good, and truths confirmed in good, in order that 
they may perform their functions in regard to the 
worship of the Lord and the work of salvation. 

60

4. This is the service of the sons of 

4. And this function is the cultivation and 

Kohath in the tent of meeting, about 
the most holy things: 

preservation of the inmost affections of love and 
charity. 

5. When the camp sets forward, Aaron 
shall go in, and his sons, and they 
shall take down the veil of the 
screen, and cover the ark of the 
testimony with it: 

6. And shall put thereon a covering of 
sealskin, and shall spread over it a 
cloth all of blue, and shall put in the 
staves thereof. 

5. For in every change of state celestial love and the 
truths thence derived are the inmost moving 
powers, which, by means of inmost appearances of
truth, protect inmost love; 

6. And these, again by interior truths by such as are 
exterior; and the whole being supported and 
conjoined by truths most external. 

7. And upon the table of shewbread 

7. Also it is the function of celestial love and its 

they shall spread a cloth of blue, and 
put thereon the dishes, and the 
spoons, and the bowls, and the cups 
to pour out withal: and the continual 
bread shall be thereon: 

8. And they shall spread upon them a 
cloth of scarlet, and cover the same 
with a covering of sealskin, and shall
put in the staves thereof. 

9. And they shall take a cloth of blue, 
and cover the candlestick of the 
light, and its lamps, and its tongs, 
and its snuff-dishes, and all the oil 
vessels thereof, with which they 
minister to it: 

truths to protect spiritual good derived from 
celestial good in the middle heaven, by means of 
exterior celestial truths, so that the knowledges of 
interior and exterior celestial good and truth in the 
natural man, may be conjoined with celestial good 
pre-eminently, and also with spiritual good pre-
eminently, and with both continually, 

8. Being also protected by the operation of spiritual 
good and truth internally, and natural good and 
truth externally, together with this good and truth 
embodied in action, so that the spiritual man is 
prepared to make progress. 

9. Also celestial love and the truths thence 

proceeding provide for the protection of the 
spiritual heaven, wherein are truths interior and 
exterior, truths purificatory and evacuatory, and 
truths receptive of good and ministering thereto by
means of spiritual truth conjoined to celestial 
good, 

10. And they shall put it and all the

vessels thereof within a covering of 
sealskin, and shall put it upon the 
frame.

good; 

11. And upon the golden altar they shall

spread a cloth of blue, and cover it 
with a covering of sealskin, and shall
put in the staves thereof: 

spiritual heaven, which is worship from charity, is 
protected in the same way; 

61

12. And they shall take all the vessels of 
ministry, with which they minister in
the sanctuary, and put them in a cloth
of blue, and cover them with a 
covering of sealskin, and shall put 
them on the frame. 

13. And they shall take away the ashes 
from the altar, and spread a purple 
cloth thereon: 

14. And they shall put upon it all the 
vessels thereof, with which they 
minister about it, the firepans, the 
fleshhooks, and the shovels, and the 
basins, all the vessels of the altar; 
and they shall spread upon it a 
covering of sealskin, and put in the 
staves thereof. 

15. And when Aaron and his sons have 
made an end of covering the 
sanctuary, and all the furniture of the
sanctuary, as the camp is to set 
forward; after that, the sons of 
Kohath shall come to bear it: but 
they shall not touch the sanctuary, 
lest they die. These things are the 
burden of the sons of Kohath in the 
tent of meeting. 

12. As well as all ministering scientifics and doctrinals

by which this worship is performed. 

13. Moreover celestial good and truth are instrumental
in the removal from spiritual worship of all those 
things which have served their purpose, and the 
retention of which would prevent progress, and in 
protecting that worship itself by the celestial love 
of good; 

14. And thus, too, are all things ministering to this 
worship, namely, those which have reference to 
love interior and exterior, those which have 
reference to truth interior and exterior, and those 
which are essential in worship, similarly protected.

15. And when celestial love and its truths thus protect 
the true worship of the Lord, and all things which 
minister thereto, in order that there may be 
progress in spiritual life, then it is the function of 
the spiritual heaven and the spiritual man, who is a
heaven or is preparing for heaven, to promote such
progress, but he cannot perform the functions 
proper to the celestial loves, nor can he realize the 
celestial things thereof, for this would cause the 
destruction of his own life of charity; but 
nevertheless spiritual love ministers to celestial 
love in the worship of the Lord and the work of 
salvation. 

16. And the charge of Eleazar the son of 

16. But spiritual truth, which is immediately from 

Aaron the priest shall be the oil for 
the light, and the sweet incense, and 
the continual meal offering, and the 
anointing oil, the charge of all the 
tabernacle, and of all that therein is, 
the sanctuary, and the furniture 
thereof. 

celestial love, alone preserves essential celestial 
good, from which proceeds truth, all things that 
are grateful and acceptable in worship, all worship 
from charity, all that promotes the conjunction of 
good and truth, all things in general having 
relation to worship, all things in particular, and all 
things ministering thereto internal and external. 

17. And the LORD spoke to Moses and to

Aaron, saying, 

17. And there is revelation from the Lord by Divine 
Truth and Divine Good giving the perception. 

62

18. Cut you not off the tribe of the 
families of the Kohathites from 
among the Levites: 

19. But thus do to them, that they may 
live, and not die, when they 
approach to the most holy things: 
Aaron and his sons shall go in, and 
appoint them every one to his service
and to his burden: 

20. But they shall not go in to see the 
sanctuary even for a moment, lest 
they die. 

18. That all those who are in charity and in the faith of
charity, and who constitute the spiritual heaven for
the uses just described, are not to be separated 
from those in charity there generally; 

19. And in order that they may enjoy their specific 

good without loss of spiritual life, when they 
minister in the holy things belonging to celestial 
love, or to the inmost heavens, they shall be 
supported by influx from celestial love and its 
truths from that heaven, and shall receive their 
love of use internal and external, thence. 

20. But still they cannot come into the perception of 

good and truth enjoyed by the celestial, nor ought 
they to aspire after such perception, lest they 
should lose their own proper life of charity. 

21. And the LORD spoke to Moses, 

saying, 

21. Further there is revelation from the Lord by Divine
Truth giving perception to the man of the church, 

22. Take the sum of the sons of Gershon 
also, by their fathers' houses, by their
families; 

22. That those who are in the obscure good, which 

constitutes the internal of the ultimate heaven both
as to interior and exterior things are ordinated and 
arranged according to their quality, 

23. From thirty years old and upward 

23. With respect to truths leading to good, and truths 

until fifty years old shall you number
them; all that enter in to wait upon 
the service, to do the work in the tent
of meeting. 

confirmed in good, in order that they may perform 
their function in regard to the worship of the Lord 
and the work of salvation. 

24. This is the service of the families of 
the Gershonites, in serving and in 
bearing burdens: 

24. And this is the function of those in the internal of 
the ultimate heaven in the cultivation of good 
internal and external. 

25. They shall bear the curtains of the 
tabernacle, and the tent of meeting, 
its covering, and the covering of 
sealskin that is above upon it, and 
the screen for the door of the tent of 
meeting; 

25. They support the interior truths of faith which 

belong to those in the second heaven, the exterior 
truths of faith which belong to their own heaven, 
the external truths there, the external good there, 
and the appearances of truth which are the medium
between their own heaven and the second. 

63

26. And the hangings of the court, and 

the screen for the door of the gate of 
the court, which is by the tabernacle 
and by the altar round about, and 
their cords, and all the instruments of
their service, and whatever shall be 
done with them, therein shall they 
serve. 

27. At the commandment of Aaron and 
his sons shall be all the service of the
sons of the Gershonites, in all their 
burden, and in all their service: and 
you shall appoint to them in charge 
all their burden. 

28. This is the service of the families of 
the sons of the Gershonites in the 
tent of meeting: and their charge 
shall be under the hand of Ithamar 
the son of Aaron the priest. 

26. Also they support the truths of the external of the 
ultimate heaven; the doctrine of the Lord therein, 
as to truth and as to good; and all inferior truths 
which minister thereto in some specific use; for by
these they worship. 

27. And all these functions are performed through the 
influx of celestial good and its truths into every act
of external worship and internal; and thus celestial 
love and its truths are present in things most 
external. 

28. These are the functions of those in the obscure 

good of the ultimate heaven in the worship of the 
Lord and the work of salvation; and their ruling 
motive is the love of natural good received from 
the Lord and expressed with power in natural 
truth.

confirmed in good, with all who perform some 
function internal or external connected with the 
worship of the Lord and the work of salvation. 

31. And this is the charge of their 

burden, according to all their service 
in the tent of meeting; the boards of 
the tabernacle, and the bars thereof, 
and the pillars thereof, and the 
sockets thereof; 

31. And this is their office according to their function: 
the preservation of the Word in its ultimate form 
according to appearances, and of all external 
worship in agreement therewith; involving the 
preservation of good and truth on the ultimate 
plane. 

32. And the pillars of the court round 
about, and their sockets, and their 
pins, and their cords, with all their 
instruments, and with all their 
service: and by name you shall 
appoint the instruments of the charge
of their burden. 

32. And also all the truths by which such external 

worship is supported, the conjunction of these with
things internal, and the confirmation of such

64

33. This is the service of the families of 
the sons of Merari, according to all 
their service, in the tent of meeting, 
under the hand of Ithamar the son of 
Aaron the priest. 

33. These are the functions of those in the external of 
the ultimate heaven in the worship of the Lord, 
and the work of salvation, and their ruling motive 
also shall be the love of natural good received 
from the Lord and expressed with power in natural
truths, 

34. And Moses and Aaron and the 
princes of the congregation

who perform some function in the worship of the

and truth, a holy state according to good, and 
fullness as to truths. 

37. These are they that were numbered 
of the families of the Kohathites, all 
that did serve in the tent of meeting, 
whom Moses and Aaron numbered 
according to the commandment of 
the LORD by the hand of Moses. 

37. Such is the ordination and arrangement of those in 
the spiritual heaven who perform some function in
the worship of the Lord and the work of salvation, 
by Divine Truth and Divine Good, that is, through 
influx from the Lord, and by the power of the 
Divine Law.

and arrangement of truths in the spiritual heaven, or in the spiritual degree of the human mind,
distinguished from those who are in charity generally, because the Kohathites signify those 
who are in the good of charity, and thence in truths in brightness, chap 3:17, 29, 9684, and the 
Levites signify those who are in charity and thence in truths generally, 3875, 3877; and by 
their families, by their fathers' houses, denotes as to interior good, and as to inmost good, 
because families denote a general good of which the fathers' house is a particular good, 7833. 

3. From thirty years old and upward even until fifty years old, denotes as to quality with respect 
to truths leading to good and truths confirmed in good, because by thirty years old is denoted 
"somewhat of combat," and thus the state of truth leading to good, 5335, 9274, and because 
fifty years old denotes fullness as to truths which are also full of goods, and thus a confirmed 
state as to truths, 2141; and all that enter into the service, or rather warfare, to do the work of 
the tent of meeting, denotes in order that they may perform their functions in regard to the 
worship of the Lord and the work of salvation, because by entering into warfare is denoted 
engaging in combat against evil, 5335, and to do the work of the tent of meeting is to worship 
the Lord in order to promote the heavenly life, and thus the work of salvation, 35403. 

4. This being the service, or work, of the sons of Kohath in the tent of meeting about the most 

holy things, denotes that the functions of those who are in truths in brightness in the spiritual 
heaven, is the cultivation and preservation of the inmost affections of love and charity there, 
because by the sons of Kohath are denoted those who are in truths from charity in brightness, 
ver. 2; by the tent of meeting are denoted the spiritual and celestial things of the Lord's 
kingdom, 35403; and by what is "most holy" there, are denoted the inmost affections of love 
and charity, 3210. 

5. By the camp setting forward is denoted a change of state during regeneration, 4236, 8181; by 
Aaron and his sons are denoted celestial love and its truths, 9946, 10017; celestial love and 
charity are inmost moving powers, and the veil denotes inmost appearances of truth, 2576; the 
ark of the testimony denotes the inmost heaven, and thus inmost love, 9485; and the ark being 
covered by the veil both when the camp rested, and during the journeying of the Israelites, 
evidently denotes that inmost appearances of truth protect inmost love, 2576; while the taking 
down of the veil aptly typifies the end of the old state and the beginning of the new state.

67

6. Putting upon the veil a covering of sealskin, denotes the protection of inmost appearances of 
truth by those which are interior, 296, 9471; spreading over it a cloth all of blue, denotes the 
protection of interior truths by such as are exterior, 94663, 9468; and putting in the staves of 
the ark denotes the whole supported and conjoined by truths most external, 9496. 

7. This appears from the signification of Aaron and his sons, as denoting celestial love and its 

truths, 9946; of the table of shewbread as denoting spiritual good derived from celestial good 
in the middle heaven, 10270; of the cloth all of blue as denoting exterior celestial truths, 9868, 
9870; of the dishes, and the spoons, and the bowls, and the cups, as denoting the knowledges 
of interior and exterior celestial good and truth, 9544; and of the continual bread, as denoting 
celestial and spiritual good pre-eminently and continually, 9545; while by "to pour out withal" 
is denoted the influx of good into truths and thence conjunction, 3728, 9780. 

8. Spreading upon them a cloth of scarlet denotes the operation of spiritual good and truth 

internally; and upon this a covering of sealskin, denotes the operation of natural good and truth
externally, 9468, 4922, and putting in the staves thereof, denotes "together with this good and 
truth embodied in action," whereby the spiritual man is prepared to make progress, 9496. 

9. This is seen from the signification of Aaron and his sons as denoting celestial love and the 
truths thence proceeding, 9946, 10017; of the candlestick as denoting the spiritual heaven, 
9548; of the light and the lamp, as denoting truths interior and exterior, 9548; of the tongs and 
snuff-dishes, as denoting truths purificatory and evacuatory, 9572; and of the oil vessels 
thereof with which they minister to it, as denoting truths receptive of good and ministering 
thereto, 3079, 3728. But covering all these things with cloth of blue denotes protection by 
exterior celestial truths, 9868, 9870. 

10. Putting them within a covering of sealskin denotes protection by natural truths grounded in 
good, 9468; and putting the whole upon a frame, or bar, denotes protection by doctrinals 
which support good, 402, 9496. 

11. Putting upon the golden altar a cloth of blue, covering that with a covering of sealskin, and 
putting in the staves thereof, denotes that the inmost worship of the Lord in the spiritual 
heaven, which is worship from charity, is protected in the same way, 9868, 9868, 9870, 9468, 
402, 9496. 

12. Taking all the vessels of the ministry with which they minister in the sanctuary, putting them 
in a cloth of blue, covering that with a covering of sealskin, and putting them on the frame or 
bar, denotes the protection of all ministering scientifics and doctrinals by which the inmost 
worship of the Lord is performed or promoted. 3079, 9868, 9870, 9468, 402, 9496. 

13. Taking away the ashes from the altar, and spreading a purple cloth thereon, denotes that 

celestial good and truth are instrumental in the removal from spiritual worship of all those 
things which have served their purpose, 9946, 10017, 9723, and the retention of which would 
prevent progress; and in protecting that worship itself by the celestial love of good, 9467, 
9868. 

14. By all the vessels of the altar with which they minister about it, the firepans, the fleshhooks 

and the shovels and the basins, all the vessels of the altar, are denoted all things ministering to 
the worship of the Lord, 3079, 9572; by firepans and fleshhooks are denoted things having 
reference to love interior and exterior from the signification of fire and flesh, 934, 574; by 

68

shovels and basins are denoted what has reference to truth interior and exterior, 9724; by 
spreading over these a covering of sealskin is denoted protection by truths grounded in good, 
which are essential also in worship, 9468; and by putting in the staves thereof is denoted good 
and truth embodied in action, whereby the spiritual man is prepared to make progress, 9496. 

15. This appears from considering that Aaron and his sons denote celestial love and its truths, 
9946, 10017; that making an end of covering the sanctuary, and all the furniture of the 
sanctuary, denotes the protection of the true worship of the Lord and all things which minister 
thereto, 2576, 3210, 10340; that the camp setting forward, denotes progress in the spiritual 
life, 4236, 8181; that the sons of Kohath coming to bear the sanctuary, denotes that it is the 
function of the spiritual heaven and the spiritual man to promote such progress, ver. 2; that 
their not touching the sanctuary denotes that they cannot perform the functions proper to those
in celestial love, nor can they realize the celestial things thereof, for that this would cause the 
destruction of their own life of charity, 10130, 2908; and that these things were the burden of 
the sons of Kohath in the tent of meeting, denotes that, nevertheless, spiritual love ministers to
celestial love in the worship of the Lord and the work of salvation, ver. 2, 6390, 10242. 

16. This is true, because by Eleazar is denoted spiritual truth immediately proceeding from 

celestial love, 9946, 10017; by the oil is denoted celestial good, 886; by the light is denoted 
truth, 3195; by the sweet incense is denoted what is grateful and acceptable in worship, 9475; 
by the meal offering is denoted worship from charity, 2177; by the anointing oil is denoted that
which promotes the conjunction of goodness and truth, 9954; by the tabernacle is denoted 
everything in general having relation to worship; and by the sanctuary with all things in it, 
everything in particular, as well as all things ministering to worship, 3210. 

17. This is evident, because by Jehovah is denoted the Divine Being as to His love, 2001; by 

speaking is denoted influx, 2951; by Moses is represented Divine Truth, or the Word, 7010; by
Aaron is denoted Divine Good, 9946; and by saying is denoted perception, 1791, 1822. 

18. Not cutting off the tribe of the families of the Kohathites from among the Levites, denotes that
all those who are in charity and the faith of charity, for the uses just described, are not to be 
separated from those in charity generally, chap 3:17, 29, 9684, 3875, 3877, 5302. 

19. Doing thus to them in order that they may live and not die, denotes "in order that they may 
enjoy their specific good, without loss of spiritual life," 290, 2908; approaching to the most 
holy things, denotes when the spiritual minister in the holy worship from celestial love, 10021,
3210; Aaron and his sons denote celestial love and its truths, 9946, 10017, and their going in 
to the holy place denotes support by the influx of celestial love and its truths in worship, 9903;
and Aaron appointing to the sons of Kohath their service and their burden, denotes that the 
Spiritual receive their love of use internal and external thence, 7038, 6390. 

20. Their not going in to see the sanctuary even for a moment lest they die, denotes that still the 

Spiritual cannot come into the perception of good and truth enjoyed by the Celestial, nor ought
they to aspire after such perception, lest they should lose their own proper life of charity, 9903,
2150, 3210, 2908. 

21. This is evident, because by Jehovah is denoted the Divine Being as to His love, 2001; by 

speaking is denoted influx, 2951; by Moses is represented Divine Truth, or the Word, 7010; 
and by saying is denoted perception, 1791, 1822. 

69

22. Taking the sum of the sons of Gershon by their fathers' houses by their families, denotes that 
those who are in the obscure good which constitutes the internal of the ultimate heaven both 
_as to interior and exterior things, are ordinated and arranged according to their quality, chap 
3:17, 996020, 1463, 10217. 

23. From thirty years old and upward until fifty years old, denotes as to quality with respect to 
truths leading to good and truths con firmed in good, because by thirty years old is denoted 
somewhat of combat, and thus the state of truth leading to good, and because fifty years old 
denotes fullness as to truths which are also full of goods', and thus a confirmed state as to 
truths, 5335, 9274, 2141; and all that enter in to wait upon the service, or warfare, to do the 
work in the tent of meeting, denotes in order that they may perform their function in regard to 
the worship of the Lord and the work of salvation, 5335, 7038, 35403, ver. 3. 

24. This being the service of the families of the Gershonites in serving and bearing burdens, 

denotes that this is the function of those in the internal of the ultimate heaven in the cultivation
of good internal and external, chap 3:17, 7833, 7038, 6390. 

25. The curtains of the tabernacle and the tent of meeting, denote the interior truths of faith which 
belong to those in the second heaven, and the exterior truths of faith which belong to those in 
the internal of the ultimate heaven respectively, 9595, 9615; the first covering named denotes 
external truths, and the covering of sealskin, external good, in the internal of the ultimate 
heaven, 9471, 9632; and the screen for the door of the tent of meeting denotes the appearances
of truth which are the medium between the ultimate heaven and the second, 25766, 9686. 

26. The hangings of the court denote the truths of the ultimate heaven, and in this case of the 
external of that heaven, 9743; the screen for the door of the gate of the court denotes the 
doctrine of the Lord as to truth and as to good, 2356, and the guard lest there should be 
entrance by those not prepared, 9763; it is said "as to truth and as to good," because of the two 
expressions "door" and "gate," 683; which is by the tabernacle and by the altar round about, 
denotes also "as to truth and as to good," in regard to worship, 10242; the cords and the 
instruments of their service denote all inferior truths which minister thereto, 9854, 90113, 
7038; whatever shall be done with them denotes, evidently, some specific use, 9282; and their 
serving therein denotes that by them they worship, 7038. 

27. At the commandment, or according to the mouth, of Aaron and his sons, denotes through the 
influx of celestial good and its truths, which is according to Divine Providence, 8560, 2951, 
9946; the service of the Gershonites denotes the functions of those who are in the obscure 
good of the internal of the ultimate heaven, 7038, chap 3:17; in all their burden and in all their 
service, denotes in every act of external and internal worship, 6390, 7038; and "you shall 
appoint to them in charge all their burden, denotes that thus celestial love and its truths are 
present in things most external, 9946, 5288, 3382, 7038. 

28. This being the service of the families of the sons of the Gershonites in the tent of meeting, 

denotes that these are the functions of those in the obscure good of the ultimate heaven in the 
worship of the Lord and the work of salvation, chap 3:17, 7833, 35403, ver. 3; and their charge
being under the hand of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest, denotes that their ruling motive is 
the love of natural good received from the Lord and expressed with power in natural truth, 
3382, 878, 9812, 725, 9946. 

70

29. The sons of Merari numbered by their families by their fathers' houses, denotes that the 

ordination and arrangement of those in the external of the ultimate heaven is also according to 
exterior and interior good, 10217, chap 3:17, 7854, 7833. 

30. From thirty years old and upward even to fifty years old, denotes with respect to truths leading
to good and truths confirmed in good, because by thirty years old is denoted somewhat of 
combat, and thus the state of truth leading to good, and because fifty years old denotes fullness
as to truths which are also full of goods, and thus a confirmed state as to truths, 5335, 9274, 
2141; and every one that enters into the service to do the work of the tent of meeting, denotes 
with all who perform some function internal or external connected with the worship of the 
Lord and the work of salvation, 5335, 7038, 35403. ver. 3. 

31. This being the charge of their burden according to all their service in the tent of meeting, 

denotes that this is their office according to their function, 3382, 6390, 7038, 35403; and the 
boards of the tabernacle, and the bars thereof, and the pillars thereof and the sockets thereof, 
denote the preservation of the Word in its ultimate form, according to appearances, and of all 
external worship in agreement therewith, involving the preservation of good and truth on the 
ultimate plane, because the boards denote the good which supports heaven, 9634; the bars 
denote the power of good by truths, 4024, 94963; and the pillars and sockets denote the 
ultimate good and truth by which the church is supported, 9757. 

32. The pillars of the court round about and their sockets, denote all the truths by which such 

external worship is supported, 9741, 9757; the pins and the cords denote the conjunction of 
these things with what is internal, and the confirmation of such support and conjunction in 
every sphere as to particulars, 9854, 9777; all their instruments with all their service, denotes 
"those things intellectual and voluntary by means of which the regeneration of man is 
promoted, such as worldly knowledges and merely natural uses," 5948, 5949, 3409, chap 3:36;
and "by name you shall appoint the instruments of the charge of their burden," therefore 
denotes that according to the specific quality of each individual, so shall his office and his uses
be, 144, 3382, 6390. 

33. This being the service of the families of the sons of Merari, denotes that these are functions of 
those in the external of the ultimate heaven, 7833, chap 3:17, 7854, 7038; according to all their

34. By Moses and Aaron and the princes of the congregation are denoted Divine Truth and Divine 
Good, as expressed in the primary truths of the church, 7010, 9946, 1482; by numbering are 
denoted ordination and arrangement, 10217; and by the sons of the Kohathites according to 
their families and their fathers' houses, are denoted those who constitute the middle or spiritual
heaven as to externals and internals, ver. 2, 9684, chap 3:17, 7833.

71

36. Those that were numbered of them by their families being two thousand seven hundred and 
fifty, denotes that their quality according lo ordination and arrangement is fullness of the 
conjunction of good and truth, a holy state according to good, and fullness as to truths, 
because numbering denotes ordination and arrangement, 10217; by their families denotes 
quality as to varieties of good, 7833; two denotes the conjunction of good and truth, hence two
thousand does the same, 5194; seven denotes a holy state as to good, and hence so does seven 
hundred, 716; and fifty denotes fullness as to truths, 2141.

leading to good to those who are in truths confirmed in good, ver. 30; and every one that 
entered into the service for work in the tent of meeting, denotes those who perform some 
function in the worship of the Lord and the work of salvation, ver. 30. 

44. Those that were numbered of them by their families being three thousand and two hundred, 

denotes that their quality according to their general principle of external good, is completeness

72

as to good of their degree, and the conjunction of truth therewith, 10217, ver. 29, 7833, 10492,
5194. 

45. These being they that were numbered of the families of the sons of Merari, denotes the 

ordination and arrangement of those In the external of the ultimate heaven, 10217, ver. 29; 
whom Moses and Aaron numbered, denotes by Divine Truth and Divine Good, 7010, 9946; 
and according to the commandment of the Lord by the hand of Moses, denotes by influx of 
Divine Good from the Lord operating by Divine Truth, 5486, 878, 7010. 

46. All those that were numbered of the Levites, whom Moses and Aaron and the princes of Israel 
numbered by their families, by their fathers' houses, denotes the quality of all those who are 
ordinated and arranged by Divine Truth and Divine Good, and the co-operation of the primary 
truths of the church, or those in such truths, and who are in charity according to externals and

48. Those that were numbered of them being eight thousand and five hundred and four score, 

denotes that their quality is a new state of life through regeneration, fullness as to truths and 
fullness of conjunction both as to good and truth mutually and reciprocally, 10217, 2044, 
10253, 7284. It is to be remembered here that two forties, or four score, involves fullness of 
victory in temptation, and thence fullness of reciprocal conjunction because the fundamental 
number two denotes conjunction, and forty denotes temptations, 5194. 730.

49. Being numbered according to the commandment of the Lord, or according to the mouth or 
word of the Lord, denotes that this ordination and arrangement is entirely from the Lord by 
Divine Truth, 10217, ver. 27; by the hand of Moses denotes by Divine Truth in its power, 878,

arrangement are the effect of influx and correspondence, wherein is exhibited the power of 
Divine Truth, or the Divine Omnipotence, 10217, 7010, 5486. 

DISCUSSION

We may commence our review of this chapter by referring to two little matters, one connected with the 
numbering of the Levites, and the other with the age at which they were required to begin their service 
in the Tabernacle. In ver. 39 of the last chapter it is said that the number of Levites was exactly twenty-
two thousand; this was two hundred and seventy-three less than the total number of firstborn male 
Israelites; and each of the two hundred and seventy-three was required to pay a redemption price of 
five shekels to Aaron, because there were no Levites to represent them. But it appears, also, that the 
actual sum total of the Levites, obtained by adding together the full numbers of Gershonites, 
Kohathites, and Merarites as given in vers. 22, 28 and 34 respectively, was twenty-two thousand three 
hundred; and commentators have had differences of opinion as to how this discrepancy is to be 

73

accounted for. Some suppose, therefore, that by a mistake in the manuscripts, or in the printing of the 
Hebrew, the number of the Kohathites is given as eight thousand six hundred instead of eight thousand 
three hundred; and others consider that the odd three hundred Levites were the firstborn males of that 
tribe, who already belonged to the Lord according to the general law concerning the firstborn (Exod 
13:2, 12, 13), and that, therefore, they could not be counted as Levites who should stand for Israelite 
firstborn. And in this opinion we are told that most Jewish and Christian commentators agree. And 
although neither of these suppositions may be really correct, yet we are disposed to think the second is 
so, because there must have been a certain proportion of firstborn males among the Levites, and it is 
reasonable to suppose that they were the odd three hundred; and, besides, if this had not been the case, 
those Israelites who were required to pay the redemption money would have had just cause to complain
that the number of Levites was actually in excess of the firstborn males among the Israelites. Moreover,
the correspondence of the twenty-two thousand is exactly according to the requirement of the internal 
sense, and so, also, is the number two hundred and seventy-three, and the number of shekels paid.

But now with regard to the age at which the Levites were appointed to commence their service, we find
that in the last chapter it is said to have been from thirty years, and in this the same, while yet in chap. 
viii. it is said to have been at twenty-five years; and this is explained by most commentators by 
considering that they may have been enjoined to commence their lighter duties at the age of twenty-
five, but their heavier work not until the age of thirty. And, also, we shall see again, when we come to 
study chapter viii., that the correspondence of the number twenty-five "is harmonious with the series in 
the internal sense there.

Taking now the first section of our chapter, let us consider its particular teaching. It describes the 
functions of those in the spiritual heaven, as distinguished from the functions of those in charity 
generally. For it must be clear to the reflecting mind that in each heaven specific uses are performed for
the benefit of the whole, and that, indeed, each angel has his specific function. Uses are those things 
which each is able to do for the good of all, and which all together are able to do for the good of each; 
and thus there is no selfishness in the love of uses. But the uses of those who are in charity generally 
are various according to the heaven to which they may belong, while the uses of those who are in 
charity in the spiritual heaven have a relation, as it is said, to the most holy things (ver. 4), that is, the 
spiritual heaven supports and protects the celestial heaven, from which it derives its life and activity. 
And as Aaron and his sons belonged to the family of the Kohathites, and yet were distinguished from 
them as priests, we see how they could at the same time represent those of the spiritual heaven and the 
celestial, while the rest of the Kohathites could only represent the spiritual heaven, and could not 
perform the duties of those represented by the priests (ver. 15).

Next we have to consider carefully the order of the various coverings, and to observe the guiding 
principle, namely, that exterior things were signified by those which covered, 94682. For a term often 
has its meaning modified, according to the position in which it occurs. Thus, for example, the covering 
of sealskin, in ver. 6, denotes interior appearances of truth and good, but in ver. 8, exterior, or natural 
truth and good; and so, again, the cloth of scarlet in ver. 8 denotes spiritual truth and good, 49224, and 
we learn in another place that it denotes not only this, but the external good of the celestial kingdom or 
church, or mutual love, or celestial truth, which different meanings may seem inconsistent, unless we 
observe the connection in which the term is applied as well as the position in which it is placed. And 
besides this, it may be added that, from a certain point of view, what is external in the celestial heaven 
is internal in the spiritual heaven, for mutual love is really charity as it is manifested in the former, 
while spiritual good is also charity as manifested in the latter. These remarks, therefore, have been 

74

made, not only to account for the apparent difficulty in respect to the part of our chapter we are now 
studying, but also with regard to similar things in the Writings generally.

But having seen what is the particular use which the spiritual man and the spiritual heaven perform 
with regard to the celestial, as represented by the Kohathites, we have to notice one or two interesting 
points about them which yet remain. It is clear from the literal sense that they were distinguished from 
the other two divisions of the tribe of Levi in a particular way, because from them sprang Aaron and 
Moses, but it is not so evident, in that sense, why it is said they were not to be cut off from the Levites. 
But the series of the internal sense shows the reason, to which it may be added that a great practical 
lesson is here involved. For the man of the church is thereby cautioned that he ought not to separate 
intelligence and love in himself, or, in other words, faith from charity. Now we know this has been 
done doctrinally in former churches; but, also, we ought to know that we are disposed to do it in our 
daily life, by sometimes being too much swayed by our reasoning powers, and at others by our 
impulses. Let us, therefore, carefully guard against this. And, on the other hand, let us encourage the 
influx of good affections, as represented by Aaron and his sons going in and appointing to each of the 
Kohathites his duty, being well assured that good work done from the promptings of love and guided 
by a discriminating enlightenment, such as is represented in this series by the office of Eleazar the 
priest, is really the best kind of work, and promotes the making perfect of the spiritual man so that he 
gains, in the end, his true heavenly quality, which is, as we have seen, "fullness of the conjunction of 
good and truth; a holy state, according to good; and fullness as to truths" (ver. 36); and in him 
adequately developed.

And in proceeding to study what relates to the other two divisions of the Levites in this chapter, we 
notice in the first place that they properly represent the Internal and External of the ultimate heaven 
respectively, or the man of the external church; and it is well to observe here that their functions, like 
those of the spiritual man, include a capacity to understand, and, by their obedience, to support and 
preserve the holy truths and affections of those in a higher heaven than their own. And thus we find that
it was the duty of the Gershonites, in the journeyings of the Israelites, to carry the curtains of the 
tabernacle, as well as those of the tent of meeting, these signifying, not any of the truths relating to their
own degree, but rather those referring to the spiritual heaven; while, in the same way, it was the duty of
the Merarites to carry the boards of the tabernacle, its bars, its pillars, and its sockets, which, taken 
altogether, denote what relates to the good and truth of the ultimate sense of the Word, and thus to 
something higher than merely natural truth or science. Now, this wonderful capacity of man generally, 
that his perceptions of what is good and true and beautiful on that account, shall be higher than his state
as to spiritual life, is of the Divine Mercy in order that he may be reformed and regenerated, and so 
advance into the realization of his inmost heavenly state. And now, as in the case of the middle heaven, 
there is influx from the celestial heaven, so in that of the ultimate; also, in order to show that the Lord's 
life, as it flows into man through all the heavens, and consequently through all the degrees of the 
human mind, puts on a quality according to the degree and the state, we are taught that in each heaven 
there is a distinct governing principle represented respectively by Aaron, Eleazar and Ithamar. For 
celestial love, or love to the Lord, is denoted by Aaron; spiritual love, or charity to the neighbour, is 
signified by Eleazar; and natural love front the Lord, as manifested in obedience, is represented by 
Ithamar. And, moreover, all duties assigned to the Gershonites and Merarites are representative of the 
uses of external worship, and the description shows the importance of it. Primarily, by external worship
is meant the worship of a good life as the outward expression of internal worship, or of genuine love 
and faith; but in a secondary sense that also is called external worship which consists in the prayers and
praises accompanied by the reading of the Word and by instruction therefrom, which takes place in the 

75

sanctuary on the Sabbath; and this, indeed, ought to be attended to with care as the means of 
stimulating to a good life, and also as the natural effect of it. Thus, then, those things which formed the 
work of the Merarites about the tabernacle and the tent of meeting, and in connection with the moving 
of the Israelites from one place to another, had, as it were, a double representation.

It now only remains, therefore, in order to conclude our notes on this chapter, to say a little on the 
quality of the external church, as expressed correspondentially by the numbers of the Gershonites and 
Merarites. That quality is conjunction with the Lord through the internal church, after a full course of 
temptations, resulting in the complete and perfect life. And particularly here we desire again to 
intensify the thought, that this conjunction, with the means by which it is acquired, and the result, as 
realized in a perfectly harmonious state, is effected in the proprium, or proper life, of the regenerated 
man. Being, in short, an individual distinct from the Lord, and thus finite, and yet being a continual 
receptacle of life from the Lord, he must for ever act as from himself. And it is therefore right for us to 
consider carefully the distinction between the corrupt proprium into which we are born, which is 
essentially selfishness, and the heavenly proprium, which we receive from the Lord, and which, 
therefore, is not selfishness, but the love of being useful in such a particular way, that no other human 
being will ever be capable of supplying our place in the grand order of the heavens. There is a sense, 
then, in which we may profitably reflect that heaven cannot do without us, in order that we may be 
stimulated In our heavenly life.

It would be a great mistake if, when we thought that of ourselves we are nothing but evil, humility 
required us to include in the thought the conception that, as individuals distinct from the Lord, we are 
nothing but evil; for if that were true, then heaven itself would be nothing but evil; and, indeed, every 
created thing, as being distinct from the Lord, would be nothing but evil. But this is evidently absurd, 
since creation is from the Lord, and therefore everything created is nothing but good (Gen 1:31). But 
what humility requires of us is, to acknowledge that we become nothing but evil by actually ascribing 
our life to ourselves, because it appears to be our own by virtue of our individuality. Evil is therefore 
entirely the result of the abuse of the freedom which our individuality, as human beings, carries with it; 
and since we have all thus abused our liberty, and hence have needed to be regenerated, and it is not 
possible for any state in which we have been ever to be altogether obliterated, we may see why and 
how it is true, that even heaven itself is not pure in the sight of the Lord, while yet our fully regenerated
life is not an impure life; or, in other words, why we are nothing but evil as to our merely natural 
proprium, and yet may have a new and heavenly proprium from the Lord which is not evil, and which, 
in its first formation with us, is the ultimate truth of the Word of the Lord, denoted by a rib built into a 
woman, 151. Let us study this subject well, and then we shall see that, from its beginning, our new life, 
by regeneration, is not the selfish life or proprium, either as to its internal or external degree; and that 
when regeneration is completed, the external man, on that account, becomes fully conjoined with the 
internal. And do not let us imagine that the rib built into a woman in us, is the selfish life regenerated, 
for this cannot be, although "to build signifies to raise up that which is fallen," because what is fallen 
and what is raised up is the man himself as to his individuality, which remains, notwithstanding 
regeneration.

Numbers Chapter 5

SUMMARY OF THE SPIRITUAL SENSE

1. The man of the church is instructed that he must reject from the heavenly life every tendency 
disposing him to profane the truth, falsify it, or defile it by contact with any natural affection 
void of spiritual life, vers. 1-4. 

2. Concerning offences against the Divine Law through ignorance or weakness, vers. 5-10. 

3. On an offence against good through ignorance of the truth; the illegitimate conjunction of 
falsity with good; the disturbance of the internal man in consequence; investigation from 
Divine Good; the process by which innocence or guilt is discovered; and the results of guilt or 
innocence, vers. 11-31. 

THE CONTENTS OF EACH VERSE

1. And the LORD spoke to Moses, 

1. There is revelation from the Lord by Divine Truth 

saying, 

giving the perception, 

2. Command the children of Israel, that
they put out of the camp every leper, 
and every one that has an issue, and 
whoever is unclean by the dead: 

3. Both male and female shall you put 
out, without the camp shall you put 
them; that they defile not their camp,
in the midst whereof I dwell. 

4. And the children of Israel did so, and
put them out without the camp: as 
the LORD spoke to Moses, so did the 
children of Israel. 

2. That the man of the Spiritual Church, by the influx
of Divine Good and the power of Divine Truth, 
must reject from himself every tendency disposing
him to profane the truth, falsify it, or defile it by 
contact with any natural affection void of spiritual 
life. 

3. And this must be done both with regard to falsity 
and evil; for these are to be separated from the 
heavenly life, and rejected to hell, because they 
destroy heavenly order which is entirely from the 
Lord, and in which the Lord has His abode with 
man inmostly. 

4. And the man of the true church is obedient to the 
dictate of Divine Truth, and entirely rejects these 
evil things, because he is able to do this from 
Divine Good by Divine Truth, which he 
acknowledges to be from the Lord. 

5. And the Lord spoke to Moses, 

5. And further, there is revelation from the Lord by 

saying, 

Divine Truth giving the perception, 

77

6. Speak to the children of Israel, When
a man or woman shall commit any 
sin that men commit, to do a trespass
against the LORD, and that soul be 
guilty; 

7. Then they shall confess their sin 

which they have done: and he shall 
make restitution for his guilt in full, 
and add to it the fifth part thereof, 
and give it to him in respect of 
whom he has been guilty. 

8. But if the man have no kinsman to 
whom restitution may be made for 
the guilt, the restitution for guilt 
which is made to the LORD shall be 
the priest's; besides the ram of the 
atonement, whereby atonement shall 
be made for him. 

9. And every heave offering of all the 
holy things of the children of Israel, 
which they present to the priest, shall
be his. 

6. That on every violation of the Divine Law, to 

which the man of the church is prone, either from 
ignorance or weakness as to good, even though it 
may be only an offence against the truth and not 
against charity, and yet there is consciousness of 
guilt; 

7. Confession shall be made before the Lord from the
internal man; and the truth shall be restored, which
has been taken away by misunderstanding, in all 
fullness, and, at the same time, it must be 
acknowledged to be from the Lord through 
remains, and that it properly appertains to the 
internal man. 

8. But if the internal man be not opened, with him 
who should make restitution thereto, and yet 
acknowledgement is made to the Lord from the 
principle of good, then guilt is removed 
nevertheless, on account of this good, and of the 
good of innocence and charity by which the 
external man is reconciled with the internal and 
thus with the Lord. 

9. For the internal man is vivified and renewed by 

influx from the Lord, because good is 
acknowledged to be from Him, 

10. And every man's hallowed things 

10. But this only when the interior and external man 

shall be his: whatever any man gives
the priest, it shall be his. 

cooperate in such acknowledgement. 

11. And the LORD spoke to Moses, 

11. Again there is revelation from the Lord by Divine 

saying, 

Truth giving the perception, 

12. Speak to the children of Israel, and 

say to them, If any man's wife go 
aside, and commit a trespass against 
him, 

13. And a man lie with her carnally, and 

it be hid from the eyes of her 
husband, and be kept close, and she 
be defiled, and there be no witness 
against her, neither she be taken in 
the act; 

12. By illustration to the man of the Spiritual Church, 
who sees, that when the principle of good also is 
violated through ignorance of the truth, 

13. And through illegitimate conjunction with internal 
falsity; and yet the internal man is unconscious 
thereof, through deficiency of perception, and 
good is adulterated, innocently and at the same 
time ignorantly; 

78

14. And the spirit of jealousy come upon
him, and he be jealous of his wife, 
and she be defiled: or if the spirit of 
jealousy come upon him, and he be 
jealous of his wife, and she be not 
defiled: 

15. Then shall the man bring his wife to 

the priest, and shall bring her 
oblation for her, the tenth part of an 
ephah of barley meal; he shall pour 
no oil upon it, nor put frankincense 
thereon; for it is a meal offering of 
jealousy, a meal offering of 
memorial, bringing iniquity to 
remembrance. 

14. While still the life of the internal man is disturbed 
through lack of correspondence in the external, 
and there is the adulteration of good; or if the 
disturbance arise, not from lack of correspondence,
but from deficiency as to truths; 

15. Then still there is communication with the internal
man as to good, and the acknowledgement of the 
Lord from the good of truth through the operation 
of the Lord by remains; but there can be no 
reception of the genuine good of love, or of the 
genuine truth thereof in worship, because 
conjunction with the Lord is interrupted either by 
the adulteration of good, or by the lack of truths; 
and there is consciousness of evil or of error. 

16. And the priest shall bring her near, 
and set her before the LORD: 

16. In which case, however, there is still conjunction 
with the Lord by good ruling in the inmost, 

17. And the priest shall take holy water 
in an earthen vessel; and of the dust 
that is on the floor of the tabernacle 
the priest shall take, and put it into 
the water: 

18. And the priest shall set the woman 
before the LORD, and let the hair of 
the woman's head go loose, and put 
the meal offering of memorial in her 
hands, which is the meal offering of 
jealousy: and the priest shall have in 
his hand the water of bitterness that 
causes the curse: 

19. And the priest shall cause her to 

swear, and shall say to the woman, If
no man have lien with you, and if 
you have not gone aside to 
uncleanness, being under your 
husband, be you free from this water 
of bitterness that causes the curse: 

20. But if you have gone aside, being 
under your husband, and if you be 
defiled, and some man have lien 
with you besides your husband: 

17. Although truth thence derived is vitiated through 
contamination with corrupted good, which causes 
condemnation in the external man; 

18. Yet there is acknowledgement that good is entirely
from the Lord, from whom it is discovered that 
evil has corrupted the truth in the natural mind, 
while yet there is the good of truth also from the 
Lord, even though there is suspicion, and the 
appearance that truth separated from good 
condemns and causes aversion. 

19. And if there be confirmation from good that there 
is no adulteration of good nor any profanation of 
truth through falsity from evil, then there is 
deliverance from the falsity of evil which causes 
aversion from the Lord. 

20. But when there is not only the profanation of truth,
but also the adulteration of good by falsity from 
evil, 

79

21. Then the priest shall cause the 

woman to swear with the oath of 
cursing, and the priest shall say to 
the woman, The LORD make you a 
curse and an oath among your 
people, when the LORD does make 
your thigh to fall away, and your 
belly to swell; 

22. And this water that causes the curse 
shall go into your bowels, and make 
your belly to swell, and your thigh to
fall away: and the woman shall say, 
Amen, Amen. 

21. Then there is confirmation of the evil state, even 
of aversion from the Lord both as to good and 
truth, because the conjunction of good with truth, 
and the reciprocal conjunction of truth with good 
is violated, 

22. So that there is aversion from truth adulterated 

with evil; and there can be no longer the reciprocal
conjunction of good with truth, because of such 
confirmation. 

23. And the priest shall write these 

curses in a book, and he shall blot 
them out into the water of bitterness:

23. And thus there is the confirmation of evil in the 
interior memory of the corrupted man so that the 
truth can no longer be violated. 

24. And he shall make the woman drink 
the water of bitterness that causes the
curse: and the water that causes the 
curse shall enter into her and 
become bitter. 

25. And the priest shall take the meal 
offering of jealousy out of the 
woman's hand, and shall wave the 
meal offering before the LORD, and 
bring it to the altar: 

26. And the priest shall take an handful 
of the meal offering, as the memorial
thereof, and burn it upon the altar, 
and afterward shall make the woman
drink the water. 

27. And when he has made her drink the 
water, then it shall come to pass, if 
she be defiled, and have committed a
trespass against her husband, that the
water that causes the curse shall 
enter into her and become bitter, and 
her belly shall swell, and her thigh 
shall fall away: and the woman shall 
be a curse among her people. 

24. And truth contaminated with evil which causes 

aversion, is appropriated, whereby the truth itself 
becomes distasteful. 

25. But still there may be the appearance of the 
reception of the good of truth externally, of 
vivification from the Lord, and of genuine 
worship, 

26. And also of the conjunction of exterior good with 
interior, and the appropriation of truths as if from 
good. 

27. But in the case of such apparent appropriation of 
truth, when nevertheless there is the adulteration 
of good by falsity and the perversion of truth by 
evil, then the reception of truth shall be distasteful;
there can be no reciprocal conjunction of truth 
with good; nor any conjunction of good with truth;
and there is complete aversion from truth. 

80

28. And if the woman be not defiled, but
be clean; then she shall be free, and 
shall conceive seed. 

28. But when, indeed, there is no adulteration of good 
but purity of life, then is there genuine freedom 
and the fructification of good and the 
multiplication of genuine truths. 

29. This is the law of jealousy, when a 

29. And this is the law of life, when there is no 

wife, being under her husband, goes 
aside, and is defiled; 

legitimate conjunction of good with truth, but on 
the contrary the falsification of truth and the 
adulteration of good. 

30. Or when the spirit of jealousy comes
upon a man, and he be jealous over 
his wife; then shall he set the woman
before the LORD, and the priest shall 
execute upon her all this law. 

30. And consequently the disturbance of the 

conjunction between the internal and external man;
and then shall the state of the external man be 
tested by Divine Good, and its true state be made 
manifest; 

31. And the man shall be free from 

iniquity, and that woman shall bear 
her iniquity. 

31. So that the truth may not be violated, when evil 
has been confirmed by conjunction with internal 
falsity. 

REFERENCES AND NOTES

1. This is evident, because by Jehovah is denoted the Divine Being as to His love, 2001; by 

speaking is denoted influx, 2951; by Moses is represented Divine Truth, or the Word, 7010; 
and by saying is denoted perception, 1791, 1822. 

2. Commanding the children of Israel, denotes influx from the Lord by Divine Truth with the 

man of the Spiritual Church, 5486, 3654, 7010; putting out of the camp every leper, denotes 
the rejection of every tendency to profane the truth, 10038, 6963; also one that has an issue, 
denotes one who falsifies the truth, 10130; and one who is unclean by the dead, denotes one 
who defiles the truth by contact with any affection void of spiritual life, 390010. 

3. Putting out of the camp both male and female, denotes the rejection from heaven and the 

church of those defiled by both falsity and evil, because male denotes truth, and female, good, 
and therefore, in the opposite sense, falsity and evil, 725; and "that they defile not their camp 
in the midst of which I dwell," denotes lest they destroy heavenly order, which is entirely from
the Lord, and in which the Lord has His abode with man inmostly, 4236, 10130, 200, 10153. 

4. By the children of Israel doing so, is denoted that the man of the true church is obedient to the 

dictate of Divine Truth, 3654, 5755; putting the lepers and other unclean persons without the 
camp, denotes the entire rejection of those evil things, 10038; and by as the Lord spoke to 
Moses, so the children of Israel doing, is denoted that the man of the church is able to do this 
from Divine Good by Divine Truth, which he acknowledges to be from the Lord, 2001, 2951, 
7010, 5755. 

5. This is evident, because by Jehovah is denoted the Divine Being as to His love, 2001; by 

speaking is denoted influx, 2951; by Moses is represented Divine Truth, or the Word, 7010; 
and by saying is denoted perception, 1791, 1822. 

81

6. Speaking to the children of Israel, denotes instruction by Divine Truth, 2951; a man or a 

woman committing a sin that men commit, denotes the violation of the Divine Law to which 
the man of the church is prone, 5076, 731; doing a trespass against the Lord, denotes a sin 
either from ignorance or weakness, 9156; and the soul being guilty, clearly denotes the 
consciousness of guilt, 3400. 

7. Confessing the sin that they have done, denotes that confession shall be made before the Lord 

from the internal man, 3880, 8388; making restitution for his guilt in full, denotes the 
restitution of the truth, which had been taken away by misunderstanding, in all fullness, 9032, 
9087; adding the fifth part, denotes that the truth by which amendment is made must be 
acknowledged to be from the Lord through remains, 649, 5291, 10227; and giving it to him in 
respect of whom he has been guilty, denotes that the truth properly appertains to the internal 
man, who makes the confession of guilt, 10227. 

8. By the kinsman to whom restitution is to be made, is denoted the Lord, not only as the 

deliverer, vindicator, or redeemer, but also the Lord as requiring restitution, or amendment of 
life by repentance, by His operation in the internal man, 6281, 9069; and hence not having a 
kinsman to receive restitution, denotes not being conscious of the Lord's operation in the 
internal man, or not having the internal man opened, but being only in natural good; by 
restitution made to the Lord, is denoted amendment through the work of repentance, from this 
good, 9087, 9088; by the restitution being the priest's, is denoted the acknowledgement of the 
Lord from good, 10227, 9946; and by the ram of atonement, whereby atonement is made for 
him, is denoted the removal of guilt nevertheless, on account of this good, and also on account
of the good of innocence and charity in the internal man, by which the external man is 
reconciled with the internal and thus with the Lord, Lev 5:14-16, 9156, 10042. 

9. Every heave offering of all the holy things of the children of Israel which they present to the 
priest being his, denotes that the internal man, with the spiritual, is vivified and renewed by 
influx from the Lord when good is acknowledged to be from Him, because the children of 
Israel denote those of the Spiritual Church, and not of the Celestial, 3654; because the heave 
offering with them, denotes the operation of the Lord's life inmostly, and the wave offering the
same operation interiorly, and therefore the result is illustration, and not perception as with the 
Celestial, 10093, and because the heave offering being given to the priest, denotes that internal
good is acknowledged to be from the Lord, 10227. 

10. Every man's hallowed things being the priest's, denotes acknowledgement by the interior man 
that all good and truth are from the Lord; and whatever any man gives to the priest being his, 
denotes acknowledgement by the external man that all good and truth are from the Lord, 683, 
8088, 10227. 

11. This is evident, because by Jehovah is denoted the Divine Being as to His love, 2001; by 

speaking is denoted influx, 2951; by Moses is represented Divine Truth, or the Word, 7010; 
and by saying is denoted perception, 1791, 1822. 

12. Speaking to the children of Israel, and saying to them, denotes illustration to the man of the 

Spiritual Church who sees, 2619; and a man's wife going aside and committing a trespass 
against him, denotes the violation of good through ignorance of the truth, because by a wife is 
denoted good, 915., and by a trespass, is denoted a sin against the truth of faith, 9156, besides 
which the man in this case signifies truth, 915, 246614. 

82

13. A man lying with the woman carnally, denotes illegitimate conjunction with infernal falsity, 
246614, 1369; it being hidden from the eyes of her husband, denotes that the internal man is 
unconscious, thereof, since the husband signifies the internal man, 915, 158, 6721, 2148; it 
being kept close, denotes deficiency of perception, 6721, 683; being defiled, denotes that good
is adulterated, 246614; no witness against her, denotes innocently, 4197; and her not being 
taken in the act, denotes ignorantly, because to have been caught in the act would have 
denoted the discovery of the state of evil by the force of the truth as is evident.

14. By the spirit of jealousy coming upon the husband, is denoted the disturbance of the internal 

man through zeal for good, 8875, 158; by his being jealous of his wife, is denoted through the 
non-correspondence of the external, 160; his wife being defiled, denotes the adulteration of 
good, and thus, clearly non-correspondence with internal, 246614; again by the spirit of 
jealousy coming upon the husband, is denoted the disturbance of the internal man, 5875, 158; 
and by the wife not being defiled, is denoted no lack of correspondence, but deficiency as to 
truths with the internal, because, in this case, the husband was in error, 246614, 158. 

15. The man bringing his wife to the priest, denotes that still there is communication with the 

internal man as to good, 158, 160, 9946; bringing her oblation for her, namely, barley meal, 
denotes the acknowledgement of the Lord through the good of truth, 349, 10227, 7602, 4335; 
the tenth of an ephah, denotes the Lord's operation by remains, 576, 8468; no oil nor 
frankincense, denotes no reception of the genuine good of love nor of the genuine truth 
thereof, 10137; a meal offering of jealousy, denotes the interruption of the worship of the Lord
by the adulteration of good, 8875, 246614; and a meal offering of memorial bringing iniquity 
to remembrance, denotes the interruption of worship by lack of truths, and consciousness of 
evil or error, ver. 14, 6888, 8620. 

16. The priest bringing her near, and setting her before the Lord, denotes still conjunction with the 

Lord by good ruling in the inmost, 9946, 223, 9378. 

17. By taking holy water, is denoted the application of truth derived from good, 2702, 8042; an 

earthen vessel, in this case, denotes corrupted external good, 5948, 10105; and putting the dust
nto the water denotes condemnation on that account, 249. 

18. The priest setting the woman before the Lord, denotes the acknowledgement that good is 

entirely from the Lord, 9946, 223, 9378; letting her hair go loose, denotes the discovery that 
evil has corrupted the truth in the natural mind, 33011; putting the meal offering of memorial 
into her hands, denotes that the good of truth also is from the Lord, 9946, ver. 15; the meal 
offering of jealousy denotes even though there is suspicion, 8875, 158, 6888; and the priest 
having in his hand the water of bitterness that causes the curse, denotes the manifestation or 
outward appearance that good separated from truth causes aversion, ver. 17, 379. 

19. The priest causing her to swear, denotes confirmation from good, 2842; saying to the woman, 
denotes the thought of such confirmation, 2506; no man having lien with the woman, denotes 
no adulteration of good, 2466"; not having gone aside to uncleanness, being under her 
husband, denotes no profanation of truth through falsity from evil, 6836, 915, 10130; and 
being free from the water of bitterness causing the curse, denotes deliverance from the falsity 
of evil which causes aversion from the Lord, ver. 17. 

83

20. Going aside, being under a husband, and being defiled, denotes when there is not only the 
profanation of truth but also the adulteration of good by falsity from evil, 246614, ver. 19,

21. Causing the woman to swear with the oath of cursing, denotes confirmation of the evil state, 

even of aversion from the Lord both as to good and truth, 2842, vers. 17, 19; the priest saying 
to the woman, denotes the dictate of Divine Truth from Divine Good, concerning the evil state,
9946, 7291; "The Lord make you a curse and an oath among your people," denotes aversion 
and confirmation in evil, 379, 2842, 683; and making the thigh to fall away and the belly to 
swell, denotes the violation of the conjunction of good with truth, and of the reciprocal 
conjunction of truth with good, 3021, 247-248, 3911. Observe here also that the falling of the 
thigh, and the swelling of the belly, aptly denote the cessation of the true heavenly life, and the
increase of the merely sensual life, 2761, 1585. 

22. The water that causes the curse going into the bowels, denotes aversion from the truth 

adulterated with evil in the natural degree, ver. 17, 379, 3911; the belly swelling, and the thigh 
falling, denotes no longer the reciprocal conjunction of truth with good, and the conjunction of
good with truth, ver. 21; and the woman saying "Amen, Amen," denotes because of such 
confirmation in evil and falsity, as appears from the meaning of the word Amen, which is 
truth, 683.

23. The priest writing these curses in a book, denotes that thus there is the confirmation of evil in 
the interior memory of the corrupted man, 8620; and his blotting them out in the water of 
bitterness, denotes evidently, that the truth can no longer be violated-by those who are thus 
averted from it, ver. 17, 379, 731, 10505. 

24. Making the woman drink of the water of bitterness, denotes that truth contaminated with evil, 

which causes aversion, is appropriated, vers. 17, 18, 3168; and it entering into her and 
becoming bitter, denotes that thus the truth itself becomes distasteful, vers. 17, 18. 

25. The priest taking the meal offering of jealousy out of the woman's hand, denotes that still there
may be the appearance of the reception of the good of truth externally, ver. 15; waving the 
meal offering before the Lord, denotes vivification from Him, 10089; and bringing it to the 
altar, denotes the appearance of genuine worship, 4S41-

26. The priest taking a handful as the memorial, and burning it upon the altar, denotes, the 

apparent conjunction of exterior good with interior, 9946, 878, 10053, 10055, ver. 15; and 
making the woman drink the water denotes the appropriation of truths as if from good, ver. 24.

27. It coming to pass when she drank the water, denotes a successive state, 4979; if she be defiled 
and have committed a trespass against her husband, denotes if there should be the adulteration 
of good by falsity, and the perversion of truth by evil, 246614, 9156; the water entering into her
and becoming bitter, denotes that the reception of the truth is distasteful, vers. 17, 18; her belly
swelling and her thigh falling away, denote that there can be no reciprocal conjunction of truth 
with good, nor any conjunction of good with truth, ver. 21; and the woman being a curse 
among her people, denotes that there is complete aversion from truth, 379, 1259. 

28. The woman not being defiled, denotes if there is no adulteration of good, 246614; being clean, 

denotes a state of purity, 4545; being free, denotes genuine spiritual freedom, 892; and 

84

conceiving seed, denotes the fructification of good, and the multiplication of genuine truths, 
1910, 913. 

29. This being the law of jealousy, when a wife being under her husband, goes aside and is 

defiled, denotes that this is the law of life when there is no legitimate conjunction of good with
truth, but, on the contrary, the falsification of truth and the adulteration of good, 2634, 246614, 
6836, 915, 10130. 

30. The spirit of jealousy coming upon a man, and his being jealous of his wife, denotes the 
disturbance of the conjunction between the internal and external man, ver. 14; setting the 
woman before the Lord, denotes that the state of the external man is tested by Divine Good, 
9946, 223, 9378; and the priest executing upon her all this law, denotes that from Divine Good
the true state of the case is made manifest by Divine Truth, or by the laws of Divine Order, 
9946, 2634.

31. The man being free from iniquity, and the woman bearing her iniquity, denotes that the truth 
may not be violated, when evil has been confirmed by conjunction with infernal falsity, 160, 
158, 246614, 9937. 

DISCUSSION

The chapter we have now to review, as appears from vers. 1, 5, and 11, consists of three distinct 
sections. Let us, therefore, consider each of them separately; but before doing so, it may be as well to 
note that, taken all together, they describe the life of the spiritual man, as to his consciousness of evil in
a threefold way; as to the reconciliation of the external man with the internal when evil is removed, and
the Lord is fully acknowledged; and as to the interrupted conjunction of the external man with the 
internal, when good is corrupted in the external, or when truth is deficient in the internal. And taking 
now our first subject, let us see what our duty is in regard to it. We are to put out of our camp, or expel 
from our lives, every leper, that is, every tendency to apply the truths of the church to selfish ends and 
purposes; we may not falsify the truth; and we may not contaminate it with merely natural affections. 
And this is a work to be done within ourselves. For if we are truly enlightened, we shall discover that 
these evil tendencies are in us, and also we shall see that the first, in this case, leads to the second, and 
that the second may culminate in the third. Let us then be wary, and watch and pray lest we enter into 
temptation. It is better to check in ourselves the principles that lead to actual evil, than to have to repent
of indulgence therein. But as we have seen, on a former occasion, how leprosy denotes the profanation 
of truth, how an issue signifies its falsification, and how contact with a dead body represents its 
contamination by merely natural affections void of spiritual life, it is not necessary now to extend our 
remarks on these evils. We may consider, however, why these injunctions are given? It is because the 
Lord dwells in our midst, and His camp must not be defiled. Moreover, we are taught that the expulsion
of our evil tendencies must not only be from our thoughts, but from our hearts as well, for this is 
involved in the use of the terms male and female according to the correspondences. For if the evil 
thought be resisted, the impurity of the feelings will be checked. As, therefore, the children of Israel 
were outwardly obedient to the Lord, so let the spiritual man be inwardly and outwardly obedient, 
since, indeed, under any circumstances, it is good to avoid evil actions, and much better also to see and 
reject the evil thoughts and feelings which prompt to evil actions.

It is interesting to notice, in the next place, the connection of the first section with the two following. 
They both relate to the putting away of evils. And whereas the literal sense concerns evil actions, the 

85

spiritual sense has to do with evil states. Every one knows that it is evil states which produce evil 
actions; and that if pains are taken to remove evil states, there will be no evil actions. The second 
section, then, refers to evils committed in states of ignorance and weakness; and we are carefully to 
consider what we are here taught. The fact that an evil action is the result of ignorance, or of weakness, 
does not cause it to be guiltless, although the guilt has not the same quality as deliberate and wilful sin. 
And it is our duty to confess our guilt, even when there is only error and not wickedness. The 
confession, however, here meant, is not to be in words only; it involves a real consciousness of evil 
doing; and thus it is said, "confession is to be made before the Lord from the internal man." Also 
restitution is to be made; and how is this to be done? We must acknowledge from our hearts, that we 
have infringed a law of Divine Order, although we may not have been aware of it, or knowing it, have 
yet transgressed. And that particular law which we have violated must become now on a law of our life,
and must be inscribed on our interior memory, and must become, as it were, a part of our souls, or of 
our internal man, and must be devoutly cherished there. This is the restitution. And it is to be restitution
in full, by being, for the future, diligently committed to the life, or outwardly observed.

But now, what is really meant by adding the fifth part? It means acknowledgement from remains that 
the truth is from the Lord, and is an internal and living principle in us. Hitherto it may have been a 
mere matter of knowledge, or of the understanding, but now it is something more, and is connected 
with its corresponding affection stored up in us by the Lord at some period of our life without our being
aware of it. Now, however, the affection is active; the truth has life in it, and is implanted in us, 
preparing the way for the realization of good. But what we feel outwardly is, perchance, only a little 
stronger determination to live a true life. Consider next the importance of the following verse. How 
many persons are there in the present day who are spiritually in the position here described! They are 
only natural, and as yet, are without spiritual principles by means of which they are regulating their 
lives. They are only external men, and not yet internal, and this for want of higher truths. They have no 
kinsmen to whom restitution can be made; but yet they can make restitution to the Lord, by doing the 
work of repentance on their own plane. And thousands and thousands of such persons are being saved 
continually because they thus act. For the Lord is in them reconciling them to Himself through their 
simple good. And, moreover, they actually worship the Lord from the good of innocence internally, 
although they are not conscious thereof (ver. 8).

But how is this possible? The next two verses explain. Although they cannot at all acknowledge the 
Lord from their merely natural state;—for no one can do this—although they have not any conscious 
spiritual life; and although they know not their own inmost or celestial life; yet, because they are in 
their simple good, and from it shun evil according to their light, their heave offerings, and their 
sacrifices generally, that is, their acknowledgement of the Lord and their worship generally, can be 
accepted, since it is in correspondence with the Lord's life flowing into their souls through their higher 
degrees. And thus "every heave offering and every hallowed thing of theirs is given to the priest, or in 
other words, is acknowledged to be from the Lord. And hence, therefore, it comes to pass that even the 
angels who form the ultimate heaven, and with whom neither the spiritual nor the celestial degree is 
opened, are yet capable of worshiping the Lord from the highest form of good, and the highest form of 
truth, that is, from celestial and spiritual principles. For such can still love their Lord above all things 
and their neighbour as themselves, but not in the same degree as those can who constitute the spiritual 
and celestial heavens because these respective degrees were opened in them during their state of 
probation in the earthly life. Study well the particular reference (10093) in this connection.

Turning to our last section, we have to reflect on some of the particular spiritual truths contained 
therein. We are all aware how easily we may offend against good through ignorance of the truth, as 

86

described in ver. 12. We may mean to do right, and we may desire to do right, but yet this wish and 
desire may be weakened for want of knowledge. But worse still, it may happen that our good 
intentions, naturally strong, may be thwarted through positive-falsity. It is the Lord who gives us 
natural good affections; but it is ourselves who pervert them by falsity. They ought to be conjoined with
the Lord through the internal man; but we listen to the voice of the serpent, and do more than simply 
err. Why is this? It is because, in our weakness and ignorance, we do not see the truth, and do not 
realize our wickedness. This is the teaching of ver. 13, and it may relate to wicked actions of many 
different kinds, and not be limited simply to violations of marriage in the literal sense only. For there 
are many ways of violating the heavenly marriage, which ought to exist between the church and the 
Lord, or between the natural and spiritual man, or between the external and internal man. And there 
may, at first, be no witness, and no positive condemnation. An illustration of this is Peter's wilful denial
and rejection of his Lord. He really loved Him, you observe, and thus was really conjoined to Him, 
comparatively as the wife to the husband; but in his state of temptation, he neither saw that, nor 
realized that he was committing so grievous a sin. There was, at the moment, no witness against him, 
nor was he caught in the act. But afterwards the Lord, through his internal man, enlightened him. "The 
Lord turned and looked upon Peter," and then he saw that his good or his love for the Lord was defiled,
and he came into that state of disturbance, as to his internal man, which is here described by jealousy. 
For it was the effect of the Lord's earnest zeal for his salvation. Or we might take another case, in 
which we may infer that there was no lack of correspondence as to good, but rather as to truth, namely, 
the case of Thomas. For Thomas, you are aware, required evidence. He could not see the truth, until the
Lord, in His zeal for his salvation, caused him to see. And so Thomas was affected with spiritual 
jealousy, because he could not see, this being removed as soon as he saw. And this illustrates the latter 
half of our fourteenth verse. Spiritual jealousy, therefore, we now see, may arise from two causes It is 
either an anxiety lest our affection for truth, which is the wife, should suffer, or it is an anxiety lest the 
truth itself should suffer.

But here we come to this most interesting case of investigation. And just look, for a moment, at its 
literal sense. How could the presenting of a meal offering like that, and the drinking of water defiled 
with dust establish the guilt or the innocence of the supposed offender? We see, consequently, that 
some mysterious truths underlie all this symbolism. The Lord does not require meal offerings, nor does 
He require incantations by holy water. But He requires sincere worship according to our state, and 
testing by truth adapted to our state. And by these it will be known whether we are truly conjoined to 
Him or not, both as to our external and as to our internal minds. And according to our real state so will 
it happen in the judgement. There is no oil nor frankincense, no purified love, nor purified truth, it may 
be, in our worship as yet, and we must drink, as we journey, the bitter waters of temptations. But the 
time will come, if we are faithful, notwithstanding our present weakness and ignorance, when we shall 
be able to offer the true meal offering (Lev 6:14-18), and to drink of the pure water of life (Rev 7:17), 
that is when our judgement is over, and it will be seen and known that we are free from all impurity.

But considering the series of the internal sense, as it stands in the parallel columns, and also what is 
said in giving the references, it is not necessary to enlarge on the remaining particulars of our chapter; 
and yet a word may be said in conclusion on the confirmation of evil in the interior memory of the 
corrupted man signified by writing the words in a book and then blotting them out with the water of 
bitterness. For it must surely be clear to the thoughtful mind, that when evil is confirmed by falsity 
inwardly as well as outwardly, there is a rejection, or a blotting out, of the truth from the conscious life,
while yet, according to the universal law, what has been once received into the memory remains, 868. 
But also it is said to be blotted out by the water of bitterness, because of its rejection, that is, because of

87

the rejection of the truth through confirmation in what is evil and false. Let the man of the church, then,
beware of this sad state; and let him rather confirm the good and the true by a life of obedience to them.

Numbers Chapter 6

SUMMARY OF THE SPIRITUAL SENSE

1. The character of the celestial man is described, namely, that he is unwilling to investigate 

spiritual or celestial truths during his-regeneration, because he is distinguished from the man 
of the Spiritual Church, and cannot appropriate truths for the sake of being led into good; and 
in him ultimate truths are not separated from good, he is in good and truth conjoined, and he 
acts from good by truth, through the immediate perception of truth, vers. 1-5. 

2. Concerning the regeneration of the celestial man, his purification from evil, his devotion to the
Lord, the reconciliation of his external man with his internal, and the state of innocence he 
acquires, vers. 6-12. 

3. Concerning the state of the celestial man made perfect by regeneration, vers. 13-21. 

4. And, lastly, concerning the conjunction of the celestial with the spiritual heavens, vers. 22-27. 

THE CONTENTS OF EACH VERSE

1. And the LORD spoke to Moses, 

saying, 

2. Speak to the children of Israel, and 
say to them, When either man or 
woman shall make a special vow, the
vow of a Nazirite, to separate 
himself to the LORD: 

1.

2.

3. He shall separate himself from wine 

3.

and strong drink; he shall drink no 
vinegar of wine, or vinegar of strong 
drink, neither shall he drink any 
liquor of grapes, nor eat fresh grapes 
or dried. 

4. All the days of his separation shall 

4.

he eat nothing that is made of the 
grape-vine, from the kernels even to 
the husk. 

There is revelation from the Lord by Divine Truth
giving the perception, 

Through influx to the man of the Spiritual 
Church, from which he learns that the celestial 
man, who is wholly devoted to the Lord. 

Is unwilling to investigate spiritual or celestial 
truths, during his regeneration, which have 
relation either to the internal, interior or external 
man, or to the exercises of charity from affections
either in their development or when confirmed in 
the understanding as distinct from the will; 

Because he who is a man of the Celestial Church 
is distinguished from the man of the Spiritual 
Church, and therefore cannot appropriate truths, 
either internal or external, for the sake of being 
led into good. 

89

5. All the days of his vow of separation

there shall no razor come upon his 
head: until the days be fulfilled, in 
the which he separates himself to the
LORD, he shall be holy, he shall let 
the locks of the hair of his head grow
long. 

5. And in him even ultimate truths, in their plenitude
and power, are not separated from good, and thus 
during the whole course of his regeneration, being
specially devoted to the Lord because he is in 
good and truth conjoined, he continually acts 
from good by truths, having immediate perception
thereof. 

6. All the days that he separates himself

6. And hence, therefore, also, during regeneration, 

to the LORD he shall not come near 
to a dead body. 

7. He shall not make himself unclean 
for his father, or for his mother, for 
his brother, or for his sister, when 
they die: because his separation to 
God is upon his head. 

he does not allow himself to be contaminated 
willingly by the unregenerated affections of the 
merely natural man which are void of spiritual 
life. 

7. Neither does he allow hereditary evils and 

falsities either internal or external to corrupt his 
life, because he is inwardly in good, in truth, and 
in obedience thence derived. 

8. All the days of his separation he is 

8.

holy to the LORD. 

9. And if any man die very suddenly 

9.

beside him, and he defile the head of
his separation; then he shall shave 
his head in the day of his cleansing, 
on the seventh day shall he shave it. 

For during the whole process of his regeneration 
and purification, he is, as to his ruling motive, 
wholly in love to the Lord. 

But when he suffers temptation on account of the 
conflicting state of his preparatory life, and thus 
comes into contact with and opposes evil because 
it is contrary to his cherished love, the 
consequence is that the merely natural life is 
rejected as his regeneration is advancing, and 
when the perfected celestial state is attained. 

10. And on the eighth day he shall bring 
two turtledoves, or two young 
pigeons, to the priest, to the door of 
the tent of meeting: 

11. And the priest shall offer one for a 

sin offering, and the other for a burnt
offering, and make atonement for 
him, for that he sinned by reason of 
the dead, and shall hallow his head 
that same day. 

10. But in every new state caused by victory in 

temptation, there is a closer conjunction of the 
truths perceived in the understanding, with 
celestial good, and also a more intense 
acknowledgement of the Lord. 

11. And from good the celestial man confesses that 
evil and error are removed by Him, while good 
and truth are confirmed; and then the external 
man is conjoined with the internal; for merely 
natural affection void of the higher life causes 
their separation, but purification from evil causes 
their conjunction and a state of holiness. 

90

12. And he shall separate to the LORD 

12. Moreover, by every victory in temptation the 

the days of his separation, and shall 
bring a he-lamb of the first year for a
guilt offering: but the former days 
shall be void, because his separation 
was defiled. 

13. And this is the law of the Nazirite, 
when the days of his separation are 
fulfilled: he shall be brought to the 
door of the tent of meeting: 

14. And he shall offer his oblation to the 

LORD, one he-lamb of the first year 
without blemish for a burnt offering, 
and one ewe-lamb of the first year 
without blemish for a sin offering, 
and one ram without blemish for 
peace offerings. 

devotion of the celestial man to the Lord is 
strengthened, and evil remitted produces a state of
the celestial things of innocence, which is 
acknowledged to be from the Lord; but no actual 
state of conflict with evil, gives any quality to the 
perfect celestial state, because evil active in the 
natural man causes temptation. 

13. But according to the Divine Law, when the 

regeneration of the celestial man is completed, he 
must fully acknowledge the Lord; 

14. And he confesses that he receives from Him all 
the celestial things of innocence internally and 
externally; as well as all spiritual truths; and that 
these are, in the perfected celestial state, free from
all contamination with evil and errors on account 
of remission. 

15. And a basket of unleavened bread, 

15. Also the Sensual—which is the receptacle, 

cakes of fine flour mingled with oil, 
and unleavened wafers anointed with
oil, and their meal offering, and their
drink offerings. 

simultaneously, of celestial love, in the internal 
man; of truth and good adequately conjoined in 
the interior man; and of truth and good conjoined 
in the external man—together with all celestial 
and spiritual good which nourish the soul, is 
acknowledged to be from the Lord. 

16. And the priest shall present them 

16. And this acknowledgement on the part of the 

before the LORD, and shall offer his 
sin offering, and his burnt offering: 

17. And he shall offer the ram for a 

sacrifice of peace offerings to the 
LORD, with the basket of unleavened 
bread: the priest shall offer also the 
meal offering thereof, and the drink 
offering thereof. 

celestial man, is entirely from celestial good, both
as to the removal of evil and the reception of that 
good; 

17. And also as to the reception of spiritual good and 
its truth in the middle degree of the mind, 
involving worship from freedom on account of 
the remission of evils, and as to the reception of 
all degrees of good in the natural mind, together 
with all celestial and spiritual good and truth 
which nourish the soul. 

91

18. And the Nazirite shall shave the head
of his separation at the door of the 
tent of meeting, and shall take the 
hair of the head of his separation, 
and put it on the fire which is under 
the sacrifice of peace offerings. 

18. And when the celestial man is thus sanctified, he 
puts off the old natural state when all temptation 
has ceased, and puts on the new natural state, 
which is holy from pure love, and the medium of 
conjunction. 

19. And the priest shall take the sodden 

19. For all the power of spiritual or internal good by 

shoulder of the ram, and one 
unleavened cake out of the basket, 
and one unleavened wafer, and shall 
put them upon the hands of the 
Nazirite, after he has shaven the 
head of his separation: 

20. And the priest shall wave them for a 
wave offering before the LORD; this 
is holy for the priest, together with 
the wave breast and heave thigh: and
after that the Nazirite may drink 
wine. 

which he had fought against evil, and all the good 
interior and external, which had supported him in 
the conflict, had been from celestial love; and this
becomes fully manifest when the warfare is 
ended, and the former natural man is separated; 

20. Since then the new natural man is vivified from 

within, and acknowledges the Lord in all fullness,
pure love, indeed, wholly predominating there in 
a state of holiness, even as in the interior spiritual 
degree, and in the inmost conjugial principle, 
which are rendered active from the Lord, and by 
reason of which the celestial man, from his state 
of perfection in good, can instantly perceive and 
also appropriate all spiritual truths. 

21. This is the law of the Nazirite who 
vows, and of his oblation to the 
LORD for his separation, beside that 
which he is able to get: according to 
his vow which he vows, so he must 
do after the law of his separation. 

21. And this is the Divine law for the celestial man 
who devotes himself to the Lord, and is 
distinguished from the spiritual man by a more 
complete acknowledgement of the Lord; nor is it 
possible for him not thus to be distinguished 
because this is a law of Divine Order. 

22. And the LORD spoke to Moses, 

22. And hence there is further revelation from the 

saying, 

Lord by Divine Truth giving the perception, 

23. Speak to Aaron and to his sons, 

saying, On this wise you shall bless 
the children of Israel; you shall say 
to them, 

23. According to influx through the celestial heavens 
that there is now full conjunction of the Lord with
the spiritual heavens, and perception thence with 
the spiritual, 

24. The LORD bless you, and keep you: 

24. That goodness and truth are conjoined in their 

inmost principles; 

25. The LORD make his face to shine 
upon you, and be gracious to you: 

26. The LORD lift up his countenance 
upon you, and give you peace. 

25. That thence all interior truths have spiritual light 

and joy; 

26. And that thence also all external principles are 
elevated into that light and become receptive of 
eternal peace. 

92

27. So shall they put my name upon the 
children of Israel; and I will bless 
them. 

27. And that thus a Divine quality is impressed upon 
the spiritual man through the celestial, there being
indeed, in this way, a full conjunction of all 
human powers with the Lord in simultaneous 
order in the natural man.

Spiritual Church from which he learns, 2951, 3654, 7304; and any man or woman making a 
special vow, the vow of a Nazarite, to separate himself to the Lord, denotes the celestial man 
who is wholly devoted to the Lord, because a man or a woman signifies the internal or 
external of the church, 158, 160; making a special vow, denotes willing that the Lord may 
provide, and also a sacred desire for conjunction with Him, 3732, 6091; and the vow of a 
Nazarite, denotes the consecration of the celestial man to the Lord, 511316. 

3. Separating himself from wine and strong drink, denotes that the celestial man is unwilling to 

investigate spiritual truths during His regeneration, 202, 337; 511316, 683; the three 
expressions, namely, wine, vinegar of wine, and liquor of grapes, denote, respectively, truths 
relating to the internal, interior, and external man according to the series, and drinking denotes 
appropriation, 3168; grapes denote charity, as peculiar to the Spiritual Church, 10712; fresh 
grapes or dried, denote affections of. charity either in their development, or when confirmed in
the understanding as distinct from the will, 88694; and eating denotes appropriation, 3168. 

4. Not eating anything that is made of the grape from the kernels even to the husk during all the 
days of his separation, denotes that he who is a man of the Celestial Church is distinguished 
from the man of the Spiritual Church, and therefore cannot appropriate truths, either internal 
or external, for the sake of being led to good, 3168, 1071, 511316, 3732, 6091. 

5. All the days of his vow of separation no razor coming upon his head, denotes that, in him, 

even ultimate truths in their plenitude and power are not separated from good, 33013; until the 
days are fulfilled in which he separates himself to the Lord being holy, denotes that during the 
whole course of his regeneration he is specially devoted to the Lord because he is in good and 
truth conjoined, 487, 96802; and letting the locks of the hair of his head grow long, denotes 
that he continually acts from good by truths, having immediate perception thereof, 33013. 

6. All the days that he separates himself to the Lord, not coming near a dead body, denotes that 

during regeneration he does not allow himself to be contaminated willingly by the 
unregenerated affections of the merely natural man, which are void of spiritual life, 487, 
390011. 

7. Not making himself unclean for his father or for his mother when they die, denotes that neither

does he allow hereditary evils and falsities either internal or external to corrupt his life, 

93

370320, 8876; when fathers and mothers denote internal evils and falsities from heredity, 
brothers and sisters denote such as are external, 370322; when they die, denotes when evils and
falsities are rejected, 1408; and his separation to God being upon his head, denotes that he is 
inwardly in good, in truth, and in obedience thence derived, ver. 2. 

8. Being holy to the Lord all the days of his separation, denotes that during the whole process of 
his regeneration and purification he is, as to his ruling motive, wholly in love to the Lord, 487,
968o2, 2001. Notice here the use of the term God in the preceding verse, and the term Jehovah
in this.

9. Any man dying very suddenly beside him, denotes temptation and victory in the conflicting 

state of his preparatory life, 1408; defiling the head of his separation, denotes coming into 
contact with evil, and opposing it from his cherished love, 10130, 3728, 511316; shaving his 
head on the day of his cleansing, denotes the rejection of the merely natural life as his 
regeneration is advancing, 33013; and the seventh day denotes when the perfected celestial 
state is attained, 84. 

10. The eighth day denotes the new state caused by victory in temptation, 2044; bringing to the 
priest two turtledoves or two young pigeons, denotes a closer conjunction of the truths 
perceived in the understanding with celestial good, 870, 9946; and the door of the tent of 
meeting, denotes the acknowledgement of the Lord,

11. The priest offering one for a sin offering and the other for a burnt offering, denotes that, from 
good, the celestial man confesses that evil and error are removed by Him, while good and truth
are confirmed, 9946, 10227, 3400, 10053; making atonement denotes the reconciliation of 
man with the Lord, and of the external man with the internal, 10042, III; sin by reason of the 
dead, denotes that merely natural affection causes their separation, 390010; and hallowing his 
head the same day, denotes that purification from evil causes their conjunction and a state of 
holiness, 8042, 96802, 3728, 487. 

12. Separating to the Lord the days of his separation, denotes that by every victory in temptation 
the devotion of the celestial man to the Lord is strengthened, because no one can be fully 
separated, or devoted to the Lord without the removal of evil, which is effected by 
temptations, and is denoted by the sin offering, 511316, 10053; bringing a he-lamb of the first 
year for a guilt offering, denotes that evil remitted produces a state of the celestial things of 
innocence which is acknowledged to be from the Lord, because the sin offering mentioned in 
the last verse, denotes evil remitted; the he-lamb, denotes the celestial things of innocence, and
of the first year, denotes in all fullness, 29069; and a guilt offering denotes the 
acknowledgement of the Lord in worship for the removal of evil committed without intention, 
3400, 9156; and the former days being void because his separation was defiled, denotes that 
no actual state of conflict with evil gives any quality to the perfect celestial state, because evil 
active in the natural man causes temptation; for by days are denoted states, 487; being void, or
falling, denotes separation, 3203; and the separation defiled, denotes a state of impurity, 
10130. 

13. This being the law of the Nazarite, when the days of his separation are fulfilled, denotes when 
the regeneration of the celestial man is completed according to the Divine Law, 487, 511316; 

94

and being brought to the door of the tent of meeting, denotes that he must fully acknowledge 
the Lord, 2356. 

14. Offering his oblation to the Lord one he-lamb of the first year for a burnt offering, denotes 

confession that he receives from the Lord all the celestial things of innocence, 10227, 28303, 
29069; and the he-lamb denotes what is internal, the ewe-lamb what is external, and the ram 
what is spiritual, 28303, while the burnt offering signifies worship from pure love; the sin 
offering worship indicating purification from evil; of the first year, signifies fullness; without 
blemish signifies what is perfect, 10053, 3400, 2906, 7837; and a peace offering signifies 
worship from freedom on account of the remission, or removal, of evil, 10097. 

15. The basket denotes the Sensual, which is the receptacle, 10080, 10107; it is said 

simultaneously, because what is highest in successive order is in the midst in simultaneous 
order, 5897, 9996; bread, cakes, and wafers, denote good, respectively, in the internal, the 
interior, and the external man, 10107; unleavened, denotes what is free from evil and falsity, 
2342; anointed with oil and mingled with oil, denotes from love, 2177; fine flour denotes what
is spiritual, 2177; mixing evidently denotes conjoining, 39935; and meal offerings and drink-
offerings denote celestial and spiritual good and truth which nourish the soul, 2177, 1071. 

16. The priest presenting them before the Lord, denotes that this acknowledgement is entirely 

from celestial good, 9946, 10227; and offering his sin offering and his burnt offering, denotes 
both as to the removal of evil and the reception of good, 3400, 10053. 

17. Offering the ram for a sacrifice of peace offerings to the Lord, denotes that so also is the 

acknowledgement of the reception of spiritual and celestial love in the middle degree of the 
mind, 28303; with the basket of unleavened bread, denotes as to the reception of all degrees of 
good in the natural mind, ver. 15; and with the meal offering, and the drink offering thereof, 
denotes as to the reception of all celestial and spiritual good and truth which nourish the 
sou50:2177, 1071. But the peace offering, denotes worship from freedom on account of the 
remission of evil, 10097, because the worship is not entirely free so long as there is 
temptation, and also self compulsion; and the reason why the burnt offering is mentioned 
before the sin offering in the first instance and after it in the second, is to show that the 
worship of the Lord from pure love, and with full devotion, is indeed the essential in worship 
under all circumstances with the celestial man; but that, nevertheless, with him also, the 
removal of evil must precede and not follow the realization of good.

18. The Nazarite shaving the head of his separation at the door of the tent of meeting, denotes that 

when the celestial man is thus sanctified, he puts off the old natural state when all temptation 
has ceased, 33013; putting the hair on the fire, denotes putting on the new natural state which 
is holy from pure love, 33013, 934, 10055; and under the sacrifice of the peace offerings, 
denotes the medium of conjunction, 8517, 92783. 

19. Taking the sodden shoulder of the ram, denotes all the power of spiritual or internal good with 
which the celestial man has fought against evil, 1085, 10043; one cake and one wafer, denote 
all the good interior and external, that had supported him in the conflict, 10107; putting them 
into the hand of the Nazarite, denotes that they were from celestial love, 9946, 878; and after 

95

he had shaven the head of his separation, denotes when the former natural man was separated, 
33013, 2356, 35403. 

20. The priest waving them before the Lord, denotes that then the new natural man is vivified 

from within, 10089, 223; this being holy for the priest together, with the wave breast and the 
heave thigh, denotes the acknowledgement of the Lord in all fullness, pure love indeed wholly
predominating in a state of holiness there, even as in the interior spiritual degree, and in the 
inmost conjugial principle which are rendered active from the Lord, ver. 19, 10091-10093; and
after that the Nazarite being permitted to drink wine, denotes that the celestial man, from his 
state of perfection in good, can instantly perceive, and also appropriate all spiritual truths,

21. This being the law of the Nazarite who vows, denotes the Divine Law for the celestial man 

who devotes himself to the Lord, ver. 2; his oblation to the Lord for his separation, denotes his
acknowledgement of the Lord as distinct from that of the spiritual man by being more 
complete, vers. 14, 15; and according to his vow that he vows, so doing after the law of his 
separation, denotes that it is not possible for him not thus to be distinguished, because this is a 
law of Divine Order, ver. 13. 

22. This is evident, because by Jehovah is denoted the Divine Being as to His love, 2001; by 

speaking is denoted influx, 2951; by Moses, is represented Divine Truth, or the Word, 7010; 
and by saying is denoted perception, 1791, 1822. 

23. Moses speaking to Aaron and to his sons saying, denotes according to influx into the celestial 
and thence into the spiritual heavens, 2951, 9946; and on this wise blessing the children of 
Israel and saying to them, denotes that there is now full conjunction of the Lord with the 
spiritual heavens, and perception there with the spiritual, 10495, 1791, 1822. 

24. "The Lord bless you and keep you," denotes that goodness and truth are conjoined in their 

inmost principles, 2001, 10495, 3382. 

25. "The Lord make His face to shine upon you and be gracious to you," denotes that thence all 

interior truths have spiritual light and joy, 2001, 222-3, 3195. 

26. "The Lord lift up his countenance upon you and give you peace," denotes that thence also the 
external principles are elevated into light and become receptive of eternal peace, 2001, 222-3, 
3780. 

27. Putting the Lord's name upon the children of Israel, denotes that thus a Divine quality is 
impressed upon the spiritual man through the celestial, 2009, 3654, 10017; and the Lord 
blessing them, denotes that, in this way, a full conjunction of all human powers with the Lord 
in simultaneous order is effected, 2001, 10495, 3654. 

DISCUSSION

This interesting chapter deals with the celestial man, as distinguished from the spiritual man, and at the 
same Lime with the spiritual man in his celestial state, or in the state when he no longer learns the truth 
in order that he may become good, but when, being good, he perceives the truths that agree with his 
good, and makes use of them as a means of doing good. Now this distinction between the celestial and 
spiritual man, and consequently between the celestial and spiritual heavens, and the celestial and 

96

spiritual states of the man of the church generally, was unknown to the Christian world, before it was 
revealed in the Arcana Coelestia; and also, there are several other distinctions made in the writings of 
the New Church generally, which were not known before. And for this reason, as every one may see, it 
became necessary that new terms should be used to mark those distinctions. And on this account also 
those terms cannot be dispensed with in treating methodically on the various subjects with which they 
are connected without a great sacrifice of clearness. No apology, therefore, is needed for the constant 
use of these terms in their proper places; and as they are generally explained, where it is necessary, the 
distinctions themselves will, in time, become quite familiar, and, of course, will be found of immense 
use, in properly understanding spiritual things. Let us, therefore, reverently study what the celestial 
man is, and what the celestial state of every man is, as set forth in the correspondential language of the 
portion of the Word now before us.

A Nazarite means, literally, one separated, devoted, or sanctified for the service of God; and a cognate 
term, derived from the same root, means the hair of the head, as shown by the Nazarite; hence, 
therefore, we may clearly see how it is that he represents the celestial man, and the celestial state of any
man, or in other words an angel of the highest heaven especially; an angel of any heaven, as to the 
good, or love which makes him an angel, and a man of the church as to the principle of good, or love, 
by which alone any one can be devoted to the Lord. Thus, then, the term Nazarite covers the whole 
meaning of the term celestial. For no one can be devoted to the Lord unless he loves the Lord, and all 
that proceeds from the Lord.

This, then, being so, consider what is first said of the Nazarite, who, of course, in the supreme sense, 
represents the Lord Himself as to His Human nature, 33013. He was commanded not to drink wine, and
not to eat anything that came from the vine, to signify that the celestial man is not regenerated by 
means of truth in the understanding, like the spiritual man, but by means of good in the will, and this 
because the celestial man, in the strict sense, means the man in whom the will and understanding make 
one, on which account he does not learn truth, and store it up in his memory with a view to becoming 
good, but he perceives what is true from his state of good; and then by uniting the truth he thus 
perceives with his good, he is gradually made perfect, or regenerated. For although the celestial man is 
in good and truth conjoined essentially or internally, it docs not necessarily follow that he is so actually 
or externally, because he is born from his parents with tendencies to evil and error, and also in a state of
ignorance, and therefore he cannot be perfect, until his faculties are developed, and thus until he is able 
to perceive truths from his good, and to conjoin them with his good in a perfect life. Now in order to 
understand the distinction between the celestial and spiritual man, and thus between the people of the 
Most Ancient Church, and those of the Ancient Church, both as to their essential nature, and with 
regard to regeneration, we must study this well. To be regenerated by means of good in the will, that is, 
by means of affection, and thus to be made perfect in truth, is a very different thing from being 
regenerated by means of truth in the understanding and thus, by means of intelligence. In both cases, of
course, regeneration implies the rejection of evil and error, and being established in goodness and truth,
and in both cases love conjoins truth to itself; but in the case of the spiritual, the love is of a lower 
degree comparatively, as love to the neighbour is in a lower degree than love to the Lord. Hence, then, 
we now see why the celestial man was not allowed, spiritually, to drink wine, or to eat anything that 
came from the vine: it was because he did not reason concerning truths, as to whether they were truths 
or not, but perceived what was true from the interior light, which was from the Lord through his good, 
according to the Lord's words concerning him, namely, "Let your communications be 'Yea, yea, Nay, 
nay,' for whatever is more than these comes of evil" (Matt 5:37).

97

But when the Nazarite had fulfilled his appointed days, as we read further on, he was permitted to drink
wine; and since the celestial man, whom he represents, neither before nor after his complete 
regeneration, reasons concerning truths but perceives them, we have to consider in what sense the 
perfected celestial man drinks wine spiritually. To perceive truths from the state of good, be it known, 
is the office of the understanding conjoined with the will; and this the celestial man does during his 
regeneration and after it, as is evident. But to appropriate truths by applying them to the life, either 
during regeneration or after it, is the office of the will, and this is what is signified also by drinking 
wine. Hence, therefore, it is said in the series of the internal sense, in ver. 20, "the celestial man, from 
his state of perfection in good, can instantly perceive, and also appropriate all spiritual truths." That is, 
this drinking of wine by the celestial man, properly represents the full appropriation of all truths, 
relating to his life, in the natural sense now completely one with the higher degrees. And, indeed, 
concerning this state, see AE 91812; and consider that, in regard to the Lord, it represents the state of 
the Human, so to speak, when it was fully glorified, or when He arose from the dead with His whole 
body which He had in the world, and when He could emphatically say, "All power is given to Me in 
heaven and on earth," thus assuming as to the Human also, Divine Omnipotence. But see Matt 26:29, 
Mark 14:25, Luke 22:18. 

And this brings us to another point which demands attention.

The Nazarite was not to shave his head, and he was to let the locks of his hair grow long, in order to 
denote that, in the celestial man, truth was never to be separated from good, that all its power was to be 
exercised in the natural degree, and that he had continual perception thereof. This the reference given 
shows; and also that when his days were fulfilled, and he shaved off the hair of his head, it was to 
denote the putting off of the old, and the putting on, in fullness, of a new natural man. This, therefore, 
clearly indicates that the celestial man, equally with the spiritual, was required to overcome evil, and 
that his regeneration was not simply a development from a lower degree of good to a higher. On the 
contrary, it consisted in the elimination of evil and error from the natural affections and thoughts, so 
that there might be perfect harmony between the higher degree of good and the lower. But, indeed, that 
the celestial man, before regeneration is completed, enters into temptation for his purification, is 
abundantly evident from what now follows in our second section. Let us consider it.

The Nazarite was not to allow himself to come near any dead body. Now what a striking symbol is a 
dead body, or carcass, of the merely natural man void of spiritual life! But the celestial man, as 
distinguished from the spiritual man, could not have been contaminated with evil, as thus represented, 
if there had been no evil with him in the natural degree of his life; that is, if there had been with him no 
actual evil there. And, of course, there could have been no actual evil, if there had not been hereditary 
evil, except in the case of the first created human beings whoever they were. But the next verse assures 
us that he was not compelled to adopt evil from hereditary tendencies; and this also is clear from the 
fact that the very first pair, if we assume that the whole human race sprang from one pair, were in 
freedom to choose between the love of the Lord and the love of self (Gen 2:16-17), or more strictly 
between the love of the Lord and selfishness. During all the states of his Nazariteship, or separation, 
therefore, the celestial man was holy to the Lord by virtue of good. And this cannot be said of the 
spiritual man, who acts from truth rather than from good in the course of his regeneration.

We now come to reflect upon the purification of the celestial man from evil, which is described by 
accidental contamination through contact with the dead body of a person dying suddenly beside the 
Nazarite. And we notice first the peculiarity of this expression, as indicating the manner in which evil 
impulses causing temptation are excited by evil spirits. For there can be no impulse of evil without 

98

influx from the hells; and this influx, in the case of the regenerating man, involves temptation. And if 
we call to mind the words of Paul when he said, "I die daily" (1 Cor 15:31), we shall understand the 
spiritual meaning of a man dying suddenly. It is the rejection of the corrupt old life through conquering 
in temptation. And in this is the celestial man defiled, in that he is conscious of his evil. But he puts off 
the old life, as represented by the Nazarite shaving his head, and puts on the holy state of the new life 
denoted by the seventh day. And now follows, therefore, the worship of the Lord in the new state, and 
the renewal of the vow of consecration, the meaning of all these things in relation to the progress in 
regeneration of the celestial man, appearing sufficiently from what is said in giving the references, 
because similar things have been previously considered. But a word must be said explanatory of the 
last clause in the section. For it must not be supposed that the former days being void, denotes that the 
previous states of the regeneration of the celestial man contributed nothing towards his final perfection,
since every previous state of good and truth and their conjunction, occurring during life, has its value, 
as is evident from the fact that we could not have the full corn in the ear, unless we previously had the 
ear and the blade before it, according to the Lord's leaching (Mark 4:28; AC 29). And hence, then, we 
are to understand by "former days," not any previous states of good and truth, but of evil and falsity; 
and that is why it is said to signify that "no actual state of conflict with evil, gives any quality to the 
perfect celestial state, because evil active in the natural man causes temptation." And, besides this, the 
words we are studying also convey the consoling and strengthening thought to the man of the church in
general, that in heaven our evil states will have passed away, and that indeed actual states of conflict 
against evil will never more be experienced.

"Eternal mansions, bright array! 
Oh blest exchange! Transporting thought! Free from the approaches of decay, Or the least 
shadow of a spot! "

With regard to the state of the celestial man made perfect by regeneration, which comprises our third 
section, there are some interesting particulars. He now acknowledges the Lord in all fullness; he 
worships Him from the inmost degree of his life, even to its outermost; the animals sacrificed indicate 
the successive order of influx as to good; the basket with its contents, denotes the same good in 
simultaneous order, to show that, in the perfect state, all degrees of good are in the ultimate or natural 
degree in their fullness and their power; and the meal offering and drink offering are last mentioned 
among the offerings, to show not only the intensification of this full reception of goodness and truth, 
but also that, in the perfect state in heaven, what nourishes the souls of the angels nourishes their bodies
also, appearing in correspondential forms suitable for that purpose.

We have already seen the signification of shaving the head, and now, since it denotes the putting off of 
the old natural state and the putting on of the new, we can thence perceive the peculiarity of what is 
said in vers. 19-20. For it was after the Nazarite had shaven the head of his separation that the waving 
and heaving took place, and that he could drink wine. That is, spiritually, it is only when the old natural
state is rejected and the new state is inaugurated, that truth and good respectively can be fully 
acknowledged and perceived to be from the Lord, and that the celestial man can fully appropriate them.
And thus the more closely we examine the particulars of the description before us, the more clearly do 
the truths of the internal sense of the Word manifest themselves, and the more completely does the 
order and beauty of Divine revelation appear.

And, lastly, we have to consider the internal sense of words so familiar to us as are those of the blessing
with which the chapter ends. That blessing denotes conjunction, the references show. But because the 
Lord, or Jehovah, signifies the Divine Being as to His love, we thence observe that it is love that causes

99

conjunction. And truly every human being is eternally conjoined with the Lord through the reception of
life or love from Him; and yet this alone does not give the conjunction signified by the threefold 
blessing. In order that there may be true conjunction with the Lord, He must not only love us, but we 
must love Him. Hence, therefore, to pray that the Lord may bless us or any one else, includes the desire
that we may love the Lord, and what proceeds from Him, namely, mercy, joy and peace, and in short all
things good and true. And to pray the threefold blessing, is to desire to love the Lord as to all the 
degrees of our life. And thus only can our prayer be a true prayer, whether the desire be for ourselves or
for others. It is worth our while, therefore, to know the internal sense of the Lord blessing us; for if we 
do not know it, we may easily imagine that it is a blessed thing to receive all kinds of good things from 
the Lord, externally, and to enjoy them without any reference to our own state internally.

Again, it is interesting to remark that this grand form of blessing is not only threefold, thus relating to 
the whole of the degrees of our life. It is also double in those degrees, and thus teaches the important 
lesson that we must be truly conjoined to the Lord both as to our wills and our understandings. That is, 
we must not only love to be good, but we must love to be truthful as well. Truly it is goodness that is a 
blessing, but it is truth that keeps or preserves us; the face of the Lord shines upon us when we 
ourselves are merciful, and He is gracious to us, when we ourselves are intelligently kind, or gracious; 
and He lifts up the light of His countenance upon us, when we act according to His truth, giving us 
peace also, when we are fully disposed to promote peace amongst our brethren.

And in one word, if we have inwardly in ourselves the heavenly affections symbolized by Aaron and 
his sons, involving the peace which the world can neither give nor take away, they will certainly 
descend and bring into perfect harmony every lower principle of our hearts and minds, which are 
collectively represented by the children, of Israel in relation to the priests who pronounce the blessing.

Numbers Chapter 7

SUMMARY OF THE SPIRITUAL SENSE

1. The subject here first presented is the conjunction of the spiritual heaven with the celestial; 

and also, generally, the chapter treats of the acknowledgement, on the part of the spiritual man,
that he receives all the good things of charity and faith and doctrine from the Lord through the 
celestial heavens, vers. 1-8. 

2. But those who constitute the spiritual heaven cannot perform the functions of the ultimate 
heaven, their use being to minister to and support with all their power the celestial heaven, 
besides which they acknowledge the Lord in genuine spiritual worship; every society, indeed, 
and each individual, according to his state, vers. 9-11. 

3. The specific acknowledgement and worship of societies and individuals is described, vers. 12-

88. 

4. Revelation, internal and external, is always the consequence of genuine acknowledgement and

worship, ver. 89. 

THE CONTENTS OF EACH VERSE

1. And it came to pass on the day that 

1.

Moses had made an end of setting up
the tabernacle, and had anointed it 
and sanctified it, and all the furniture
thereof, and the altar and all the 
vessels thereof, and had anointed 
them and sanctified them; 

2. That the princes of Israel, the heads 
of their fathers' houses, offered; 
these were the princes of the tribes, 
these are they that were over them 
that were numbered: 

3. And they brought their oblation 
before the LORD, six covered 
wagons, and twelve oxen; a wagon 
for every two of the princes, and for 
each one an ox: and they presented 
them before the tabernacle. 

It happens, when the state of the celestial man is 
completely established by the conjunction of truth 
with good, and by a holy state of good and truth 
thence derived in consequence, and thus when the 
worship of the Lord from these principles is also 
established by such conjunction and sanctification;

2. That those who are in the primary truths of the 
Spiritual Church grounded in charity, which is 
celestial love in an image, have conjunction 
therewith; for they are the primary things of faith 
and charity, and the ordination and arrangement of 
all inferior things is thence derived from the Lord. 

3. And therefore they acknowledge that they are, 

from the Lord by regeneration, the receptacles of 
celestial things protected from evil, and concealed 
by Divine Providence; that they have all fullness 
as to natural affections; that they are receptacles of
good and truth in conjunction; that the affection of 
good is distinguished from the affection of truth; 
and that they receive these gifts from the Lord 
through the celestial heaven. 

101

4. And the LORD spoke to Moses, 

4. And they have perception from the Lord by Divine

saying, 

Truth, 

5. Take it of them, that they may be to 
do the service of the tent of meeting; 
and you shall give them to the 
Levites, to every man according to 
his service. 

5. That their acknowledgement that all these good 

things are from the Lord, is accepted that they may
be in holy spiritual worship by the reception of 
charity as primary, each being in his own 
particular good or use. 

6. And Moses took the wagons and the 
oxen, and gave them to the Levites. 

6. And thus all natural receptacles or scientifics, and 
all natural affections are grounded in charity; 

7. Two wagons and four oxen he gave 
to the sons of Gershon, according to 
their service: 

8. And four wagons and eight oxen he 
gave to the sons of Merari, according
to their service, under the hand of 
Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest. 

9. But to the sons of Kohath he gave 
none: because the service of the 
sanctuary belonged to them; they 
bare it upon their shoulders. 

7. Scientifics of truth conjoined with good, and 

affections of good conjoined with truth, belonging 
to those who are in the internal of the ultimate 
heaven, adequate to their functions; 

8. And scientifics of truth conjoined with good, and 
affections of good conjoined with truth belonging 
to those who are in the external of the ultimate 
heaven, also adequate to their functions, and 
forming the new external man, this being 
subordinate to and acting from celestial natural 
good. 

9. But those who constitute the middle heaven, or 

spiritual degree, are not in the functions of those 
who are in the ultimate heaven, and consequently 
not in their scientifics of truth or affections of 
good, because their ministry is to the celestial 
heaven, by supporting it from the affections of 
interior truth and interior good conjoined, with all 
their power. 

10. And the princes offered for the 

10. And thus all those in the primary truths of the 

dedication of the altar in the day that 
it was anointed, even the princes 
offered their oblation before the 
altar.

worship when it is from charity and faith 
conjoined, and this both as to internals and 
externals. 

11. And the LORD said to Moses, They 

11. And there is revelation from the Lord by Divine 

shall offer their oblation, each prince
on his day, for the dedication of the 
altar.

internally, or of spiritual and celestial love; 

14. One golden spoon of ten shekels, full

of incense; 

14. And the grateful hearing and reception of worship,
because derived from remains and expressed in 
loving words and actions, 

15. One young bullock, one ram, one he-

15. All natural, spiritual, and celestial love in fullness

worship derived from remains and from truth 
conjoined with good the quality of which is 
completeness and equality as to both truth and 
good; 

87. Completeness as to all natural affections, as to all 
spiritual affections, and as to all celestial affections
internal and external, and as to Faith in the Lord 
for the remission, of evil in the worship of the 
Lord by entire consecration; 

88. And also completeness as to the free and full 

devotion of all natural affections, of all spiritual 
affections, of all the' good of faith, and of all the 
good of innocence established in the external man 
as well as in the internal by regeneration. And thus
it is acknowledged by the spiritual man that all his 
worship: of the Lord is entirely from Him by the 
conjunction of good with truth. 

89. So that when the spiritual man is, in this holy: 

worship, desirous humbly to communicate with 
the Lord, he receives revelation from the Divine 
Mercy which removes evil from him through the 
inmost or celestial heaven, the Divine Providence 
operating continually by Divine Truth thence 
proceeding, and being adapted to all his states and 
changes of state in such worship.

speaking is denoted influx, 2951; by Moses is represented Divine Truth, or the Word, 7010; 
and by saying is denoted perception, 1791, 1822.

112

9. The sons of Kohath denote those who constitute the middle heaven, or spiritual degree, chap 

3:17, 29, 9684; not giving them any denotes that they are not in the functions of those who are 
in the ultimate heaven, and, consequently, not in their scientifics or affections of good, vers. 7, 
8; the service of the sanctuary belonging to them denotes that their ministry is to the celestial 
heaven, 3210, chap 4:4; and bearing it upon their shoulders denotes by supporting it from the 
affection of interior truth and interior good conjoined, with all their power, 1085. 

10. The princes offering for the dedication of the altar in the day that it was anointed, even the 

princes offering their oblation before the altar, denotes that thus all those in the primary truths 
of the Spiritual Church acknowledge the Lord in genuine worship when it is from charity and 
faith conjoined, and this both as to Internals and Externals, 8314, 5619, 4541, 9954, 1085, 
683. 

11. The Lord saying to Moses denotes revelation from the Lord by Divine Truth, 2001, 7010, 

1822; and offering his oblation each prince in his day for the dedication of the altar, denotes 
that each worships the Lord, by acknowledgement, according to his own state, 10227, 8314. 
487, 4541. 

12. He that offered his oblation on the first day being Nahshon the son of Amminadab of the tribe 

of Judah, denotes that the first are in truths immediately proceeding from Divine Love, chap 
1:7, 3880, 197, 1482. 

13. One silver charger the weight whereof was one hundred and thirty shekels, denotes all spiritual
truth having relation to doctrine in perfection, because silver denotes spiritual truth, 2937; a 
silver charger, being a receptacle or vessel, denotes truth, or doctrine recipient of good, 3079; 
weight has reference to good, 3104; and one hundred and thirty denotes perfection, 2636, 
5335; one silver bowl of seventy shekels after the shekel of the sanctuary, denotes all spiritual 
truths having relation to life in perfection and holiness, 2937, 3079, 728; after the shekel of the
sanctuary denotes from the conjunction of truth with good, 2959; and both of them full of fine 
flour mingled with oil for a meal offering, denotes being receptacles of celestial good 
externally and internally, or of spiritual and celestial love, the charger signifying the external 
receptacle and the bowl the internal, as appears from the signification of the numbers 
connected with each, 2177. 

14. One golden spoon of ten shekels full of incense, denotes the grateful hearing and reception of 
worship, because derived from remains and expressed in loving words and actions, 10177, 
576, 10340, 3164. It is said here "expressed in loving words and actions," because a vessel, or 
spoon made of gold, denotes what is grounded in good in the outward life, from the 
understanding and the heart as all true worship ought to be.

15. One young bullock, one ram, and one he-lamb of the first year for a burnt offering, denotes all 
natural, spiritual and celestial love in all fullness and grounded in innocence, consecrated 
wholly to the Lord, and being perpetually from Him, 10021, 10042, 10132, 10053, 7839. 

16. One male of the goats for a sin offering denotes faith in the Lord conjoined with some charity 

from which repentance is practised and evils are remitted, 41694, 3400, 10122. 

17. Two oxen denotes every good natural affection conjoined with its truth, 2180, 5194; five rams 
denotes every spiritual affection, 10042; five he-goats denotes all the truth of faith, 41694; five

113

he-lambs of the first year denotes all the good of innocence in the natural man, 10132, 29069; 
the peace offering denotes devotion to the Lord in freedom as the result of peace and harmony 
between the internal and external man, 10097; and this being the oblation of Nahshon the son 
of Amminadab, denotes that thus they worship the Lord who are in truth immediately 
proceeding from the primary truth of good, ver. 12. 

18. On the second day Nethanel the son of Zuar prince of Issachar offering, denotes the worship of
those who are in celestial conjugial love, in mutual love, and humility, chap 1:8, 3956, 2001, 1 
Sam 15:17, Luke 12:32, 27153. 

19-23.  The contents of these verses being the same as those of vers. 13-17, the proofs are the same; 
and as the offerings for each of the princes were similar, these proofs need not be repeated. 
But these offerings are repeated in the text, and therefore their internal sense is repeated, and 
the interpretation of it is repeated in each case, because, although it is outwardly the same 
internal sense, it is not inwardly so, owing to the fact that the quality of external worship 
depends upon the motive or principle which rules. And as there were twelve different ruling 
motives or principles represented by the twelve princes, and twelve signifies all, 3858, 
therefore the worship of the whole heaven is here described, showing that it is various on 
account of the universal distinctions of angelic life. But the reason why the offerings are 
described as being all the same is to show that still worship throughout the whole heaven is 
one worship, because it is the worship of the one only Lord; and because he who truly 
worships the Lord, alike devotes to His service all his human affections and powers, each 
being a man like all other men, and endowed with the same faculties from the Lord, since he is
an image and likeness of the Lord. For he embodies in himself all things finitely which are in 
the Lord infinitely; and these common constituents of human life are therefore adequately 
denoted by the several gifts mentioned. 

And, before proceeding, it is also to be observed that each prince is mentioned by name, not 
only before the account of his offerings, but immediately afterwards also, which appears, on 
the surface, to be another unnecessary repetition, but it is not so. For it evidently shows, in the 
internal sense, that the principle which rules inmostly with a man in his worship must be fully 
expressed in that worship, and thus appear in external thoughts and actions, because the 
external man, in heaven, is fully and perfectly represented in what is external.

24. On the third day Eliab the son of Helon, prince of the children of Zebulun, denotes those who 
are in truth conjoined with good and derived therefrom, or in the heavenly marriage, chap 1:9, 
3960-1, 2001, 37032. 

25-29.  See vers. 13-17.

73-77.  See vers. 13-17. 

78. On the twelfth day Ahira the son of Enan, prince of the children of Naphtali, denotes those 
who are in resistance to evil, and in a principle of good derived from the truth of the Divine 
Word, 3928, 2360, 343, 3424. 

79-83.   See vers. 13-17. 

84. This being the dedication of the altar in the day when it was anointed by the princes of Israel, 
denotes that thus it is acknowledged by all who are in the Spiritual Church that good is 
conjoined to truth in worship when they are sensible that they receive all good things from the 
Lord, 10227, 4541, 487, 9954, 8314, 3654; and twelve silver chargers, twelve silver bowls, 
and twelve golden spoons, denote all spiritual truths external and internal, and the power of 
expressing these in good works, which are receptacles of interior principles, 3858, vers. 13, 
14. 

85. Each silver charger being one hundred and thirty shekels, and each bowl seventy, denotes 
fullness and completeness, and holiness as to truth, ver. 13; all the silver of the vessels two 

115

thousand and four hundred shekels, denotes the quality, namely fullness of the conjunction of 
good with truth, and of truth with good, because twenty-four denotes fullness, 53136, two 
thousand denotes the conjunction of good and truth, 10235, and four hundred denotes the 
conjunction of truth and good, 4248; and after the shekel of the sanctuary, denotes that all truth
has its origin from good, 29595. 

86. The twelve golden spoons full of incense weighing ten shekels apiece, after the shekel of the 

sanctuary: all the gold of the spoons one hundred and twenty shekels, denotes fullness, also, as
to good expressed in loving words and actions, which are the receptacles of spiritual worship 
derived from remains, and from truth conjoined with good, the character of which is 
completeness and equality as to both truth and good, ver. 14, 3858, 2959, 575, 576. 

87. All the oxen for the burnt offering being twelve bullocks, the rams twelve, the he-lambs of the 
first year twelve, and their meal offering; and the males of the goats for a sin offering twelve, 
denotes completeness as to all natural affections, as to all spiritual affections, and as to all 
celestial affections internal and external; and as to faith in the Lord for the remission of evil in 
the worship of the Lord by entire consecration, vers. 13, 15, 16, 2177, 3858. 

88. All the oxen for the sacrifice of the peace offerings twenty and four bullocks, the rams sixty, 

the he-goats sixty, the he-lambs of the first year sixty; this being the dedication of the altar 
after it was anointed, denotes completeness as to the free and full devotion of all natural 
affections, of all spiritual affections, of all the good of faith, and of all the good of innocence 
established in the external man as well as in the internal by regeneration. And that thus it is 
acknowledged by the spiritual man that all his worship of the Lord is entirely from Him by the
conjunction of good with truth, ver. 17, 10227, 4541, 9954, 3858, 3306. 

89. Moses going into the tent of meeting to speak with Him, denotes when the spiritual man is, in 
this holy worship, desirous humbly to communicate with the Lord, 10574, 35403, 2271, 2951; 
hearing the voice, denotes revelation, 9926; from the Mercy-seat, denotes from the Divine 
Mercy which removes evils, 9506; the ark denotes the celestial heaven, 9485; cherubim denote
the Divine Providence, 308; and speaking to Him denotes operation continually by Divine 
Truth adapted to all his states, 2951, 2271. 

DISCUSSION

It is interesting to be able to trace the connection between the spiritual series of one chapter of the Word
and of that which immediately follows it, and to observe that the division of the chapters in the literal 
sense by no means agrees with the divisions of the subjects in the spiritual sense, and we have now 
another example of this. For the subjects of the conjunction of the celestial with the spiritual heavens 
commences with, or is introduced by, the blessing which concludes the last chapter. And, indeed, this 
blessing clearly indicates the operation, in the first place, of the Lord through the celestial heavens, 
while the whole of what we now have to consider speaks of the reciprocal action of the spiritual 
heavens. It is just, in fact, as we have already pointed out. There is no true conjunction with the Lord 
where there is no love for Him.

And, moreover, it is the Lord Himself Who renders man capable of love to Him. Each human being, to 
speak universally, is endowed by the Lord with a, particular capacity to love Him, although 'no one is 
compelled to develop this capacity. Let any one of us reflect upon the ruling love that he has, and is 

116

fully conscious of in its general form. Can he say that by study and labour he acquired it? By no means.
It is not a thing that may be acquired, but, being conscious of it, we may develop it. We used to think 
that a man, by determining to do so, could choose any ruling love; but we now think experience proves 
the contrary. It is the Lord Who gives to every man his own ruling love, which is his new will; but He 
does not prevent Him from adopting the opposite evil. For the predetermination of man is between 
good and evil generally, in order that it may be exercised between good and evil specifically. And this 
is evident from the teaching of 1555, that "the will of man is formed by the Lord from infancy to 
childhood," during which time there is, of course, no deliberate choice on man's part, for this freedom 
of choice is not exercised until afterwards; and if he then chooses good and not evil, he by and by 
becomes conscious of the ruling love, or the new will of good, which the Lord has given him; and from
it he reciprocates the Lord's love. And these remarks are made to show that, as each of the twelve 
princes named in our chapter represents a certain principle by which the things he offered for the 
dedication of the altar, which were exactly similar in each case, were modified, really making no two of
their offerings exactly alike, so, comparatively, many persons may receive from the Lord, and 
acknowledge to be from Him, the same endowments of various kinds which are represented by the 
various things each prince offered, and yet these same endowments will be so modified by the ruling 
love or will, which each person has also from the Lord, as to constitute truly a different offering in each
case. And these considerations may serve to show us in what way, for example, the silver charger of the
same form and weight, and containing the same things, which was given by each of the princes, may 
represent, nevertheless, a different endowment because of its being modified by the ruling love of each.
This, therefore, is what justifies the continual repetitions, in the literal sense of this chapter, and 
elsewhere in the Word, by showing that they are not repetitions in the internal sense.

The next thing to be considered is that all these gifts were for the dedication of the altar; and as the altar
was the chief representative of the Lord, therefore its dedication signifies dedication to the Lord in the 
sincere worship of Him. Only that which is from the Lord can enable us to worship Him truly, however,
and thus we see still more clearly that what was given by the princes denotes what is from the Lord, 
and that the giving denotes acknowledgement. And if we now study the gifts in their order, we shall 
cover the whole ground of our chapter. For with regard to the princes, their meaning and signification 
has occupied our attention previously; and it is evident that each prince making his offering on one day 
indicates the progressive character of regeneration. Also the wagons and horses for the service of the 
tent of meeting aptly denote external receptacles and intellectual powers, by means of which suitable 
changes of state are promoted, and the first things we have now to reconsider are the silver charger, the 
silver bowl, and the golden spoon with their contents. These signify the general receptacles of truth and
good, and the principles of truth and good themselves which the man of the church must first receive 
before he can offer acceptable worship. And although these appear to be acquired by an outward way, 
as knowledge stored in the memory, yet we could not thus receive them, if Divine Truth from the Lord 
were not operative inwardly. And it is here particularly said "Divine Truth," because this is what 
proceeds, as the Holy Spirit, from the Lord, and is the receptacle and medium also by which we receive
good inmostly. It is this Divine Good, therefore, that is represented by the contents of the receptacles, 
namely, by the flour mingled with oil for a meal offering, while by the incense in the golden spoon is 
clearly denoted acceptable worship. But, be it remembered, this only means, as far as our actual 
experience is concerned, the first worship of the regenerating man from spiritual principles or from 
truths, the order being, according to our consciousness, from external to internal things; for clearly the 
numbers attached to the charger, the bowl and the spoon, from their correspondence, indicate this. But 
still this part of the description, taken as a whole, and in relation to what follows, as we have said just 
above, signifies the Lord's operation inmostly.

117

For it is now to be observed that it is the Lord's operation from the inmost that precedes, and is 
followed in successive order from internals to externals, by the burnt offerings, the sin offering and the 
peace offerings, representative of worship internally, interiorly and externally, as is evident. Now we 
know that the burnt offerings signify full devotion to the Lord from pure love, and also that peace 
offerings in general denote worship from the same love in freedom in the external man after victory in 
temptation, and when the natural degree fully corresponds with the higher degrees; and hence we may 
see how it is that the sin offering represents interior worship, and denotes an intermediate state also in 
which there is the removal of evil through victory in temptations.

But we notice now that the burnt offering was threefold, consisting of a bullock, a ram, and a lamb, and
knowing that they represent respectively natural, spiritual and celestial worship, we perceive at once 
that when man truly worships the Lord from a state of natural good received from Him, this really 
involves the worship from the higher degrees of good at the same time, although the man of the 
ultimate heaven, whose worship is signified by the bullock, may not be sensible of this. But yet he may 
understand that it is so, for he will know that the higher loves are those through which the Lord, as it 
were, descends, and produces the lower love, which enables him who is in it to be obedient, to love his 
neighbour as himself, and to love the Lord according to his state in the heaven which he occupies.

Again, another reason why the male of the goats takes the middle position, and thus represents the 
spiritual degree, is because it signifies the truth of faith, in the best sense faith conjoined with charity, 
and in the opposite sense faith without charity as the reference shows; and faith as distinguished from 
love or charity is peculiar to the spiritual man. But the good man does not separate faith from charity 
although he distinguishes them, and it is faith conjoined with charity which is especially instrumental in
the removal of evil during the work of repentance. Hence, therefore, we now see the propriety of the 
goat being, in the case before us, a representative of worship for the removal of evil, which is signified 
by the sin offering. And, in addition to this, we may here call to mind that a goat was the sin offering on
the great day of atonement, which is representative of the plenary removal of evil when man is fully 
regenerated.

Turning, however, to the sacrifices for the peace offering, we have to notice some other interesting 
particulars, for here there were two oxen, five rams, five he-goats, and five he-lambs of the first year. 
The reason for this, again, appears from the correspondence of the numbers. The peace offerings 
clearly denote the state of peace arising from the agreement and harmony between the internal and 
external man, and the joy and gladness brought about by the entire removal of evil and the cessation of 
spiritual conflict, producing the conjunction of all the natural affections with the spiritual and celestial 
affections; and this conjunction is signified by the number two. But besides conjunction, when the 
external is one with the internal man, there is fullness of life and worship in the external; and this 
fullness is signified by the number five. And there were oxen, rams, he-goats and lambs to denote the 
presence of all the degrees of life in simultaneous order in the ultimate. Thus we perceive, therefore, 
the spiritual value of all the expressions in relation to the peace offering.

And now, in order to complete this general review of the spiritual principles involved, and of their 
operation, in the internal sense of this account of the gifts of the princes for the dedication of the altar, 
two things more may be briefly considered, namely that all the wagons and horses were given to the 
Levites to do the service of the tent of meeting, and that there was revelation in consequence of the 
fullness of external representative worship expressed by the offering of all these gifts. From 10017 we 
learn that the work of the salvation of those who are in natural good is represented by the priesthood of 
the Levites, and therefore the same thing is also represented by the service of the Levites in the tent of 

118

meeting. And the work of salvation with the natural man is, therefore, evidently the cultivation of 
charity there by means of knowledge, and by means of intelligence such as is signified by the wagons 
and the horses, and the work done by the Levites; for we know that the Levites denote charity. 
Abundance of knowledge and intelligence there may be with the natural man with regard to worldly 
and selfish matters; and we know how keen he can be in cultivating them upon merely natural 
principles. But it is necessary for us all, as natural men, in the carrying out of the main object for which
we are in this world, to cultivate also knowledge and intelligence in spiritual things for the sake of 
being established in genuine charity on the natural plane; for unless we are so established, we shall fail 
to enter the kingdom of heaven when we leave this world. And we know that the Lord says, "Seek you 
first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things shall be added to you" (Matt 6:33). 
And indeed the more we are in this charity as a governing principle, the more will the truths of the 
Word be revealed to us as represented by Moses going into the tent of meeting and hearing the Voice 
speaking to him. For, again, it is written, that "to every one that has shall be given, and he shall have 
abundance: but from him that has not, even that which he has shall be taken away" (Matt 25:29). That 
is to say, to him who has good, or charity, as his general ruling life, will abundance of truths be given, 
in perfect harmony with his specific ruling life of charity, or, in other words, his specific love of 
performing uses without any selfish motive.

THE CONTENTS OF EACH VERSE

1. And the LORD spoke to Moses, 

saying, 

2.

Speak to Aaron, and say to him, 
When you light the lamps, the seven
lamps shall give light in front of the 
candlestick. 

1.

2.

There is revelation from the Lord by Divine Truth
giving the perception, 

To those who are in celestial good by influx and 
illustration, that all the light of the spiritual 
heaven is derived from the celestial, and 
specifically as Divine Truth proceeds from Divine
Good, and enlightens the man of the Spiritual 
Church. 

3. And Aaron did so; he lighted the 

lamps thereof so us to give light in 
front of the candlestick, as the LORD
commanded Moses. 

3. And this is actually the case; truth in the spiritual 
degree is from charity which is love to the Lord in
an image, and thus the Spiritual Church has light 
according to Divine Order. 

120

4. And this was the work of the 

4.

candlestick, beaten work of gold; to 
the base thereof, and to the flowers 
thereof, it was beaten work: 
according to the pattern which the 
LORD had showed Moses, so he 
made the candlestick. 

For it is constituted of Divine Truths brought into 
heavenly order from good; good being in 
ultimates, and truth there in the form of scientifics
in adornment by the operation of the 
understanding conjoined with the will, just as 
Divine Truth is enlightened from Divine Good to 
perceive that all outward forms of beauty are 
representative of the Divine Love in Divine 
Wisdom. 

5. And the LORD spoke to Moses, 

5. And further, there is revelation from the Lord by 

saying, 

Divine Truth giving the perception, 

6.

Take the Levites from among the 
children of Israel, and cleanse them.

6.

That those who are in charity and form the 
Spiritual Church, must be purified; 

7. And thus shall you do to them, to 

7. And this process of purification is effected by 

cleanse them: sprinkle the water of 
expiation upon them, and let them 
cause a razor to pass over all their 
flesh, and let them wash their 
clothes, and cleanse themselves. 

means of the truths of the Word which expose and
remove evils and falsities; separate falsities so 
that truth is conjoined with good even in 
ultimates: separate falsities from truths in the 
understanding; and remove evils from the heart, 
or in the will. 

8.

Then let them take a young bullock,
and its meal offering, fine flour 
mingled with oil, and another young
bullock shall you take for a sin 
offering. 

8. Moreover, this process is accompanied by the 
worship of the Lord from natural good in 
innocence, from spiritual good or charity, and 
from celestial good, or love to the Lord; and by 
the acknowledgement that evil is removed by 
good from the Lord in the natural man. 

9. And you shall present the Levites 

9. And charity must be acknowledged to be the 

before the tent of meeting: and you 
shall assemble the whole 
congregation of the children of 
Israel: 

essential of all worship, giving communication 
with the heavens on the one hand, and with the 
man of the church who is in its truths on the other.

10. And you shall present the Levites 

10. When it is acknowledged to be from the Lord, and

before the LORD: and the children of
Israel shall lay their hands upon the 
Levites: 

also to be a means of communication and 
conjunction with Him by the man of the Spiritual 
Church. 

11. And Aaron shall offer the Levites 

11. For only by this acknowledgement can he be 

before the LORD for a wave offering,
on the behalf of the children of 
Israel, that they may be to do the 
service of the LORD. 

vivified from the Lord, through celestial love, and
thus truly worship the Lord in the uses of life. 

121

12. And the Levites shall lay their 

12. And thus also he is able to acknowledge that 

hands upon the heads of the 
bullocks: and offer you the one for a
sin offering, and the other for a 
burnt offering, to the LORD, to make
atonement for the Levites. 

charity as-expressed in the natural man, is from 
the Lord, together with the remission of sins, the 
reception of such good, and its entire consecration
by the conjunction of the external man equally 
with the internal wholly to the Lord. 

13. And you shall set the Levites before 
Aaron, and before his sons, and 
offer them for a wave offering to the
LORD. 

13. And thus charity and its faith in the Spiritual 

Church, are in celestial love and its truths in the 
Celestial Church, the man of the church being 
vivified thereby. 

14. Thus shall you separate the Levites 
from among the children of Israel: 
and the Levites shall be mine. 

14. For charity is to be properly distinguished from 

faith, and is to be recognized as the only medium 
of conjunction with the Lord. 

15. And after that shall the Levites go in
to do the service of the tent of 
meeting: and you shall cleanse 
them, and offer them for a wave 
offering. 

15. And when this is done, all the uses of life and 

worship in heaven and the church are from charity
and love, as the result of purification from sin and
thence of vivification from the Lord. 

16. For they are wholly given to me 

16. For charity is truly the Lord's life with the man of 

from among the children of Israel; 
instead of all that opens the womb, 
even the firstborn of all the children 
of Israel, have I taken them to me. 

17. For all the firstborn among the 

children of Israel are mine, both 
man and beast: on the day that I 
smote all the firstborn in the land of 
Egypt I sanctified them for myself. 

18. And I have taken the Levites instead
of all the firstborn among the 
children of Israel. 

19. And I have given the Levites as a 
gift to Aaron and to his sons from 
among the children of Israel, to do 
the service of the children of Israel 
in the tent of meeting, and to make 
atonement for the children of Israel:
that there be no plague among the 
children of Israel, when the children
of Israel come near to the sanctuary.

the church, and is primary, although faith, in the 
beginning of regeneration appears to be so. 

17. And indeed even faith both in its inward and 
outward form, is from the Lord by love and 
charity; and this is made especially manifest when
man is delivered from the power of evil by the 
Lord's work of redemption, and is sanctified, by 
the reception of charity, 

18. So that no doubt remains as to the real origin of 

faith, or as to the conjunction of faith with charity.

19. Because charity in the Spiritual Church is the 

expression of celestial love and its truths, not only
for the performance of uses in life and worship 
with man, but also in the removal of evil, and thus
in the reconciliation of the natural with the 
spiritual man in every individual, in order that 
spiritual life may not be destroyed, and that 
external worship separated from internal may no 
longer prevail, through the destruction of remains.

122

20. Thus did Moses, and Aaron, and all 
the congregation of the children of 
Israel, to the Levites: according to 
all that the LORD commanded 
Moses touching the Levites, so did 
the children of Israel to them. 

20. And in this way, Divine Truth and Divine Good, 
with all their subordinate powers, even to 
ultimates, are unanimous in exalting charity, 
because Divine Love Itself flows into Divine 
Truth, and effects this by causing the external to 
act as one with the internal man. 

21. And the Levites purified themselves
from sin, and they washed their 
clothes; and Aaron offered them for 
a wave offering before the LORD; 
and Aaron made atonement for them
to cleanse them.. 

22. And after that went the Levites in to
do their service in the tent of 
meeting before Aaron, and before 
his sons: as the LORD had 
commanded Moses concerning the 
Levites, so did they to them. 

21. And the man of the church, as from himself, 
removes evil internally and externally, thus 
receiving life from the Lord in all its activity, as a 
consequence of the reconciliation of the external 
man with the internal through purification. 

22. And then the external man as well as the internal 
is fully in the performance of uses in life and 
worship through the power of celestial love and 
its truths, all this being accomplished by the 
influx of Divine Love into Divine Truth, and thus 
appearing outwardly as voluntary action on the 
part of man. 

23. And the LORD spoke to Moses, 

23. And further there is revelation from the Lord by 

saying, 

Divine Truth giving the perception, 

24. This is that which belongs to the 

Levites: from twenty and five years 
old and upward they shall go in to 
wait upon the service in the work of
the tent of meeting: 

24. That it is a universal law of Divine Order that 
during the state of imperfect conjunction as to 
faith and charity, man shall be engaged in conflict
against evil from a principle of good; 

25. And from the age of fifty years they
shall cease waiting upon the work, 
and shall serve HO more; 

25. But that when that conjunction is perfect all 

spiritual temptation shall cease, and man shall be 
free. 

26. But shall minister with their 

26. And then all the ministry of uses in life and 

brethren in the tent of meeting, to 
keep the charge, and shall do no 
service. Thus shall you do to the 
Levites touching their charges. 

worship will be from mutual love, and thus from 
freedom inwardly and outwardly; and it is the 
essential quality of charity thus to be, and thus to 
act.

DISCUSSION

The first section of this chapter is interesting, not only as describing the origin and derivation of 
spiritual light from the celestial heavens, but also as forming a connecting link with the previous 
account of the gifts by the princes, the result of which was, in the spiritual sense, as we have seen, the 

126

revelation of Divine Truth. For here that: subject is continued, and then appropriately follows an 
account of the purification of the Levites, representing the purification of those who are in charity. And,
of course, there cannot be such purification without the operation of Divine Truth inwardly, to which 
the light corresponds, and of the same outwardly, to which the water of expiation corresponds.

Now, the first three verses may be easily understood from what is said in the references; but the fourth 
requires a little particular study. The work of the candlestick signifies the communication of spiritual 
light to those in the middle heaven; but some remarks are necessary in reference to the Hebrew word 
variously translated beaten work and turned work in the versions, and in the Arcana Coelestia, solid. 
And it may be said that the lexicons justify all these meanings, so that we may assume that they are 
involved correspondentially in the internal sense; and the interpretation given in the series, namely, that
beaten or solid gold denotes "truths brought into order from good," may therefore be usefully 
considered under three aspects. It is the Lord Who arranges our truths in order under good; but the 
qualifying word implies a process, and we have to consider what that may be in regard to our 
experience.

To begin with, from the term beaten, which implies the exercise of force, and therefore refers to the 
exertion of the will, we may here learn that there must be resistance to evil on our part in order that the 
truths we have received, and which have enlightened our understandings, may take proper form and 
subordination under good.

That is, we must endure temptation; and that good may give an appropriate form to our truths, we must 
be victorious. We ought to consider this well; and those who do consider it, will not shrink from the 
hard work herein involved. We must not faint, therefore, nor be weary in well-doing, but we must be 
determined to conquer as from ourselves.

And then there is the wreathing or turning, and this implies the office of the understanding, and the 
application of are. Truths that are not understood are not likely to remain with us, and still less likely 
when they are not applied to use; but if we understand and skilfully utilize them, under the impulse of 
our best affections, then forms of beauty like an ornamental basis, and like flowers, may be the result; 
and our whole spiritual life may be lovely. And, indeed, we may be sure that it will be lovely; for the 
instinct of ornamentations seems to abound everywhere in nature, and much more so must it be the case
in the perfect heavenly state towards which we are tending. Moreover, we cannot imagine the love of 
what is beautiful being, so to speak, inherent in a sordid soul.

And, thirdly, there is the idea of solidity, or hardness, or spiritually in a bad sense, of obstinacy, and 
therefore in a good sense, of that firmness of character which is the result of a well-balanced 
understanding and will, and in fact of a fully established and confirmed stale of goodness conjoined 
with truth.

But, secondly, the influx of Divine light interiorly is not sufficient, and there must be the external 
purification of those who are in charity such as is represented by the use of the water of expiation, 
which denotes the truths of the Words properly adapted for this purpose. Notice particularly, here, the 
steps in the process. The first exposes evil and then removes it; and that is why it is called the water of 
expiation. But the truth by itself does not effect this; it is the operation of good by means of truth; and 
so it happens that the Hebrew word translated expiation also means a sin offering, that is, worship for 
the removal of evil in the natural man, as appears from the third section. But there must also be a 
"burnt-offering," or worship from love, or from the good of innocence. Thus we see the reason why 
there were two bullocks, the first signifying what is interior, and the second its exterior manifestation. 

127

And, in short, the second implies the work of repentance, since there is no removal of evil apart from 
this. Here, therefore, we may impress upon ourselves the thought that repentance does not consist 
simply of a single act of our lives, or even of a series of acts by which we express our sorrow for sin. 
On the contrary, it means rather a settled habit of the mind by which the evil which causes the sinful act
is also shunned. Let us consider this well.

And now we may observe that the rest of this section clearly describes, to put it in one general 
statement, the conjoint operation of all the powers of the mind, for the purification and making perfect 
of the whole human character through charity. But of course the subject of regeneration himself, only 
dimly feels and perceives the particulars of this operation. And yet if we take them one by one, as here 
set forth, they afford ample scope for reflection. It is a grand thing to be able to recognize charity as the
great bond of union between the heavens and mankind, and still a grander to feel that by charity we 
have conjunction with the Lord Himself. And then the double imposition of hands is highly suggestive, 
for it denotes communication, translation, and reception, the children of Israel laying their hands on the
Levites, the External acknowledging that charity is essential, and the Levites laying their hands on the 
heads of the bullocks, the Internal descending and causing itself to be realized in the External. Also the 
same kind of reciprocal action is involved in the double mention of the Levites as a wave offering. To 
offer a wave offering is to acknowledge that all the activity, or, as it is termed, vivification, of our life is
from the Lord. Now, it is most important that we should make this great truth actual with ourselves, for 
at least two purposes would be served by so doing; for on the one hand, as "Israelites," we should 
thereby cease to be energetic in what we do, on selfish principles, and should be more than ever active, 
as from ourselves on true and good principles; and on the other, as "Levites," we should be filled with 
ardent zeal, wisely directed by a spiritually enlightened judgement, in the consciousness of doing good 
from the Lord. And thus this spiritual wave offering would be at once a powerful stimulant inwardly 
and outwardly, and, in short, would become more and more a powerful and a perpetual stimulant. But 
this brings us into our fourth section, and something is to be said thereon.

"Charity is to be distinguished from faith, and is to be recognized as the only means of conjunction 
with the Lord." The reason is, because faith or truth, taken by itself, may be used either for selfish or 
for unselfish purposes, but charity or love cannot be selfish, and it is continually operative, with the 
spiritual man, from the Lord. Besides this, it may be property considered as the Lord's life in man, and 
we see why it is so especially the wave offering, and thus the very life of all faith, when it has full 
conjunction with it.

For the next section shows not only this, and that charity is to be expressed in the performances of uses,
but also how faith, which is represented by all the firstborn among the children of Israel, may 
apparently hold the chief place in the beginning of regeneration. And as it is very important to 
understand this part of our chapter, other portions of the Word, in which it is particularly explained in 
The internal sense, may be usefuly consulted, as, for example, the interesting allegory concerning Cain 
and Abel, and the history of Esau and Jacob in the Old Testament, and particularly what is frequently 
said about Peter, James and John, and their representation in the New Testament.

With regard to the section included in vers. 20-22, however, it is in be noticed that in the literal sense it 
is merely a statement that the instructions given to Moses and Aaron concerning the Levites were 
carried into effect; and yet a careful study of its, internal sense will show that it is so expressed as to 
reveal other truths in relation to the general subject, while at the same time there is a recapitulation of 
the orderly series according to man's experience, namely, purification internally and externally, the full 
activity of the Lord's life in consequence, the reconciliation of the external with the internal man

following, and lastly the performance of uses as the result of the whole process. And here, indeed, a 
moment's reflection will show that unless we are first purified, and then receive new life and energy 
from the Lord, we cannot perform genuine good works untainted with unworthy motives.

And now, therefore, it will be very interesting to consider our last section in its connection with all that 
precedes, noticing first, however, that in ver. 24, twenty-five years is named as the age at which the 
Levites were required to commence their duties instead of thirty, as in chap. iv., where the apparent 
discrepancy is considered in the commentary at the end of the chapter. But we now have to consider, 
from the spiritual side, why we have twenty-five and not thirty. In the first place, the literal sense in the 
former chapter, that is, numbering from thirty years old to fifty, expresses the whole duration of the 
"service" or "warfare," meaning, spiritually, the whole period during which there should be 
temptations; but, in this chapter, the literal sense describes rather the point at which this should begin, 
and that at which it should cease, meaning, spiritually, to distinguish the imperfect state of conjunction 
with the Lord at the commencement of temptations, from the state of rest when they should be over, as 
well as their duration. Now, the number thirty, which signifies "somewhat of combat," in relation to the 
number fifty, which denotes fullness, means little of temptation in relation to fullness of it; and there 
being twenty between the two numbers, involves the truth that conjunction with the Lord is effected by 
temptations, because twenty, like two, signifies conjunction. But, again, the relation between twenty-
five and fifty is that the former is half of the latter, thus denoting less of fullness and less of 
conjunction, rather than less of temptation like thirty, 10255. Hence then, again, we see, as well as from
the references given on ver. 24, that: twenty-five properly signifies there "the state of imperfect 
conjunction as to faith and charity," while in chap. iv. the number thirty properly signifies "somewhat 
of combat," that is, of spiritual temptations. But with regard to numbers in general, we do well to notice
that their specific signification is very often dependent on the connection in which they stand as to the 
subject and as to the series in the internal sense.

And, secondly, it is to be observed that what is said in this section about the service or warfare of the 
Levites in the tent of meeting, before the age of fifty, refers spiritually to the whole course of 
temptations experienced by him who is in charity during his state of truth, leading to his full realization
of good. For the purification of man from evil, and all the worship connected therewith, as represented 
by the washings and the sacrifices of different kinds, cannot be effected without temptations, and only 
one who is in charity, as a principle upon which he regulates his life, can endure temptations. For he 
who is in faith without charity, or in no faith at all, cannot, of course, experience any conflict between 
good and evil, and consequently any purification. Let us then "count it all joy when we enter into 
diverse temptations" (James 1:2).

THE CONTENTS OF EACH VERSE

1. And the LORD spoke to Moses in the 
wilderness of Sinai, in the first 
month of the second year after they 
were come out of the land of Egypt, 
saying, 

2. Moreover let the children of Israel 
keep the passover in its appointed 
season. 

3.

In the fourteenth day of this month, 
at even, you shall keep it in its 
appointed season: according to all 
the statutes of it, and according to all
the ordinances thereof, shall you 
keep it. 

1. There is revelation from the Lord by Divine Truth 
giving perception to the man of the Spiritual 
Church, when he is in obscurity as to good on 
account of deficiency as to truths, while yet he is 
in some truths conjoined with good through 
deliverance from evil, 

2. That such conjunction should be confirmed by the 
appropriation of good according to the state. 

3. For good is conjoined with truth in man, in passing
successively from an old state to one that is new 
according to the state specifically as regards things
external and things internal. 

4. And Moses spoke to the children of 
Israel, that they should keep the 
passover. 

4. For then man is prompted from within, and 

disposed from without to such conjunction and 
appropriation, 

5. And they kept the passover in the 

first month, on the fourteenth day of 
the month, at even, in the wilderness 
of Sinai: according to all that the 
LORD commanded Moses, so did the 
children of Israel. 

5. When faith is in its prime and is sanctified by love,
although the state is new and comparatively 
obscure, because there is perpetual influx from the 
Lord by Divine Truth, and man then cheerfully co-
operates. 

130

6. And there were certain men, who 

6. But some truths with man cannot, as yet, be 

were unclean by the dead body of a 
man, so that they could not keep the 
passover on that day: and they came 
before Moses and before Aaron on 
that day: 

7. And those men said to him, We are 
unclean by the dead body of a man: 
wherefore are we kept back, that we 
may not offer the oblation of the 
LORD in its appointed season among 
the children of Israel? 

8. And Moses said to them, Stay you; 
that I may hear what the LORD will 
command concerning you. 

conjoined with good, and thus fully appropriated, 
on account of the prevalence of evils and falsities, 
but nevertheless they are under the influence of 
Divine Truth in that state, 

7. Confessing, as individuals, from the light of truth, 
that they are impure through evil, being drawn into
external delights, and thus debarred from fully 
acknowledging the Lord in worship as to the 
external man; 

8.

In consequence of which they are undecided, and 
so are not fully receptive of influx from the Lord, 

9. And the LORD spoke to Moses, 

9. Until they receive revelation and thence perception

saying, 

from the Lord by Divine Truth, 

10. Speak to the children of Israel, 

10. That, in the case where evils for a time prevail 

saying, If any man of you or of your 
generations shall be unclean by 
reason of a dead body, or be in a 
journey afar off, yet he shall keep the
passover to the LORD: 

11. In the second month on the 

fourteenth day at even they shall 
keep it; they shall eat it with 
unleavened bread and bitter herbs: 

with them, and in the case of states of instruction, 
conjunction with the Lord and appropriation will 
still be possible. 

11. If the conjunction of good with truth and of truth 
with good is reciprocal at the end of a state of 
temptation, and thus of purification; and: in the 
beginning of a new state; for then the undelightful 
things of temptation are coming to an end, and 
good purified from falsity may be realized. 

12. They shall leave none of it to the 

12. For states of temptation cease when this takes 

morning, nor break a bone thereof: 
according to all the statute of the 
passover they shall keep it. 

place, and truths being purified remain entire, and 
good is conjoined with truth in externals. 

13. But the man that is clean, and is not 
in a journey, and live on to keep the 
passover, that soul shall be cut off 
from his people: because he offered 
not the oblation of the LORD in its 
appointed season, that man shall bear
his sin. 

13. But he who is neither in a state of temptation, nor 
of instruction, and yet neglects, to appropriate 
good in externals as well as internally is in danger 
of the separation of good from truth entirely; and if
he does not acknowledge the Lord by ascribing all 
good to Him in his conduct, then evil and falsity 
together will be confirmed in him. 

131

14. And if a stranger shall sojourn 
among you, and will keep the 
passover to the LORD; according to 
the statute of the pass-over, and 
according to the ordinance thereof, 
so shall he do: you shall have one 
statute, both for the stranger, and for 
him that is born in the land. 

15. And on the day that the tabernacle 

was reared up the cloud covered the 
tabernacle, even the tent of the 
testimony: and at even it was upon 
the tabernacle as it were the 
appearance of fire, until morning. 

14. He, however, who is not of the church, and yet is 
instructed and agrees thereto, being willing, may 
realize the conjunction of good and truth both 
externally and internally; for the law is the same in
regard to both the natural and spiritual man. 

15. And when the church is. established in man by 
means of the Word, he is in the appearances of 
truth therefrom, and in the literal sense; in every 
state of obscurity he has good and truth thence, 
and in every state of illustration. 

16. So it was always: the cloud covered 
it, and the appearance of fire by 
night. 

16. And this is perpetual; for all heavenly states with 
man are from the Word; and even in his obscurity 
its good and truth are revealed to him. 

17. And whenever the cloud was taken 
up from over the Tent, then after that
the children of Israel journeyed: and 
in the place where the cloud abode, 
there the children of Israel 
encamped. 

17. Moreover, all states of progress and rest with man 
are according to the Word, the former taking place 
when its good and truth are revealed, and the latter
when they are in obscurity. 

18. At the commandment of the LORD 

the children of Israel journeyed, and 
at the commandment of the LORD 
they encamped: as long as the cloud 
abode upon the tabernacle they 
remained encamped. 

18. And thus by the Divine Providence, instruction is 
received from the Word; and by Him, from the 
Word, are all the states of man ordinated and 
arranged; nor is man, from himself, aware of such 
ordination and arrangement, because with regard 
to this he is in obscurity. 

19. And when the cloud tarried upon the 
tabernacle many days, then the 
children of Israel kept the charge of 
the LORD, and journeyed not. 

20. And sometimes the cloud was a few 
days upon the tabernacle; then 
according to the commandment of 
the LORD they remained encamped, 
and according to the commandment 
of the LORD they journeyed. 

19. But during such obscurity, progress in the spiritual 

life is delayed; yet there is no retrogression 
although there is no progress. 

20. And even when good is in obscurity, and not so 

much truth, there is delay, because it is good from 
the Lord that determines man's state as to progress,
and as to the ordination and arrangement of truths. 

132

21. And sometimes the cloud was from 
evening until morning; and when the
cloud was taken up in the morning, 
they journeyed: or if it continued by 
day and by night, when the cloud 
was taken up, they journeyed. 

22. Whether it were two days, or a 
month, or a year, that the cloud 
tarried upon the tabernacle, abiding 
thereon, the children of Israel 
remained encamped, and journeyed 
not: but when it was taken up, they 
journeyed. 

23. At the commandment of the LORD 

they encamped, and at the 
commandment of the LORD they 
journeyed: they kept the charge of 
the LORD, at the commandment of 
the LORD by the hand of Moses. 

REFERENCES AND NOTES

21. Also, with respect to a state of obscurity or 
brightness, it is the latter which leads man 
forward; but there are states of both successively, 
which do not promote any advance. 

22. Or whether the conjunction of good and truth be 

from obedience, from faith or from love, obscurity
of state involves delay, but the removal of 
obscurity means progress. 

23. But all states of progress or rest are from the Lord,
although man must cooperate with the Lord, 
believing that he receives life from Him 
continually by Divine Truth. 

1. The Lord speaking to Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, denotes revelation from the Lord by 

Divine Truth giving perception to the man of the Spiritual Church when he is in obscurity as to
good on account of deficiency as to truths, 2001, 2951, 7010, 1822, 8753; and in the first 
month of the second year after they were come out of the land of Egypt, saying, denotes that 
yet he is in some truths conjoined with good through deliverance from evil, 7900, 3814, 851, 
5104, 8866. 

2. The children of Israel being required to keep the passover in its appointed season, denotes that 
such conjunction should be confirmed by the appropriation of good according to the state, 
2342, 2187, 2212, 7867. 

3.

In the fourteenth day of this month, between the evenings, keeping it at the appointed season, 
denotes that good is conjoined with truth in man in passing successively from an old state to 
one that is new, 7900, 5194, 1686, 7901, 10135; and according to all the statutes thereof, and 
according to all the ordinances thereof, denotes according to the state specifically as regards 
things external and internal, 7995, 3382. 

4. Moses speaking to the children of Israel that they should keep the passover, denotes that then 

man is prompted from within, and disposed from without to such conjunction and 
appropriation, 7010, 2951, 2342, 2187. 

5. Actually keeping the passover, in the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month, between 
the evenings in the wilderness of Sinai, denotes conjunction and appropriation when faith is in 
its prime and is sanctified by love, although the state is new and comparatively obscure, 2342, 
2187, 7900, 3814, 10135, 8753; and according to all that the Lord commanded Moses, so the 

133

children of Israel doing, denotes because there is perpetual influx from the Lord by Divine 
Truth, and man then cheerfully co-operates, 2001, 5486, 7010, 4258. 

6. Certain men that were unclean by the dead body of a man, so that they could not keep the 

passover on that day, denotes that some truths with man cannot be conjoined with good, and 
thus fully appropriated on account of the prevalence of evils and falsities, 718, 2342, 2187, 
10130, 5407, 390010, 487; and their coming before Moses and before Aaron then, denotes that,
nevertheless, they are under the influence of Divine Truth and Good in that state, 7010, 9946. 

7. Those men saying "we are unclean by the dead body of a man," denotes confession from the 
light of truth, that they are impure through evil, being drawn into external delights, 1822, 
7010, 5407, 390010; and "wherefore are we kept back that we may not offer the oblation of the
Lord in its appointed season among the children of Israel?" denotes that thus they are debarred
from fully acknowledging the Lord in worship, as to the external man, 248, 349, 2212. 

8. Moses saying "Stay you; that I may hear what the Lord will command concerning you," 

denotes that they are undecided, and so far, not fully receptive of influx from the Lord, 3175, 
3163, 2001, 5486. 

9. This is evident, because by Jehovah is denoted the Divine Being as to His love, 2001; by 

speaking is denoted influx, 2951; by Moses is represented Divine Truth, or the Word; and by 
saying is denoted perception, 1791, 1822. 

10. Speaking to the children of Israel and saying "If any man of you or of your generations be 

unclean by reason of a dead body, denotes revelation, in the case where evils for a time prevail
with them, 25,91, 1822, 10130, 5407, 390010; being on a journey afar off, denotes being in a 
state of instruction, 5996, 7908, 8918; and being still required to keep the passover to the 
Lord, denotes that conjunction and appropriation will still be possible, 2342, 2187. 

11. Keeping the passover in the second month, on the fourteenth day between the evenings, 

denotes a state of the reciprocal conjunction of good with truth, and of truth with good, at the 
end of a state of temptation, because the second month denotes the conjunction of good with 
truth, 851, 3814, 5194, the fourteenth day, denotes the conjunction of truth with good, as well 
as a holy state on account of two and seven being involved, 5194, 7900, and between the 
evenings, denotes the end of a state of temptation and thus of purification, and also the 
beginning of a new state, 10135, 7901; and eating it with unleavened bread and bitter herbs, 
denotes that then the undelightful things of temptation are coming to an end, and good purified
from falsity may be realized, 7853, 7854. 

12. Not leaving any of it until the morning, denotes that states of temptation cease when this takes 
place, 7860; not breaking a bone thereof, denotes that ultimate truths being purified remain 
entire, 8005; and keeping it according to all the statute of it, denotes that good is conjoined 
with truth in external things, 2342, 3382. 

13. The man that is clean, and is not in a journey, denotes one neither in a state of temptation, nor 
of instruction, 4545, 5996, 7908, 8918; forbearing to keep the passover, denotes neglecting to 
appropriate good in externals as well as internally, 2342, 2187; that soul being cut off from his 
people, denotes to be in danger of separating good from truth entirely, 5302, 1259; not offering
the oblation of the Lord in its appointed season, denotes non-acknowledgement of the Lord by 

134

ascribing all good to Him in his conduct, 10227, 349, 2212; and that man bearing his sin, 
denotes that then evil and falsity together will be confirmed in him, 9937. 

14. A stranger denotes one who is not of the church and yet is; instructed and agrees thereto, 1463;
to be willing to keep the passover, denotes being willing and realizing the conjunction and 
appropriation of good and truth externally, 2342, 2187; doing according to the statute and the 
ordinance of it, denotes realization externally and internally, 7995, 3382; and one statute both 
for the stranger and for him that is born in the land, denotes that the law is the same both for 
the natural and the spiritual man, 8013. 

15. The day that the tabernacle was reared up, denotes when the church is established in man by 

means of the Word, 487, 3210, 35403, 6315; the cloud covering the tabernacle even the tent of 
the testimony, denotes the appearances of truth from the Word and its literal sense, 8106; and 
its being on the tabernacle at even as it were the appearance of fire until the morning, denotes 
that in every state of obscurity the man of the church has good and truth from the Word, and 
also in every state of brightness, 8108. 

16. So it being always; the cloud covering the tabernacle, and the appearance of fire by night, 
denotes that this is perpetual because all heavenly states with man are from the Word; and 
even in his obscurity its good and truth are revealed to him. This is seen by observing that in 
states of brightness, denoted by morning, the revelation of Divine Truth is moderated by the 
obscurity of the human understanding, and in states of obscurity, denoted by evening and 
night, the love of the Lord in the heart vivifies and cheers the soul, 8108. 

17. The children of Israel journeying whenever the cloud was taken up from the Tent, and 

encamping where the cloud abode, denotes that all states of progress and rest with man, are 
according to the Word, the former taking place when its good and truth are revealed, and the 
latter when they are in obscurity, 8108, 1457, 4236, 3613. 

18. The children of Israel journeying and encamping at the commandment of the Lord, denotes 

that thus by the Divine Providence instruction is received from the Word, and by Him from the
Word, are all the states of man ordinated and arranged, 1457, 8560, 4236; and remaining 
encamped as long as the cloud abode upon the tabernacle, denotes that man, from himself is 
not aware of such ordination and arrangement, because with regard to this he is in obscurity, 
4236, 8106. 

19. When the cloud tarried upon the tabernacle many days, then the children of Israel keeping the 
charge of the Lord and not journeying, denotes that during such obscurity progress in spiritual 
life is delayed; yet there is no retrogression, although there is no progress, 8106, 3613, 3382, 
1457. 

20. By the cloud being sometimes a few days upon the tabernacle, is denoted delay on account of 
obscurity as to good, more than as to truth, because the terms many and few, in the internal 
sense, have relation, respectively, to states of truth and good, and not to mere number, 6172, 
6654, and because in Matt 20:16, the few that were chosen evidently denote the good, and the 
many that were called those who are in truths without good, altogether apart from the 
numbers; for otherwise it would have to be concluded that only a few of the human race will 
be saved, which is very far from being true, 37554, 39004; arid by remaining encamped, or 
journeying according to the commandment, or mouth, of the Lord, is denoted that it is good 

135

from the Lord which determines man's state as to progress, and as to the ordination and 
arrangement of truths, 8560, 2001, 4236, 1457. 

21. The cloud being sometimes from evening to morning, denotes successive states of obscurity 

and brightness, 8106, 8108; the cloud being taken up in the morning, and their then 
journeying, denotes that man is led forward in states of brightness, 1457, 8108; the cloud 
continuing by day and by night, denotes sometimes no progress in both states, 8106, 8108; and
still journeying when the cloud was taken up, denotes progress afterwards, 8106, 1457. 

22. By two is denoted conjunction, 5194; by days, and months, and a year are denoted 

respectively states of obedience, of faith, and of love, according to the series, 487, 851, 7828; 
the cloud tarrying and abiding on the tabernacle, denotes that obscurity of state involves delay,
8106, 4236, 3613; and journeying when the cloud was taken up, denotes that the removal of 
obscurity means progress, 8106, 1457. 

23. Encamping or journeying at the commandment, or mouth, of the Lord, denotes that states of 

rest or progress are from the Lord, 4236, 1457, 8560; and keeping the charge of the Lord at the
commandment, or mouth of the Lord, by the hand of Moses, denotes that man must co-operate
with the Lord, believing that he receives life from Him continually by Divine Truth, 3382, 
8560, 878, 7010. 

DISCUSSION

It is so well known in the Christian world that the feast of the Passover was appointed to commemorate
the deliverance of the Israelites from Egyptian bondage, and that, generally, it signifies man's 
deliverance from the bondage of sin, that it is not necessary to demonstrate these things. But it is not so 
well known what the particulars concerning this feast signify, nor can it be known apart from an 
acquaintance with the correspondences in which the Word is written. What, for example, is meant, 
spiritually, by the destruction of all the firstborn of the Egyptians, and the sacrifice of the lamb in order 
that the firstborn of the Israelites might be preserved? A thousand guesses may be made, and many 
fancies indulged, to account for such facts, and to show what they signify as far as the spiritual life is 
concerned; but without this universal law of correspondence, no satisfactory explanation can be given; 
and therefore this should afford strong presumptive evidence, not only that the law itself is a law of 
Divine Order, but that it is applicable both to the works of the Lord and to His Word. And when we 
consider further, what wonderful results have followed from its application to the Word, through the 
explanation of several of its books in series, we ought to be fully convinced that these books are the 
Word of the Lord, and were not the work of any finite man. Let us then reverently consider the subject 
now before us; and as a preliminary step, reflect on what is said on the above-named points. The 
firstborn of the Egyptians, denote faith separated from charity, and the firstborn of the Israelites faith 
conjoined with charity, 7778, 352; while a lamb denotes the good of innocence, and in the supreme 
sense the Lord Himself from whom all innocence comes, 7840, 39946, and thus we learn that, 
personally, we are delivered from evil by means of a true faith in the Lord grounded in the good of 
innocence from Him; and that to keep the Passover, is to be conjoined with the Lord, and to appropriate
good from Him. And before leaving this point, it may be interesting to notice the signification of the 
blood of the lamb being sprinkled on the lintel, and on the two side posts of the houses. The blood, of 
course, signifies the holy truth which is of the good of innocence; putting it upon the posts and upon the
lintel denotes that, in this connection, it signifies the truths and goods of the natural degree, the houses 
denoting what has relation to good, and eating denoting enjoyment, or making this truth and good a 

136

part of the natural life; while doing it in that night signifies when evil is condemned and rejected by the 
regenerating man, even in the state denoted in our chapter by "between the evenings," 7845. And thus 
we see that these are all practical truths that have to be realized by each of us; and we may be sure that 
the same is the case with all the other particulars named in the paragraph just referred to, and also in 
our first section. A word, however, must be said, on the expression "between the evenings," because 
different opinions are held as to its precise meaning. Spiritually, it signifies the state of transition from 
the old and corrupt life to the beginning of the new life, 7844; but literally, some suppose it is the time 
between the setting of the sun and the moment when the stars become visible; others maintain that it is 
to be reckoned from the time when the sun begins to decline from the meridian to its setting; and 
others, again, that the two evenings were the time immediately before, and immediately after sunset 
(Kitto, are. "Passover"). But now, considering these differences of opinion, the following words have 
special interest: "That by between the evenings is not meant the time between the evening of one day 
and the evening of another day, but the time between evening and morning, thus, inclusively, night or 
twilight, is evident from this, that the continual burnt offering of a lamb, was not only made in the 
evening, but also in the morning. Hence it may be manifest that the like is signified in other places by 
between the evenings, as where it is said that they should offer the passover between the evenings 
(Exod 12:6; Num 9:5. 11), which is also explained elsewhere in these words, 'You shall sacrifice the 
passover in the evening, when the sun has set' at the stated time of departure out of Egypt, afterwards 
you shall roast and eat it in that place which Jehovah your God shall choose, and you shall respect the 
morning, and shall go into your tents' (Deut 16:6, 7)." And to this it may be added that as, clearly, the 
passover was sacrificed, or was commanded to be sacrificed, when the sun was set, it follows that the 
first evening was just after sunset and that therefore the second evening was just before sunrise on the 
following morning, "between the evenings," thus meaning the time between the sunset of one day and 
the sunrise of the next, corresponding as already stated to the state of transition between the old life and
the new.

Coming now to our second and third sections, which may be considered together on account of the 
connection between them, it is only necessary, in the first place, to observe that they are not only easy 
to comprehend, spiritually, but are of great practical importance. For who cannot see that this 
description is according to our actual experience? We are in the course of regeneration, and our 
principles of faith and charity are, so far, established; and yet we are unclean by the dead body of a 
man, that is, evils and falsities in the natural man, which is as yet void of spiritual life in several 
respects, infest and contaminate us. And it is well for us if, in this state, we can acknowledge our 
deficiencies, and are uncertain about our duty, until we are enlightened from the Word, according to 
vers. 7-9. And it is still better, in this case, if in spite of our weakness, we persevere in our worship of 
the Lord; for this is what compliance with the instruction here given really amounts to; and to eat the 
passover in the second month exactly as directed, is to convert what would otherwise be a failure into a 
success, by doubling our exertions to be conjoined with the Lord, even in our extremity, which is 
denoted by eating the passover in the evening, and by resolutely abstaining from the tempting evil, and 
patiently enduring the necessary conflict, which are denoted by eating with unleavened bread, and 
bitter herbs. But, indeed, in addition to these experiences, we now, as final results, cease to contaminate
our life of good by continuing to indulge in the delights of evil, which is involved in not leaving any of 
the passover until the morning, 8480; and also we preserve our truths entire, in being victorious, which 
is signified by not breaking a bone of it, 8005. But with regard to the next section, which concludes 
what is said about the passover, what has already been said, combined with the explanation in giving 
the references thereon is sufficient to make its meaning clear; and we now proceed, therefore, to study 
the last section.

As the tabernacle and the tent of meeting represent the heavens in successive order, so also, in a lower 
degree, they represent the church, and in particular every man who has the principles which make the 
church within him. And the church is said to be established in man, when faith and charity are his 
ruling principles instead of the loves of the world and of himself, at the beginning of regeneration; and 
this is the sense in which we are to regard the words commencing the section on account of all that 
follows, because the journeyings of the Israelites denote the successive states of progress with the man 
of the church, 81021/2. But the cloud covered the tabernacle; and we have seen from the series what 
that indicates spiritually. This, however, is not all that is involved in the fact. It is true that through the 
literal sense of the Word there is revelation 1o man in every state. But it is also true that the same sense 
hides the glory and the beauty of the internal sense, which describes those principles which are 
represented by the tabernacle and all things in it, and this for the best and wisest of purposes, namely, 
lest man should enter into those truths before he is prepared, and so it is written, "Over all the glory 
there shall be a covering" (Isaiah 4:5). And here particular attention should be paid to the last clause of 
ver. 18. Encamping denotes the ordination and arrangement of man's truths under good, which is 
entirely the work of the Lord; and as this refers to the progressions of man's regeneration, although it 
may also be applied to angelic life as well, we may consider one point in connection with it, which is 
revealed in the Writings of the church. It is that, as we advance, we acquire what is called the good of 
truth, that is the state as to love and charity, which may he obscurely realized at any period of our life 
by obeying the truth; and this state of good is clearly that to which the encampment corresponds, while 
the arrangement of the camp at any particular spot, corresponds to the arrangement of truths by the 
Lord according to that particular state of good. Now we do not know what that is; hut we may be sure 
that it is one step in our journey towards our own heavenly society in which we shall realize and 
understand our proper position in the heavenly kingdom, which will be permanent. And these 
reflections may encourage us to "run with patience the race set before us" (Heb 12:1). For we may 
depend upon it, that every state of our life has its relation to that which is eternal.

And now, lastly, it is very interesting indeed to notice and reflect upon the several different things 
specified in the rest of the chapter. First, there is the state of obedience during seasons of repose; 
secondly, there is the state when good is in obscurity and not so much truth, as indicated by the 
distinction many and few; thirdly, progress made in a state of brightness signified by morning, and 
repose in a state of obscurity represented by night; fourthly, states of repose continuing both during 
states of brightness and states of obscurity; and, lastly, seasons of repose in states of obedience, or of 
faith, or of love, respectively, from all of which we may learn something with regard to our conduct in 
life. But certainly the closing statement of the chapter, namely, that states of rest and progress are all 
from the Lord, is worthy of very serious consideration. For it teaches us emphatically, that we cannot 
from any self-derived intelligence, or under the influence of any merely worldly or selfish motive, 
promote our own spiritual progress, or enjoy any seasons of spiritual repose. Of course, the contrary 
does appear to us, at certain times, to be surely the case, since the motives just mentioned do cause 
people to do many good things, but although usefulness to others may thereby be promoted, it is yet 
quite evident that no one can advance in the religious life by such actions, since it is impossible to serve
two masters, or in other words, to act from selfishness and charity at the same time as ruling motives. 
Hence, therefore, if we would properly act according to the commandment of the Lord, we must cease 
to allow self and the world to rule us, at the same time remembering that to take proper care of 
ourselves and our property is not, necessarily, cither selfish or worldly.

Numbers Chapter 10

SUMMARY OF THE SPIRITUAL SENSE

1. Concerning revelation from the Lord, that it is adapted to man in all his changes of state; and 
that it has relation to good, and truth, and their conjunction. Also that it is from Divine Good 
by Divine Truth; and that it is perpetual, being adequate to every state of conflict, and to every 
state of rest and peace, vers. 1-10. 

2. Man's progress in regeneration is from a state of obscurity into a state of spiritual light, vers. 

11-13. 

3.

It begins by a change as to the celestial things of love, vers. 14-17;

4. This causes changes as to its spiritual things successively, these proceeding from inmost 

affections to those which are relatively external, ver. 18-21. 

5.

It then follows that the inmost of the ultimate heaven, or of the natural degree, is affected, and 
makes progress in due order and subordination, vers. 22-24. 

6. And, lastly, the external of the ultimate heaven, or of the natural degree, advances in a similar 

order and subordination; and thus the whole heaven, the whole church, or the whole 
individual, moves forward, vers. 25-28. 

7. But not only so. For those who are in the truth of simple good, outside the church, are also 

influenced and make progress, vers. 29-32. 

8. And, more than all, the Lord Himself is the Leader of His people, by means of the Word; while
His church acknowledges that all progress is from Him, even through states of conflict into 
states of peace and rest continually, vers. 33-36. 

THE CONTENTS OF EACH VERSE

1. And the LORD spoke to Moses, 

1. There is revelation from the Lord by Divine Truth 

saying, 

giving the perception, 

2. Make you two trumpets of silver; of 

beaten work shall you make them: 
and you shall use them for the 
calling of the congregation, and for 
the journeying of the camps. 

2. That such revelation has relation to Divine Good, 
Divine Truth, and their conjunction, because the 
former is expressed in the latter so that while 
Divine Good unites under itself all Divine Truths, 
Divine Truths are the means by which progress is 
made in the course of regeneration. 

3. And when they shall blow with 
them, all the congregation shall 
gather themselves to you at the door 
of the tent of meeting. 

3. And thence, when revelation is made, the whole 

church is united under its leading principle, by the 
acknowledgement of the Lord, and of conjunction 
with Him by charity and love generally. 

139

4. And if they blow but with one, then 

the princes, the heads of the 
thousands of Israel, shall gather 
themselves to you. 

4. But the particular revelation of Divine Truths is 
made to those who are in the love of primary 
truths of the first degree; that is, in the love of 
interior things; 

5. And when you blow an alarm, the 
camps that lie on the east side shall 
take their journey. 

5. And revelation, which appeals more especially to 
the affections, produces changes of state and 
progress. 

6. And when you blow an alarm the 
second time, the camps that lie on 
the south side shall take their 
journey: they shall blow an alarm for
their journeys. 

6. Still, such as affects both feeling and thought in 

conjunction, or the external as well as the internal 
man, is productive of greater advance; for all 
progress is according to the state as to affection; 
and truth is revealed in order that it may minister 
to good. 

7. But when the assembly is to be 

7. But revelation as to truths intended, afterwards, to 

gathered together, you shall blow, 
but you shall not sound an alarm. 

be arranged in order under good, is not, 
necessarily, accompanied by the particular 
excitement of the affection of good. 

8. And the sons of Aaron, the priests, 
shall blow with the trumpets; and 
they shall be to you for a statute for 
ever throughout your generations. 

9. And when you go to war in your 
land against the adversary that 
oppresses you, then you shall sound 
an alarm with the trumpets; and you 
shall be remembered before the 
LORD your God, and you shall be 
saved from your enemies. 

8. And all revelation is from Divine Good by Divine 
Truth, being made through the internal man to the 
external, during regeneration continually. 

9. And in every state of spiritual conflict against evils
which hinder spiritual progress, good is the ruling 
principle and truth the guiding principle; for 
Divine Good and Divine Truth control all things, 
and from the Lord alone is all salvation. 

10. Also in the day of your gladness, and

10. Moreover, in all activity of the affections in 

in your set feasts, and in the 
beginnings of your months, you shall
blow with the trumpets over your 
burnt offerings, and over the 
sacrifices of your peace offerings; 
and they shall be to you for a 
memorial before your God; I am the 
LORD your God. 

particular and in general, and in every new state of
faith, revelation is made, when the affections are 
consecrated to the Lord inwardly and outwardly 
from freedom; and truths revealed to the 
understanding are always the manifestation of the 
Divine Love, because this is the origin of Divine 
Truth; and the Lord alone is to be worshiped. 

11. And it came to pass in the second 
year, in the second month, on the 
twentieth day of the month, that the 
cloud was taken up from over the 
tabernacle of the testimony. 

11. But it happens after a state of instruction in Divine 
Truths, when there is some conjunction with the 
Lord as to charity, as to faith, and as to obedience, 
that revelation is made through heaven from the 
Lord by good and truth; 

140

12. And the children of Israel set 

forward according to their journeys 
out of the wilderness of Sinai; and 
the cloud abode in the wilderness of 
Paran. 

12. And the man of the Spiritual Church passes from a
state of obscurity on account of deficiency as to 
truths, to a state of spiritual light in which the 
Divine Human is acknowledged, but still 
obscurely. 

13. And they first took their journey 

according to the commandment of 
the LORD by the hand of Moses. 

13. And this change of state takes place by influx from
the Lord, through Divine Truth manifested in its 
power. 

14. And in the first place the standard of
the camp of the children of Judah set
forward according to their hosts: and
over his host was Nahshon the son of
Amminadab. 

14. For the inmost truths of man's life are first affected
by this influx, these being celestial love and its 
truths in orderly arrangement, governed by the 
perception of truth from love, derived from 
primary Divine Truth. 

15. And over the host of the tribe of the 

children of Issachar was Nethanel 
the son of Zuar. 

15. And the governing principle of those who are in 
mutual love and its truths, is the good of inmost 
truth derived from inmost love, which is a state of 
profound humility. 

16. And over the host of the tribe of the 

children of Zebulun was Eliab the 
son of Helon. 

16. While that of those who are in the heavenly 
marriage, is truth conjoined with good and 
proceeding therefrom. 

17. And the tabernacle was taken down; 
and the sons of Gershon and the sons
of Merari, who bare the tabernacle, 
set forward. 

17. But a change as to celestial things, which are 

inmost, produces a change as to spiritual things 
which are interior, and thence as to exterior and 
external things which support things interior; 

18. And the standard of the camp of 
Reuben set forward according to 
their hosts: and over his host was 
Elizur the son of Shedeur. 

19. And over the host of the tribe of the 

children of Simeon was Shelumiel 
the son of Zurishaddai. 

20. And over the host of the tribe of the 
children of Gad was Eliasaph the son
of Deuel. 

18. So that those who are in the inmost of the Spiritual
Church, or of the spiritual degree, with its truths in
orderly arrangement, are now affected; and their 
governing principle is faith from charity which is 
the foundation of the church. 

19. And the governing principle of those who are in 
the good of truth, is obedience giving peace with 
God, and founded on the power of faith from 
charity; 

20. While the governing principle of those who are in 
good works, proceeding both from celestial and 
spiritual love, is the perfection of good and truth in
conjunction, derived from Divine knowledge as 
now seen from a state of charity. 

141

21. And the Kohathites set forward, 

bearing the sanctuary: and the other 
did set up the tabernacle against they
came. 

21. And those who are in inmost truths from good, in 
the Spiritual Church, advance in order, supporting 
celestial love and spiritual love together, and, in 
the meantime, the external church is established as
a support to the internal. 

22. And the standard of the camp of the 
children of Ephraim set forward 
according to their hosts: and over his
host was Elishama the son of 
Ammihud. 

22. Whence it follows that those who are in faith from 

charity in the inmost of the ultimate heaven, now 
make progress in orderly arrangement, their 
governing principle being obedience to truth from 
the love of good. 

23. And over the host of the tribe of the 
children of Manasseh was Gamaliel 
the son of Pedahzur. 

24. And over the host of the tribe of the 
children of Benjamin was Abidan the
son of Gideoni. 

25. And the standard of the camp of the 
children of Dan, which was the 
rearward of all the camps, set 
forward according to their hosts: and
over his host was Ahiezer the son of 
Ammishaddai. 

26. And over the host of the tribe of the 
children of Asher was Pagiel the son 
of Ochran. 

27. And over the host of the tribe of the 

children of Naphtali was Ahira the 
son of Enan. 

23. And the governing principle of those who are in 
the new will of good, in the same heaven, is the 
love of reward, as if from self, the knowledge of 
the truth, and separation from evil through the 
work of redemption; 

24. While that of those who are in the life of truth 
from good in the natural man, and from the 
medium between the interior of the natural man 
and the exterior, or between the interior celestial 
and the exterior spiritual of the ultimate heaven, is 
truth from good springing from opposition to evil. 

25. But those who are in the affirmation of truth in the 
natural man, and have their position in the obscure
truth of the ultimate heaven, in orderly 
arrangement, are the last to make progress, their 
governing principle being truth which aids, 
derived from Divine Truth which protects man in 
temptation. 

26. And the governing principle of those who are in 
exterior natural delight, in that heaven, is 
opposition to evil derived from a state of spiritual 
trial and affliction; 

27. While that of those who are in resistance to evil, in
the ultimate degree of the natural man, or of the 
ultimate heaven, is good derived from the truth of 
the Divine Word. 

28. Thus were the journeyings of the 

children of Israel according to their 
hosts; and they set forward. 

28. And this is the law of progress with the man of the
church; and thus he proceeds in all his changes of 
state. 

142

29. And Moses said to Hobab, the son of
Reuel the Midianite, Moses' father in
law, We are journeying to the place 
of which the LORD said, I will give it
you: come you with us, and we will 
do you good: for the LORD has 
spoken good concerning Israel. 

30. And he said to him, I will not go; but

I will depart to mine own land, and 
to my kindred. 

29. But with those who are in the truth of simple good,
from which good is the conjunction of good and 
truth, there is the perception, that that conjunction 
is to be effected during the progress of 
regeneration, because it is according to the will of 
the Lord, and hence, according to Divine Truth, 
that the man of the church desires that truth should
be reciprocally conjoined to good; for it is gnod 
which constitutes the church, essentially. 

30. But those in the truth of simple good, in their first 
state, are not willing to admit that conjunction, 
having a tendency to abide in the truth of simple 
good owing to actual evil from what is hereditary. 

31. And he said, Leave us not, I pray 

31. The Lord, however, by Divine Truth desires to 

you; for as much as you know how 
we are to encamp in the wilderness, 
and you shall be to us instead of 
eyes. 

conjoin all men to Himself; and it is the function 
of those who are in truths, to perceive that truths 
must come into orderly arrangement under good, 
even with those in the obscurity of simple good; 
and good needs truth in order that it may be saved.

32. And it shall be, if you go with us, 
yea, it shall be, that what good 
soever the LORD shall do to us, the 
same will we do to you. 

32. And therefore it is necessary that truth should be 

conjoined with good, and good with truth, in order 
that good received by the internal man from the 
Lord, may be fully manifested by the external. 

33. And they set forward from the mount
of the LORD three days' journey; and 
the ark of the covenant of the LORD 
went before them three days' 
journey, to seek out a resting-place 
for them. 

33. For then the whole church advances from an 

obscure state of love to the Lord by successive 
degrees, since Divine Good and Divine Truth 
conjoined lead the way, through states of conflict 
to a state of rest and peace. 

34. And the cloud of the. LORD was over
them by day, when they set forward 
from the camp. 

34. And the man of the church is guided by the Lord, 
through the Word, in every state of spiritual 
progress, 

35. And it came to pass, when the ark set
forward, that Moses said, Rise up, O 
LORD, and let your enemies he 
scattered; and let them that hate you 
flee before you. 

35. So that he perceives and acknowledges his 

dependence upon the Lord, and the Word for 
protection against his spiritual enemies which are 
falsities and evils; 

36. And when it rested, he said, Return, 
O LORD, to the ten thousands of the 
thousands of Israel. 

36. And also that in every state of victory, and thus of 
repose, a more perfect conjunction of goodness 
and truth is effected. 

143

REFERENCES AND NOTES

1. This is evident, because by Jehovah is denoted the Divine Being as to His love, 2001; by 

speaking is denoted influx, 2951; by Moses is represented Divine Truth, or the Word, 7010; 
and by saying is denoted perception, 1791, 1822.

2. By making two trumpets.of silver is denoted that such revelation has relation to Divine Good, 
Divine Truth, and their conjunction, 8802, 5194, 425; by their being made of beaten, or turned,
or solid work, is denoted that good is expressed in truth, 9510; by being used for the calling of 
the congregation is denoted that Divine Good unites under itself all Divine Truths, 6335, 6338,
7843; and by the journeying of the camps is denoted that Divine Truths are the means by 
which progress is made in the course of regeneration, 1457, 4236. 

3. When they shall blow with the trumpets all the congregation gathering themselves together to 
Moses at the door of the tent of meeting, denotes that thence, when revelation is made, the 
whole church is united under its leading principle by the acknowledgement of the Lord, and of
conjunction with Him by charity and love generally, 8802, 6338, 7010, 2356, 35403. 

4.

If they blow with one trumpet, then the princes, the heads of the thousands of Israel gathering 
themselves to Moses, denotes that the particular revelation of Divine Truths is made to those 
who are in the love of primary truths of the first degree, that is, in the love of interior things, 
8802, 2089, 3728, 8712, 6338. 

5. When an alarm was blown the camps on the east side taking their journey, denotes that 

revelation which appeals more especially to the affections, produces changes of state and 
progress, 8815, 4236, 3708, 9668. 

6. Blowing an alarm the second time denotes revelation which affects both feeling and thought in
conjunction, or the external as well as the internal man, 8815, 5194; the camps on the south

their journeys denotes that all progress is according to the state of the affections, 8815, also 
that truth is revealed in order that it may minister to good, 1457. 

7. When the assembly is to be gathered together, blowing but not sounding an alarm, denotes that

revelation as to truths intended, afterwards, to be arranged in order under good, is not 
necessarily accompanied by the particular excitement of the affection of good. This appears 
from the signification of blowing with one trumpet, and not sounding an alarm, ver. 4, as 
denoting only revelation as to truths, and from the signification of sounding an alarm, as 
denoting revelation affecting the feelings, ver. 5, or the thoughts in conjunction with the 
feelings, ver. 6. 

8. The sons of Aaron the priests blowing with the trumpets denotes that all revelation is from 

Divine Good by Divine Truth, 8802, 9946; and their being a statute for ever throughout their 
generations denotes revelation through the internal man to the external, during regeneration 
continually, 7884, 9042. 

9. By going to war in the land against the adversary that oppresses you, is denoted every state of 
spiritual conflict against evils which hinders spiritual progress, 1664, 9314, 9196; by sounding

principle, 8802, 8815, ver. 7; by being remembered before the Lord your God is denoted that 

144

Divine Good and Divine Truth control all things, 2001, 9849; and by being saved from 
enemies is denoted that from the Lord alone is all salvation, 2001, 9314, 10219, 10655. 

10. In the day of your gladness, in your set feasts, and in the beginning of your months, denotes all
the activity of the affections in particular and in general in the worship of the Lord, and also all
new states, 9286, 3814; blowing with your trumpets denotes revelation from the Lord, 8802, 
8815; burnt offerings and sacrifices of peace offerings denote affections consecrated to the 
Lord inwardly and outwardly from freedom, 10053, 10097; their being a memorial before 
your God denotes that truths revealed to the understanding are always the manifestation of 
Divine Love, because this is the origin of Divine Truth, 9849, 2001, 8802; and "I am the Lord 
your God," denotes that the Lord alone is to be worshiped as Divine Good united to Divine 
Truth, 2001. 

11. By it coming to pass is denoted a change of subject and state, 4979; by the second year, the 
second month, and the twentieth day of the month, is denoted that there is some conjunction 
with the Lord, as to charity, as to faith, and as to obedience, because two, and consequently the
second and the twentieth, denote conjunction, 5194, a year denotes a full state as to good with

according to the series, 488; and by the cloud being taken up from over the tabernacle of the 
testimony, is denoted the removal of the obscurities of the literal sense of the Word, and thus 
revelation made through heaven from the Lord by good and truth, the tabernacle denoting 
good, and the testimony denoting truth, 8106, 35403, 3210, 41979, 8535. 

12. The children of Israel setting forward, according to their journeys, denotes progress with the 
spiritual man, 3654, 1457; out of the wilderness of Sinai denotes from a state of obscurity on 
account of deficiency as to truths, 8753; and the cloud abiding in the wilderness of Paran 
denotes to a state of spiritual light in which the Divine Human is acknowledged, although 
obscurely, 2708, 2714. The word Paran is derived from a root signifying, among other things, 
glory, and thence, correspondentially, signifies a state of spiritual light.

13. First taking their journey according to the commandment, or mouth, of the Lord by the hand of
Moses, denotes that this change of state takes place by influx from the Lord, or according to 
the Divine Providence, through Divine Truth manifested in its power, 1457, 8560, 7010, 878.

that the governing principle of those who are in the heavenly marriage is truth conjoined with 
good and proceeding therefrom, chaps 1:9, 2:7. 

145

17. By the tabernacle being taken down is denoted a change as to celestial things that are inmost 
and spiritual things that are interior, chap 4:5, 3210; and by the sons of Gershon and the sons 
of Merari bearing the tabernacle is denoted changes of state as to exterior and external things 
which support things interior, chaps 2:17, 3:17, 3335, 9500. 

18. The standard of the camp of Reuben setting forward according to their hosts, denotes that 

those who are in the inmost of the Spiritual Church, or of the spiritual degree, with its truths in
orderly arrangement, are now affected, 8624, 4236, 38632, 7236; and over his host being 
Elizur the son of Shedeur, denotes that their governing principle is faith from charity, which is 
the foundation of the church, chaps 1:5, 2:10.

peace with God and founded on the power of faith from charity, chaps 1:6, 2:12. 

20. Over the host of the tribe of the children of Gad, being Kliasaph the son of Deuel, denotes that
the governing principle of those who are in good works proceeding both from celestial and 
spiritual love is the perfection of good and truth in conjunction derived from Divine 
knowledge as now seen from a state of charity, chaps 1:14, 2:14. 

21. The Kohathites setting forward bearing the sanctuary, denotes t hat those who are in inmost 
truths from good in the Spiritual Church advance in order, supporting celestial love and 
spiritual love together, chaps 3:17, 4:15, 3335, 9500, 3210; and the other setting up the 
tabernacle against they came, denotes that, in the meantime, the external church is established 
as a support to the internal, ver. 17. 

22. The standard of the camp of the children of Ephraim setting forward according to their hosts, 
denotes that those who are in faith from charity in the inmost of the ultimate heaven now make
progress in orderly arrangement, 8624, 4236, 6238, 5355, 7236; and over his host being 
Elishama the son of Ammihud, denotes that their governing principle is obedience to truth 
from the love of good, chaps 1:10, 2:18. 

23. Over the host of the tribe of the children of Manasseh being Gamaliel the son of Pedahzur, 

denotes that the governing principle of those who are in the new will of good, in the ultimate 
heaven, is the love of reward as if from self, the knowledge of the truth, and separation from 
evil through the work of redemption, chaps 1:10, 2:20. 

24. Over the host of the tribe of the children of Benjamin being Abidan the son of Gideoni, 

denotes that the governing principle of those who are in the life of truth from good in the 
natural man, and form the medium between the interior of the natural man and the exterior, or 
between the interior celestial and the exterior spiritual of the ultimate heaven, is truth from 
good springing from opposition to evil, chaps 1:11, 2:22. 

25. The standard of the camp of the children of Dan, which was the rearward of all the camps, 

setting forward according to their hosts, denotes that those who are in the affirmation of truth 
in the natural man, and have their position in the obscure truth of the ultimate heaven, in 
orderly arrangement, are the last to make progress, 8624, 4236, 3923, 6396, 7236; and over his
host being Ahiezer the son of Ammishaddai, denotes that their governing principle is truth 
which aids, derived from Divine Truth which protects man in temptation, chaps 1:12, 2:25. 

146

26. Over the host of the tribe of the children of Asher, being Pagiel the son of Ochran, denotes that

the governing principle of those who are in exterior natural delight in the ultimate heaven, is 
opposition to evil derived from a state of spiritual trial and affliction, chaps 1:13, 2:27. 

27. And over the host of the tribe of the children of Naphtali being Ahira the son of Enan, denotes 
that the governing principle of those who are in resistance to evil in the ultimate degree of the 
natural man, or of the ultimate heaven, is good derived from the truth of the Divine Word, 
chaps 1:15, 2:29. 

28. Thus being the journeyings of the children of Israel according to their hosts, and their setting 
forward, denotes that these are the laws of progress with the man of the church, and that thus 
he proceeds in all his changes of state, 1457, 3654, 7236, 4236, 683. 

29. Moses saying to Hobab, the son of Reuel, the Midianite, Moses' father-in-law, denotes that 
with those who are in the truth of simple good, from which good is the conjunction of good 
and truth, there is perception, because by Moses is denoted Divine Truth from which the 
perception comes, 7010, by saying is denoted perception, 1822, by the Midianite is denoted 
the truth of a simple good, 6827, by Reuel, or Jethro, as a priest, is denoted the good of the 
church, 6827, by Reuel, or Jethro, as a father-in-law, is denoted the good from which is the 
good that is conjoined to truth, 6827, and by Hobab, as the son of the priest, is denoted, 
therefore, good and truth conjoined, 489, 6827, the word Hobab meaning favoured and 
beloved; "we are journeying to the place," denotes that conjunction is to be effected in the 
course of regeneration, 1457; the Lord saying He would give the place denotes that it is 
according to the will of the Lord, or according to Divine Good, 2001, 8899; Moses saying 
"come you with us and we will do you good," denotes that the man of the church desires that 
truth should be reciprocally conjoined with good, 3654, 6827; and "the Lord has spoken good 
concerning Israel," denotes that it is good which constitutes the church essentially, 2001, 3654,
2951. 

30. Hobab saying, "I will not go; but I will depart to mine own land and to my kindred," denotes 

that those in the truth of simple good, in their first state, are not willing to admit that 
conjunction, having a tendency to abide in the truth of simple good owing to actual evil from 
what is hereditary, ver. 29, 1457, 1411-1413.

31. By Moses saying, "Leave us not, I pray you," is denoted that the Lord, by Divine Truth, 

desires to conjoin all men to Himself, 7010, 1822, 5812; Hobab knowing how they were to 
encamp in the wilderness, denotes that it is the function of those who are in truths to perceive 
that truths must come into orderly arrangement under good, ver. 29, 4236, 2708; and "you 
shall be to us instead of eyes," denotes that good needs truth in order that it may be saved, 
2001, 7010, ver. 29. 

32. "And it shall be, if you go with us, yea, it shall be, that what good soever the Lord shall do to 
us, the same will we do to you," denotes that it is necessary that truth should be conjoined with
good, and good with truth, in order that good received by the internal man from the Lord may 
be fully manifested by the external. This appears by considering that the expression "it shall 
be" is repeated, indicating what is of the will and understanding reciprocally, and thus, also, 
what is of the internal man and the external reciprocally, 1683; and also that Moses and the 
Israelites denote the internal church, and Hobab and the Midianites the external; while the 
subject of the verse is the communication of good from the Lord, ver. 29. 

147

33. This is true, because the Israelites setting forward from the mount of the Lord three days' 

journey, denotes the advance of the whole church, from an obscure state of love to the Lord 
successively, 3654, 1457, 8753, 6904, 4495; the ark of the covenant of the Lord going before 
them, denotes that Divine Good and Divine Truth conjoined lead the way, 93965, 9485; and 
seeking out a resting-place for them denotes, evidently, through states of conflict to a state of 
rest and peace, 3696. 

34. The cloud of the Lord being over them by day when they set forward from the camp, denotes 
that the man of the church is guided by the Lord, through the Word, in every state of spiritual 
progress, 8106, 487, 4236. 

35. By it coming to pass is denoted a change of state, 4979; the ark setting forward denotes 

progress, 1457; Moses saying "Rise up, O Lord, and let your enemies be scattered," denotes 
that man acknowledges his dependence upon the Lord, and the Word for protection against his 
spiritual enemies, which are falsities and evils, 7010, 1822, 2401, 2001, 2851, 1309; and "let 
them that hate You lice before You," denotes the dispersion of evils externally as well as 
internally, 683. 

36. Saying when the ark rested, "Return, O Lord, to the ten thousands of the thousands of Israel," 
denotes that in every state of victory, and thus of repose, a more perfect conjunction of 
goodness and truth is effected, because the Lord denotes Divine Good, 2001; the Israelites 
denote the spiritual man or church, 3654; the ten thousands of the thousands denote infinity 
with regard to the Lord and abundance, or fullness as to reception by man from the Lord, 
3186; and the ark resting denotes a state of victory, 851; while by the Lord returning to Israel 
is denoted conjunction between Him and the church, as is evident, 4387, 10501. 

DISCUSSION

The first thing to be observed in connection with the chapter now before us is that, in the internal sense,
it continues the subject of revelation, with which the last chapter closes. And as we know that the 
division of the Pentateuch into different books, and chapters, and verses, was not the work of Moses, 
since the whole together is called the book of the Law (Deut 31:24-26), it is not surprising, as has been 
already observed, that the end of a chapter in the literal sense should not be the conclusion of a subject 
in the spiritual sense. Hut still we find a certain change here which must be noticed. For revelation is 
now represented by trumpets in order to show how celestial good descends, and is manifested in the 
truths of the Word, and this variously according to the state of the church, or of the individual, 8802. 
And these are the particulars of our first section. Now that it is necessary for us to live according to the 
instruction here given is evident, from reflection on each point in succession. Who cannot see, for 
example, that unless he conjoins in himself intelligence with affection, he can make no progress? 
Again, is it not necessary to unite all the powers of the external man under our ruling capacity for some
useful work? Who does not recognize, also, that the higher powers, denoted by the princes, should 
guide the lower, and this in subordination to the Divine Word? But, on the other hand, our best and 
highest love must be that which stimulates to action, as we learn from ver. 5; while it is manifest, also, 
that our love of truth, as well as our love of good, should be active, as we clearly see from ver. 6. But 
still there are seasons of rest for us, as we learn from ver. 7, and then the Lord prepares us, even 
mysteriously, for what is to follow. For we must endure temptations, as we observe from ver. 9; and 
then we know that we need the special revelation, which only the Lord, by truth proceeding from good,
denoted by the sons of Aaron blowing the trumpets, can give as we are taught in ver. 8, and also that 

148

this particular help, when seasons of conflict are about to take place, is perpetual. And the Lord assured
us of this elsewhere by saying, "When you passest through the waters, I will be with you; and through 
the rivers, they shall not overflow you: when you walkest through the fire, you shall not be burned, 
neither shall the flame kindle upon you" (Isaiah 43:2). And, lastly, when we have come off victorious 
and are rejoicing and enjoying the delights of charity, denoted by the set feasts; when we enter into new
states of faith, signified by the beginnings of our months; and when, at such times, we worship the Lord
with our whole hearts, and in our lives, as is denoted by the burnt offerings and peace offerings, then, 
indeed, is the Word revealed to us, and the manifestation of truths conjoined with our best affections, 
causes us to remember our deliverances, as signified by the blowing with the trumpets for a memorial 
before our God. And then, too, do we clearly realize that He is truly Divine Love united with Divine 
Wisdom.

In the second section, which is a general statement as to the progress of the church, and of the 
individual, three things may be noticed. First, there is no progress unless we make the best use of our 
opportunities in the state in which we are at any time; secondly, progress, according to our experience, 
is from an obscure to a clearer state, or from external things towards internal; and, thirdly, the change is
produced by the Divine operation internally. And besides this, the section is an epitome of all that 
follows in the other sections. That, in the case before us, a proper use was made of the state of 
instruction, appears from the fact that there was some conjunction with the Lord, this resulting in 
further revelation. That progress was to be into a clearer state is evident from the spiritual sense of the 
next verse. And that the change was brought about by the Lord's operation may be seen from both the 
literal and spiritual sense of the following verse; while all that follows was but the orderly carrying out 
of the general law of progress. And if we can not only see, but realize that the Lord is surely leading us 
in every step we take towards the promised land, we shall then acquire a cheerful and contented state of
mind under all circumstances.

Coming, therefore, to the third section, we find that the Lord's operation is through the celestial 
heavens into the spiritual, and thence into the natural, or, individually, through the inmost degree of 
man's life, into the middle degree, and thence into the ultimate, as we know the signification of the 
camps, and also of the twelve leaders from our former studies. Also we know, from experience, that in 
all our changes of state it is the internal man, and thus the highest predominating affections, as here 
described, that stimulate the lower to activity, and that through these the body is moved to action. 
Hence, then, it is interesting to reflect, that although literally, in the marchings of the Israelites, the 
camp of Judah proceeded first, thus representing inmost operation in order to initiate the first 
movement of the external man, and thus of the whole man, from an obscure state to a clearer state, yet 
we must not imagine that progress from internal states to external is the order of regeneration. For the 
order of the marching not only describes the order of the Divine operation, but also the order of the 
heavenly life, when man, being fully regenerated, acts from his highest loves into his lower, for the 
purpose of performing the uses for which he has been fitted; or, to put it technically, he acts from good 
by means of truth, and not as previously, according to truth, that he may be led to a state of good. But 
concerning this, see 10076. And as we know that, in the heavens, there is eternal progress with every 
one, we may be certain that it is in harmony with this law of proceeding from Internals to Externals, not
involving any change in the ruling which remains constant, nor any want of general correspondence 
between the internal and external man, but consisting rather in this, namely, that each person becomes 
more intensely a perfect form of his peculiar function, because the internal renders the external degree 
continually more and more an image of itself by the law of reciprocal conjunction, the continual action 
and reaction between the higher and the lower powers, necessarily producing this effect; besides which,

149

the activity of the higher life is unlimited, by virtue of the Divine Infinity in which it originates. We 
observe, too, in passing, that in this heavenly order represented by the four camps, the first and second 
represent the celestial and spiritual heavens, and the third and fourth the ultimate heaven as to the 
celestial and spiritual principles, that is, as to the good and truth thereof; while the three tribes forming 
each camp, according to their general correspondence, aptly denote the three degrees of life in each 
heaven, the first three signifying affections only, and the commencing tribe in each of the other triads 
corresponding to intelligence, the second to affection, and the third to both in action. Now, this order of
the faculties shows that in the perfect state love prevails in every degree of the life.

The next point, however, that demands attention is, that before the second camp is named, it was said 
that the tabernacle was taken down and was carried forward. Why? It was in order that the first actual 
step of the external man from his obscure state may be represented, and thus the co-operation of the 
external with operation of the internal powers, or, what is the same, the co-operation of the regenerating
man with the Lord. This third section, therefore, shows how the Divine influx and operation is the 
cause of man's co-operation. And the same process is evident in the fourth section. For after the camp 
of Reuben had moved, denoting a further step in the Divine operation through the spiritual heavens, or 
through the spiritual internal; the Kohathites, we are told, set forward bearing the sanctuary, and the 
other set up the tabernacle in the new place against their coming, evidently denoting, again, the 
corresponding co-operation of the external man, and his further advance into the state of enlightenment,
described spiritually by the wilderness of Paran in ver. 12. For the Kohathites were Levites, and 
properly represent, in this place, the spiritual in the natural, co-operating with the higher spiritual 
powers signified by the second camp, and advancing to take their part in the establishment of the 
internal of the church, signified by the sanctuary, within the external, denoted by the tabernacle which 
was being set up in the meantime.

It now follows that we are to consider the remaining sections, which may be taken altogether, because 
the essential truths involved in the internal sense of the whole chapter have received attention, and 
illustrate what follows. And, first, we may profitably notice that, according to the series, the operation 
of the Lord proceeds through the highest even to the very lowest powers of man's life, and causes 
reactivity there, which is denoted by the forward motion of the third and fourth camps, and by all that is
said about Hobab. But this great truth may be confirmed and strengthened in us, and also become 
practically useful by stimulating our feelings and thoughts of continual and faithful dependence upon 
the Lord, if we observe that this Divine operation is constant also as to the very functions and powers 
of our bodily life. For man can neither eat nor drink, nor enjoy all the legitimate delights and pleasures 
which belong to the body, unless the Lord continually and particularly operates therein. For example, 
how could the brain think, so to speak, the heart propel the blood in its circulation, the lungs respire, 
the digestive organs perform their work, or the various discriminating processes of our bodily life go on
from day today, unless the Lord's operation was there constant and unremitting? It is well known that 
no one directs and controls these functions in himself; and it ought to be well known that only by 
carefully co-operating with the Lord, Who alone directs and controls them, can man enjoy perfect 
bodily health. No doubt the opinion prevails that all these things continue according to the laws of 
nature; but few sufficiently reflect that the operation of those laws is really the Divine operation, and 
demonstrates the omnipresence of the Lord with every one—yea, also, and His tender care for the well-
being of every one. Hence now we see, therefore, how the wonderful things of our natural and bodily 
life illustrate and confirm the teachings of the Divine Word concerning our spiritual life.

But, in conclusion, it will be useful to notice one or two things in regard to those represented by the 
Midianites, namely, those not of the church, but yet capable of salvation by virtue of their state as to 

150

good. And this is called simple good, not because those who are in it are deficient in moral and mental 
power, but because they have not the genuine doctrine of the church where the Word is. But the Lord 
desires their salvation and provides for it, at the same time leaving them free, because no man can be 
saved except in freedom; and therefore the temptation of those who are in the truth of simple good is 
described by the indecision of Hobab. For the making of a choice between good and evil, which those 
out of the church must do, implies some temptation, but it is evident that such persons must afterwards 
be instructed in the doctrine of the church in order that their regeneration may be completed, 932. And 
another point that may cause difficulty is the saying of Moses to Hobab, "you shall be to us instead of 
eyes," as signifying that "good needs truth in order that it may be saved." For it might be said, "How 
can the truth of simple good, denoted by Hobab, be of advantage to the men of the internal church 
signified by Moses and the Israelites? Should it not be rather the reverse, namely, that the truth of the 
internal church is an advantage to those of the external? "Now, while this last statement is true, 
generally, yet it should be remembered that the words of Moses, spiritually understood, imply a state of
obscurity and difficulty with the man of the church such as is denoted by the wilderness, that is, a 
merely external state like that signified by Hobab and the Midianites; and that, therefore, in such a 
state, even a man of the internal church might be more safely guided by truth from simple good, which 
at once perceives the right course to be pursued, than by the higher or interior truths of the church; and 
thus our interpretation is that "good needs truth" (adapted to its state) in order to be saved. And to 
illustrate this point we may observe that the best way to advance into a state of spiritual enlightenment, 
which is the subject before us in this chapter, is by obeying the truths of the state in which we are 
according to the Lord's teaching in John 7:17. And more than this, it is also the way into a state of 
spiritual love, ver. 32; besides being the way of perfect co-operation with the Lord as to every degree of
our life, vers. 33-36.

151

Numbers Chapter 11

SUMMARY OF THE SPIRITUAL SENSE

1. A state of temptation is described, causing aversion from the Lord, and the predominance of 

lusts in the external man; but intercession is made and deliverance follows, vers. 1-3. 

2. Another state of temptation succeeds, in which there is a desire, externally, to return into the 
delights of the merely natural man, and a want of confidence in the Lord internally, resulting 
in a state of despair, vers. 4-6, and 10-15. 

3. The good of truth is described, with which, in the temptation, the man of the church is 

disgusted, vers. 7-9. 

4. Concerning the orderly arrangement of truths by the Lord, revelation, the conjunction of truth 

with good, and the appropriation of good, vers. 16-18. 

5. But the corrupted man desires only natural delights; while the truly spiritual man is in doubt 

and distress, and consequently receives consolation, vers. 19-23. 

6. And now, therefore, a new arrangement of truths actually occurs, and consequently revelation, 

and the power to teach, vers. 24-30. 

7. Besides which, there is an abundant supply of natural delight, which, with the true man of the 

church, is good legitimately appropriated; but the wicked pervert this good by application to 
lusts, and, therefore, suffer the destruction of remains, and total vastation. But the good 
experience a change of state, coming into peace and tranquillity in externals, vers. 31-35. 

THE CONTENTS OF EACH VERSE

1. And the people were as murmurers, 
speaking evil in the ears of the LORD:
and when the LORD heard it, his 
anger was kindled; and the fire of the
LORD burnt among them, and 
devoured in the uttermost part of the 
camp. 

2. And the people cried to Moses; and 
Moses prayed to the LORD, and the 
fire abated. 

1. And now the man of the Spiritual Church enters 
into temptation, because evils are predominant, 
and opposed to the Divine Providence, wherefore 
the influx of the Divine Life causes aversion on 
the part of man, evil passions are excited, and the 
natural man is overcome by lusts. 

2. Consequently there is a conflict between the falsity
of evil and the truth of the Word, accompanied by 
a strong desire for deliverance, through which evil 
passions are restrained. 

152

3. And the name of that place was 

3. And therefore the quality of that state of 

called Taberah: because the fire of 
the LORD burnt among them. 

4. And the mixed multitude that was 
among them fell a lusting: and the 
children of Israel also wept again, 
and said, Who shall give us flesh to 
eat? 

temptation, and generally of every state of 
temptation, is known from the love of evil which 
is excited, and which is directly opposed to the 
love of good. 

4. For in every state of temptation, falsities and truths

with the man of the church appear to be in 
confusion, because evil is predominant, and there 
is grief on account of the desire for merely natural 
delights on the one hand, and the restraining power
of truth on the other; 

5. We remember the fish, which we did

eat in Egypt for naught; the 
cucumbers, and the melons, and the 
leeks, and the onions, and the 
garlick: 

5. And the memory of pleasures freely enjoyed in the
merely natural state before regeneration, from 
scientifics and from the affections of worldly and 
selfish love external and internal, and what 
stimulates those affections. 

6. But now our soul is dried away; 
there is nothing at all: we have 
nought save this manna to look to. 

6. But in the state of temptation there is a strong 

aversion from truth and its affection, the good of 
truth being entirely distasteful. 

7. And the manna was like coriander 
seed, and the appearance thereof as 
the appearance of bdellium. 

7. And yet this good is from the pure truth of the 
Word, and is celestial truth from Good with the 
spiritual man. 

8. The people went about, and gathered
it, and ground it in mills, or beat it in
mortars, and seethed it in pots, and 
made cakes of it: and the taste of it 
was as the taste of fresh oil. 

9. And when the dew fell upon the 
camp in the night, the manna fell 
upon it. 

8. And man must procure this as it were by his own 

exertions, it being arranged both as to the 
understanding and will into heavenly order by the 
Lord, and adapted to the state of man so as to lead 
to the conjunction of good and truth, the affection 
of this good with the spiritual man being similar to
the love of good with the celestial man. 

9. And moreover, it is given by the Lord when man is
in a state of transition, the peace of this state being 
the interior of which the good of truth is the 
exterior. 

10. And Moses heard the people 

10. But the state of temptation continuing, all the 

weeping throughout their families, 
every man at the door of his tent: and
the anger of the LORD was kindled 
greatly; and Moses was displeased. 

powers of the mind are affected by it, from the 
internal which constitutes the ruling principle, to 
the external as to every particular, so that there is 
aversion from the Lord exceedingly, and also from
the Divine Truth which proceeds from Him. 

153

11. And Moses said to the LORD, 

11. And the thought of him who is in temptations, 

Wherefore have you evil entreated 
your servant? and wherefore have I 
not found favour in your sight, that 
you lay the burden of all this people 
upon me? 

12. Have I conceived all this people? 

have I brought them forth, that you 
should say to me, Carry them in your
bosom, as a nursing-father carrieth 
the sucking child, to the land which 
you swarest to their fathers? 

13. Whence should I have flesh to give 
to all this people? for they weep to 
me, saying, Give us flesh, that we 
may eat. 

concerning the Divine Good and also concerning 
the Divine Truth, is that they are opposed to him, 
and are the cause of all the suffering of temptation.

12. Besides which, he is disposed to doubt the power 
of the Lord in his regeneration, as to truth and as 
to good, and thus to deny His Divine Providence 
in the church by influx from within and by 
instruction from without through the Word, so that 
he who is in the innocence which belongs to the 
beginning of regeneration may proceed into the 
state of celestial life which has been promised to 
him by irrevocable confirmation. 

13. And hence he doubts also the possibility that the 

man of the church can enjoy legitimate natural 
delight, perceiving the tendency in himself to 
despise what is heavenly, and to return into the 
delights of the merely natural man; 

14. I am not able to bear all this people 

14. Nor does he conceive, in that state, that he can be 

alone, because it is too heavy for me.

15. And if you deal thus with me, kill 

me, I pray you, out of hand, if I have
found favour in your sight; and let 
me not see my wretchedness. 

16. And the LORD said to Moses, Gather 

to me seventy men of the elders of 
Israel, whom you know to be the 
eldest of the people, and officers 
over them; and bring them to the tent
of meeting, that they may stand there
with you. 

preserved from evil, according to order, as from 
himself, feeling so strongly his tendency to 
gravitate to lower things. 

15. And indeed in that state he is also disposed to fall 
into utter despair of salvation altogether, and even 
to reject the truth which exposes the opposition of 
the unregenerate natural man to the life of good 
and truth; but the Lord in mercy provides 
consolation for the tempted, and removes the evil 
which causes their misery. 

16. Also there is further revelation from the Lord by 
Divine Truth giving perception to the man of the 
church, that, as a consequence of a state of 
temptation, holy truths grounded in good, acquired
by him and adopted as governing principles, are 
arranged into order by the Lord under heavenly 
affections of love, charity, and obedience, and also 
in subordination to Divine Truth in general. 

154

17. And I will come down and talk with 
you there: and I will take of the spirit
which is upon you, and will put it 
upon them; and they shall bear the 
burden of the people with you, that 
you bear it not yourself alone. 

18. And say you to the people, Sanctify 

yourselves against to-morrow, and 
you shall eat flesh: for you have 
wept in the ears of the LORD, saying, 
Who shall give us flesh to eat? for it 
was well with us in Egypt: therefore 
the LORD will give you flesh, and 
you shall eat. 

19. You shall not eat one day, nor two 

days, nor five days, neither ten days, 
nor twenty days; 

17. That thence there may be orderly influx from the 

Lord, and revelation, these truths being filled with 
good through the medium of Divine Truth in 
general, and, that thus the spiritual man may be 
able to endure temptations, and may be confirmed 
in the truth that the Lord is with him in all his 
trials. 

18. Also it is given to the man of the Spiritual Church 
through Divine Truth to perceive that truth must be
conjoined with good in him to eternity, and that he 
shall have natural delight corresponding to what is 
spiritual, as the result of victory in his temptations,
in which his state is opposed to the Divine life, and
in which he is brought into merely natural delight 
through the excitement of former states of such 
delight. And in this way the natural man shall 
indeed enjoy legitimate natural delights from the 
Lord. 

19. But the corrupted man of the church, who desires 
natural delights from selfish love, confirms such 
delights in himself successively, first by voluntary 
indulgence; secondly, by conjunction with falsity; 
thirdly, by the destruction of remains in himself as 
to truth and as to good; fourthly, by fully resisting 
the conjunction of truth with good and of good 
with truth; 

20. But a whole month, until it come out
at your nostrils, and it be loathsome 
to you: because that you have 
rejected the LORD which is among 
you, and have wept before him, 
saying, Why came we forth out of 
Egypt? 

20. And lastly by rejecting all truth and good to 
eternity, even the slightest perception of the 
former, this becoming utterly distasteful, and the 
least influence of the latter, which becomes 
entirely loathsome, because good from the Lord 
cannot abide with evil, nor truth from Him with 
falsity, and merely natural loves only are desired. 

21. And Moses said. The people, among 

whom I am, are six hundred 
thousand footmen; and you have 
said, I will give them flesh, that they 
may eat a whole month. 

21. And he who is in temptation, because abundantly 
in the affection of natural truth, and, for the time 
being, overcome with doubt, cannot perceive that 
the natural man shall have legitimate natural 
delight, and that he shall have it to eternity. 

22. Shall flocks and herds be slain for 

22. For he thinks that it is impossible for the natural 

them, to suffice them? or shall all the
fish of the sea be gathered together 
for them, to suffice them? 

man to appropriate charity and natural good from 
the Lord, or to be gratified with natural truths in all
their fullness. 

155

23. But he receives consolation from the 
thought that the Divine Omnipotence
is constant, and that the spiritual man
cannot fail, 

24. And Moses went out, and told the 
people the words of the LORD: and 
he gathered seventy men of the 
elders of the people, and set them 
round about the Tent. 

25. And the LORD came down in the 

cloud, and spoke to him, and took of 
the spirit that was upon him, and put 
it upon the seventy elders: and it 
came to pass, that, when the spirit 
rested upon them, they prophesied, 
but they did so no more. 

26. But there remained two men in the 
camp, the name of the one was 
Eldad, and the name of the other 
Medad: and the spirit rested upon 
them; and they were of them that 
were written, but had not gone out to
the Tent: and they prophesied in the 
camp. 

27. And there ran a young man, and told 

Moses, and said, Eldad and Medad 
do prophesy in the camp. 

28. And Joshua the son of Nun, the 

minister of Moses, one of his chosen 
men, answered and said, My lord 
Moses, forbid them. 

23. And the LORD said to Moses, Is the LORD'S hand 

waxed short? now shall you see whether my word 
shall come to pass to you or not. 

24. The result being that the external man is instructed
in Divine Truths; and truths grounded in good 
there have conjunction with the Lord through the 
heavens. 

25. So that now there is revelation adapted to the state,
and the influx of good through Divine Truth with 
the man of the church who is in holy states 
through regeneration, the consequence being the 
full power of teaching truths from good, but not 
from himself. 

26. And not only so, but the natural love of good and 
truth also, having a new quality, through the influx
of interior good, and the confirmation of good in 
the natural man, although distinct from the 
spiritual love of good and truth, is alike endowed 
with power to teach. 

27. And thus the eager affection of truth in the natural 
man, being brought into correspondence with the 
internal, there is thence the perception that the 
regenerated natural man also has the power to 
teach truths. 

28. But the natural reason separated from the Internal, 
although designed to minister thereto, is indignant,
conceiving that only the interior must teach truths. 

29. And Moses said to him, Art you 

29. Yet the internal man perceives both the ardour and 

jealous for my sake? would God that
all the LORD'S people were prophets, 
that the LORD would put his spirit 
upon them! 

the error of the natural Rational, and 
communicates the perception that Diyine Truth is 
freely given to the natural as well as the spiritual 
man in proportion to his reception of Divine Good.

30. And Moses gat him into the camp, 

30. And therefore, as the result of victory in 

he and the elders of Israel. 

temptation, it becomes present there both as to the 
understanding and will. 

156

31. And there went forth a wind from 
the LORD, and brought quails from 
the sea, and let them fall by the 
camp, about a day's journey on this 
side, and a day's journey on the other
side, round about the camp, and 
about two cubits above the face of 
the earth. 

32. And the people rose up all that day, 
and all the night, and all the next 
day, and gathered the quails: he that 
gathered least gathered ten homers: 
and they spread them all abroad for 
themselves round about the camp. 

33. While the flesh was yet between 
their teeth, ere it was chewed, the 
anger of the LORD was kindled 
against the people, and the LORD 
smote the people with a very great 
plague. 

34. And the name of that place was 

called Kibroth-hattaavah: because 
there they buried the people that 
lusted. 

31. Besides which the spirit of the Lord freely gives to
the regenerating man natural delight also which is 
the good of truth, according to states of instruction
as to faith and charity and thus as to conjunction 
with the interiors. 

32. And the man of the church, generally, is elevated 
by this gift, appropriating good in every state of 
brightness as to truths, in every state of obscurity, 
and in every state of the conjunction of truth with 
good, every one, in fact, being supplied with 
remains, and freely acting as from himself in the 
acquisition of good. 

33. But those who pervert natural delight by making it 
lust through selfishness, and in its application to 
life are averted from the Lord, cause in themselves
the destruction of remains, 

34. And thus induce in themselves the quality of the 
internals, because they reject all good and truth 
through lust. 

35. From Kibroth-hattaavah the people 
journeyed to Hazeroth; and they 
abode at Hazeroth. 

35. But he who, in the course of regeneration is 

delivered from such a state, is brought into one of 
temporary peace and tranquillity as to externals. 

REFERENCES AND NOTES

1. The people being as murmurers, denotes that now the man of the Spiritual Church enters into 
temptation, and consequently into complaint, 8351; it being evil in the ears of the Lord, 
denotes that: evils are predominant, and opposed to the Divine Providence, 4839, 3869; when 
the Lord heard it His anger being kindled, denotes that the influx of the Divine Life causes 
aversion on the part of man, 3869, 5798, 6997; the fire of the Lord burning among them, 
denotes that evil passions are excited, 5071, 6832; and the fire devouring to the uttermost parts
of the camp, denotes that the natural man is overcome by lusts, 10283, 2187, 10533, 1718, 
4236. 

2. The people crying to Moses, denotes that there is a conflict between the falsity of evil and the 
Divine Truth of the Word, 1259, 2240, 7010; Moses praying to the Lord, denotes a strong 
desire for deliverance, 2535, 8179, 2001; and the fire.abating, denotes that evil passions are 
restrained, 10283, 5071. 

157

3. The name of that place being called Taberah, that is burning, because the fire of the Lord burnt

among them, denotes that, therefore, the quality of that state of temptation, and, generally, of 
every state of temptation, is known from the love of evil, which is excited, and which is 
directly opposed to the love of good, 145, 2625, 5071, 6832. 

4. By the mixed multitude falling a lusting, is denoted that in every state of temptation, falsities 

and truths, with the man of the church, appear to be in confusion, because evil is predominant, 
2006, 4574, 3993, 84094; by the children of Israel weeping again, is denoted grief, 2910; and 
by saying "Who shall give us flesh to eat?" is denoted on account of the desire for merely 
natural delights on the one hand, and the restraining power of the truth on the other, 84094, 
ver. 2. In the literal sense, the grief of the children of Israel was for the loss of natural delight, 
but in the internal sense the grief or weeping and the crying to Moses denote grief during the 
conflict between evil and good.

5. Remembering what happened in Egypt, denotes the memory of pleasures freely enjoyed in the

merely natural state before regeneration, 33362, 5276; fishes denote scientifics, 991; 
cucumbers, and melons, and leeks and onions, denote the affections of worldly and selfish 
love, external and internal; and garlic denotes what stimulates those affections. This is shown 
by considering that all these things were enjoyed in Egypt, 5276, and that the series is from the
scicntifics denoted by the fishes. It may be observed also, by a careful perusal of the articles 
under each Hebrew term, here translated cucumbers, melons, leeks, onions and garlic, in the 
Biblical Encyclopedias, that there is little or no doubt that the rendering is correct, and also 
that the correspondence of each term is grounded in the specific character and use of each 
thing named; the oily nature of the allii, indicating a more interior state, than the juicy nature 
of the cucurbitacice, 4581. 

6. Their soul being dried away because there is nothing at all, denotes that, in the state of 

temptation, there is a strong aversion from truth and its affections, 8185; and nought but the 
manna to look to, denotes that the good of truth is entirely distasteful, 8464. 

7. The manna being like coriander seed, and the appearance thereof as the appearance of 

bdellium, denotes that yet this good is from the pure truth of the Word, and is celestial truth 
from good with the spiritual man, 8521, no.

8. The people going about and gathering it, denotes that man must procure the good of truth, as it
were by his own exertions, 7115, 9273; grinding it in mills, or beating it in mortars, denotes 
arrangement into heavenly order by the Lord both as to the understanding and will, 10303; 
seething it in pots, denotes adaptation to the state of man, 8496; making cakes of it, denotes so
as to lead to the conjunction of goodness and truth, 2177; and the taste of it being as the taste 
of fresh oil, denotes that the affection of this good with the spiritual man is similar to the love 
of good with the celestial man, 4793, 4581. The Hebrew word, here translated "fresh" in the 
A.V. and R.V., with a note in the margin of the latter suggesting "cakes baked with oil," is in 
the Lexicon, said to mean "moisture"; and "fluid oil" is proposed instead of "fresh oil." Hence 
there is evidently a difficulty in the rendering; but since the cakes clearly denote the good of 
truth as appropriated by the spiritual man, and oil denotes the celestial principle of love and 
charity, 886, the word translated "fresh," or "fluid," evidently implies, in the internal sense, the
derivation of the good peculiar to the Spiritual from that peculiar to the Celestial, and the 
similarity of the former to the latter.

158

9. When the dew fell upon the camp in the night, the manna falling upon it, denotes that the good
of truth is given when man is in a state of transition, the peace of this state being the interior of
which the good of truth is the exterior, 8456, 3579. 

10. Moses hearing the people weeping throughout their families, every man at the door of his tent,

denotes that the state of temptation continues, all the powers of the mind being affected by it 
from the internal which constitutes the ruling principle to the external as to every particular, 
7010, 2641, 3654, 1259, 2910, 10549; and the anger of the Lord being kindled greatly, while 
Moses also was displeased, denotes that there is aversion from the Lord exceedingly, and also 
from the Divine Truth which proceeds from Him, 6997, 10431. 

11. By Moses saying to the Lord, is denoted the thought of him who is in temptation concerning 

the Divine Gocd, and also concerning the Divine Truth, because, in this case, Moses evidently 
puts on the representation of the people whom he governed, 7041, 2506, 2001; and because, 
"Wherefore have you evil intreated your servant? and wherefore have I not found favour in 
your sight that you lay the burden of all this people upon me?" denotes the thought of him in 
temptation that Divine Good and Divine Truth are opposed to him and are the cause of all his 
suffering. For by the Lord evil intreating any one is signified his opposition to Divine Good, 
2001, 10618; by not finding favour in the Lord's sight, is denoted opposition to Divine Truth, 
10563, 10560; and by the Lord laying a burden upon people, is denoted the thought of those in
temptation that their suffering is from Him, 7104, 7105. 

12. By Moses saying, "Have I conceived all this people, and have I brought them forth?" is 

denoted doubt as to the power of the Lord in man's regeneration as to truth and as to good, 
3860, ver. 11; by "that you should say, Carry them in your bosom as a nursing-father carrieth 
the sucking child," is denoted doubt as to the Divine Providence in the church by influx from 
within, and by instruction from without, 6960, 10087, 6740, 6745; and by "to the land which 
you swarest to their fathers," is denoted that he who is in the innocence which belongs to the 
beginning of regeneration, 67456, may proceed into the state of celestial life, which has been 
promised to him by irrevocable confirmation, 3705, 6098, 2842. It is said above, "by influx 
from within and by instruction from without through the Word," because to carry in the bosom
denotes love, 6960, and love flows into man from the Lord; and because suckling denotes the 
reception of good and truth by an external way, that is, by instruction, 6745, 3513. 

13. "Whence should I have flesh to give to all this people? For they weep to me saying, Give us 
flesh that we may eat," denotes that he doubts also the possibility that the man of the church 
can enjoy legitimate natural delight, perceiving the tendency in himself to despise what is 
heavenly, and to return into the delights of the merely natural man, 84094, 2187, 2910, 7010. 

14. "I am not able to bear all this people alone, because it is too heavy for me," denotes that 
neither does the spiritual man conceive, in that state, that he can be preserved from evil, 
according to order, as from himself, feeling so strongly his tendency to gravitate to lower 
things, because by not being able to bear all this people alone, is denoted that man cannot by 
himself resist evil, evil being signified by the desire of the people for flesh, ver. 13, and 
because yet, in temptations, he must resist as from himself, 8179; and by its being too heavy 
for him, is denoted that man feels his tendency to lapse into evil apart from Divine help, 8279. 

15. "And if you deal thus with me," denotes that, indeed, in that state man is also disposed to fall 

into utter despair of salvation altogether, as appears from the affection involved in the 

159

expression, and from the implication that the Lord is the cause of the temptation, 8165, 8166 
"kill me, I pray you, out of hand," denotes the disposition to reject the truth, because the Lord 
does not kill or destroy, but man himself rejects the Lord, 7043; "if I have found favour in your
sight," denotes that the Lord in mercy provides consolation for the tempted, 5043: and "let me 
not see my wretchedness," denotes that He removes the evil which is the cause of their misery,
because by the miserable are meant those in temptations, 5042, and by the Lord not letting the 
tempted see their misery, is denoted that he removes, or remits the evil which is the cause of 
temptation, 8174. 

16. By the Lord saving to Moses, is denoted further revelation from the Lord by Divine Truth 

giving perception, 2001, 7010, 1822; by seventy men of the elders of Israel, are denoted holy 
truths grounded in good, 728, 158, 6524; by Moses knowing that they were elders of the 
people and officers over them, is denoted that they were acquired by the spiritual man and 
adopted as ruling principles, 7200, 6524, 82115; by their being gathered to the Lord, and 
brought to the tent of meeting, is denoted arrangement by the Lord into order under the 
heavenly affections of love, charity, and obedience, 6712, 35403; and by their standing with 
Moses, is denoted that they are in subordination to Divine Truth in general, 3136, 7010. 

17. By the Lord coming down, and talking with Moses there, is denoted that thence there is 

orderly influx from the Lord, and revelation, 3084, 2951, 7010; by taking the spirit that was in 
Moses and putting it upon the elders and officers, is denoted that these truths are filled with 
good through the medium of Divine Truth in general, 9818, 7010; by their bearing the burden 
of the people with Moses, is denoted that thus the spiritual man may be able to endure 
temptations, 7104, 7105; and by Moses not bearing the burden himself alone, is denoted that 
the Lord is with him in all his trials, because, although the literal sense is that Moses would 
not be alone since he would have the help of the elders, the internal sense is that the spiritual 
man is continually helped by the Lord, Who indeed enables him to make a proper use of his 
subordinate powers, as He enabled Moses to select the elders, 139. 

Observe in the reference the sense in which it was not good for the man to be alone, namely, 
that he should ascribe his life to himself only.

18. By saying to the people, "Sanctify yourselves against tomorrow," is denoted the perception 

that truth must be conjoined with good, in man, to eternity, 1822, 1259, 8042, 3908; by "you 
shall eat flesh," is denoted that he shall have natural delight corresponding to what is spiritual 
as the result of victory in his temptations, 8431: by their having wept in the ears of the Lord, 
saving, "Who shall give us flesh to eat?" and "it was well with us in Egypt," is denoted that, in 
the state of temptation, man is opposed to the Divine life, and is brought into merely natural 
delight through the excitement of former states of such delight, 2910, ver. 2, 84094, 10283; 
and by the Lord giving them flesh and their eating, is denoted, in the best sense, that the 
natural man indeed enjoys legitimate natural delights from the Lord, 8431, 2187. 

19. But, in the opposite sense, by eating, is denoted that the corrupted man of the church, who 

desires natural delights from selfish love, confirms such delights in himself successively, 
10283; by eating one day, is denoted a state of voluntary indulgence, 41492, 39863, 487; by 
eating two days, is denoted the conjunction of evil with falsity, 5194; by eating five days and 
ten days, is denoted the destruction of remains in himself as to truth and as to good, 5201, 683;

160

and by eating twenty days, is denoted resistance to the conjunction of truth with good, and of 
good with truth, 5194, 5291. 

20. By eating a whole month of days, is denoted the rejection of all truth and good to eternity, 
3814; by "until it come out at your nostrils, and it be loathsome to you," is denoted the 
rejection of even the slightest perception of truth, this becoming utterly distasteful, and the 
least influence of good, which becomes entirely loathsome, 4624, 4625; by "because you have 
rejected the Lord which is among you," is denoted that good from the Lord cannot abide with 
evil, 2001; by "because you have wept before Him," is denoted that truth from the Lord cannot
abide with falsity, 2010, 2001; and by their saying, "Why came we forth out of Egypt?" is 
denoted that merely natural loves only are desired, 5276. 

21. By Moses is here denoted the man of the church who is in temptation, 7041; by the people 

among whom he was being six hundred thousand footmen, is denoted abundance as to natural 
truths and their affections, 1259, 7973, 2162; it is said, "for the time being overcome with 
doubt," because what Moses says involves and impresses a state of doubt; and by the Lord 
saying, "I will give them flesh that they may eat a whole month," is denoted the perception 
that the natural man shall have legitimate natural delight even in eternity, 2001, 1822, 8431, 
3814. 

22. By "Shall flocks and herds be slain for them to suffice them?" is denoted that he who is in 

temptation thinks that it is impossible for the natural man to appropriate charity and natural 
good from the Lord, 5913, 6126; and by "Shall all the fish of the sea be gathered together to 
suffice them?" is denoted that he also thinks it impossible for him to be supplied with natural 
truths in all their fullness, 991. 

23. The Lord saying to Moses, "Is the Lord's hand waxed short? now shall them see whether my 

word shall come to pass to you or not," denotes that the man of the church receives 
consolation from the thought that the Divine Omnipotence is constant and that the spiritual 
man cannot fail, 2001, 2506, 878, 2150, 5075, 4979. 

24. Moses going out, and telling the people the words of the Lord, denotes the result, namely, that 
the external man is instructed in Divine Truths, 7010, 5337, 1259, 4250; and gathering seventy
men. of the elders of the people, and setting them round about the tent, denotes that truths 
grounded in good in the external man, have conjunction with the Lord through the heavens, 
6112, 728, 158, 6524, 2973, 35403. 

25. The Lord coming down in the cloud and speaking to Moses, denotes revelation adapted to the 
state, and the influx of good through Divine Truth, 3084, 8106, 2951, 7010; taking of the spirit
that was in Moses and putting it upon the seventy elders, denotes influx with the man of the 
church who is in holy states through regeneration, 9818, 7010, 728, 6524; and it coming to 
pass that when the spirit rested upon them they prophesied, but did so no more, denotes that 
the spiritual man has the full power of teaching heavenly truths from good, but not from 
himself, 4979, 2534. 

It is to be noticed here, however, that the Hebrew words translated "but they did so no more," 
mean that they added no more, this being the rendering of the similar expressions in Deut 
5:22. But by not adding any more, is meant, in the literal sense, that they did not add to what 

161

they then uttered, and in the internal sense, that man is forbidden to add anything from himself
to the Divine Truth, or to the Word, as we read in Rev 22:18, which is explained in AR 957. 

26. There remaining two men in the camp, the name of the one being Eldad and the name of the 

other Medad, denotes the natural love of good and truth having a new quality, for two men 
signify the conjunction of good and truth in the Spiritual Church, 5194, 7120, name signifies 
quality, 145, Eldad means loved of God and therefore signifies good, 2001, and Medad means 
he that measures, or the water of love, and therefore signifies truth, 3104, 2702; the spirit of 
the Lord resting upon them, denotes the influence of interior good, ver. 25; their being of the 
seventy that were written, denotes the confirmation of good, ver. 25, 9386; their not going out 
to the tent, denotes the natural love of good and truth as distinguished from the spiritual, 
35403, because both the camp and the tent represented heavenly order, 4236; and the two men 
prophesying in the camp, denotes that the natural love of good and truth is also endowed with 
the power to teach, 2534. 

27. A young man running and telling Moses that Eldad and Medad prophesied in the camp, 

denotes that the eager affection of truth in the natural man, being brought into correspondence 
with the internal, there is thence the perception that the regenerated natural man also has the 
power to teach truths, 7668, 3804, 7010, 2534, ver. 26. 

28. Joshua the son of Nun the minister of Moses, and one of his chosen men, here denotes the 

natural reason separated from the Internal, although designed to minister thereto from good, 
10454, 10557, 7051; and his answering and saying, "My lord Moses, forbid them," denotes 
indignation from the consideration that only the interior must teach truths, 6943, 7010, 5725, 
2534. 

29. Moses saying to Joshua, "Art you jealous for my sake?" denotes that the internal man 

perceives both the ardour and the error of the natural Rational, 1822, 3839; would God that all 
the Lord's people were prophets, denotes the communication of the perception that Divine 
Truth is freely given to the natural as well as the spiritual man, 7010, 2001, 1259, 2534; and 
the Lord putting His spirit upon them, denotes in proportion to the reception of Divine Good, 
2001, 9818, 728, 6524. 

30. Moses and the elders going into the camp, denotes that therefore as the result of victory in 

temptations, good becomes present in the natural man as to the understanding and will, 7010, 
6524, 4236, 35403. 

31. By a wind going from the Lord, is denoted the spirit of the Lord freely given to the 

regenerating man, 97; by quails from the sea falling on the camp, is denoted natural delight 
which is the good of truth, 8452, 4236; by a day's journey on this side, and a day's journey on 
the other side, denotes according to the states of instruction as to faith and charity, 1457, 410; 
and by two cubits above the face of the earth, is denoted as to conjunction with the interiors, 
5194, 872, 358. 

32. The people rising up all that day and all that night, and all the next day and gathering the 
quails, denotes that the man of the church, generally, is elevated by this gift appropriating 
good in every state of brightness as to truths, in every state of obscurity, and in every state of 
the conjunction of truth with good, 2401, 487, 709, 5092, 2091, 9273, 8452; he that gathered 
least gathering ten homers, denotes that every one is supplied with remains, 576, 8540; and 

162

spreading them all abroad for themselves round about the camp, denotes freely acting, as from
self, in the acquisition of good, 4035, 2973, 4236. 

33. While the flesh was yet between their teeth ere it was chewed, denotes those who pervert 
natural delight by making it lust through selfishness, 84094, 44243, 2187; the anger of the 
Lord being kindled against the people, denotes aversion from the Lord on the part of the 
wicked, 5798; and smiting the people with a very great plague, denotes that they cause in 
themselves the destruction of remains, 10219. 

34. The name of that place being called Kibroth-hattaavah, or the graves of lust, denotes that thus 
the wicked induce upon themselves the quality of the infernals, 145, 2625, 8452; and because 
they buried the people that lusted, denotes because they reject all good and truth through lust, 
4564. 

35. The people journeying from Kibroth-hattaavah to Hazeroth, and abiding there, denotes that he 

who, in the course of regeneration, is delivered from such a state is brought into one of 
temporary peace and tranquillity as to externals, ver. 34, 1259, 1457, 3271, 7407, 3613. By 
Hazeroth are meant courts, and therefore it signifies what is external, 7407. 

DISCUSSION

The first section of this chapter, as in some other cases, is evidently a summary of the whole, both in 
the literal and spiritual senses, the general subject being the temptations of the spiritual man, who has 
advanced from a state of instruction into a state of light, described in the last chapter by the wilderness 
of Paran. Let us, therefore, carefully reflect upon these temptations, and notice first that they 
commence with a state of discontent, advance to a state of complaining, and culminate in the activity of
the lusts of selfish and worldly love.

Now although it may seem somewhat paradoxical, yet it is a fact that all temptations take place in a 
state of more or less spiritual enlightenment, and in a state of freedom, wherein there is a conflict 
between man's selfishness on the one hand, and the truth which enlightens on the other. Hence, then, in 
temptations a man's very life is at stake, and he must decide, whether he will yield to the suggestions of
his selfishness, or confirm in himself the truth. And because the truth appears to him to be the cause of 
his misery in that state, therefore he is dissatisfied with it; and because his sufferings seem to proceed 
from the Lord, therefore the evils which tempt are called the fire of the Lord which burns. But it is said 
to burn in the first instance only in the uttermost part of the camp, because the temptation is light. But 
also, it is said, that when the Lord heard the murmurings of the Israelites, His anger was kindled; and it 
is necessary to understand what this really means in connection with our spiritual conflicts. For the 
Lord is never angry, nor does He listen and hear just as we hear and are angry, because He is 
unchangeable love, and is also omniscient. Hence, therefore, when, in the Word, it is said that the Lord 
hears, thereby is meant His infinite perception of man's states, and the influx of His love for man's 
relief; and when it is said that He is angry, thereby is meant that the evils of man's life are excited and 
are the cause of sufferings. Thus the literal sense of the Word often speaks according to appearances, in 
accommodation to our imperfect states. But still it is very natural that, in our distress, we should appeal
to others who can help us, and that they should appeal to the Lord; and it is a fact that every one who 
prays to the Lord for deliverance from evil, and thus outwardly, and inwardly for the Holy Spirit (Luke 
11:10) certainly receives it, since the effect of true prayer is to cause a state of receptivity in ourselves, 
by which evil is repelled, the earnestness of the prayer involving determined resistance to the evil; and 

163

this is from the Lord. And consequently, in the case before us, it is said, that the fire abated, which 
evidently signifies that evil is restrained; and that a distinct temptation and victory is here described 
appears from the special name being given, although that name describes a quality which belongs to all 
temptations. These remarks, therefore, illustrate our first section.

In the first part of the second section, which states that a mixed multitude fell a lusting, denoting 
spiritually that, in states of temptation falsities and truths are mixed with man for the time being, we 
have an aspect of the subject very interesting, as the study of it: will enable us to consider how this is 
the case with ourselves. For we know how very much perplexed we are many a time, as to what is true 
and as to what is false, and more than this, as to what it is right to do, or not to do, under certain 
circumstances, because conflicting feelings cause obscurity. And thus it is when former delights of the 
merely natural life are excited in us by the evil spirits who tempt us, as here described, and represented 
by the longing of the Israelites for the food they had enjoyed in Egypt, and by the manna provided for 
them in the wilderness becoming distasteful. And what person who is in the course of regeneration, has 
not experienced temptations of this kind, arising from mixed states of good and evil? Not, indeed, that 
these can really be mixed, but that they appear to be so under certain circumstances. And if we read 
attentively what is said on this very point in the references given, particularly 399; we shall be helped 
greatly in our present study. But now, coming to the second part of this section, we cannot but notice 
that this second conflict affects the internal as well as the external man, all the words of Moses 
indicating this. And two things are here prominent, which may be understood clearly by a reference to 
human experience, namely, the indignation of the spiritual man that he should be required to control 
and guide the natural as of himself, and his state of despair in consequence. But, indeed, it is these two 
things that may be called the essence of the conflict; for unless every one was required to contend 
against his evils as from himself, he would fail to acquire his own distinct individuality, and to form his
own character; and unless he were reduced to a state of despair from which he is afterwards delivered 
by the Lord, he would not be able to acknowledge with all his heart that all his power to conquer is 
from the Lord. And it is remarkable that just in proportion as he is able to be in genuine humility, just in
the same proportion does he become conscious that, from the Lord, he has a function that no one else 
can perform but himself. And this, too, is involved in the internal sense of ver. 15, because "Kill me, I 
pray you, out of hand," taken in the best sense, signifies the desire of him who is tempted to reject the 
life of selfishness, and thus to come into humility; and "let me not see my wretchedness," signifies that 
he earnestly desires to become fully conscious of the heavenly life, in which he has the "new name 
which no man knows, but he that receives it" (Rev 2:17), and no wretchedness.

With regard to the third section, which describes the manna, and, spiritually, the good that man receives
from the Lord by means of truth, we have some interesting particulars; and, first of all, the very name 
given to this food miraculously, supplied to the Israelites, means "what is it?" And this at once suggests 
the thought that man of himself is entirely ignorant of the quality of that good which comes from the 
Lord and properly nourishes his soul during regeneration. But still he knows from the Word that it 
involves three things in their order, namely, obedience, charity, and love, for these really are the 
manifestation and the essence of "all the law and the prophets" (Matt 22:40). But, again, the manna is 
said to be like coriander seed. And in this connection, spiritually, there are two remarkable things; first, 
the seed corresponds to the Word, or the truth of the Word (Matt 13:19; Luke 8:11), and, secondly, the 
Hebrew word for coriander is gad, which is also the name of one of the sons of Jacob, and at the same 
time of an idolatrous worship. It signifies works both good and evil, and thus, obedience to the truth in 
the best sense, and also in the opposite sense, for we read: "They who are in external works from the 
non-truth which they believe to be truth, are signified by Gad also in Isaiah, 'You are they who forsake 

164

Jehovah, who forget the mountain of my holiness, who spread out a table for Gad, and offer a drink 
offering to Meni,' where spreading out a table for Gad, stands for being in works alone (Is. lxv. n)," 
6404-6405. But it may be thought that this word, which means "fortune," or "a troop," or "chance" and 
corresponds to works, cannot be identical with that which means the seed of coriander, and cannot have
the same correspondence; yet this difficulty disappears, when we remember that the seed was also, the 
fruit of this plant, and that although, as a seed, it signifies truth still, as a fruit it signifies works, and 
thus, as we have said, obedience to the truth. See, however, the articles on the word Gad in Kitto's 
Encyclopedia, and also 1873, 7690. 

And now, also, there is another consideration. The text does not say that the manna was coriander seed, 
but that it was like it; and there is a reason for this. It was in order to emphasize the fact that it was a 
miraculous provision and not some natural production; and concerning this, too, we have the following 
positive instruction: "From these passages it is also evident, that to eat, in the spiritual sense, signifies 
to receive in the will and to do, whence comes conjunction. For the Lord by doing the Divine will, 
conjoined the Divine which was in Him with His Human, so that He appropriated the Divine to His 
Human. It was for the same reason also that the Lord fed five thousand men, besides women and 
children, with live loaves and two fishes, and that after they had eaten, and were filled, they took up 
twelve baskets of fragments (Matt 14:15-21; John 6:5, 13, 23); and that He fed four thousand men from
seven "loaves and a few fishes (Matt 15:32 and the following verses). This miracle was performed 
because the Lord had previously been teaching them, and because they received and appropriated to 
themselves His doctrine. This was what they spiritually ate, from this the natural eating followed, that 
is, it flowed in with them out of heaven unknown to themselves, as the manna with the children of 
Israel. For at the will of the Lord, spiritual food, which is also real food, but only for spirits and angels, 
is turned into natural food, just as it was turned into manna every morning" (AE 6174). Here, therefore, 
we see how the manna was produced; it was created by the Lord, instantaneously, according to the law 
of correspondence; and that this instantaneous creation can, at any time, take place, according to the 
laws of Divine Order, is shown in DLW 312, 340-342, and in TCR 78. But with regard to the other 
particulars in this section, what is said in connection with the references, and what the passages referred
to themselves teach may be sufficiently illustrative.

The fourth section concerns four things, which are often occurring in the internal sense, because they 
enter so much into every state of regeneration, and are, of course, varied in every state, and with every 
individual. And they naturally follow states of temptation as in this case. We call attention, however, to 
the expressions of the literal sense, which describes the Lord as if He were like an ordinary governor 
giving directions to his subordinates and talking with them, and moving from place to place, when yet 
He does not require to do so; and this alone may convince us that the holy Word contains a spiritual 
sense, which, so to speak, falls into the literal sense, and is presented under appearances. But a great 
deal more is also involved; for it is the arrangement made by the Lord, as to our inner states, and 
without our knowledge, which produces subordinations, not only in heaven, but on earth, and, indeed, 
order could not be maintained without such subordinations; and if we reflect carefully, we shall discern 
that order in heavenly societies has very much to do in producing the happiness of the angels; for 
perfect associations must contribute very greatly to the increase and extension of heavenly delights, 
where the external is completely conjoined with the internal man, and where revelation is therefore full 
and complete.

Hut the fifth section is exceedingly interesting, because it not only presents us with a contrast between 
those who confirm themselves in evil, and those who are fully regenerated by temptations, but it also 
shows that even the wicked are brought into their final condition by an orderly process, as we see 

165

particularly from vers. 19-20, and that the good, having experienced the extreme of temptation, also by 
a gradual process, afterwards receive adequate satisfaction and convolution, as is evident from vers. 21-
23.

And now it follows, therefore, that in the sixth section is described the complete arrangement of truths 
that is the result of victory in temptation, and the full power given to the natural man as well as to the 
spiritual to understand and teach truths. And the particular points here to be noticed are of great 
practical value. We must acknowledge that all revelation is from the Lord through Divine

Truth, or the Word; that it operates through the heavens; that it is they who are in holy good and truth 
interior, who first receive it, and are arranged into order; that the highest principles of life descend in an
accommodated form; that good as well as truth becomes active in the lower spheres, when 
acknowledged to be from the Lord alone; and that both good and truth, therefore, may fully possess the 
natural degree of man's life. Nor can we fail to see here, how wonderfully the names of persons 
mentioned in the Word correspond with the spiritual states which they represent, as in the case of Eldad
and Medad; and also that the natural powers, although filled with spiritual life, remain distinguished as 
natural powers, as represented by these persons, although of the seventy, not going to the tent, but 
remaining in the camp. And, moreover, what a fine and stimulating picture have we here presented of 
the unselfishness of the higher life, and of the comparative weakness of the lower life as manifested 
both in the literal and spiritual senses by the respective actions of the young man, of Joshua, and of 
Moses! And lastly, how completely is the full regeneration of the Natural represented by Moses and all 
the elders now coming into the camp! May we, therefore, earnestly endeavour, while in this our 
probationary state, alike to understand, to love, and to realize all these things, so that at last we may 
fully enjoy all natural delights in the best sense, as described in our seventh section. But on this we do 
not here enlarge because the series appears clearly from all that goes before and from the references; 
and it will be sufficient if we fully reflect, for our own spiritual benefit, on the contrast, here also 
infernal delights of the unregenerate, and of those who confirm themselves in a life that is merely 
natural.

Numbers Chapter 12

SUMMARY OF THE SPIRITUAL SENSE

1. On the opposition of perverted good and perverted truth to Divine Truth in a state of 

temptation, vers. 1-5. 

2. There is revelation in consequence, showing the distinction between the manifestation of truth 
to the internal and the external, or to the celestial and spiritual man, and also that the external 
man is averted from the Lord and ceases to recognize the truth, vers. 6-9. 

3. And then, when truth is revealed without appearances, there is profanation, which, seen and 

acknowledged, induces a state of repentance, vers. 10-12. 

4. Consequently, there is, internally, a desire for restoration from a state of profanation; and 

revelation is made that this can only be removed by regeneration successively, vers. 13-16. 

THE CONTENTS OF EACH VERSE

1. And Miriam and Aaron spoke 
against Moses because of the 
Cushite woman whom he had 
married: for he had married a 
Cushite woman. 

1. But now a state of interior temptation follows; for 
good and truth perverted are opposed to Divine 
Truth, because the latter is conjoined with interior 
good; and this conjunction is according to order. 

2. And they said, Has the LORD indeed 
spoken only with Moses? has he not 
spoken also with us? And the LORD 
heard it. 

2. But interior truth and good perverted, or those who
pervert them, imagine that they can discern the 
truth from themselves; and this is known to the 
Lord. 

3. Now the man Moses was very meek,
above all the men which were upon 
the face of the earth. 

3. Yet Divine Truth from the Lord immediately, 

especially induces a state of humility; for this is in 
proportion to the love and practice of good and 
truth in various degrees. 

4. And the LORD spoke suddenly to 

4. And Divine Love acting immediately by Divine 

Moses, and to Aaron, and to Miriam,
Come out you three to the tent of 
meeting. And they three came out. 

Truth particularly scrutinizes opposing principles 
in the man of the church by separation from the 
Natural, and by the operation of love and charity 
through the heavens. Nor can this scrutiny be 
avoided. 

5. And the LORD came down in a pillar 
of cloud, and stood at the door of the
Tent, and called Aaron and Miriam: 
and they both came forth. 

5. And also by adapting the revelation of itself to the 
state of man, when he is in the beginning of 
regeneration only, influencing those who are in 
perverted states, and exposing those states; 

167

6. And he said, Hear now my words: if 
there be a prophet among you, I the 
LORD will make myself known to 
him in a vision, I will speak with 
him in a dream. 

6. Giving perception also, that the power to teach 

truths is from the Lord alone, and that by Him also
revelation is made either in clearness or in 
obscurity. 

7. My servant Moses is not so; he is 

7. But that those who have the Divine Law inscribed 

faithful in all mine house: 

on their hearts, like the celestial, or like the Lord 
in His Human on earth, on account of the 
conjunction of truth with good perceive truth 
immediately. 

8. With him will I speak mouth to 

mouth, even manifestly, and not in 
dark speeches; and the form of the 
LORD shall he behold: wherefore 
then were you not afraid to speak 
against my servant, against Moses? 

8. And thus they are most of all in truths and least in 
appearances, discerning that Divine Truth is the 
expression of Divine Good; and consequently the 
Spiritual, who cannot thus perceive truths 
immediately, should fear to claim to themselves 
this power or to ascribe truth to themselves. 

9. And the anger of the LORD was 
kindled against them; and he 
departed. 

9. For by so doing they are averted from the Lord 

exceedingly? and His truth ceases to be known at 
all to them. 

10. And the cloud removed from over 
the Tent; and, behold, Miriam was 
leprous, as white as snow: and Aaron
looked upon Miriam, and, behold, 
she was leprous. 

10. And even when it is revealed to those in such a 
state without appearances, then it is discovered 
that they profane it; and this is made manifest to 
those who are in temptation. 

11. And Aaron said to Moses, Oh my 

11. And thence repentance follows; prayer for 

lord, lay not, I pray you, sin upon us,
for that we have done foolishly, and 
for that we have sinned. 

remission is made; and confession that to claim the
power of discerning truths from and for the sake of
self is not only foolish but wicked. 

12. Let her not, I pray, be as one dead, of
whom the flesh is half consumed 
when he comes out of his mother's 
womb. 

12. Also a strong desire is felt to avoid spiritual death, 
and especially such spiritual death as deprives the 
spiritual man of good through the entire corruption
of truth by profaning it, and thus preventing 
regeneration. 

13. And Moses cried to the LORD, 

13. Whence it follows, that the man of the church 

saying, Heal her, O God, I beseech 
you. 

inmostly desires the restoration of good through 
the medium of genuine truth. 

168

14. And the LORD said to Moses, If her 

14. But perception is given from Divine Good, that 

father had but spit in her face, should
she not be ashamed seven days? let 
her be shut up without the camp 
seven days, and after that she shall 
be brought in again. 

even when interior good is but vitiated slightly by 
falsity from selfish love, the consciousness of sin 
and of the necessity of purification by regeneration
are present; how much more then is this the case 
when there is the profanation of good and truth! It 
must needs be therefore, that while any vestige of 
profanation remains with man, he is excluded from
heaven, and that only when he is fully regenerated 
can he enter therein. 

15. And Miriam was shut up without the
camp seven days: and the people 
journeyed not till Miriam was 
brought in again. 

15. Hence, then, the state of profanation is only 

removed by regeneration successively, and every 
such state, so long as it lasts, retards spiritual 
progress. 

16. And afterward the people journeyed 
from Hazeroth, and pitched in the 
wilderness of Paran. 

16. But when the state of temptation is past, then there
is progress from a state of comparative obscurity 
to a state of spiritual light from the Divine Human 
by the conjunction of truth with good producing 
alike charity internally and the beauty of truth 
externally. 

REFERENCES AND NOTES

1. By Miriam and Aaron speaking against Moses, is denoted a state of interior temptation, 

because Miriam, whose name means exalted, the mistress of the sea, or the bitterness of the 
sea, here signifies the good of faith perverted, and Aaron signifies the truth of faith perverted, 
8337, 8271, 1936, 28, 8349; and by "because of the Cushite woman whom he had married: for
he had married a Cushite woman," is denoted because the latter is conjoined with interior 
good, and that this conjunction is according to order. For Moses denotes Divine Truth, 7010; 
marriage denotes the conjunction of truth with good, or of good with truth according to the 
subject, 48232; a Cushite, or Ethiopian woman, denotes "those who are in possession of 
celestial things, which are love, charity, and the works of charity," in this case charity, because 
this is the interior good of the Spiritual Church, 3492; and Moses having married the Cushite, 
or Ethiopian, woman, is said to be according to order, because the Lord regenerates man by 
means of Divine Truth conjoined with Divine Good flowing into the heavens, or into the mind 
of man which is to become a heaven, 9408, 8309; and because Divine Truth is the very order 
of the Lord's universal kingdom, and Divine Good is the very essential of that order, 1728. In 
the celestial heaven, therefore, the Cushite woman is celestial good as received by the angels 
there, and in the spiritual heaven it is spiritual good, or charity as received by the angels there, 
while with the man of the church it is love or charity, by which the Lord as Divine Truth, or 
the Divine Human, is conjoined with him and he is reciprocally conjoined with the Lord.

2. By Miriam and Aaron saying, is denoted the thought or imagination of perverted good and 
truth, 2506; by "Has the Lord spoken only with Moses?" and "Has He not spoken also with 
us?" is denoted the apparent discernment of Divine Truth from the Lord, while yet it was from 
themselves as the affection in the words, and the context clearly show, 2001, 2951, 7010; and 

169

by the Lord hearing it, is denoted that this is known and provided against by the Lord, by 
permitting man to suffer the consequences of his vain imaginations, as the context, in the 
internal sense, also shows, 3869. 

3. The man Moses being very meek above all the men that were upon the face of the earth, 

denotes that Divine Truth immediately from the Lord, especially induces a state of humility, in
proportion to the love and practice of good and truth in various degrees; for by the man Moses 
is particularly denoted Divine Truth as distinguished from all human affections in man; or the 
Divine Human as distinguished from all finite men, 914410, by his being very meek, is 
denoted a state of humility exceedingly, 1937, 10646; and by "above all the men that were 
upon the face of the earth," or more strictly, the ground, is denoted the greatest degree of 
humility as is evident, 6866, 10570. Note that the Hebrew word for man, as applied to Moses, 
is ish, because he represents Divine Truth; and as applied the second time is adam, this term 
having reference to affection or good, 49, 7120, 158, 160. 

4. The Lord speaking suddenly to Moses, denotes Divine Love acting immediately by Divine 

Truth, 2001, 2951, 7010, 2406; Moses denotes Divine Truth by which there is scrutiny, 7010; 
Aaron and Miriam denote the opposing principles in the church, or in the human mind, ver. 1; 
their coming out, denotes separation from the Natural, implying that man in temptation must 
be elevated and separated from his evil in order that he may be enlightened, and see its true 
nature, 1853; and to the tent of meeting, denotes operation through the heavens, 35403; while 
by their actually coming out is denoted that this scrutiny cannot be avoided, because it was the
effect of the Divine operation, 2951. 

5. The Lord coming down in a pillar of cloud, denotes adaptation to the state of man, 8106; 
standing at the door of the tent of meeting, denotes the Lord's presence with those in the 
beginning of regeneration, 3136, 2356, 35403; calling Aaron and Miriam, denotes influencing 
those in perverted states, 6047, ver. 1; and their coming forth, denotes the exposure of those 
states, 5934. 

6. The Lord saying, "Hear now my words," denotes perception that the power to teach truths is 
from the Lord alone, 1822, 3869, 1288; a prophet denotes one who teaches, 2534; and the 
Lord making Himself known in a vision to him, and speaking to him in a dream, denotes that 
by the Lord all revelation is made either in clearness or in obscurity, 2001, 683, 1970, 6000. 

7. By the Lord's servant Moses, are denoted those who perceive truth immediately, having the 

Divine Law inscribed on their hearts, like the celestial, or like the Lord in His Human on earth,
5161, 3019; and his being faithful in all the Lord's house, denotes the conjunction of truth with
good, 34, 2233. 

8. The Lord speaking with Moses mouth to mouth; manifestly and not in dark speeches, denotes 
that thus they are most of all in truths, and least of all in appearances, 2001, 2951, 6987, 1860, 
589; beholding the form of the Lord, denotes that Divine Truth is the expression of Divine 
Good; 3094, 4985; and being afraid to speak against the Lord's servant, against Moses, 
denotes that the spiritual, who cannot thus perceive truths immediately, should fear to claim to 
themselves this power, or to ascribe truth to themselves, because, in this case, Miriam and 
Aaron in respect to Moses, denote the Spiritual in respect to the Celestial, and their speaking 
against the Lord's servant, signifies not acknowledging Divine Truth immediately proceeding 

170

from and conjoined with Divine Good, 5161, 3019, but on the contrary being disposed, in their
state of temptation, to ascribe it to themselves, ver. 1. 

9. The anger of the Lord being kindled against Miriam and Aaron, and His departing, denotes 

that, by so doing, the Spiritual are averted from the Lord exceedingly; and that His truth ceases
to be known at all to them, 5798, 5827. 

10. By the cloud removing from over the Tent, is denoted the revelation of the truth without 

appearances, 8106; by Miriam being leprous as white as snow, is denoted the profanation of 
truth, 6963, 8459, 4007; and by Aaron looking upon Miriam, is denoted that this is made 
manifest to those who are in temptation, that is, they are shown that by claiming the truth for 
themselves they profane it, 2150. 

11. Aaron saying to Moses, denotes perception from Divine Truth, 1822; "Oh, my lord," denotes 

the acknowledgement that Divine Truth revealed from the Lord involves good, 3049; "lay not, 
I pray you, sin upon us," denotes prayer for remission, 2535; and "for that we have done 
foolishly and for that we have sinned," denotes confession that to claim the power of 
discerning truths from and for the sake of self, is not only foolish but wicked, vers. 1, 2, 7589, 
683. 

12. "Let her not, I pray you, be as one dead, of whom the flesh is half consumed when he comes 
out of his mother's womb," denotes a strong desire to avoid spiritual death, 81, 2908, and 
especially such spiritual death as deprives the spiritual man of good through the entire 
corruption of truth through profaning it and thus preventing regeneration, 780, 9488, 10431, 
6963, 4904. 

13. Moses crying to the Lord, and saying, "Heal her, O God, I beseech You," denotes that the man 
of the church inmostly desires the restoration of good through the medium of genuine truth, 
7010, 2535, 8337. 6502.

14. The Lord saying to Moses, denotes perception given from Divine Good, 2001, 1822, 7010; "If 
her father had but spit in her lace should she not be ashamed seven days?" denotes that even 
when interior good is but vitiated slightly by falsity from selfish love, the consciousness of sin,
and of the necessity for purification by regeneration are present, 370320, 66696, 48354, Lev 
15:8, 358, 213, 2044; and "let her be shut out of the camp seven days and after that let her be 
brought in again," denotes "how much more is this the case when there is the profanation of 
good and truth!" And that it must needs be that while any vestige of profanation remains with 
man, he is excluded from heaven, and that only when he is fully regenerated can he enter 
therein, 6963, 4236, 2044. 

15. Miriam being shut up without the camp seven days, denotes that the state of profanation is 

only removed by regeneration successively, vers. 1, 2, 6963, 2044, 4236; and the people not 
journeying until she was brought in again, denotes that every such state, so long as it lasts, 
retards spiritual progress, 1259, 3654, 1457. 

16. The people afterwards journeying from Hazeroth, and pitching in the wilderness of Paran, 
denotes that when the state of temptation is past, then there is progress from a state of 
comparative obscurity to a state of spiritual light from the Divine Human by the conjunction

of truth with good producing alike charity internally and the beauty of truth externally, 1457, 
3271, 7407, 1616, 2708, 2714, chap 10:12. 

DISCUSSION

In beginning to review this short but interesting chapter, we may reflect for a moment that the 
temptations of the spiritual man take place in a series and successively, as all that goes before and 
follows in the book of Numbers clearly indicates. And the same truth is, evident also from the account 
of the Lord's temptations as described in the gospels. For as in regeneration we must have first the 
blade, then the ear, and after that the full corn in the ear, so the temptations endured must be first 
external, then interior, and lastly internal, since according to his consciousness, man is first in natural 
truths, then in spiritual truths, and lastly in celestial truths; and besides this, his evils are successively 
manifested to him according to the degree of truth in which he is. Now this appears in the series before 
us, since the three states of conflict represented respectively, by the Israelites lusting for flesh, by the 
trouble of Moses in consequence, and now by a still greater trial, clearly denote temptations more and 
more interior. And hence we see that what is spiritually described in our first section is an interior 
temptation.

But let us consider the case as history, in the first place, and even in this respect we have important 
instruction. For it is a predominant thought, with many, that in the sight of the Lord, all men are upon 
equality; that He is quite impartial; and that He does not withhold His benefits from any, whether they 
be rich or poor, or of low birth or noble birth, as far as their worldly position is concerned. And this, of 
course, is true. But there is another way of regarding this matter. While the Lord is impartial, and 
desires equally the salvation of all, yet all are not alike, and, in fact, no two human beings are alike; and
consequently all cannot receive from the Lord the same benefits equally, but each according to his state
and capacity. And hence it really happens, that not every one, or any one, can be a prophet or receive 
revelation as a particular instructor of mankind; and that the Lord appoints persons for this purpose, 
who are best adapted for the precise kind of revelation to be made. For He knows the capacities of all 
men, and leads each into his proper function. Now we see from these thoughts that, even literally, 
Miriam and Aaron reasoned falsely; for they were not capable of performing the duties, for which 
Moses was particularly fitted.

But in this case, what is naturally true is so because it is spiritually true. For although all regenerated 
persons are equally images and likenesses of the Lord, no two are adapted for the same heavenly use. 
Recurring now, however, to the temptation here described, by Miriam and Aaron speaking against 
Moses, and observing that Miriam denotes the good of faith perverted, and Aaron the truth of faith 
perverted, while Moses denotes Divine Truth immediately proceeding from the Lord, we may easily 
see that this concerns that state of the man of the church in which he is disposed to claim to himself the 
power to rule in spiritual things from selfish love. And how much mischief this evil has caused in the 
churches of former times, and also in the corrupted Christian Church, may be known from the history 
of those churches. But it is said that Miriam and Aaron acted as they did, because Moses had married a 
Cushite, or Ethiopian woman, who signifies the celestial things of love, charity, and good works 
therefrom. And is it not evident, that persons of the character here described, who act from selfish love, 
greatly despise the very things that constitute the true church? Hence, therefore, we see how truly the 
internal sense of the Word describes human life and experience. But another thing that is peculiar to 
those who aspire after dominion in spiritual things is, that they do not openly deny the Lord and the 
Word, as we read that neither did Miriam and Aaron. On the contrary, they claim to themselves the 

172

authority of the Lord and the Word. And then how finely does the next verse set before us the character 
of the true prophet, and of the Lord Himself in His Human. For He only could wisely and lovingly say, 
"Learn of Me for I am meek, and lowly of heart, and you shall find rest to your souls" (Matt 11:29). 
And, moreover, we see here how truly Moses was a representative of the Lord. But now we are told, 
the Lord spoke suddenly to Moses, and we pause to think of this. The Lord does nothing suddenly, or in
a hurry, and although He says in one place, "Behold, I come quickly" (Rev 22:7, 12), yet seventeen 
hundred and fifty-seven years elapsed between His first and second advent (LJ 45). Suddenly, or 
immediately, or quickly, therefore, in the internal sense, signifies certainly, and expresses the Lord's 
ardent love for the salvation of men, and also His continual operation for that purpose. Judgement is 
always taking place; and whenever men do wrong their sin is surely found out. Miriam and Aaron 
could not escape the scrutiny of Divine Truth, nor can any man ever do so. And also, as far as good 
men are concerned, who are in temptation, it is necessary that their evil tendencies should be revealed 
to them. Hence, therefore, we see the spiritual meaning of vers. 4-5, both as regards general and 
particular judgements; and it is also evident that the Lord coming down in a pillar of cloud, is 
significative of His second coming, as the reference shows.

And again, the next section enables us still further to see the analogy between this particular case of 
exploration, or scrutiny, and what takes place at the Lord's appearance for the establishment of a new 
church. For this does not mean His personal coming in the clouds of the earthly sky, but the revelation 
of Divine Truth (HH 1), and particularly of the central doctrine of the church, or of the Divine Human, 
here represented by Moses, with whom the Lord spoke manifestly and not in dark speeches. For now it 
is known from the Word, that the Human Nature of the Lord is one with the Divine, and is the full 
manifestation of the Divine, so that, in Jesus, God is man, and man is God in one Divine Person. It is 
true, indeed, that the Lord actually did speak to Moses, as here described, by means of an angel, who, 
for the time being was filled with the Divine Life, his own individuality being quiescent, and that thus 
he spoke as the Lord; and the reason is, because Moses represented, on such occasions, in the highest 
sense, the Divine Human, and in the lower senses, the celestial or spiritual man, as the case might be; 
and certainly, it was not because Moses himself was superior to all other men; and it is of great 
consequence that we should remember this. And also, we must remember that the Lord thus by His 
second coming, has, through the Word, exposed the great evil and error of those who, in the Christian 
Church, presume to claim the power of opening and shutting heaven. These considerations, therefore, 
will clearly show us the deep significance of what is involved in the supreme sense in this section, and 
at the same time illustrate the internal sense as regards the man of the Spiritual Church. And now, 
consequently, the last verse of the section shows that all who would ascribe the truth to themselves, and
assume powers, which belong only to the Lord, thereby separate themselves from Him. For in very 
truth, He does not depart from man, but it is the wicked who, of their own free will, separate 
themselves from Him, because they cannot bear the intensity of the Divine Love, or the surpassing 
splendour of the Divine Truth. And for this reason it is that His love appears to them as anger kindled 
against them; and that, in the Word, anger is frequently ascribed to Him, that the natural man, in his 
early states of life, may be induced, even through fear, to desist from his evils.

Having thus seen the consequences of the revelation signified by the Lord coming down in a pillar of 
cloud as far as the wicked are concerned, we turn to consider its effects with regard to the regenerating 
man. And here two things attract our attention, that is, the lifting up of the cloud, and the leprosy of 
Miriam. With regard to the former, it might at first sight appear to denote the withdrawal of Divine aid, 
because it happened in consequence of the Lord's departure. And, in fact, as far as the wicked are 
concerned, it does represent the removal of truths from them because they themselves reject the Word, 

173

even as to its literal sense signified by the cloud. But with regard to the good, the raising of the cloud, 
as we have before seen, denotes progress, and thus, as it is said, the removal of appearances, and the 
manifestation of interior Divine truths in the spiritual sense of the Word. For the revelation of these 
particularly distinguishes the coming of the Lord, not only in the general sense, by means of a 
Revelator appointed for the purpose, but also in a particular sense by perception given to the ministers 
and members of the church individually. And, secondly, do we not all know very well, that it is the 
function, so to speak, of the Word, to reveal to man his real character when he is disposed to attribute 
the truth to himself, or in other words to profane the truth, which profanation is denoted by leprosy. 
And so then, it happened that, when the cloud was raised Miriam was leprous. But a very natural 
question comes in here. Why was it Miriam who was leprous, and why not Aaron as well? For surely 
he sinned as Miriam did! The answer appears to be twofold. Miriam and Aaron respectively, denote the 
good of faith and the truth of faith, and thus the will and the understanding of the regenerating man. 
But it is the will that constitutes the person primarily, and only the understanding so far as it agrees 
with the will, and therefore it was Miriam who was leprous; and besides this, truth considered 
distinctly, although it is said to be profaned when it is applied to selfish purposes, is still the truth even 
if it is wrongly used, and thus Aaron was not leprous. Also note, that the profanation of truth, signified 
by leprosy, is its perverted use by an affection external to itself, that is, by a selfish affection; and the 
new will of the spiritual man is an internal affection implanted in the understanding; and hence we find 
that it is Aaron who makes the double confession by saying, "we have done foolishly," which is a fault 
of the understanding, and "we have sinned," which is an act of the will. And thus we see how, in 
spiritual temptation, the corrupt will, and the new will are both active, and that there is profanation 
when the natural will prevails, or predominates, and repentance when the new will does so. And now 
consider the entreaty of Aaron. For the spiritual man may here truly fear spiritual death, that kind of 
spiritual death, namely, which is caused by profanation. But read all the passages referred to in 
connection with ver. 12, and also remember that spiritual death, which is caused by profanation, is 
attended by much suffering to the subject of it, because the vastation of such persons is more difficult; 
and it is necessary that every one who thus confirms himself in evil, should finally reject truths 
altogether, not only that he may have less suffering, but that he may be prevented from doing injury to 
the good by continuing in the intermediate state. But now we must consider the last section.

And the predominant general thought that arises out of the spiritual sense here is, that he who is 
regenerated, cannot enter heaven so long as the least remains of falsity from evil are active with him; 
while the great lesson we have to learn is, that we must be most particular in our daily lives, not to 
allow merely natural motives to contaminate our love of the truth. To this we are stimulated particularly
by the study of ver. 14. But another thing here taught is also of great practical importance. Regeneration
is retarded by indulgence in evil; and also the whole church is checked in its progress by the persistence
of certain forms of evil and error, which is described by the people not journeying so long as Miriam 
remained out of the camp, because without the good of faith there can be no advance. And the advance 
here, is from the comparatively obscure state denoted by Hazeroth into the comparatively clear one 
represented by the wilderness of Paran, as the correspondence of each name shows. But we shall 
discover as we proceed, that the general progress of man in regeneration, involves many fluctuations 
between good and evil, so that sometimes he may appear not only to make no progress, but even to 
glide back into former states of discontent and evil and error, as indeed we saw in the last chapter.

man, such as are in the power of truth from good. 

16. These are the names of the men 
which Moses sent to spy out the 
land. And Moses called Hoshea the 
son of Nun Joshua. 

16. These are the general truths by means of which, in 
subordination to Divine Truth, man must examine 
himself; but the quality of the truth which leads 
him to do this successfully is truth which delivers 
him by leading to good in the beginning; while 
truth proceeding from the Lord and bringing 
salvation, fully, delivers him in the end. 

176

17. And Moses sent them to spy out the 
land of Canaan, and said to them, 
Get you up this way by the South, 
and go up into the mountains: 

18. And see the land, what it is; and the 
people that dwells therein, whether 
they be strong or weak, whether they
be few or many; 

19. And what the land is that they dwell 
in, whether it be good or bad; and 
what cities they be that they dwell in,
whether in camps, or in strong holds;

20. And what the land is, whether it be 
fat or lean, whether there be wood 
therein, or not. And be you of good 
courage, and bring of the fruit of the 
land. Now the time was the time of 
the firstripe grapes. 

21. So they went up, and spied out the 
land from the wilderness of Zin to 
Rehob, to the entering in of Hamath. 

22. And they went up by the South, and 
came to Hebron; and Ahiman, 
Sheshai, and Talmai, the children of 
Anak, were there. (Now Hebron was 
built seven years before Zoan in 
Egypt.) 

17. But it is the duty of man, from or according to 

Divine Truth, to examine his own quality, and his 
capacity for the heavenly life; and perception is 
given to him that he should do this by means of the
universal truths of the Word, in a state of 
enlightenment from the Lord, and under the 
influence of Divine Love. 

18. And a man must scrutinize his own spiritual state 
both as to truth and as to good, or as to form and 
as to life, internally, interiorly, and externally; 

19. And also what it is in ultimates as to good or evil, 

and as to truth or falsity there; 

20. And lastly as to the specific quality of his 

affections of good and truth, and as to the presence
of ultimate good from the Lord. And all this is to 
be done with zeal and determination, and with 
particular reference to the quality of charity, as 
embodied in actions, even at the beginning of 
regeneration. 

21. And the extension of this searching examination is
from where truth and good are in obscurity and 
coldness, through the multiplication of truths, to a 
zealous state of natural good, and its truths 
confirmed in ultimates. 

22. It involves also a state of spiritual light from the 
good of the Spiritual Church giving interior 
perception, and then leads to the discovery of 
interior persuasions of falsity from the pride of 
selfish love, having reference to the will, 
understanding, and actions. But the interior good 
of the church which is celestial, is insinuated into 
man in infancy, before he is consciously in 
scientifics or knowledges; 

23. And they came to the valley of 

Eshcol, and cut down from there a 
branch with one cluster of grapes, 
and they bare it upon a staff between
two; they brought also of the 
pomegranates, and of the figs. 

23. Whence he has a perception, according to his state,
of the principle of good or charity in its general 
form, even when that state is low, supporting it by 
the literal sense of the Word with all the power of 
the will and understanding; and thence also he has 
natural truth and natural good. 

177

24. That place was called the valley of 

24. And indeed, charity is manifested in the literal 

Eshcol, because of the cluster which 
the children of Israel cut down from 
there. 

sense of the Word in general; and from it the 
general idea of charity is procured by the man of 
the Spiritual Church. 

25. And they returned from spying out 
the land at the end of forty days. 

25. And besides this, self-examination involves also a 

complete state of trial and temptation. 

26. And they went and came to Moses, 

26. And this leads to the confirmation of Divine Truth 

and to Aaron, and to all the 
congregation of the children of 
Israel, to the wilderness of Paran, to 
Kadesh; and brought back word to 
them, and to all the congregation, 
and showed them the fruit of the 
land. 

and Divine Good, and of the truths of the church 
thence derived, in a state of spiritual light from the
Divine Human, which is a holy state, and which 
affords interior evidence to the man of the church 
internal and external of the reality of Divine and 
heavenly things which may be manifested in the 
exercises of faith and charity; 

27. And they told him, and said, We 

came to the land whither you sentest 
us, and surely it flows with milk and 
honey; and this is the fruit of it. 

27. And that thus the external man, both as to thought 
and will, is brought into harmony with the internal,
and realizes that the heavenly state is also one of 
the good of truth, and of delight as expressed in all
good works. 

28. Howbeit the people that dwell in the 
land are strong, and the cities are 
fenced, and very great: and 
moreover we saw the children of 
Anak there. 

28. But the merely natural man is also fully impressed 
with the difficulty of overcoming the evils, and 
falsities by which evil is defended, fully discerning
the strength of the persuasions of pride from 
selfish love, 

29. Amalek dwells in the land of the 
South: and the Hittite, and the 
Jebusite, and the Amorite, dwell in 
the mountains: and the Canaanite 
dwells by the sea, and along by the 
side of Jordan. 

30. And Caleb stilled the people before 
Moses, and said, Let us go up at 
once, and possess it; for we are well 
able to overcome it. 

29. Of the delusions of falsities from interior evil, of 
the corrupted principles in which there is yet 
something of good, of falsifications in which there 
is yet something of truth, of interior evils in 
general, and of external worship, without internal 
which prevails with the natural man both as to his 
affections and thoughts. 

30. He who is in the principle of good, however, 

discerns the harmony of external with internal 
truth, is elevated above merely natural 
considerations, and is sure that good will triumph, 
because power is given to overcome evil; 

31. But the men that went up with him 

said, We be not able to go up against 
the people; for they are stronger than
we. 

31. While they who are not in good, and yet appear to 
be so outwardly, are unwilling to enter into the 
conflicts against evil and error, conceiving that 
selfish love and its falsities are all-powerful. 

178

32. And they brought up an evil report 

of the land which they had spied out 
to the children of Israel, saying, The 
land, through which we have gone to
spy it out, is a land that eats up the 
inhabitants thereof; and all the 
people that we saw in it are men of 
great stature. 

33. And there we saw the Nephilim, the 
sons of Anak, which come of the 
Nephilim: and we were in our own 
sight as grasshoppers, and so we 
were in their sight. 

32. Moreover, they misrepresent the good and truth of 
the Spiritual Church, which they can yet discern 
through their understandings, being persuaded that
what is called good is in reality consuming evil, 
and that what is called truth is opposing falsity. 

33. And more than all, that the doctrines of the 

Spiritual Church are not inconsistent with the 
direst lusts from the pride of selfish love, which 
will not admit of conjunction with the Lord, and 
that these lusts cause the good and truth of the 
church to appear insignificant to those who are 
only outwardly in them, as well as to those who 
are in the evil of pride.

the new will of good, 6238; Gaddi means my troop, and denotes good works, 3934; and Susi 
means my horse, and thus denotes the understanding of truth, 2761. 

12. Of the tribe of Dan, Ammiel the son of Gemalli, denotes of those who are in the affirmation of 
truth, such as are in the love of truth for the sake of reward, because by Dan is denoted the 
affirmation of truth, 3923; Ammiel means the people of God, and therefore he denotes those 
who are in truths, 1259; and Gemalli means my recompense, and therefore he denotes this 
spiritually, 3816. 

13. Of the tribe of Asher, Sethur the son of Michael, denotes of those who are in natural delight, 

such as are in truth from good on the natural plane, because by Asher is denoted the delight of 
the affections, 3938; Sethur means what is concealed or protected, and therefore he denotes 
the hidden source of natural delight from the Lord, namely, Divine Truth; and Michael means 
"Who is like God?" and therefore he denotes the inmost source thereof, namely, Divine Good, 
6721, 6722, 2001. 

14. Of the tribe of Naphtali, Nahbi the son of Vophsi, denotes of those who are in resistance to evil
in the natural man, such as are in the strength of good in the natural man which does not 

180

appear, because by Naphtali is denoted resistance to evil, 3928; Nahbi is under a root, which 
means to hide, and therefore he denotes the strength of good which does not appear, 6721, 
6722; and Vophsi, which is said by Cruden to mean a fragment, and by some to be of doubtful 
meaning, may be considered, from the series, to denote the little strength from good, which 
those in the state signified by Naphtali have in the beginning of regeneration, or when the 
heavenly land is only being explored.

15. Of the tribe of Gad, Geuel the son of Machi, denotes of those who are in good works in the 
natural man, such as are in the power of truth from good, because by Gad are denoted good 
works, 3943; and Geuel means the Divine majesty, and thus denotes the power of Divine Truth
from Divine Good; Machi, according to the series, denoting good, but the lists which have 
been examined do not contain the meaning of this name.

16. These being the men that Moses sent to spy out the land, denotes that these are the general 

truths by means of which, in subordination to Divine Truth, man must examine himself, 1259, 
7010, 2397, 27145, 19092, 3705; and Moses calling Hoshea the son of Nun Joshua denotes 
that the quality of the truth which leads him to do this successfully is truth which delivers him 
by leading to good in the beginning; while truth from the Lord bringing salvation fully, 
delivers him in the end, because while Hoshea means simply "salvation," Joshua means the 
Lord the Saviour, 8595, 10557, 2001. 

17. By Moses sending the men to spy out the land of Canaan is denoted that it is the duty of man, 
from or according to Divine Truth, to examine his own quality, and his capacity for the 
heavenly life, ver. 16; by saying to them is denoted perception given, 1822; "Get you up this 
way by the south" denotes that he should do this by means of the universal truths of the Word 
in a state of enlightenment from the Lord, ver. 16, 1555; by going up into the mountains is 
denoted under the influence of the Divine Love, 795; and by seeing the land what it is, is 
denoted perception as to the quality of the heavenly life, 2150. 

18. Seeing the people that dwells therein, whether they be strong or weak, or few or many, denotes
that a man must scrutinize his own spiritual state both as to truth and as to good, or as to form 
and as to life, internally, interiorly and externally, 2150, 1259, 2451, 8315, 3820, 6172, 6654, 
chap 9:20. 

19. Seeing what the land is that they dwell in, whether it be good or bad, denotes examining the 
state as to good or evil, 2150, 3310; what cities they dwell in, whether in camps or in 
strongholds, denotes as to truth or falsity, 402, 4236, 3271. Observe here that the land in 
respect to the inhabitants clearly denotes what is external in respect to what is internal; and 
that as good and bad are opposed to each other, so also are camps and strongholds.

20. Seeing what the land is, whether it be fat or lean, denotes examination as to the quality 

respecting good or truth, fat denoting good, and lean denoting truth respectively without good,
10029, 5200, 5204; whether there be wood therein or not denotes as to the presence or not of 
ultimate good, 643; being of good courage, and bringing of the fruit of the land, denotes that 
all this is to be done with zeal and determination, and with particular reference to the quality 
of charity, 7690; and the time being the time of the first ripe grapes denotes even at the 
beginning of regeneration, 35197. 

181

21. By going up and spying out the land is denoted elevation of the mind for a searching 

examination, 1543, ver. 2; from the wilderness of Zin denotes extension from where truth and 
good are in obscurity and coldness, because a wilderness signifies a state of obscurity, 2708, 
and by Zin is meant coldness, and therefore it denotes the absence of love, 934; Rehab means 
breadth, space, or extent, and therefore it denotes the multiplication of truths, 4482; and 
Hamath means anger, heat, or a wall, and therefore it denotes a zealous state of natural good, 
934; while a wall denotes ultimate truths, 6419. 

22. Going up by the south and coming to Hebron denotes entering into a state of spiritual light 

from the good of the Spiritual Church giving perception, 2909; Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai 
the children of Anak being there, denotes the presence of interior persuasions of falsity derived
from selfish love, 2909, 581; Ahiman means a brother of the right hand, and therefore he 
denotes what relates to the will, 1222, 4592; Sheshai means one who is led, and therefore 
denotes what is of the understanding, 58932; Talmai means what is furrowed, as land is when 
ploughed, and therefore he denotes the preparation of the external man to receive the seeds of 
falsity by evil actions, 5895; and Hebron being built seven years before Zoan in Egypt denotes
that the interior good of the church which is celestial is insinuated into man in infancy before 
he is consciously in scientifics or knowledges, because by Hebron is denoted the Spiritual 
Church, 2909; being built denotes the increase of good by means of truth, good being from the
Lord by influx, 4390, 1555; seven years denotes holiness and completeness, 716, 2044; and by
Zoan, which means motion, is denoted the affection of scientifics or knowledges, in the natural
mind signified by Egypt, 51733, 1482, 33226. 

23. Coming to the valley of Eshcol and cutting down thence a branch with one cluster of grapes, 
denotes that thence he has a perception, according to his state, of the principle of good, or 
charity, in its general form, even when that state is low, because by a valley is signified a state 
respectively low, 4715, Eshcol means a bunch of grapes, and therefore denotes charity, 1071; 
and it is said charity in its general form, because there was one cluster, and also because the 
spiritual man, in the state here described, cannot have a perception of charity as to particulars, 
1285; their bearing it upon a staff between two denotes supporting it by the literal sense of the 
Word with all the power of the will and the understanding, because by bearing is signified 
supporting, spiritually, 9500, by the staff is signified power, and thus the literal sense of the 
Word where Divine Truth is in fullness and power, 9496, 9430, see also DLW 221, and by 
"between two" is signified what is of the will and understanding, 747; and bringing also of the 
pomegranates and figs denotes that thence also there is natural truth and natural good, 9552, 
216. 

24. That place being called the valley of Eschol, because of the cluster which the children of Israel
cut down from there, denotes that, indeed, charity is manifested in the literal sense of the Word
in general; and that from it the general idea of charity is procured by the man of the Spiritual 
Church, ver. 23. 

25. Returning from spying out the land at the end of forty days denotes that, besides this, self-

examination involves a complete state of trial and temptation, ver. 2, 730. 

26. Going and coming to Moses, and Aaron, and all the congregation of the children of Israel to 

the wilderness of Paran, to Kadesh, denotes being led to the confirmation of Divine Truth, and 
Divine Good, and of the truths of the church thence derived in a state of spiritual light from 

182

the Divine Human which is at holy state, 3335, 3572, 7010, 9946, 4574, 3654, 2708, 2714, 
2503, 1678; the word Kadesh means holy, and therefore denotes a holy state from the affection
of truth 2503; and bringing back word to them, and showing them the fruit of the land, denotes
affording interior evidence to the man of the church internal and external, of the reality of 
Divine and heavenly things, which may be manifested in the exercises of faith and charity, 
2288, 1288, 2150, 1071, 7010, 9946, 4574, 3654. 

27. Their telling Moses and saying, denotes the thought and perception of the internal derived 
from the external man, 3209; their coming into the land to which Moses had sent them, 
denotes the harmony between the internal and external man, because the men sent were 
obedient to Moses, who represents the internal, while they represent the external, 7010, ver. 2; 
it being a land flowing with milk and honey, denotes the realization that the heavenly state is 
one of the good of truth, and of delight, 56209; and this being the fruit of it denotes these 
things as expressed in good works, or good works proceeding from charity and faith, ver. 23, 
1873. 

28. By the people dwelling in the land being strong is denoted the thought of the merely natural 

man concerning evils to be overcome, 1259, 2451, 3727 end; the cities being fenced and very 
great denotes the thought of the merely natural man concerning falsities conjoined with those 
evils, 402, 2451, 2227; and by the children of Anak being there are denoted thoughts 
concerning the strength of the persuasions of pride from selfish love, 581. 

29. Amalek dwelling in the land of the south denotes the delusions of falsities from interior evil, 
8593, 2451, 61106; the Hittite denotes corrupted principles in which there is yet something of 
good, 2913; the Jebusite denotes falsifications in which there is yet something of truth, 1867, 
6860; the Amorite dwelling in the mountains denotes evil in general, 1857, 2451, 1691; and 
the Canaanites denote external worship without internal, which prevails with the natural man 
both as to his affections and thoughts, because they dwelt by the sea and the Jordan, 1063, 
2451, 53137, 1585. 

30. Caleb stilling the people before Moses denotes that he who is in the principle of good discerns 

the harmony of external with internal truth, ver. 6, 8176, 1259, 7010, 1822; and "let us go up 
at once and possess it, for we are well able to overcome it," denotes elevation above merely 
natural considerations, and confidence that good will triumph because power is given to 
overcome evil, 1543, 2658, 93383. 

31. The men that went up with Caleb denote those who are not in good and yet appear to be so 

outwardly, vers. 28, 29, 1543; saying denotes perception, 1822; and "we be not able to go 
against the people, because they are stronger than we," denotes unwillingness to enter into the 
conflict against evil and error, and the conception that selfish love and its falsities are all 
powerful, 93383, 3727 end, 10481. 

32. Bringing up an evil report of the land which they had spied out to the children of Israel, 

saying, denotes that the wicked misrepresent the good and truth of the Spiritual Church, which
they can yet discern through their understandings, 4674, ver. 2, 1822; the land being a land 
that eats up the inhabitants thereof, denotes the persuasion that what is called good is in reality
consuming evil, 5149; and all the people seen in it being men of great stature, denotes that 

183

what is called truth is opposing falsity, according to perception from such a persuasion, 1259, 
5011, 2150. 

33. Seeing there the Nephilim, the sons of Anak, which some of the Nephilim, denotes that, 
mcireover, the doctrines of the Spiritual Church are not inconsistent, according to such 
persuasion, with the direst lusts from the pride of selfish love, which will not admit of 
conjunction with the Lord, 2150, 581, 3705; and the men being in their own sight, and in the 
sight of the Nephilim, as grasshoppers, denotes that these lusts cause the good and truth of the 
church to appear insignificant to those who are only outwardly in them, as well as to those 
who are in the evil of pride, ver. 2, 2374, 581, 2403, 7643. See Kitto, Encyclopedia are. 
Chagab. 

DISCUSSION 

The importance of continual self-examination by the man of the church can hardly be too earnestly 
insisted upon. And it must be evident at once that this ought not to be superficial only. For it is quite 
possible for a person to compare his actions with the commandments of the Decalogue, for example, 
and to be able to say, "I have not broken any of these," if he finds that his outward conduct has been, 
generally, in harmony therewith. And therefore it is clear that self-examination includes more than this, 
and should regard the motive as well as the act. But a motive may be either selfish or unselfish, or it 
may be both in the same degree, or in different degrees, according to the affections which constitute it. 
And hence we see that self-examination is not the simple thing it might appear to be to some. For 
motives are sometimes very complex, and seem to defy particular investigation. What, then, is the 
remedy? It is the power of discrimination by the light of truth from the Word, and by the influence of 
the Holy Spirit of love. And this is what is involved in our first section. For Jehovah, or the Lord, is the 
Divine Love; Moses is Divine Truth; and Paran is the light of truth accommodated to the state. Thus, 
then, we learn, in general, that the Lord gives to every one who earnestly desires it, the power to 
examine himself, which is signified by spying out the land of Canaan.

Now we know what the twelve tribes signify, namely, all the general truths of the Word, not because 
they are exactly twelve, but because twelve signifies all. But we are interested in our second section on 
account of the wonderful way in which the names mentioned correspond to the principles represented 
by each tribe, and by the order in which each tribe is named. The meaning of the name givcn to each 
tribe has been already explained; but the order in this chapter has not been considered. It may, 
therefore, be observed that, as the tribes signify all the general principles of the Word, of the church, 
and thence all the degrees of life in the man of the church, therefore, in this account, the first four tribes
denote the inmost degree, the second the middle degree, and the third the ultimate degree; and that as 
the general subject is investigation or examination, therefore the tribe that commences each degree has 
reference to the understanding, and modifies the signification of those which follow. And these are 
Reuben, Ephraim, and Dan, the first representing faith in the understanding, the second the new 
intellectual principle, and the third the affirmation of truth. But, although the intellect is predominant, it
must be stimulated by the will, or by affection, and by application to life; and hence the tribes that 
follow their leader in each degree indicate this; for Simeon signifies faith in the will, Judah denotes 
celestial love, or charity as the Spiritual Church is treated of, and Issachar denotes mutual love. So, 
again, Benjamin represents truth from good, Zebulun their conjunction, and Manasseh the new will of 
good. And, lastly, Asher signifies natural delight, Naphtali denotes resistance to evil, and Gad the 
practice of good. And hence it is clear that the position given to each tribe is in harmony with the series.

184

But this is not all. For we now have to consider the names and origins of each of the leaders chosen for 
the expedition proposed, and we shall discover that they, too, harmonize with the tribes to which they 
belong, and with the object in view. The meaning of each name and its correspondence, being given 
with the references, need not here be repeated; it will suffice to notice the result as stated in giving the 
internal sense of each verse. Those in faith in the understanding ought to obey the truth received into 
the memory. Those who are in faith in the will should yet judge concerning truths, even if their state is 
comparatively obscure; for obedience without judgement is not the part of a thoughtful man. Again, 
who does not recognize that the truly loving man more readily perceives truths than others? And are not
those who mutually love each other, because they love the Lord, already redeemed and enriched with 
the good of the church? Again, we are sure that those who are intelligent in spiritual things from the 
pure love of the truth and the practice of it, are capable, from the Lord, of promoting the salvation of 
others; and we know, too, that truth, which is the means of leading to good, and is properly applied 
with power, removes evil and thus heals all spiritual sicknesses. Also do not those who conjoin faith 
with charity, sincerely practise good works, and thus confirm themselves in what they love? For good 
feelings and pious thoughts, not expressed in deeds, are evanescent, and are not firmly established in 
the soul. And are not those who are in the new will of good also in works, thence from the 
understanding of truth, since the latter precedes the former? And, further, we know that simply to 
affirm the truth at the beginning of regeneration may be accompanied by the love of reward; while the 
first state of one in natural delight in spiritual things may properly be called a state of truth from good 
on the natural plane. And, lastly, those who resist evil from a principle of good have power given them 
from the Lord, which seems to be as from themselves; while, surely, good works, which are genuine, 
certainly express also the power of truth from good.

But now, as we know from the sequel, that only two of the twelve who were sent to search the land 
gave an encouraging report, it is evident that the ten who were afraid represent those who, like the 
Sardians (Rev 3:1), have a name that they live, and yet are spiritually dead. We need all, therefore, as 
men of the church, to be carefully on our guard, lest we lapse into merely external worship, while we 
earnestly endeavour to be of the number of those represented, Caleb and Joshua, who denote those who
are internally in good and truth as well as externally; and it is remarkable here that the former was of 
the tribe of Judah, who signifies good especially, and the latter of the tribe of Ephraim who signifies 
truth especially; and hence we see that these two denote generally all those who are of the true Celestial
Church and of the true Spiritual Church respectively, as indeed afterwards appears from the application 
of their names by the prophets, as well as, in this place, from the meaning, and therefore the 
correspondence of the names, as they have been given above. We now, however, proceed to consider 
the third section.

And here a study of all the correspondences carefully will show clearly how changes of place in the 
natural world represent changes of state in the spiritual world, and in the progress of the mind. We all 
recognize this; and it seems quite easy to consider our progress to heaven as a journey. But when we 
are told positively that there is no such thing as space in the spiritual world although there is all the 
appearance of space, it is difficult for us, with our present ideas of time and space, to realize this. For 
we naturally ask, "How can there be so strong an appearance, or sense, of space where the thing itself 
does not exist? It is worth while, therefore, to endeavour to form some rational and tangible idea of this
fact; for that it is a fact we may be sure from the simple consideration that everywhere in the natural 
world there is space, which can be measured because it is fixed; and also from considering that, on this 
account, no journey through space could bring us to the spiritual world, where heaven and hell and the 

185

world of judgement are, and where the Lord undoubtedly is. The spiritual world, therefore, cannot be a 
world in which there is space.

And, in the second place, as we have a clear idea of the world of space, we wish now to have a clear 
idea of the world in which there is no space, and we may have this. For as our bodies, we know, are a 
part of space, so we equally know that our minds are not in space, and that we neither love in space nor 
think in space. But evidently our minds (that is, our wills and our intellects), which are so powerful that
they can control and direct our bodies, are something distinct from our bodies; and are a kind of 
substance and form; for there are millions of human minds, just as there millions of human bodies, and 
not two of them are alike. Moreover, just as we know positively that our bodies are in space, we 
equally know, or are conscious that our minds or spirits, consisting of our will and understanding, and 
of our various feelings and thoughts, are not in space, and cannot be measured like space. Hence, then, 
it follows, incontrovertibly, that while our bodies are certainly in the world of space, our minds, or our 
spirits, or our souls, which really constitute ourselves, are not in space, never were, and never will be in
space. That is, in one sentence, our bodies are in the material world, or the world of space, and our 
souls are in the spiritual world, or in the world, which is without space. And now, therefore, we may 
see, if we think, that wherever there are human beings in the material universe, there also the same 
human beings are in the spiritual universe. And so, in short, the spiritual world, which is the world 
without space, and of which every one of us may be conscious to a certain extent, is co-extensive with 
the material world. We may have, therefore, if we wish, a clear and distinct idea of the spiritual world, 
and of its being a world without a space.

But, thirdly, we may also have a clear and distinct idea that in the spiritual world there is, nevertheless, 
the outward appearance of space. For whenever we think, or conceive a thing in our minds, and we 
hardly ever cease from doing so, we think, as it were, in space, nor can we think without doing so more
or less. For, indeed, there is no such thing, in reality, as what we sometimes call abstract thought. Now, 
how common a thing it is to build castles in the air, as we say, or to indulge our imagination. But to 
indulge the imagination is to do nothing else but think in the spiritual world, and is an evidence that any
one may have, that in the other life, where there is no space there is yet the appearance of space. For if 
we deny that what we call imagination is a reality, that is, a real spiritual experience, we shall also have
to affirm that our minds or spirits are not so real as our bodies, which is manifestly absurd, since we 
know that the mind it is "which does the body make," or of which the body is only the form, or 
representative in the material world. It is clear, therefore, that any one who wishes sincerely to have an 
idea of the spiritual world as being without space, and yet having the living appearance of space, he 
may do so if he consults carefully the operations and the laws of his own mind. But this is a longer 
argument than was at first anticipated, and we must return to finish our third section.

The truth now to be re-stated is that we see heaven only by means of enlightenment from the Lord, 
signified by going up into the south. There must be an elevation of the mind above merely natural 
things if we would "see the land, what it is;" and, further, this must lead to an elevation into a state of 
the love of truth, denoted by going into the mountains. These two are the general states of investigation;
and as we see from the explanation in giving the references, they cause us to examine ourselves 
particularly, and to understand that we pass from where our life is in obscurity to a state of natural good
and its truths, or of obedience from a sense of duty, the truths relating thereto being, like a wall, barriers
against the incursions of evil and error. For affection and intelligence not embodied in usefulness to 
others, are but vain fancies, leaving the soul exposed to the incursions of our spiritual enemies. Hence, 
therefore, it is clear that this section, although short, involves very much.

186

But now, coming to our fourth section, we remark that whereas the third, in the literal sense, describes a
journey from the south to the north, this describes one from the north to the south, and thus is 
represented, spiritually, a progress of a threefold character: first from the obscurity and coldness, 
denoted by the wilderness of Zin, into a state of enlightenment and love internally; secondly, in 
consequence, to a new state of the natural man signified by Hamath; and thirdly into an interior state 
represented by passing from the north to the south. And this is exactly according to our experience in 
regeneration. And then note the result. First, the interior evils and falsities of our unregenerate state are 
discovered to us, and secondly a new state as to spiritual good or charity, denoted by the bunch of 
grapes, and also an improved state still further as to the truth and good of the natural man, signified by 
the pomegranates and figs. And yet this state is described as a valley, because it is a low state 
comparatively, it not being possible to realize a higher until the evils and falsities which bar the way, 
and are represented by the sons of Anak, are fully overcome, through victory in the temptations, which 
must take place, and which are represented, as we have seen, by the period of forty days. From this 
rapid sketch, therefore, of the contents of this section we may, in a slight measure, see the beauty and 
harmony of the internal sense, and how accurately it sets before us what we must all experience. For 
unless we know what our inmost evils are we cannot conquer them, and unless we conquer we cannot 
properly realize the heavenly life of charity and good works. And this brings us to our last section, 
which contains the report of the spies, and its effect upon the people.

Here, however, we need not linger. But it may be interesting to observe that the spiritual state called 
Kadesh represents, according to the meaning of the word, a holy state, as far as the good are concerned,
resulting from a state of self-examination; but it also signifies a state of contention about truths, 1678; 
and it appears from the history that the Israelites were twice at Kadesh, once before the long 
wandering, and again when it had come to its end, nothing whatever being recorded of that terrible 
experience of thirty-eight years. And here we see that the majority of those who had been sent to 
examine the land, and also the majority of the people, were afraid, and unwilling to go forward and 
conquer it. This is a very sad picture of the state of the Israelites, after being delivered by the Lord as 
they had been; but it exactly resembles the state of those who, notwithstanding the clear light of 
revelation, reject the heavenly life and prefer the selfish life. May we as members of the church not be 
among that number, but rather among those who are fully in love to the Lord and love to the neighbour,
and who, like Caleb and Joshua, have no fear of being able to overcome the opposing enemy through 
constant Divine aid.

187

Numbers Chapter 14

SUMMARY OF THE SPIRITUAL SENSE

1. A continuation of the closing subject of the last chapter, describing more particularly the state 

of temptation and its effect with the wicked and with the good, vers. 1-10. 

2. Revelation from the Lord that those who are merely natural will persist in their hatred of good,
while the good will be delivered; including a description of the state of the good during the 
temptation, and of consolation given to them, notwithstanding that their temptation may 
continue, vers. 11-25. 

3. Further, there is revelation giving a more particular description of the experiences of the 

wicked, of their vastation, and of the preservation of those who are established in good and 
truth, vers. 26-39. 

4. Concerning the attempt of those who are in merely external worship without any genuine 

spiritual life to overcome evil by and from themselves, and the consequences thereof, vers. 40-
45. 

THE CONTENTS OF EACH VERSE

1. And all the congregation lifted up 

their voice, and cried; and the people
wept that night. 

2. And all the children of Israel 

murmured against Moses and against
Aaron: and the whole congregation 
said to them, Would God that we had
died in the land of Egypt! or would 
God we had died in this wilderness! 

1. But in the continuance of the strong temptation the
man of the church is in a state of distress and grief 
on account of the obscurity which prevails with 
him. 

2. And there is opposition against Divine Truth and 
Divine Good, and a state of despair arising from 
the merely natural loves, and from ignorance as to 
truths. 

3. And wherefore does the LORD bring 
us to this land, to fall by the sword? 
Our wives and our little ones shall be
a prey: were it not better for us to 
return into Egypt? 

3. At the same time that the life of religion seems to 
be threatened, through falsities, with the extinction
of the love of good and with the destruction of 
innocence, so that the tendency becomes strong to 
yield to the natural man by giving up the contest. 

4. And they said one to another, Let us 
make a captain, and let us return into
Egypt. 

4. While the perception is, that the reasoning of the 
natural man is a sufficient guide in life, and that 
natural delights alone are to be desired.

5. Then Moses and Aaron fell on their 
faces before all the assembly of the 
congregation of the children of 
Israel. 

5. But the consequence of this is a state of profound 
humiliation as to internals, apparently before 
prevailing externals; 

6. And Joshua the son of Nun and 

Caleb the son of Jephunneh, which 
were of them that spied out the land, 
rent their clothes: 

6. And the interior principles of truth from good, and 
of good from truth, which have truly discerned the 
glory of the heavenly life, now mourn on account 
of apparently lost truth. 

7. And they spoke to all the 

7. But yet there is perception thence even with the 

congregation of the children of 
Israel, saying, The land, which we 
passed through to spy it out, is an 
exceeding good land. 

8.

If the LORD delight in us, then he 
will bring us into this land, and give 
it to us; a land which flows with 
milk and honey. 

external man, that the heavenly life, 
notwithstanding appearances, is the only genuine 
life; 

8. That he who is in the delight of good from the 

Lord, is confident that he will receive good and 
truth from Him in externals; and that therefore he 
shall yet experience the conjunction of good and 
truth and natural delight there; 

9. Only rebel not against the LORD, 
neither fear you the people of the 
land; for they are bread for us: their 
defence is removed from over them, 
and the LORD is with us: fear them 
not. 

9. Provided only that the natural man is willing to 

submit himself, and no longer to fear that evil will 
prevail with him, because by temptations man 
becomes receptive of good, and because in evil 
there is no power when resisted from a principle of
good; for a state of good destroys fear. 

10. But all the congregation bade stone 
them with stones. And the glory of 
the LORD appeared in the tent of 
meeting to all the children of Israel. 

10. But the merely natural man regards all these truths 
as falsities, while by the spiritual man they are 
seen in the light of Divine Truth made manifest 
through all the heavens in the state of worship. 

11. And the LORD said to Moses, How 

long will this people despise me? 
and how long will they not believe in
me, for all the signs which I have 
worked among them? 

11. And there is revelation from the Lord by Divine 
Truth, that those who are merely natural will 
persist in their hatred of good, and will not have 
faith in Divine Truth, notwithstanding they may be
compelled to obedience by miracles outwardly. 

12. I will smite them with the pestilence,

12. Therefore such persons must perish through the 

and disinherit them, and will make 
of you a nation greater and mightier 
than they. 

destruction of remains, and will no longer abide in 
merely external worship, which is only 
representative of what is external; while those who
are truly internal men by resistance to evil and 
victory over it, shall enjoy the realization of good 
from the Lord and of truth thence even in their 
natural man. 

189

13. And Moses said to the LORD, Then 
the Egyptians shall hear it; for you 
broughtest up this people in your 
might from among them; 

14. And they will tell it to the 

inhabitants of this land: they have 
heard that you LORD are in the midst 
of this people; for you LORD are seen
face to face, and your cloud stands 
over them, and you go before them 
in a pillar of cloud by day, and in a 
pillar of fire by night. 

15. Now if you shall kill this people as 
one man, then the nations which 
have heard the fame of you will 
speak, saying, 

13. And although still, in a state of temptation, they 
too fear the uprisings of the merely natural man; 
yet they remember the Lord's work of redemption; 

14. And although they dread the incursions of falsity 
even in their state of prevailing good, yet even 
their natural powers are under the influence of that
good, since they are in truths interiorly, and in the 
letter of the Word exteriorly, and thence have 
truths accommodated to their states of brightness, 
and also to their states of obscurity. 

15. But when, in temptation, they fear to be deprived 
of the heavenly life, and notwithstanding they 
have been in truths, they may be overwhelmed by 
the insinuation from their enemies; and they fear 
also, 

16. Because the LORD was not able to 

bring this people into the land which 
he swore to them, therefore he has 
slain them in the wilderness. 

16. That because the realization of the heavenly life is 
an impossibility, therefore they must of necessity 
be given up to evil and its falsities, which is 
spiritual death. 

17. And now, I pray you, let the power 
of the Lord be great, according as 
you have spoken, saying, 

17. And hence they are earnest in their prayers to the 
Lord, and in their application to the Word from 
which they have the perception, 

18. The LORD is slow to anger, and 

18. That the Lord in reality is pure love, and abundant 

plentiful in mercy, forgiving iniquity 
and transgression, and that will by 
no means clear the guilty; visiting 
the iniquity of the fathers upon the 
children, upon the third and upon the
fourth generation. 

in mercy; that He will remove evil internally and 
externally from those who repent; and that only 
those who deliberately choose evil will remain in 
it, because evil which is increased and confirmed 
by falsity in a long series, is conjoined with that 
falsity and becomes permanent. 

19. Pardon, I pray you, the iniquity of 
this people according to the 
greatness of your mercy, and 
according as you have forgiven this 
people, from Egypt even until now. 

19. And therefore they know that their earnest desire 

for the removal of their evils will be complied with
according to the mercy of the Lord, even as is the 
case in every temptation in which man conquers 
by the power of the Lord. 

20. And the LORD said, I have pardoned 

according to your word: 

20. And therefore also they receive the assurance in 
themselves of complete deliverance according to 
Divine Truth. 

190

21. But in very deed, as I live, and as all 
the earth shall be filled with the 
glory of the LORD; 

21. But nevertheless, as sure as the Lord is Life Itself; 
as sure as He made His Human Divine; and as sure
as He regenerates man internally and externally; 

22. Because all those men which have 

22. Because the wicked who have received, in the 

seen my glory, and my signs, which I
worked in Egypt and in the 
wilderness, yet have tempted me 
these ten times, and have not 
hearkened to my voice; 

natural life, instruction in Divine Good and Divine
Truth internally and externally, and have had the 
opportunity of being regenerated through 
temptations and remains in all fullness, and yet 
have persisted in their own life of disobedience; 

23. Surely they shall not see the land 
which I swore to their fathers, 
neither shall any of them that 
despised me see it: 

23. They cannot enter into the heavenly state, which is
from the Lord by irrevocable confirmation with 
the good; nor especially can they do so, who have 
confirmed evil by falsity. 

24. But my servant Caleb, because he 

24. But he who acknowledges himself to be the 

had another spirit with him, and has 
followed me fully, him will I bring 
into the land where-into he went; and
his seed shall possess it. 

servant of the Lord, and who is receptive of the 
heavenly life, truly embodying it in his actions, 
finally realizes that life in fullness, and with him 
good and truth will abundantly increase. 

25. Now the Amalekite and the 

Canaanite dwell in the valley: to-
morrow turn you, and get you into 
the wilderness by the way to the Red
Sea. 

25. But in the meantime evils and falsities internal and
external still occupy the natural man, and therefore
changes of state follow continually; and other 
temptations are impending through influx from the
hells in a state of obscurity. 

26. And the LORD spoke to Moses and to

26. And further, there is revelation from the Lord by 

Aaron, saying, 

Divine Truth and by doctrine thence, 

27. How long shall I beAR with this evil
congregation, which murmur against
me? I have heard the murmurings of 
the children of Israel, which they 
murmur against me. 

27. That temptations must needs continue with the 

man of the Spiritual Church who is not yet wholly 
confirmed in good; for so long as evil is active and
at the same time there is perception of Divine 
Truths, 

28. Say to them, As I live, says the Lord,

surely as you have spoken in mine 
ears, so will I do to you: 

28. There is also the perception that since the Lord is 
Life Itself the communication of that life to man is
altogether according to the state of the man. 

29. Your carcases shall fall in this 

29. And therefore the wicked who are in external 

wilderness; and all that were 
numbered of you, according to your 
whole number, from twenty years 
old and upward, which have 
murmured against me, 

worship and yet without spiritual life are vastated 
of all spiritual truth, and are thus in spiritual 
darkness, notwithstanding that, outwardly, they 
formed a portion of the Spiritual Church, and were
then in intelligence as to truths, some perception of
charity, and endured temptations. 

191

30. Surely you shall not come into the 
land, concerning which I lifted up 
my hand that I would make you 
dwell therein, save Caleb the son of 
Jephunneh, and Joshua the son of 
Nun. 

31. But your little ones, which you said 
should be a prey, them will I bring 
in, and they shall know the land 
which you have rejected. 

32. But as for you, your carcases shall 

fall in this wilderness. 

33. And your children shall be 

wanderers in the wilderness forty 
years, and shall bear your 
whoredoms, until your carcases be 
consumed in the wilderness. 

30. And so neither can they enjoy the life of heaven, 
which the Lord from His Divine Omnipotence, is 
both willing and able to impart to man; but they 
who are in good from Divine Truths, and in truths 
derived from good, alone do this. 

31. While they who are in innocence; and yet in 

apparent danger through ignorance, are capable of 
receiving good and do receive it from the Lord, 
notwithstanding hereditary defilements; for they 
can be instructed in good and truth, which the 
wicked reject and despise. 

32. And therefore the wicked must necessarily perish 
through vastation as to good and truth, and through
the adoption of the evil and falsity which they 
have confirmed in themselves. 

33. But those who are capable of regeneration by the 
reception of innocence are instructed in their 
obscurity, and endure a full course of spiritual 
temptations, being subject to the fluctuations 
caused by the falsification of truth, through evil, 
until they themselves are vastated of all evil and 
falsity. 

34. After the number of the days in 

34. For tendencies to evil from hell with man are 

which you spied out the land, even 
forty days, for every day a year, shall
you bear your iniquities, even forty 
years, and you shall know my 
alienation. 

equally balanced by tendencies to good with him 
from the Lord, all general states involving those 
which are particular, and hence it is necessary that 
every one should endure temptations, and should 
freely choose his own eternal life. 

35. I the LORD have spoken, surely this 
will I do to all this evil congregation,
that are gathered together against 
me: in this wilderness they shall be 
consumed, and there they shall die. 

35. And this arises from the unchangeable character of
Divine Good and of Divine Truth thence, evil 
being the opposite of good, and falsity the opposite
of truth, so that the wicked are consumed by their 
own falsities, and are overwhelmed by their own 
evils. 

36. And the men, which Moses sent to 
spy out the land, who returned, and 
made all the congregation to murmur
against him, by bringing up an evil 
report against the land, 

36. And those who, having had the opportunity of 

choosing good and truth, turn away from them and
intensify the state of temptation with the man of 
the church, because they are unwilling to engage 
in the conflict against evil, 

192

37. Even those men that did bring up an 
evil report of the land, died by the 
plague before the LORD. 

37. And who confirm their evil by falsity; even these 
destroy in themselves all remains, and thus render 
their salvation impossible. 

38. But Joshua the son of Nun, and 
Caleb the son of Jephunneh, 
remained alive of those men that 
went to spy out the land. 

39. And Moses told these words to all 

the children of Israel: and the people 
mourned greatly. 

40. And they rose up early in the 

morning, and gat them up to the top 
of the mountain, saying, Lo, we be 
here, and will go up to the place 
which the LORD has promised: for 
we have sinned. 

41. And Moses said, Wherefore now do 
you transgress the commandment of 
the LORD, seeing it shall not prosper?

38. But those who are in truth derived from good, and 
in good derived from truth, and who do not 
confirm their evils by falsities, are in the 
enjoyment of the life of good, because they have 
confirmed that life by truths. 

39. But also, Divine Truth is revealed to the man of 
the church from the Lord, and the first effect 
thereof is mourning on account of their state of sin
and weakness. 

40. And secondly, in a state of external illustration, 
and in the excitement of selfish fear, they are 
willing to be obedient, and outwardly, at least, to 
adopt the heavenly life, and forsake their sin. 

41. But Divine Truth perceives their state of external-

ism, and therefore of disobedience, and affirms 
that man cannot overcome evil by and from 
himself; 

42. Go not up, for the LORD is not

down before your enemies. 

conjunction with the Lord; nor can it overcome the
evils of the selfish life. 

43. For there the Amalekite and the

Canaanite are before you, and you 
shall fall by the sword: because you 
are turned back from following the 
LORD, therefore the LORD will not be

prevail, and falsities from those evils are 
destructive of spiritual life, since they avert 
themselves from the supreme life, and therefore 
cannot receive it. 

44. But they presumed to go up to the

Moses, departed not out of the camp.

presumptuous, and elevates himself as if sure of 
victory; yet such have no interior conjunction with
the Lord, and with Divine Truth; nor are they 
prepared for a real conflict. 

45. Then the Amalekite came down, and 
the Canaanite which dwelt in that 
mountain, and smote them and beat 
them down, even to Hormah. 

45. The consequence of which is that evils interior and
exterior break forth from within them; and evil 
then both as to the will and understanding impels 
them to their ultimate destruction. 

193

REFERENCES AND NOTES

1. All the congregation lifting up their voice and crying; and the people weeping that night, 

denotes that in the continuance of the strong temptation the man of the church is in a state of 
distress and grief on account of the obscurity which prevails with him, 7843, 375, 9202, 1259, 
2689, 1712. In the first reference, we read "congregation is predicated of truth and assembly of
good," in the passage commented upon; and the Hebrew word here translated "congregation," 
is there translated "assembly," and therefore denotes good, while "people" denotes truth, and 
thus the verse describes distress as to the will, and grief as to the understanding. Also in order 
to endure temptations successfully, a person must be potentially in good, as well as ostensibly 
in the truth, by means of which he carries on the combat.

2. All the children of Israel murmuring against Moses and against Aaron, denotes that there is 

opposition against Divine Truth and Divine Good, 8351; and the whole congregation, or rather
assembly, saying to them, "Would God that we had died in the land of Egypt! or would God 
we had died in this wilderness!" denotes a state of despair arising from the merely natural 
loves, and from ignorance as to truths, 7843, 2001, 6119, 8567, 33226, 5013, 2708. 

3. The Lord bringing the Israelites into that land to fall by the sword, denotes the thought of the 
spiritual man in temptation that the life of religion seems to be threatened through falsities, 
2001, 3705, 279915; their wives and their little ones being a prey, denotes the danger of the 
destruction of the love of good and of innocence, 915, 430, 5763; and "were it not better for us
to return into Egypt?" denotes a strong tendency to yield to the natural man by giving up the 
contest, 24542, 6661. 

4. Saying one to another, "let us make a captain, and let us return into Egypt," denotes the 

perception that the reasoning of the natural man, is a sufficient guide in life, and that natural 
delights alone, are to be desired, 91667, 24543, 6661. 

5. Moses and Aaron falling on their faces before all the assembly of the congregation of Israel, 

denotes a state of profound humiliation as to internals, apparently before prevailing externals, 
7010, 9946, 1999, 7843. See ver. 1; and note that, according to the last reference, the words 
"assembly" and "congregation," ought to be reversed.

6.

Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, which were of them that spied out the 
land rending their clothes, denotes that the interior principles of truth from good and of good 
from truth, which have truly discerned the glory of the heavenly life, now mourn on account of
apparently lost truth, 8595, 4112, 2150, chap 13:6, 8, 27145, 3705, 4763. 

7. Speaking to all the congregation of the children of Israel saying, denotes perception with the 

external man, 2951, 1822, 7843, ver. 1; and the land passed through and spied out being an 
exceedingly good land, denotes that the heavenly life, notwithstanding appearances, is the 
only genuine life, 3705, 3992, 27145, 60. 

8.

"If the Lord delight in us," denotes the delight of good received from the. Lord, because it is 
man who changes and not the Lord, 2001, 997; bringing us into the land and giving it to us, 
denotes confidence of receiving the life of good and truth in externals, 3705, $899; and a land 

194

which flows with milk and honey, denotes the experience of the conjunction of good and truth 
and natural delight there, 56209. 

9. By not rebelling against the Lord, is denoted the submission, in this case, of the natural man, 
1668; not fearing the people of the land, denotes not fearing that evil will prevail, 390, 391, 
chap 13:28, 29; their being bread for the spiritual man, denotes that by temptation, he becomes
receptive of spiritual good, 276, 8682; their defence, or shadow, removed from over them, 
denotes that in evil there is no power, 87648; the Lord being with the spiritual man, denotes 
when resisted from a principle of good, 2001; and not fearing them, denotes that a state of 
good destroys fear, 4180. 

10. By the congregation bidding stone them with stones, is denoted that the merely natural man 
regards all these truths as falsities, 7843, 5156; by the glory of the Lord appearing in the tent 
of meeting, is denoted that, by the spiritual man, they are seen in the light of Divine Truth 
made manifest through all the heavens, 8427, 35403; and by the glory appearing to all the 
children of Israel, is denoted during a state of worship in the Spiritual Church, 3654. 

11. The Lord saying to Moses, denotes revelation from the Lord by Divine Truth, 2001, 7010; 

"How long will this people despise Me?" denotes that those who are merely natural will perish
in their hatred of good, 1259, 59, 2001; "how long will they not believe in Me?" denotes that 
they will not have faith in Divine Truth, 36; and "for all the signs that I have worked among 
them," denotes, notwithstanding they may be compelled to obedience by miracles outwardly, 
7273, 7290. 

12. Smiting them with the pestilence, denotes that such persons must perish through the 

destruction of remains, 10219; disinheriting them, denotes that they will no longer abide in 
merely external worship, because the Israelites were not in any internal worship; and although 
the wicked whom they represented when, as in this case, they were disobedient, may be, in 
merely external worship in this life, yet, in the other life, they will cease to be so, 1799, 1802; 
and making of Moses a nation greater and mightier than they, denotes that those who are truly 
internal men by resistance to evil and victory over it, shall enjoy the realization of good from 
the Lord, and of truth thence even in their natural man, 7010, 1259, 7043, 2227, 6343. 

13. By Moses saying, "then the Egyptians shall hear of it," is denoted that, in a state of temptation,
the Spiritual also fear the uprisings of the merely natural man, 7010, 1822, 6661; and by the 
Lord bringing up the people from among them, is denoted the remembrance of His work of 
redemption, 8866; while by "in your might," is denoted the exercise of omnipotence in that 
work, 6343. 

14. Telling it to the inhabitants of this land, denotes a dread of the incursions of falsity from the 
evil of the merely natural man, even in their state of prevailing good, 6661, 7291, 3066; the 
Egyptians hearing that the Lord is in the midst of this people, denotes that even their natural 
powers are under the influence of that good, 6661, 2641, 2001, 200, 1259; the Lord being seen
face to face, or eye to eye, denotes to be in truths interiorly, 9306, 2148; the cloud standing 
over them denotes the Lord's presence with man in the literal sense of the Word, or exteriorly, 
8106; and the Lord going before them in a pillar of cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night, 
denotes that from the Word man has truths accommodated to his states of brightness and to his
states of obscurity, 8106, 8108. 

195

15. "If you shall kill this people as one man, then the nations which have heard the fame of you 

will speak, saying," denotes that when, in temptation, men fear to be deprived of the heavenly 
life, and notwithstanding they have been in truths, they may be overwhelmed by the 
insinuation from their enemies, 7043, 10288, 2853, 48232, 9248, 2951, 1822. Observe here, 
that in the reference, 9248, the "fame," or "report" denotes what is false, while in this verse it 
denotes truths, according to the series; and that "speaking and saying," imply evil insinuations,
as the following verse shows.

16. "Because the Lord was not able to bring this people into the land which He swore to them, 

therefore He has slain them in the wilderness," denotes that because the realization of the 
heavenly life is an impossibility, therefore they must of necessity be given up to evil and its 
falsities, which is spiritual death, 2001, 8626, 3705, 2842, 7043, 10288, 27082. 

17. "And now, I pray you, let the power of the Lord be great, according as you have spoken, 

saying," denotes that hence, those who are tempted, are earnest in their prayers to the Lord, 
and in their application to the Word, from which they have the perception, because Moses, in 
this case denotes those who are tempted, 7010, ver. 12; "I pray you," denotes earnest prayer, 
2535; the power of the Lord being great, denotes the revelation of Divine Truth from Divine 
Good, thus revelation by application to the Word, 6343, 2227; and speaking and saying 
denotes influx and perception, 2951, 1822. 

18. The Lord being slow to anger, and plentiful in mercy, denotes that He is, in reality, pure love, 
and abundant in mercy, 6997; forgiving iniquity and transgression, denotes that He will 
remove evil internally and externally, 868, 9156; by no means clearing the guilty, denotes the 
removal of evil only in the case of those who repent, 9075, 3400; and visiting the iniquities of 
the fathers upon the children upon the third and upon the fourth generation, denotes that only 
those who deliberately choose evil will remain in it, because evil which is increased and 
confirmed by falsity in a long series, is conjoined with that falsity, and becomes permanent, 
8876, 8877, 8878. 

19. "Pardon, I pray you, the iniquity of this people according to the greatness of your mercy, and 

according as you have forgiven this people from Egypt even until now," denotes that therefore 
the Spiritual know that their earnest desire for the removal of their evils, 7010, ver. 12, 2535, 
will be complied with according to the mercy of the Lord, 6997, even as is the case in every 
temptation in which man conquers by the power of the Lord, 868, 3400, 6661. 

20. By the Lord saying, "I have pardoned according to your word," is denoted that therefore also 
they receive the assurance in themselves of complete deliverance according to Divine Truth, 
2001, 1822, S68, 3400, 7010. 

21. "But in very deed, as I live, and as all the earth shall be filled with the glory of the Lord," 

denotes that, nevertheless, as surely as the Lord is Life Itself; as surely as He made His Human
Divine; and as surely as He regenerates man internally and externally, 1735. 1733, 984. 5922. 
8427-

22. By all those men are clearly denoted the wicked generally, ver. 10; by seeing the Lord's glory 
and His signs which He worked in Egypt and in the wilderness, is denoted instruction in 
Divine Good and Divine Truth internally and externally, 2150, 8427, 7273, 7290, 5013, 2708; 
by their tempting the Lord these ten times, is denoted having the opportunity of being 

196

regenerated through temptations and remains in all fullness, 8682, 576, 8468; and by their not 
hearken-iming to the Lord's voice, is denoted persistence in their own life of disobedience, 
2542. 

23. Their certainly not seeing the land which the Lord swore to their fathers, nor any of them that 

despised Him seeing it, denotes that they cannot enter into the heavenly state, which is from 
the Lord by irrevocable confirmation with the good; nor especially can they do so who have 
confirmed evil by falsity, 7738, 3705, 2001, 2842, 37033, 9257. 

24. By "my servant" is denoted he who acknowledges himself to be the servant of the Lord, 5161; 
by Caleb is denoted one receptive of the heavenly life, chap 13:6; by another spirit being in 
him, is denoted the life of love and charity internally, 5307; by his following the Lord fully, is 
denoted that he truly embodies that life in his actions, 9251; by bringing him into the land 
whereinto he went, is denoted that he finally realizes that life in fullness, 3705; and by his seed
possessing it, is denoted that, with him, good and truth will abundantly increase, 1940, 1941, 
2658. 

25. The Amalekite and the Canaanite dwelling in the valley, denotes that, in the meantime, evils 
and falsities internal and external, will occupy the natural man, chap 13:29, 1723; and to-
morrow turning and going into the wilderness by the way of the Red Sea, denotes that 
therefore changes of state follow continually, and that other temptations are impending 
through influx from the hells in a state of obscurity, 3998, 6226, 1457, 2708, 4867, 8099. 

26. This is evident, because by Jehovah is denoted the Divine Being as to His love, 2001; by 

speaking is denoted influx, 2951; by Moses is represented Divine Truth, or the Word, 7010; by
Aaron, in subordination to Moses, is represented doctrine, 7089; and by saying is denoted 
perception, 1822. 

27. By "How long shall I bear with this evil congregation," or rather assembly, "which murmur 
against me?" is denoted that temptations must needs continue with the man of the Spiritual 
Church, who is not yet wholly confirmed in good, 2001, 9937, 7843, 8351; and by "I have 
heard the murmurings of the children of Israel which they murmur against me," is denoted that
as long as evil is active, and at the same time there is perception of Divine Truths, 8351, 2691, 
2692. 

28. "Say to them," denotes perception, 1822; "as I live, says the Lord," denotes since the Lord is 
Life Itself, 1735, 2001; and "surely as you have spoken in mine ears, so will I do to you," 
denotes that the communication of that life to man, is altogether according to the state of the 
man, 42924, 3869, 2618. 

29. By "your carcases shall fall in this wilderness," is denoted that the wicked, who are in external 
worship and yet without spiritual life, are vastated of all spiritual truth, and are thus in spiritual
darkness, ver. 10, 7843, 5156, 390010, 7102, 60009, on Ps 91:5, 6, 27082; by "all that were 
numbered of you, according to your whole number," is denoted notwithstanding that, 
outwardly, they formed a portion of the Spiritual Church, chap 2:32; and by "from twenty 
years old and upward which have murmured against me," is denoted that they were then in 
intelligence as to truths, some perception of charity, and endured temptations, 2280, 10225, 
1664, chap 1:3,

197

30. By "surely you shall not come into the land concerning which I lifted up my hand that I would 
make you dwell therein," is denoted that neither can they enjoy the life of heaven, which the 
Lord from His Divine Omnipotence is both willing and able to impart to man, 1853, 3705, 
5327, 7545, 4480; and by "save Caleb the son of Jephunneh, and Joshua the son of Nun," is 
denoted that they who are in good from Divine Truths, and in truths derived from good, alone 
do this, ver. 6. 

31. "Your little ones," denotes those who are in innocence and yet in apparent danger through 
ignorance, 47972; "which you said should be a prey," denotes, not only danger through 
ignorance, but also from hereditary defilements, 5763, 8876; "them will I bring in," denotes 
that they are capable of receiving good, and do receive it from the Lord, 2001, 9500, 3705; 
"and they shall know the. land," denotes that they can be instructed in good and truth, 2230, 
3705; and "which you have rejected," denotes which the wicked reject and despise, 9257. 

32. "As for you, your carcases shall fall in this wilderness," denotes that therefore the wicked must
necessarily perish through vastation as to good and truth, and through the adoption of the evil 
and falsity which they have confirmed in themselves, ver. 29. 

33. "And your children shall be wanderers," or shepherds, "in the wilderness forty years," denotes 
that those who are capable of regeneration by the reception of innocence, are instructed in 
their obscurity, and endure a full course of spiritual temptations, 47972, 6044, 2708, 730; "and 
shall bear your whoredoms until your carcases be consumed in the wilderness," denotes that 
they shall be subject to the fluctuations caused by the falsification of truth through evil until 
they themselves are vastated of all evil and falsity, 9937, 6348, ver. 29. 

34. "After the number of the days in which you spied out the land, even forty days," denotes that 

the tendencies to evil from hell with man, are equally balanced by tendencies to good with him
from the Lord, because by numbering is denoted quality as to evil or good, 10217, and forty 
days denotes a full course of temptation, in which man forms his character for good or for evil 
in freedom, 7304, 19375, Deut 8:2, 3, 16; "for every day a year," denotes that all general states 
involve those which are particular, 487, 488; and "shall you bear your iniquities, even forty 
years, and you shall know my alienation," or the "revoking of my promise," denotes the 
necessity that every one should endure temptations, and should freely choose his own eternal 
life, because by bearing iniquities, is denoted the removal of evil, by man, as from himself, but
in reality from the Lord, 9937; by forty years is denoted during a full course of temptation, 
7304, 1937, Deut 8:2, 3, 16; and by knowing the Lord's alienation, or "the revoking of His 
promise," or His "aversion," is denoted the knowledge that evil is opposed to good from the 
Lord, and thus that man is bound to make his choice between evil on the one hand and good 
on the other, 39941, 5798. 

35. By "I the Lord have spoken," is denoted the unchangeable character of Divine Good and 

Divine Truth, 2001, 7304, 10602; by "surely this will I do to all this evil congregation," or 
rather assembly, "that are gathered together against me," is denoted that evil is the opposite of 
good, and falsity the opposite of truth, 10602, 7843, 679, 6112; and by "in this wilderness they
shall be consumed, and there they shall die," is denoted that the wicked are consumed by their 
own falsities, and are overwhelmed by their own evils, 2708, 10431, 2908. 

198

36. The men whom Moses sent out to spy the land, denote those who have the opportunity of 

choosing good and truth, chap 13:2; and their returning and making all the congregation, or 
rather assembly, murmur against him by bringing up an evil report against the land, denote 
those who turn away from good and truth and intensify the state of temptation with the man of 
the church because they are unwilling to engage in the conflict with evil, 2454, 7843, 8351, 
7010, 4674, 3705. 

37. By those men dying by the plague before the Lord, is denoted that they could confirm their 
evil by falsity, destroy in themselves all remains, and thus render their salvation impossible, 
10219. 

38. By Joshua the son of Nun and Caleb the son of Jephunneh remaining alive of those men who 
went to spy out the land, is denoted that those who are in truth derived from good, and in good
derived from truth, and who do not confirm their evils by falsities, are in the enjoyment of the 
life of good, because they have confirmed that life by truths, ver. 6, 6119, ver. 2. 

39. Moses telling the Lord's words to all the children of Israel, and the people mourning greatly, 
denotes that also Divine Truth is revealed to the man of the church when corrupted; and the 
first effect thereof is mourning on account of their sin and weakness, 3209, 3654, 2910. 

40. Rising up early in the morning denotes a state of illustration, 2540; getting up to the top of the 
mountain, denotes, in this case, the excitement of selfish fear, 1691; and by their saying, "Lo, 
we be here, we will go up to the place which the Lord has promised: for we have sinned," is 
denoted that there is willingness to be obedient and outwardly, at least, to adopt the heavenly 
life, and forsake their sin, 3335, 3705, 2001, 5076. 

41. Moses saying, "Wherefore do you transgress the commandment of the Lord, seeing it shall not

prosper?" denotes that Divine Truth perceives the state of externalism, and therefore of 
disobedience, and affirms that man cannot overcome evil by and from himself, 7010, 1822, 
3400, 9156, 8560, 2150, 4972. 

42. "Go not up, for the Lord is not among you; that you be not smitten down before your 

enemies," denotes that outward resistance to evil only, does not give conjunction with the 
Lord; nor can it overcome the evils of the selfish life, 1543, 2001, 200, 10510, 2851. 

43. "For there the Amalekite and the Canaanite are before you," denotes that with such persons 
interior and exterior evils prevail, 8593, 1063; "you shall fall by the sword," denotes that 
falsities from those evils are destructive of spiritual life, 2799"; "because you are turned back 
from following the Lord," denotes that they avert themselves from the Supreme Life, 2454, 
2001; and "therefore the Lord is not with you," denotes that therefore they cannot receive it, 
2001. 

44. Their presuming to go up to the top of the mountain, denotes that the man in this external state
is presumptuous, and elevates himself as if secure of victory, 1543, 1691; and the ark of the 
covenant of the Lord, nevertheless, not departing out of the camp, denotes that such persons 
have no interior conjunction with the Lord, and with Divine Truth; nor are they prepared for a 
real conflict, 93961, 93965, 7010, 4236. 

45.The Amalekite coming down and the Canaanite from the mountain, and smiting them, and 
beating them down even to Hormah, denotes that evils interior and exterior break forth from 

199

within them; and that evil, then, both as to the will and the understanding, impels them to their
ultimate destruction, 8593, 1063, 1691, 10510, 9081, 8165. The last reference is intended to 
illustrate the signification of Hormah, which means destruction, or utter devastation, and 
therefore denotes this.

DISCUSSION

It is evident from this whole chapter that many particulars concerning temptations, are contained in its 
internal sense, and that it will be profitable to consider them. First, therefore, be it observed that 
spiritual temptation is a conflict in the mind of the man of the church between opposing principles of 
evil and good, the former being represented by the Israelites who murmured, and the latter by Caleb 
and Joshua. And it must be remembered here, that it is the tempted man himself who must decide, from
the state of reason and liberty in the exercise of which the Lord preserves him. And yet this does not 
appear to him who is enduring the temptation, because he is in that condition, which is represented 
appropriately by night. And when it is said that the whole of the people cried and wept in that night, it 
is to be understood, again, that the tempted man himself, who is required to decide, experiences that 
state of temporary darkness and distress. And not only so; but it is, thirdly, the man himself who for the 
time being, opposes the Divine Truth and Divine Good represented by, Moses and Aaron.

For if is a fact that when we are tempted, we appear to ourselves to be the very evil by which we are 
tempted, and to desire in our despair, the extinction of our lives from the lack of natural delights, and 
from scarcity as to truths, which are respectively signified by Egypt, and the wilderness. But, of course,
nobody's life can ever be extinguished, the wicked indeed only desiring the cessation in themselves of 
the heavenly life, and the good in their extremity only fearing lest they should lose it.

And then look at the next experience, which is an intensification of the state of despair. For with regard 
to the wicked who will fail, they look upon the Lord as their enemy, who will destroy them, when yet 
their own falsities take away their true spiritual life, and their own evil affections matured and 
incipient, deprive them of the love of what is good, and of all innocence; while on the other hand, the 
good fear greatly the loss of their truths by apparently prevailing falsities, and the loss also of their 
cherished heavenly affections. And now, therefore, the state of despair culminates with the good, and 
they have a strong impulse to give themselves up to what is merely natural by which they are tempted; 
and the wicked actually do this by confirming themselves in their evils through falsities.

But now follows another aspect of the temptation, and upon this we may briefly reflect. The good do 
not resist evil from themselves, aS the wicked oppose good; on the contrary, they come into a state of 
profound humiliation, inmostly acknowledging that, of themselves, they are nothing but evil, while, in 
a lower degree, they mourn for the apparent loss of good and truth as described in the correspondential 
language of vers. 5-6. And now, therefore, as a consequence of this, they have consolation and hope, 
and confidence from the Lord that the heavenly state, after which they are striving, is exceedingly 
desirable, that internally it is one of felicity, and that externally it is filled with natural delights, which 
are so often in the Word called milk and honey; and they no longer fear, but are certain, from their love 
of good, that they shall realize it, that their temptations are a means, and that in evil there is no power. 
But, lastly, how different is the result of a state of trial with the evil and with the good; for the former 
reject good, and therefore regard the truth as falsity, while the latter are greatly enlightened by it, not 
only internally but also externally.

200

And, then, who cannot see in preparing to study the second section, how wonderfully revelation was 
adapted to the state of the Israelites, although it was so framed that at the same time it might contain the
internal sense, which should afterwards be revealed? For here we find that even the Lord Himself is 
described as acting like a mere man, who is subject to fits of anger, and who is capable of being 
diverted from his desire to destroy, or remove those who oppose him by selfish considerations and 
fears. But we know that the Lord does not so act; and therefore we may the more easily discern that the 
literal sense of the Word contains accommodated truths, or appearances, which are only the coverings 
for those which are genuine, and that for these we ought to look. Let us, then, do this, and be thereby 
spiritually instructed.

The merely natural man all over the world, here represented by the Israelites in their state of opposition
to the Lord, despises what is really good, and will not believe what is really true, and miracles 
performed before him would not convince him. He even destroys in himself those remains of such 
good and truth which, from his childhood, have been communicated to him, from the Divine Spirit; and
instead of becoming an inheritor of the kingdom of heaven, he turns away from it; while, the spiritual-
natural man, here signified by Moses, becomes truly receptive of the Divine life. But, in a state of 
temptation, even this man is in fear, lest his merely natural loves should triumph, and yet he is consoled
by the thought that he is a free man because the Lord has redeemed him. But still his temptation 
continues, and he dreads, not only his own perverted external natural feelings, but also the various 
interior falsities, and the pride of selfish love, which are denoted by the inhabitants of the land to be 
conquered, and especially by the sons of Anak, and he dreads that spiritual death in the wilderness, 
from which none but the Lord can save him. Now is not this a true picture? But consider the next, 
which extends to ver. 20 inclusive. The Lord is love itself and mercy itself, and is always ready to 
forgive; but pardon for sin is not unconditional, as it is here so powerfully shown; and, moreover, it 
depends in every case upon the state of the man; and hence we read elsewhere, "If you be willing and 
obedient, you shall eat the good of the land; but if you refuse and rebel, you shall be devoured with the 
sword; for the mouth of the Lord has spoken it" (Isaiah 1:19-20). We need not wonder, therefore, at 
what is said in the remainder of this section. But here we would call particular attention to the 
statement of ver. 22, which declares that the Israelites had tempted the Lord ten times, and means, 
spiritually, "having the opportunity of being regenerated through temptations and remains in all 
fullness." That is to say, no one is ever condemned to the infernal life, without having had the 
opportunity of choosing the heavenly life. Of course, it is clear that the Lord is not tempted by any one,
as the literal sense states; and neither does He tempt any one, although it is said that He did tempt 
Abraham; for it is impossible that the unchangeable, the pure, and the holy Lord can thus be affected or
thus act. But man is tempted through the evils that appertain to him, and which he has indulged; and 
even in this way there is no spiritual temptation, through the incitement to do evil only, but there must 
be principles of goodness and truth with man as well from the Lord, and these are called remains, and 
are signified by the number ten, the same number also signifying what is full, or complete. For remains 
are stored up with man by the Lord, throughout his whole life; nor is any man ever led or permitted by 
the Lord to enter into temptations, who has not been supplied with truths adequate to the conflict. And, 
indeed, it may easily be seen, by those who reflect, that an impulse to do evil from some selfish 
passion, and a resistance to that impulse from some other selfish motive, is not a conflict between good 
and evil, or between truth and falsity in which spiritual temptation really consists. And hence now we 
may see how very much spiritual instruction is involved in the statement that the Israelites had tempted 
the Lord ten times. And thus we might comment on every sentence in the section, had we space. But let
us add only a few words. We are taught to pray: "Lead us not into temptation," first, because no one 
should desire to have his evils excited; secondly, because the Lord leads man continually, and 

201

especially during temptations; and, thirdly, because the Lord by means of temptations delivers us from 
evil.

As the next section describes the experiences of the wicked and their vastation, and the final 
deliverance of the good; as vastation is a term applied both to the wicked and the good; and as the 
subject is not clearly understood in some respects, the following remarks upon it are first given as a 
general illustration of the contents of the section. To vastate, or devastate, is to lay waste, and therefore 
specifically it signifies to deprive the wicked during the process of their judgement of the truths they 
have acquired in their earthly life, and which might have been the means of their salvation, had they 
been properly used by choosing the heavenly life in preference to the selfish life, which constitutes the 
ruling love of the infernals. But it may be thought that, surely, the Lord does not deprive any one of 
truths, since it must be a good thing to retain them. The Lord, however, does not thus vastate evil 
spirits; it is their own evils which reject truths, because evils and truths cannot agree together. It 
therefore follows, that to the wicked in the other life are given the falsities which agree with their evils, 
while to the good are given the truths which agree with their good, according to the Lord's words in 
speaking of the Judgement, where it is written, "For to every one that has shall be given, and he shall 
have abundance: but from him that has not, even that which he has shall be taken away" (Matt 25:29). 
That is, to him who has goodness shall truths in agreement therewith be given, while from him that has 
not goodness, shall the truths be taken away which he has. This taking away of truths, therefore, from 
the evils, or their rejection by the evil, is vastation in the proper sense; but at the same time the term is 
also applied to the good in order to describe the removal from them, in the process of their judgement, 
of the falsities and other imperfections that they have contracted, and which do not agree with their 
ruling love, or essential heavenly delight. And it may be here remarked, that much suffering is 
sometimes endured by the good in this vastation, and that this suffering is called punishment, even us is
the suffering of the infernals themselves, which naturally follows as the consequence of indulgence in 
their evils. But, nevertheless, all punishments, whether they occur for the purification of the good, or 
for the restraining of the wicked, are beneficial (AC 696).

And from what has now been said, it may be clearly seen, generally, that the punishment denounced 
upon the children of Israel, and upon the ten spies who encouraged them in their opposition to Caleb 
and Joshua, denotes the vastation of the wicked, and hence that the particulars recorded relate to that 
vastation. And thus it is evident that, by their carcases falling in the wilderness, is signified, that the 
wicked are deprived of all true spiritual life; that by their not coming into the promised land is 
spiritually meant, that the wicked cannot enter into the heavenly life; that by Caleb and Joshua and the 
children of that generation entering, is denoted that the good do come into heaven; that by their 
wandering in the wilderness forty years, is denoted the temptations of the good; and that by knowing 
the Lord's alienation is denoted that the wicked will know that evil is opposed to good from the Lord, 
and cannot be reconciled with it. And, further, it may thus be known that, by being consumed and 
dying, is signified that the wicked are consumed by their own falsities, and are overwhelmed by their 
own evils; that by the spies who died by the plague, are represented the wicked who perish by the 
destruction of remains in themselves; and that by Joshua and Caleb alone remaining alive, is denoted 
that those alone who are obedient, and do not confirm their evils by falsities, are in the enjoyment of 
the life of good, which really constitutes the heavenly life.

But the last section is by no means the least important of our chapter. For, in a degenerate age and state 
of the church, nothing is more prevalent than a selfish desire for salvation, which is not attended by a 
knowledge of what salvation is; and which causes men to imagine that merely outward resistance to 
evil is sure of victory over it. But the particulars before us show the contrary. Men are always instructed

202

from the Word concerning Divine things; and in its literal sense are plainly set forth the consequences 
of an evil life, just as it is said that Moses told all the people the words of the Lord. And the merely 
natural man, who outwardly acknowledges the Word is frequently alarmed at its threatenings against 
the wicked, so that a state of fear and of mourning for sin is produced, which is well represented by the 
mourning of the Israelites on this occasion. But let us note carefully, how Divine Truth clearly discerns 
the real condition of a man internally, and warns him against seeking salvation from the fear of 
punishment only. "Go not up," it says, "for the Lord is not among you." How true, then, is this picture 
to human experience! And also, in spite of being warned, how many are there who presume to "go up 
into the mountain," that is, to put on the appearance of being in genuine love, not aware that inward 
evils beset them; that external worship without internal is of no use; and that if their inmost love is not 
in harmony with the life of the celestial angels, or with that Divine Law, which they so clearly perceive,
represented here by the ark, there is no real victory for them! No wonder, therefore, that such persons 
do not overcome their spiritual enemies; that they are driven back in their vain attempt; and that, at 
length, they are indeed entirely devastated. Above all things, therefore, let the man of the church be 
genuine; let him know that real truth alone is competent to overcome evil; and that real goodness from 
the Lord is that alone which entitles him to enjoy the hidden manna, and the white stone, and the new 
name, which no man knows but he that receives it (Rev 2:17). For these are the love of good, the pure 
truth, and the new quality of the fully regenerated external man.

203

Numbers Chapter 15

SUMMARY OF THE SPIRITUAL SENSE

1. Concerning the worship of the Lord outwardly in various states of heaven and the church, 

namely, that it increases in fullness and intensity according to the degree in which the good of 
innocence increases, beginning in the inmost, descending also to the interior, and finally 
occupying the external man, and thus every degree of man's life, vers. 1-16. 

2. Concerning the appropriation of good, when it is confirmed and established in the heavenly 

state, that then it is fully vivified from the Lord both by acknowledgement and perception, 
vers. 17-21. 

3. Concerning errors through ignorance or inadvertence, and amendment in consequence, 

through the worship of the Lord by consecration to Him, and for the removal of the evil in 
order that the external man may be fully harmonized with the internal, and the whole man with
the Lord, vers. 22-31. 

4. Concerning the claiming of merit, even when man is in a prevailing state of good and truth 

conjoined, and the method of its removal and rejection, vers. 32-36. 

5. And concerning the study of the Word in its literal sense in order that its particulars may be 
known, imbibed and practised; and in order that all merely selfish love and intelligence by 
which its truths are continually falsified may be removed, vers. 37-41. 

THE CONTENTS OF EACH VERSE

1. And the LORD spoke to Moses, 

1. There is revelation from the Lord by Divine Truth 

saying, 

giving the perception, 

2. Speak to the children of Israel, and 

say to them, When you be come into 
the land of your habitations, which I 
give to you, 

2. To the man of the church by influx internally and 
by thought externally, that when he is confirmed in
the life which constitutes the Lord's kingdom in 
heaven and on earth; 

3. And will make an offering by fire to 
the LORD, a burnt offering, or a 
sacrifice, to accomplish a vow, or as 
a freewill offering, or in your set 
feasts, to make a sweet savour to the 
LORD, of the herd, or of the flock: 

3. And when he worships the Lord outwardly from 

love either celestial or spiritual; either as to the 
external man from a principle of truth, or from a 
principle of good freely; or from good 
appropriated by the reciprocation of the Lord's 
love with delight either natural or spiritual, 

204

4. Then shall he that offers his oblation 
offer to the LORD a meal offering of 
a tenth part of an ephah of fine flour 
mingled with the fourth part of an 
hin of oil: 

4. Then he must worship the Lord also internally, 

from what is sufficient according to spiritual good 
and celestial good in conjunction; 

5. And wine for the drink offering, the 
fourth part of an hin, shall you 
prepare with the burnt offering or for
the sacrifice, for each lamb. 

5. And also as to spiritual truth conjoined with good, 
if his external worship, either celestial or spiritual, 
shall be from the good of innocence in the inmost 
degree of his life only. 

6. Or for a ram, you shall prepare for a 

meal offering two tenth parts of an 
ephah of fine flour mingled with the 
third part of an hin of oil: 

6. But if it shall also be from the good of innocence 
in the middle degree, then his internal worship 
from spiritual or celestial good is in greater 
proportion as to conjunction and fullness; 

7. And for the drink offering you shall 
offer the third part of an hin of wine, 
of a sweet savour to the LORD. 

7. And so also his worship, from spiritual truth 
conjoined with good is in the same increased 
proportion. 

8. And when you prepare a bullock for 
a burnt offering, or for a sacrifice, to 
accomplish a vow, or for peace 
offerings to the LORD: 

8. And lastly if it shall be from the good of innocence

in the ultimate degree also as to external worship 
from celestial or spiritual good, from truth, or from
good freely, 

9. Then shall he offer with the bullock 
a meal offering of three tenth parts 
of an ephah of fine flour mingled 
with half an hin of oil. 

10. And you shall offer for the drink 

offering half an hin of wine, for an 
offering made by fire, of a sweet 
savour to the LORD. 

11. Thus shall it be done for each 

bullock, or for each ram, or for each 
of the he-lambs, or of the kids. 

9. Then his internal worship from spiritual and 

celestial good is in the greatest proportion, 

10. And so also in his internal worship from spiritual 
truth conjoined with good; and then his worship is 
altogether from the love of good, and from the 
delightful perception of truth well pleasing to the 
Lord. 

11. And this is true with regard to every individual 
who is regenerated, and to every faculty of each 
individual fullness of worship being universally in 
proportion to the reception of the good of 
innocence in the ultimate, the middle and the 
inmost degree of the mind with the angels of the 
celestial and spiritual kingdoms respectively. 

205

12. According to the number that you 
shall prepare, so shall you do to 
every one according to their number.

12. For indeed, the quality of the whole heaven in 
respect to the worship of the Lord and the 
reception of celestial and spiritual good, is to be 
measured by the quality of each individual as to 
the good of innocence. 

13. All that are homeborn shall do these 
things after this manner, in offering 
an offering made by fire, of a sweet 
savour to the LORD. 

13. And this is the law concerning the reception of the 
good of innocence into the, external affections 
capable of conjunction with the interior and 
internal man when worship is performed from love
grateful and well pleasing to the Lord. 

14. And if a stranger sojourn with you, 

14. And so also for those who are in a state of 

or whoever be among you 
throughout your generations, and 
will offer an offering made by fire, 
of a sweet savour to the LORD; as 
you do, so he shall do. 

instruction in every state of the church; the Lord is
worshiped from love, and such worship is grateful 
and well pleasing on that account. 

15. For the assembly, there shall be one 
statute for you, and for the stranger 
that sojourns with you, a statute for 
ever throughout your generations: as 
you are, so shall the stranger be 
before the LORD. 

15. And indeed, the law is the same both for those 
who are established in spiritual truths, and for 
those in a state of instruction in every period of the
church. For the Lord regards with equal care both 
the man of the internal church and the man of the 
external. 

16. One law and one ordinance shall be 
for you, and for the stranger that 
sojourneth with you. 

16. And consequently also the natural man, as well as 
the celestial and the spiritual, receives the good of 
innocence through the same process. 

17. And the LORD spoke to Moses, 

17. Further also there is revelation from the Lord by 

saying, 

Divine Truth giving the perception, 

18. Speak to the children of Israel, and 

say to them, When you come into the
land whither I bring you, 

18. By influx internally and by thought externally with
the man of the Spiritual Church, that when he is 
confirmed in the principle of good which makes 
heaven and the church, from the Lord, 

19. Then it shall be, that, when you eat 

of the bread of the land, you shall 
offer up an heave offering to the 
LORD. 

19. And appropriates that good, it shall be vivified by 
acknowledgement and perception that it is from 
Him. 

206

20. Of the first of your dough you shall 
offer up a cake for an heave offering:
as you do the heave offering of the 
threshing-floor, so shall you heave it.

20. Also all truth derived from good shall be 

acknowledged to be from the Lord, when that truth
is conjoined with its good and is vivified; for as 
the good of truth must be seen to be from the Lord 
before regeneration, so also must the truth of good 
after regeneration. 

21. Of the first of your dough you shall 
give to the LORD an heave offering 
throughout your generations. 

21. And this acknowledgement that the power of the 
perception of truth from good is from the Lord 
must continue and be perpetual both during 
regeneration and after it. 

22. And when you shall err, and not 

observe all these commandments, 
which the LORD has spoken to 
Moses, 

22. Moreover, in the case in which every man wanders
from truth and goodness which are received from 
the Lord by the Word, although he is regenerated; 

23. Even all that the LORD has 

23. Even as to all the truth and good received from the

commanded you by the hand of 
Moses, from the day that the LORD 
gave commandment, and onward 
throughout your generations; 

24. Then it shall be, if it be done 

unwittingly, without the knowledge 
of the congregation, that all the 
congregation shall offer one young 
bullock for a burnt offering, for a 
sweet savour to the LORD, with the 
meal offering thereof, and (be drink 
offering thereof, according to the 
ordinance, and one he-goat for a sin 
offering. 

Word, and by influx during the course of 
regeneration; 

24. Then it shall be, if such error arise from ignorance 
or inadvertence, or both as to the understanding 
and the will, and thus as to all the powers of the 
mind, then acknowledgement shall be made to the 
Lord that this error sprang from the innocence of 
ignorance in the natural man, which is now newly 
sanctified to the Lord, such acknowledgement also
being internally from spiritual good and truth 
according to order, and being also accompanied by
the confession of sin and its removal by means of 
the truth of faith involving some charity from the 
Lord. 

25. And the priest shall make atonement 
for all the congregation of the 
children of Israel, and they shall be 
forgiven; for it was an error, and they
have brought their oblation, an 
offering made by fire to the LORD, 
and their sin offering before the 
LORD, for their error: 

25. And in this way shall reconciliation between the 
internal and external man be effected by good 
from the Lord as to the whole of man's powers, 
and full remission shall follow, because it was 
through inadvertence, and acknowledgement has 
been made from natural good conjoined with that 
which is spiritual and celestial and confession and 
remission have followed. 

207

26. And all the congregation of the 

children of Israel shall be forgiven, 
and the stranger that sojourns among
them; for in respect of all the people 
it was done unwittingly. 

26. And such remission shall not only be extended to 
all the powers of the mind or to the whole church 
where a number of persons is concerned, but also 
to such faculties or such persons as are being 
instructed; for in respect to the whole man, or to 
the whole church it was a sin of ignorance. 

27. And if one person sin unwittingly, 
then he shall offer a she-goat of the 
first year for a sin offering. 

27. And if such error takes place with regard to one 

faculty only, or if it arises from the understanding 
without the consent of the will, then 
acknowledgement and confession shall be made 
from the interior good of faith in all fullness, and 
remission from the Lord shall follow. 

28. And the priest shall make atonement 
for the soul that erreth, when he sins 
unwittingly, before the LORD, to 
make atonement for him; and he 
shall be forgiven. 

28. For good from the Lord shall reconcile the 

external to the internal man, where error takes 
place inadvertently, where the Lord is inwardly 
acknowledged; and such reconciliation shall be 
effected through the remission of evil by Him. 

29. You shall have one law for him that 
does aught unwittingly, for him that 
is homeborn among the children of 
Israel, and for the stranger that 
sojourns among them. 

30. But the soul that does aught with an 
high hand, whether he be home-born
or a stranger, the same blasphemes 
the LORD; and that soul shall be cut 
off from among his people. 

29. And this law concerning a sin of ignorance shall 

apply equally to one who is confirmed in the good 
and truth of the church, and to one who is in a state
of instruction. 

30. But wilful sin from the pride of selfish love, 

whether by him whose ruling love is good 
notwithstanding, or who is in a state of truth 
leading to good, is the profanation of good and 
truth from the Lord, and is productive of spiritual 
death, or of separation from the Lord until 
repentance takes place; 

31. Because he has despised the word of 

31. Because such sin is a sin against Divine Truth, or 

the LORD, and has broken his 
commandment; that soul shall utterly
be cut off, his iniquity shall be upon 
him. 

the Word, perverts influx, and destroys 
correspondence, thus making the removal of evil 
impossible, or possible only through sincere 
repentance. 

208

32. And while the children of Israel were
in the wilderness, they found a man 
gathering sticks upon the Sabbath 
day. 

32. But it happens to the man of the church during 

regeneration, when he is disposed to claim merit 
for his good deeds—even though he is in a 
prevailing state of good conjoined to truth—and 
also actually does so; 

33. And they that found him gathering 
sticks brought him to Moses and 
Aaron, and to all the congregation. 

33. That the truths of the Word condemn such persons,

and this not only because such a state is contrary 
to the leading principles of truth and good in the 
church, but also to the general perception of truth 
with which man is endowed. 

34. And they put him in ward, because it

had not been declared what should 
be done to him. 

34. And consequently there is a state of restraint and 
uncertainty, until the particular truths concerning 
the evil of claiming merit are revealed and 
considered. 

35. And the LORD said to Moses, The 

man shall surely be put to death: all 
the congregation shall stone him 
with stones without the camp. 

35. But revelation is made from the Lord by Divine 
Truth, that such a state is contrary to the genuine 
life of good and truth, and must therefore be 
rejected. 

36. And all the congregation brought 
him without the camp, and stoned 
him with stones, and he died; as the 
LORD commanded Moses. 

36. And therefore it is to be separated from the church 
and from the heavenly life, and must suffer the 
punishment of falsity conjoined with evil causing 
spiritual death; for this is according to Divine 
Truth from Divine Good. 

37. And the LORD spoke to Moses, 

37. And again there is revelation from the Lord by 

saying, 

Divine Truth giving the perception, 

38. Speak to the children of Israel, and 

38. That the man of the church is urged both by an 

bid them that they make them fringes
in the borders of their garments 
throughout their generations, and 
that they put upon the fringe of each 
border a cord of blue: 

appeal to the understanding and the will to study 
the Word of the Lord in its literal sense, as to the 
particulars of truth there, even during the whole 
course of regeneration, and to do so from the love 
of truth conjoined with the love of good. 

209

39. And it shall be to you for a fringe, 
that you may look upon it, and 
remember all the commandments of 
the LORD, and do them; and that you 
go not about after your own heart 
and your own eyes, after which you 
use to go a whoring: 

39. And the reason why the Word of the Lord is thus 
to be studied in its literal sense, is that it may not 
only be understood, but also that it may be 
imbibed and practised as to its particulars, and thus
that the love of good and truth may overcome all 
merely selfish love and intelligence by which the 
truths of the Word are continually falsified. 

40. That you may remember and do all 
my commandments, and be holy to 
your God. 

41. I am the LORD your God, which 

brought you out of the land of Egypt,
to be your God: I am the LORD your 
God. 

40. For the love of good conjoined with the love of 
truth, causes particular truths to be more easily 
remembered, and applied to life, thus producing 
the sanctification of the external man as well as the
internal; 

41. And from the Lord proceed both Divine Good and 
Divine Truth in conjunction, and by Him alone is 
man delivered from the bondage of the merely 
natural life in order that he may first be led by 
truths, and may afterwards realize in himself the 
full conjunction of good and truth. 

REFERENCES AND NOTES

1. This is evident, because by Jehovah is denoted the Divine Being as to His love, 2001; by 

speaking is denoted influx, 2951; by Moses is represented Divine Truth, or the Word, 7010; 
and by saying is denoted perception, 1822. 

2. Speaking to the children of Israel and saying, denotes influx internally, and thought externally, 
with the man of the Spiritual Church, 2951, 3395; and "when you be come into the land of 
your habitations which I give to you," denotes when he is confirmed in the life which 
constitutes the Lord's kingdom in heaven and on earth, 1853, 3705, 10646, 8899. 

3. Making an offering by fire to the Lord denotes the worship of the Lord outwardly from pure 
love, 10055; a burnt offering or sacrifice denotes worship either celestial or spiritual, 923; to 
accomplish a vow, or as a freewill offering, denotes either as to the external man from a 
principle of truth, or from a principle of good freely, 388o5, 10097; and "in your set feasts, to 
make a sweet savour to the Lord of the herd or of the flock," denotes, or from good 
appropriated by the reciprocation of the Lord's love with delight either natural or spiritual, 
2187, 9286, 5913, 6126, 10054. 

4. Offering a meal offering with the burnt offering, denotes worship also internally as well as 

externally, 45814, 10079 end; a tenth part denotes what is sufficient, 10136; fine flour denotes 
spiritual good, 2177, 10136; oil denotes celestial good, 2177, 10136; and a fourth part denotes 
as much as is necessary for conjunction, 10136. 

Considering what is said, respectively, in 2177, 4581, and 10079, concerning the meal 
offering, it will appear that in this verse it may denote either a superior degree of worship or 

210

an inferior degree, and that if it be taken to mean the latter, then the signification will be that 
wherever there is internal worship, there must also be external. And, indeed, whichever 
interpretation we adopt, we may see that the great lesson of the verse, and therefore of the first
sixteen verses of the chapter, is that there should never be internal worship without its 
corresponding external, nor, on the other hand, external worship without its corresponding 
internal. But we have preferred the latter, especially on account of the teaching of 10079, and 
because, according to the series, external worship leads to internal, and is afterwards the 
expression of it.

"Wine for a drink offering the fourth part of an hin." denotes also as to spiritual truth 
conjoined with good, 10137; "prepared with the burnt offering or sacrifice," denotes if his 
external worship, either celestial or spiritual, 923; and "for each lamb" denotes shall be from 
the good of innocence in the inmost degree of his life only, 10137. 

"Or for a ram" denotes if the external worship shall also be from the good of innocence in the 
middle degree, 10137; and "you shall prepare for a meal offering two tenth parts of an ephah 
of fine flour mingled with the third part of an hin of oil," denotes that then his internal worship
from spiritual or celestial good is in greater proportion as to conjunction and fullness, 10137, 
5194, 2788, ver. 4. 

"And for a drink offering you shall offer the third part of an hin of wine of a sweet savour," or 
an odour of rest, "to the Lord," denotes that so also his worship from spiritual truth conjoined 
with good is in the same increased proportion, 10137, 2788, 10054. 

5.

6.

7.

8. Preparing a bullock denotes if worship shall be from the good of innocence in the ultimate 

degree, 10137; for a burnt offering or for a sacrifice, denotes as to celestial or spiritual good, 
923; and to accomplish a vow, or for peace offerings to the Lord, denotes from truth, or from 
good freely, 38805, 10097. 

9. Offering with the bullock three tenth parts of an ephah of fine flour mingled with half an hin 

of oil for a meal offering, denotes that then his internal worship from spiritual and celestial 
good is in the greatest proportion, 10137, 2788, 5291, ver. 4. 

10. Offering, with the meal offering, a drink offering half an hin of wine for an offering made by 

fire of a sweet savour to the Lord, denotes that so also is his internal worship from spiritual 
truth conjoined with good; and that then his worship is altogether from the I0ve of good, and 
from the delightful perception of truth well pleasing to the Lord, 10137, 5291, 10054, 10055. 

11. It being thus done for each bullock, or for each ram, or for each of the he-lambs, or of the kids,
denotes that this is true with respect to- every individual who is regenerated, and to every 
faculty of each individual, fullness of worship being universally in proportion to the reception 
of the good of innocence in the ultimate, the middle, and the inmost degree of the mind, with 
the angels of the celestial and spiritual kingdoms respectively, 10136, 10137, vers. 4-9.

12. "According to the number that you shall prepare, so shall you do to every one according to 

their number," denotes that indeed the quality of the whole heaven in respect to the worship of 
the Lord, and the reception of celestial and spiritual good, is to be measured by the quality of 
each individual as to the good of innocence, 10217, vers. 4-9.

211

13. All that are homeborn doing these things after this manner, in offering an offering made by fire
of a sweet savour, to the Lord, denotes that this is the law concerning the reception of the good
of innocence into the external affections capable of conjunction with the interior and internal 
man, when worship is performed from love, grateful and well pleasing to the Lord, 1708, 
6465, 10137, 10054, 10055. 

14. "And if a stranger sojourn with you, or whoever be among you throughout your generations," 

denotes those who are in a state of instruction in every state of the church, 1463, 1041, 683; 
"and will offer an offering made by fire of a sweet savour to the Lord," denotes the worship of 
the Lord from love, grateful and well pleasing on that account, 10054, 10055; and "as you do 
so shall he do," denotes the same law for those under instruction, as for the man of the internal
or interior of the church, 6465. 

15. There being one statute for the assembly, or rather for the congregation, and for the stranger 
sojourning, denotes that indeed the law is the same for those who are established in spiritual 
truths and for those who are in a state of instruction, 7843, 1463, 7884; a statute for ever 
throughout your generations, denotes in every period of the church, 7884, 1041; and "as you 
are, so shall the stranger be before the Lord," denotes that the Lord regards with equal care 
both the man of the internal church and the man of the external, 7843, 1463. 

16. "One law, and one ordinance being for the Israelites, and for the stranger sojourning," denotes 
that consequently, also, the natural man as well as the celestial and the spiritual receives the 
good of innocence through the same process, 58263, 8357, 7843, 1463, 50812. 

17. This is evident, because by Jehovah is denoted the Divine Being as to His love, 2001; by 

speaking is denoted influx, 2951; by Moses is represented Divine Truth, or the Word, 7010; 
and by saying is denoted perception, 1822. 

18. Speaking to the children of Israel, and saying to them, denotes by influx internally and thought
externally with the man of the Spiritual Church, 2951, 3395; and "when you shall come into 
the land whither I bring you," denotes that when he is confirmed in the principle of good 
which makes heaven from the Lord, 1853, 3705, 6115. 

19. By eating of the bread of the land is denoted the appropriation of good, 2187, 2165, 3705; and 
offering a heave offering to the Lord denotes vivification by acknowledgement and perception 
that it is from Him, 10093. 

20. Of the first of the dough offering up a cake for a heave offering, denotes that all truth derived 
from good shall be acknowledged, or perceived, to be from the Lord, when that truth is 
conjoined with good and is vivified, 7966, 2177, 10093, 6537; and "as you do the heave 
offering of the threshing-floor, so shall you heave it," denotes that as the good of truth must be 
seen to be from the Lord before regeneration, so also must the truth of good after regeneration,
6537. 10093.

21. Of the first of your dough, giving a heave offering to the Lord throughout your generations, 
denotes that this acknowledgement, namely, that the power of perceiving truth from good is 
from the Lord, must continue and be perpetual both during regeneration and after it, 1041. 

22. "And when you shall err, and not observe all these commandments which the Lord has spoken 
to Moses," denotes that in the case in which every man wanders from truth and goodness 

212

which are received from the Lord by the Word although he is regenerated, 2679, 5625, 7167, 
7010. 

23. "Even all that the Lord has commanded you by the hand of Moses, from the day that the Lord 
gave commandment, and onward throughout your generations," denotes even as to all the truth
and good received from the Word, and by influx during the course of regeneration," 2001, 
5486, 7010, 487, 1041. 

24. "If it be done unwittingly without the knowledge of the congregation," or, rather, assembly, 

denotes that if such error arise from ignorance or inadvertence, or both as to the understanding
and the will, and thus as to all the powers of the mind, 2679, 5625, 7843; one young bullock 
for a burnt offering of a sweet savour to the Lord, denotes that reflection shall take place and 
that acknowledgement shall be made to the Lord that this error sprang from the innocence of 
ignorance in the natural man, which is now newly sanctified to the Lord, 10021, 10053, 
10054; the meal offering and the drink offering denote that such acknowledgement is also 
internally from spiritual good and truth according to order, 4581, 2177, 3382; and one he-goat 
for a sin offering denotes the confession of sin and its removal by means of the truth of faith, 
involving some charity, or by the exterior good of truth, 4169, 3400. 

25. By the priest making atonement for all the congregation, or assembly of the children of Israel, 
and by their being forgiven, is denoted that, in this way, reconciliation between the internal 
and external man shall be effected by good from the Lord, as to the whole of man's powers, 
and full remission shall follow, 9946, 10042, 7843, 3654, 863; and by its being an error, and 
their having brought their burnt offering and their sin offering to the Lord, is denoted that it 
was through inadvertence, and that acknowledgement has been made from natural good 
conjoined with that which is spiritual and celestial, and confession and remission have 
followed, 10055, 3400, 868. 

26. All the congregation, or rather assembly, of the children of Israel being forgiven, denotes not 
only remission for all the powers of the mind or for the whole church where a number of 
persons is concerned, 7843, 3654, 868; the stranger that sojourns among them denotes but also
for such faculties or such persons as are being instructed, 1463; and in respect to all the 
people, it being done unwittingly, denotes that in respect to the whole man, or the whole 
church, it was a sin of ignorance, 2679, 5625, 7843. 

27. One person sinning unwittingly denotes error with regard to one faculty only, or error arising 
from the understanding without the consent of the will, 3986, 1000; and offering a she-goat of 
the first year for a sin offering, denotes that acknowledgement and confession will then be 
made from the good of truth, or from the interior good of faith in all fullness, remission from 
the Lord following, 4169, 7839, 3400. 

28. The priests making atonement for the soul that erreth, when he sins unwittingly, before the 
Lord, to make atonement for him, and his being forgiven, denotes that good from the Lord 
shall reconcile the external to the internal man, where error takes place inadvertently, when the
Lord is inwardly acknowledged; and such reconciliation shall be effected through the 
remission of evil by Him, 9946, 10042, 1000, 2679, 2001, 868. 

29. One law for him that does aught unwittingly, for the home-born among the children of Israel, 
and for the stranger that sojourns among them, denotes that this law concerning a sin of 

213

ignorance shall apply equally to one that is confirmed in the good and truth of the church, and 
to one who is in a state of instruction, 25678, 1708, 1463, 2679. 

30. The soul doing aught with a high hand, whether he be home-born or a stranger being guilty of 
blaspheming the Lord, and consequently being cut off from his people, denotes that wilful sin 
from the pride of selfish love, whether by him whose ruling love is good notwithstanding, or 
by him who is in a state of truth leading to good, is the profanation of good and truth from the 
Lord, and is productive of spiritual death, or of separation from the Lord until repentance takes
place, 1000, 8153, 8882, 5302. 

31. "Because he has despised the word of the Lord, and has broken His commandments, that soul 

shall be utterly cut off, his iniquity shall be upon him," denotes that because such sin is a sin 
against Divine Truth, or the Word, perverts influx and destroys correspondence, thus making 
the removal of evil impossible, except through sincere repentance, 9257, 1288, 2951, 2634, 
5302. 

32. The children of Israel, while in the wilderness, finding a man gathering sticks on the Sabbath 
day, denotes that it happens to the man of the church, during regeneration, when he is disposed
to claim merit for his good deeds,—even though he is in a prevailing state of good conjoined 
to truth,—and also actually does so, 3654, 2708, 2784, 8495. 

33. Bringing the man to Moses, and Aaron, and all the congregation, denotes that the truths of the 
church condemn such persons, and this not only because such a state is contrary to the leading 
principles of truth and good in the church, but also to the general perception of truth with 
which man is endowed, 7010, 9946, 7843. 

34. Putting him in ward because it had not been declared what should be done to him, denotes a 

state of restraint and uncertainty, until the particular truths concerning the evil of claiming 
merit are revealed and considered, 5037, 2862, 6337. 

35. The Lord saying to Moses denotes revelation made from the Lord by Divine Truth, 2001, 

1822, 7019; "the man shall surely be put to death" denotes that this state is contrary to the life 
of good and truth from the Lord, 1408; and all the congregation stoning him with stones 
without the camp, denotes the rejection of the life of claiming merit in order that man may 
enjoy the heavenly life, and that this is effected by the power of the truth, 7843, 8575, 4236. 

36. All the congregation bringing him without the camp, and stoning him with stones that he died, 
as the Lord commanded Moses, denotes that this state of claiming merit is to be separated 
from the church, and from the heavenly life, and must suffer the punishment of falsity, 
conjoined with evil, causing spiritual death; for this is according to Divine Truth from Divine 
Good, 7843, 8575, 4236, 2908, 2001, 5486, 7010. 

37. This is evident, because by Jehovah is denoted the Divine Being as to His love, 2001; by 

speaking is denoted influx, 2951; by Moses is represented Divine Truth, or the Word, 7010; 
and by saying is denoted perception, 1822. 

38. Speaking to the children of Israel and bidding them, denotes that the man of the church is 

urged both by an appeal to the understanding and the will, 2619; making fringes in the borders
of their garments, denotes to study the Word of the Lord in the literal sense as to the 
particulars of truth there, 257615, 94687; throughout their generations, denotes even through 

214

the whole course of regeneration, 1041; and putting upon the fringe of each border a "cord of 
blue," or a "scarlet thread," denotes doing so from the love of truth conjoined with the love of 
good, 94681. 

39. "And it shall be to you for a fringe, that you may look upon it, and remember all the 

commandments of the Lord and do them," denotes that the reason why the Word of the Lord is
thus to be studied in its literal sense, is that it may not only be understood but also that it may 
be imbibed and practised, as to its particulars, 9468s; and "that you go not about after your 
own heart and your own eyes, after which you use to go a whoring," denotes that thus the love 
of good and truth may overcome all merely selfish love and intelligence, by which the truths 
of the Word are continually falsified, 246611, 3335, 7272, 9051. 

40. "That you may remember and do all my commandments, and be holy to your God," denotes 

that the love of good conjoined with the love of truth causes particular truths to be more easily 
remembered, and applied to life, thus producing the sanctification of the external man, as well 
as the internal, 5229, 94681, 2634, 47272, 5069, 2001. 

41. "I am the Lord your God which brought you out of the land of Egypt to be your God: I am the 
Lord your God," denotes that from the Lord proceed both Divine Good and Divine Truth in 
conjunction, and that by Him alone is man delivered from the bondage of the "merely natural 
life, in order that he may first be led by truths, and may afterwards realize in himself the full 
conjunction of good and truth, 2001, 8866. 

DISCUSSION

The subject of the first section, in what is now before us, is the worship of the Lord in the regenerated 
state, and the increase of the good of innocence which is said, in 10137, to be in the least proportion 
when it is the inmost good of innocence, in greater proportion when it is the middle degree of 
innocence, and in the greatest proportion when it is the ultimate degree of innocence, corresponding 
respectively to the three heavens; and it may appear to some persons a very strange thing that the 
innocence of those in the inmost heaven should be in the least proportion, while the innocence of the 
ultimate heaven is in the greatest; and that surely the innocence of the celestial angels is in very much 
greater proportion than that of those in the ultimate heaven. And indeed this is true, for it is said that the
celestial angels are more than others in a state of peace and innocence, 3887; that a ram denotes the 
internal good of innocence, 10132, or such as appertains to the spiritual angels; and that a bullock 
signifies the external good of innocence, 9391, or such as belongs to the angels of the ultimate heaven. 
We have to consider, therefore, in what sense the inmost good of innocence is in the least proportion; 
the middle good of innocence in greater proportion, and the ultimate good of innocence in the greatest 
proportion; or rather how it increases in proportion from what is inmost to what is ultimate.

Now, it is here to be remembered that man advances in regeneration by degrees from external to 
internal states, according to the teaching that the natural life comes first and the spiritual and celestial 
life afterwards (1 Cor 15:46-49), and according to the order of regeneration described in the internal 
sense of Gen. i. throughout; and also that the Divine operation in regeneration is from or through 
Internals to Externals at the same time. For unless the Lord operated inwardly at the same time that 
man received instruction outwardly (John 3:5), there could be no regeneration. And from this it will be 
seen that when a person first becomes conscious externally that he is being born again, it is because he 

215

is internally affected by the Lord's life, that is, he then first comes inmostly into a state of good; and 
thus into a state of innocence, because innocence is the very essence of good, 2526. But it must be 
evident that, to the person's consciousness at this time, this good of innocence is in the least proportion 
with him, notwithstanding it is really his inmost good of innocence properly denoted by a lamb. And 
this is the reason why it is said that worship at the beginning of regeneration, which is here described in
the internal sense, is from the inmost good of innocence only; for as to the spiritual and natural degrees 
there is not yet a state of innocence. But now, as the person advances from this state of conscious 
external good to a more internal state, or from a natural to a spiritual state, and worships the Lord, it is 
because the good of innocence descends from Him, and becomes, also, the middle good of innocence, 
signified by a ram, in addition to the inmost good of innocence denoted by a lamb, and thus the good of
innocence is intensified, and is therefore in greater proportion when man is in spiritual good 
consciously as well as in natural good. But, again, the person passing through regeneration will also 
advance beyond the spiritual degree of his life, even to its celestial or inmost degree; for his progress is 
from a state of simple obedience to a state of the love of the truth, and thence to a state of the love of 
good, which is his celestial state; and when this happens, then the good of innocence becomes 
consciously present in the ultimate degree of his life, and he worships the Lord most intensely and 
fully, such worship being signified by a bullock, and being in the greatest proportion, because it is, 
again, in addition to the middle good of innocence and the inmost good of innocence.

And now, therefore, it is to be observed that, to whichever of the three heavens the fully regenerated 
person belongs, he has his good of innocence in the greatest proportion, because he has realized his 
inmost life in his natural degree; or, in other words, his external man is in perfect harmony with his 
internal. And yet it remains true that the angels of the superior heavens are more in the good of 
innocence than those of the inferior heavens. For to compare the good of innocence prevailing in the 
three heavens is one thing, and to compare the increase of that good in the course of regeneration is 
quite another.

In order properly to understand the internal sense of the next section, it must be taken into 
consideration that by coming into the land is signified not only the realization of the heavenly life in 
heaven by regeneration completed, but also the realization of the state of being regenerated; for when a 
man is in the course of regeneration, he is potentially in the heavenly life, although not, as yet, fully so. 
But the subject of the section is the appropriation of good signified by eating the bread of the land; and 
it is worth while to consider what this involves. It is evident that when a person takes food naturally 
and properly digests it, then the materials of that food become, by the process of digestion, a part of his 
body, and that this is a real appropriation. And it is just the same with regard to the appropriation of 
good and truth from the Lord. For the good and truth thus received are outside the man to begin with, 
and he has the power or faculty from the Lord of making them a part of his very being. And he first 
receives them into his memory and understanding as knowledge and affection; but after he has thus 
received them by thus spiritually eating them, their digestion is under another control, and, in short, is 
the work of the Lord according to certain spiritual laws, to which the laws regulating the digestion of 
man's food correspond. Just, therefore, as a person cannot regulate his own digestion, although he may 
injure it by taking unsuitable food, or by neglect or excess in eating or drinking, so he may do 
spiritually. He may receive good and truth and may abuse them through his selfishness by wrong 
application, or misappropriation. And hence we may see that there is important spiritual instruction in 
our section. When a man receives good from the Lord, therefore, which is freely given (Isa 55:1), and 
which the Lord desires he shall make properly his own, then there is an important duty before him; and 
this duty is represented by offering up a heave offering to the Lord. That is, the good which he 

216

incorporates must be acknowledged to be from the Lord, and the recipient must love to have it so, and 
perceive that it is so continually.

Outwardly, indeed, among Christians, it is a very common thing to acknowledge that all natural and all 
spiritual good things are from the Lord, for nothing is more easy to do than this. But the real 
acknowledgement and perception signified by the heave offering is not quite so easy, because it 
involves the repression and so to speak, the extinction of the conceit that what we appropriate is our 
very own without any qualification. Thus, then, to make the acknowledgement here required involves 
the giving up of our own selfish life, and this both as to the understanding and the will. Now the angels,
in their happy homes, are able to do this, because they are fully regenerated, but still they know very 
well that they could not do it without the continual dependence upon the Lord which is necessary. It is 
said both as to the understanding and the will, because there were both wave offerings and heave 
offerings in the representative church, the former having relation to spiritual things and the latter to 
celestial. Of course, the thing that was offered itself represented the acknowledgement that a certain 
specific good was from the Lord, 99382, but the waving or heaving, as it is said, denoted vivification 
by influx into spiritual or celestial things respectively. And really it is a delightful thought that, as soon 
as, or in proportion as we get rid of evil impulses, we may have good impulses from the Lord, and the 
appropriate activity thence.

But there is yet another point here. For "the first of your dough" signifies the first state of truth from 
good, according to the explanation in the place to which reference is made; and this, to some extent, 
illustrates what is said about the threshing-floor, since this signifies the state of the good of truth before 
regeneration is completed, and of the truth of good after it is completed, the cake denoting the 
conjunction of truth with good in the first instance, and the conjunction of good with truth in the 
second, while the heave offering denotes the perception of this conjunction, and that it is from the Lord.
See also 5295, 5959. 

The next section, which has reference to what is to be done, when sins arising from ignorance or error 
are committed, is interesting, not only as showing the difference between such offences and those 
which spring from deliberate wickedness, as described in vers. 30-31, but also as distinguishing 
between an error of the will, and of the understanding, the former being denoted by the whole assembly
sinning thus, and the latter by a single person doing so. For when the assembly unwittingly sinned, a 
he-goat was offered as a sin offering, but when one person only sinned, it was a she-goat, and we 
naturally desire to know why this difference was to be made. Now, the reference shows that a she-goat, 
compared with a ewe, denotes the good of the understanding as distinguished from the good of the will,
and it follows, therefore, that a he-goat denotes the truth of the understanding, 725, and that this is 
relatively exterior to its good, so that, as it is said, the she-goat signifies worship from a more interior 
good than does a he-goat. That is to say, when an error is committed from imperfection as to the 
understanding only, and not as to the will, which is denoted by one person sinning unwittingly, then the
state of good by which atonement is made, or the state of worship causing the removal of the evil, is 
evidently the interior good of faith signified by the she-goat; but when, on the other hand, the error is 
committed through imperfection as to the will as well as the understanding, which is denoted by the 
whole assembly sinning unwittingly, then it is equally evident that the state of good by which 
atonement is made, or the state of worship causing the removal of the evil, is the exterior good of faith 
signified by a he-goat. Thus, then, the secret reason why a he-goat was offered as a sin offering in one 
case, and a she-goat in another, clearly appears; and we here see how particular the laws of Moses were
in the selection of the various animals that were employed in the sacrifices. But this difficulty being 
removed, we may soon proceed to consider the remaining sections, the first of which has relation to the

217

claiming of merit which is an act of the imperfect will, and the second to the proper study of the Word, 
which, of course, is an act of the understanding.

And with regard to the first, which, in the literal sense, describes the punishment inflicted by the Divine
command upon a man who was found gathering sticks, or wood, on the Sabbath, does it not seem, on 
the surface, to be a very severe sentence for a relatively small offence? But reflection will show that 
there was a sufficient reason for it. For the church, at that time, was only the representative of a true 
Spiritual Church; and by its means such an external conjunction between mankind and heaven was 
maintained, as was then absolutely necessary, because such was the state of the Israelites, and of the 
human race generally, that there could be no interior conjunction, and thus no true church; and if, 
therefore, the representative people had not been strictly kept in their outward obedience by miracles 
and severe punishments, the connection between heaven and the world would have been broken, and 
great calamities would have been the result. Hence, therefore, severe punishments were necessary even 
for apparently slight offences, as in the case before us and others. See, for example, Exod 19:12; Lev 
16:13; 2 Sam 6:6-7; and 45456, 6304, 4208. But as to the internal sense, it is evident that the Sabbath 
signifies the heavenly state of love to the Lord and the neighbour, while the six days of labour denote a 
state of conflict between good and evil, which precedes the heavenly state; so that, generally speaking, 
to keep the Sabbath denotes to preserve in ourselves the state of good by not doing evil things at any 
time, and that to break the Sabbath signifies to do what is evil at any time. And thus in reality a person 
may keep the Sabbath holy; or break it, on any day in the week, as well as the first.

And now, this being understood, it becomes evident that, at any time, to claim merit to ourselves for 
any good thing which we do, which the references given in connection with this section show, is 
signified by gathering wood, is actually to break our spiritual Sabbath, and is, in fact, a far more serious
matter than, at first thought, it may appear. For it amounts to this, that we then ascribe to ourselves 
what really belongs to the Lord, and bring upon ourselves, for the time being, a state of spiritual death, 
which is signified by being stoned with stones. That is, we put ourselves entirely in a false position, and
suffer the punishment arising from it. For how can we truly ascribe our good to the Lord, although, 
internally, we desire to do it, so long as we are selfishly gratified by hearing anybody praise us for 
doing some good thing, this being actually the claiming of merit. How, then, shall we be delivered from
such a false position? Only by acknowledging, not in words alone, but from our hearts, that all good is 
from the Lord; and thus we shall be purified, and while properly rejoicing, as we may, that we are able 
to perform uses sincerely, we shall get rid of a very troublesome vice, which cannot be tolerated among
the angels, 23804, Luke 18:19. 

Coming now to the last section, we have an excellent example of how the internal sense of the Word 
sometimes, as it were, descends and manifests itself in the letter of the Word; for the sum and 
substance, both of the spiritual and literal sense lies in continually remembering the commandments of 
the Lord to do them. It is very important indeed that the man of the church should make for himself a 
fringe at the border of his garments, or, in other words, should value the literal sense of the Word, 
because there even the Divine Truth is in its fullness, its sanctity, and its power (DLW 221). It does, 
indeed, appear as if much of the literal sense has no relation to man's duty to the Lord and the 
neighbour at all, but when the spiritual sense is known, even these may be read with the greatest delight
and interest, since all the expressions immediately call forth the spiritual truths within, and the mere 
history, or literal precept, or prophecy, seems to pass unnoticed, while the mind is intent on receiving 
real instruction in the duties and laws of life, as well as in the phenomena of regeneration. But in other 
parts the letter is so full of wisdom and of practical instruction, even in relation to man's spiritual 

218

experiences in the natural life, that no secular writing as to our moral duties appeals to us with anything
like the interest and power of the sacred books. Take, for example, the universal suitability, in this 
respect, of the Psalms in the Old Testament, and of the Lord's own personal teaching in the Sermon on 
the Mount, and in other parts of the Gospels, in the New. Well, then, is it with us when we regularly 
make use of the literal sense of the Word, or, in correspondential language, make for ourselves fringes 
upon the borders of our garments.

But, also, we are instructed in this spiritual law to put upon the fringe a cord of blue, or a scarlet thread,
in order that we may remember. For this scarlet thread is the love of truth conjoined with the love of 
good, or it is love to the neighbour conjoined with love to the Lord; and we all know very well that we 
remember best that which we love most, and also do best that which we love most. By all means, 
therefore, let us not forget the lesson of the fringe and the scarlet thread, but carry with us the Word of 
the Lord in all our wanderings, fixing its truths in our memories and embodying them in our lives from 
genuine love.

Numbers Chapter 16

SUMMARY OF THE SPIRITUAL SENSE

1. On the opposition of those in faith without charity to the true church. They support themselves
apparently by the primary doctrines of the church; they approve Divine Good as well as 
Divine Truth; and they urge that every man is led by selfish love, vers. 1-3. 

2. But the man of the true church comes into profound humiliation on being thus tempted; he 

depends upon influx from the Lord through the heavens; he sees that the wicked are allowed to
assume the appearance of genuine worship; he condemns their vain assumptions, and their 
discontent; and he knows that their pretensions will be thoroughly tested, vers. 4-19. 

3. Also revelation is made, and exhortation is given to the true church to separate themselves, 

which actually happens; and the false church continues its opposition, vers. 20-27. 

4. Concerning the judgement and condemnation of those in faith without charity, vers. 28-35. 

5. Concerning the preservation of true external worship, although that which is false and selfish 

is rejected, vers. 36-40. 

6. And also concerning the effect of false external worship, and true external worship, the former
resulting in the destruction of spiritual life by the destruction of remains, and the latter in its 
preservation, vers. 41-50. 

THE CONTENTS OF EACH VERSE

1. Now Korah, the son of Izhar, the son
of Kohath, the son of Levi, with 
Dathan and Abiram, the sons of 
Eliab, and On, the son of Peleth, 
sons of Reuben, took men: 

1. Those who are in faith alone, in a state of the 

church which is merely external, and who act from
strong natural affection, which, in its purity, is 
derived from Divine Truth and Divine Good; with 
those who delight in mere ceremonies and those 
who falsify the truth, both, in their best form, 
derived from Divine Truth conjoined with Divine 
Good; and those who from the violence of their 
evil passions destroy the heavenly life, although 
all those are outwardly of the church as to faith in 
the understanding;—are, all together, exalted 
against the truth, 

2. And they rose up before Moses, with
certain of the children of Israel, two 
hundred and fifty princes of the 
congregation, called to the assembly,
men of renown: 

2. Supporting themselves in their rebellion 

apparently by the primary doctrines of the church 
having relation respectively to affection, to 
intelligence, and to activity, and in sufficiency as 
to the conjunction of falsity and evil. 

220

3. And they assembled themselves 

together against Moses and against 
Aaron, and said to them, You take 
too much upon you, seeing all the 
congregation are holy, every one of 
them, and the LORD is among them: 
wherefore then lift you up 
yourselves above the assembly of the
LORD? 

3. And this combination of the wicked is not only 
against Divine Truth, but also against Divine 
Good, insinuating the falsities with the man of the 
church in temptation, that what is affirmed to be 
from good and truth is from pride and the love of 
ruling; that, in reality, every man is led by selfish 
love; and that by this the Lord governs him. 

4. And when Moses heard it, he fell 

4. But the truly spiritual man, being thus tempted, 

upon his face: 

comes into profound humiliation, 

5. And he spoke to Korah and to all his 
company, saying, In the morning the 
LORD will show who are his, and 
who is holy, and will cause him to 
come near to him: even him whom 
he shall choose will he cause, to 
come near to him. 

5. And opposes the influx of evil and falsity from the
hells, by influx from the Lord through the heavens,
involving the perception that the real truth will be 
made manifest in a state of illustration from the 
Lord, as to those who are in genuine truth and 
genuine good; for genuine truth has conjunction 
with good, and genuine good has conjunction with 
the Lord; 

6. This do; take you censers, Korah, 

6. But that nevertheless, the Lord permits those who 

and all his company; 

7. And put fire therein, and put incense 
upon them before the LORD to-
morrow: and it shall be that the man 
whom the LORD does choose, he 
shall be holy: you take too much 
upon you, you sons of Levi. 

8. And Moses said to Korah, Hear now,

you sons of Levi: 

9.

Seemeth it but a small thing to you, 
that the God of Israel has separated 
you from the congregation of Israel, 
to bring you near to himself; to do 
the service of the tabernacle of the 
LORD, and to stand before the 
congregation to minister to them; 

are interiorly in evils and falsities to assume the 
appearance of sincere worship, 

7. And this even as to the zeal of love to the Lord and
charity to the neighbour continually; while yet 
Divine Love itself decides who is in truth and who
is in good, because the real character of man is 
determined by his state internally, and not by his 
state externally, wherein he assumes the 
appearance of charity. 

8. And the man of the true church perceives from 
Divine Truth, and by his obedience to that truth 
causes the tempters to feel his opposition to them, 
discerning 

9. That it is of the greatest importance to understand 
that charity, and not faith alone, is that which 
particularly distinguishes the man of the Spiritual 
Church, who from Divine Truth engages in 
conflict against evil; and that gives conjunction 
with the Lord. For it is the function of the spiritual 
man to minister to the celestial, and at the same 
time to the natural man, as a medium of 
conjunction, 

221

10. And that he has brought you near, 

and all your brethren the sons of 
Levi with you? and seek you the 
priesthood also? 

10. And thus also, by such conjunction, to hallow the 
external man; but that the spiritual man cannot 
perform the functions of the celestial; 

11. Therefore you and all your company 
are gathered together against the 
LORD: and Aaron, what is he that you
murmur against him? 

11. And that, therefore, the corrupted spiritual man 
with his falsities is in opposition even to Divine 
Good itself, and not simply to celestial good which
claims no merit. 

12. And Moses sent to call Dathan and 
Abiram, the sons of Eliab: and they 
said, We will not come up: 

13. Is it a small thing that you have 

brought us up out of a land flowing 
with milk and honey, to kill us in the 
wilderness, but you must needs make
yourself also a prince over us? 

14. Moreover you have not brought us 
into a land flowing with milk and 
honey, nor given us inheritance of 
fields and vineyards: will you put out
the eyes of these men? we will not 
come up. 

15. And Moses was very angry, and said 
to the LORD, Respect not you their 
offering: I have not taken one ass 
from them, neither have I hurt one of
them. 

12. Moreover, Divine Truth investigates the state of 
the corrupted man as to external worship and the 
falsification of truths, which worship and truths 
are, in their purity, derived from truth conjoined 
with good; but it is the thought of the corrupted 
man, that he will not submit to Divine Truth. 

13. And this because he regards as all important the 
pleasures and delights of the merely natural man, 
and despises the instruction and restraint which the
course of regeneration imposes, and the 
assumption of the Divine Law that it is primary in 
the church; 

14. But he does not believe in the heavenly life of 
truth and goodness with their delights in the 
natural man, or in goodness and truth as the real 
inheritance of man, considering that his own 
intelligence derived from selfish love is true 
intelligence, and being in determined opposition to
Divine Truth both as to the will and understanding.

15. The wicked, therefore, are averted from Divine 

Truth, while the man of the church, in temptation, 
perceives that they are only in the hypocritical 
acknowledgement of the Lord, that Divine Truth in
regeneration is not destructive of the natural 
powers in their integrity, and that neither is it 
disposed to injure the natural affections. 

16. And Moses said to Korah, Be you 

16. It also dictates that those who are in faith alone 

and all your congregation before the 
LORD, you, and they, and Aaron, to-
morrow: 

with its errors, as well as those who are in genuine 
good, must alike submit themselves to Divine 
Judgement continually; 

222

17. And take you every man his censer, 
and put incense upon them, and 
bring you before the LORD every 
man his censer, two hundred and 
fifty censers; you also, and Aaron, 
each his censer. 

18. And they took every man his censer, 
and put fire in them, and laid incense
thereon, and stood at the door of the 
tent of meeting with Moses and 
Aaron. 

17. And that every one will, in the Judgement, reveal 
his true character in his outward actions, this being
effected by the nearer presence of the Lord, which 
discovers the exact quality of each individual, 
whether it be little or much, as to good and truth, 
and that this applies especially to the ruling 
principles as to evil or good. 

18. And that this also actually takes place in the 

intermediate state, where both the wicked and the 
good are assembled. 

19. And Korah assembled all the 

congregation against them to the 
door of the tent of meeting: and the 
glory of the LORD appeared to all the
congregation. 

19. For the wicked, with all their errors, are eager to 
rely on the spiritual things of the church from 
selfish love; and in the Judgement, the power of 
Divine Good and Divine Truth conjoined becomes 
manifested to all. 

20. And the LORD spoke to Moses and to

Aaron, saying, 

20. And there is revelation to those who are in Divine 
Truth and Divine Good giving the perception, 

21. Separate yourselves from among this
congregation, that I may consume 
them in a moment. 

21. In the first place, that they are about to be 

overwhelmed in their extremity of temptation, and 
to perish from the dominion of evil; 

22. And they fell upon their faces, and 

said, O God, the God of the spirits of
all flesh, shall one man sin, and will 
you be angry with all the 
congregation? 

22. And this induces in them a more profound degree 
of humiliation, and the acknowledgement that the 
Lord governs man by Divine Truth operating first 
in his spiritual degree, which shall afterwards 
freely manifest itself in his natural degree; and 
that, therefore, although evil, in the temptation, 
appears to prevail, in reality it is the natural man 
which appears to be in aversion from the Lord. 

23. And the LORD spoke to Moses, 

23. And hence they receive further revelation from the

saying, 

Lord giving the perception, 

24. Speak to the congregation, saying, 

24. That their external man is, as the effect of the 

Get you up from about the tabernacle
of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram. 

temptation, to be entirely separated from evils and 
falsities. 

25. And Moses rose up and went to 

Dathan and Abiram; and the elders 
of Israel followed him. 

25. And then they experience an elevation as to Divine
Truth and Divine Good in themselves, which 
clearly manifests the falsity of external worship 
without internal, and the profanation of truth by 
evil affections. 

223

26. And he spoke to the congregation, 

saying, Depart, I pray you, from the 
tents of these wicked men, and touch
nothing of theirs, lest you be 
consumed in all their sins. 

26. So that the external man, as well as the internal, is 
separated from the evils and falsities which cause 
the temptation, yea, from all contact therewith, by 
which means the wicked are entirely vastated, and 
the good are delivered; 

27. So they gat them up from the 

tabernacle of Korah, Dathan, and 
Abiram, on every side: and Dathan 
and Abiram came out, and stood at 
the door of their tents, and their 
wives, and their sons, and their little 
ones. 

27. And then the spiritual man, as to both his internal 
and external powers, is completely delivered from 
false worship, while those who are in merely 
external worship, and in falsities from evil, are 
made manifest as to their true characters, and thus 
as to affections, as to thoughts, and as to the 
appearance of innocence. 

28. And Moses said, Hereby you shall 
know that the LORD has sent me to 
do all these works; for I have not 
done them of mine own mind. 

29. If these men die the common death 
of all men, or if they be visited after 
the visitation of all men; then the 
LORD has not sent me. 

28. And further, there is now perception from Divine 

Truth even in the external man thus separated, that 
there shall be testification with them that all 
salvation and purification are from the Lord, and 
not at all from man himself, 

29. Namely, that if those who have perverted the good 
of the church and falsified its truths deliberately, 
are saved of themselves by giving up the life of 
evil and falsity in the Judgement because the Lord 
has provided that all may be saved who are 
willing, then indeed is Divine Truth not a 
revelation from Divine Good, as a means of 
salvation. 

30. But if the LORD make a new thing, 

30. But if, on the other hand, it is clearly manifested 

and the ground open her mouth, and 
swallow them up, with all that 
appertain to them, and they go down 
alive into the pit; then you shall 
understand that these men have 
despised the LORD. 

from Divine Good, through the revelation of truths
not before known, that man, by confirming himself
in the life of evil, is given up to all the falsities 
proceeding therefrom, both as to the external and 
the internal of his life, and is then delighted with 
nothing more than his own evil by which he is 
condemned to hell, then it will be seen that evil 
was chosen deliberately. 

31. And it came to pass, as he made an 

31. And so it really happens according to Divine 

end of speaking all these words, that 
the ground clave to pieces that was 
under them: 

Truth, to the corrupted spiritual man. For in the 
Judgement, all the outward professions of 
righteousness upon which he had mainly relied are
taken away from him; 

224

32. And the earth opened her mouth, and

swallowed them up, and their 
households, and all the men that 
appertained to Korah, and all their 
goods. 

32. And he is overwhelmed in his own merely natural 
delights, thereby condemning himself to hell, and 
this completely as to every faculty of the will and 
every power of the understanding. 

33. So they, and all that appertained to 
them, went down alive into the pit: 
and the earth closed upon them, and 
they perished from among the 
assembly. 

33. And thus he enters into his eternal condition of life
in the hells; his external man is made one with his 
internal; and he is no longer in the intermediate 
state in which regeneration alone is possible by 
means of truths. 

34. And all Israel that were round about 
them fled at the cry of them: for they
said, Lest the earth swallow us up. 

35. And fire came forth from the LORD, 
and devoured the two hundred and 
fifty men that offered the incense. 

34. But the man of the church who is in temptations is 
delivered by the Lord from the infestations of the 
wicked, because he perceives that the confirmation
of what is of the spiritual man by the natural man, 
when it is falsity conjoined with evil, is spiritual 
death; 

35. Besides which, the Divine Love in the heart of the 

regenerated member of the church entirely 
overcomes all tendency to profane worship by 
making it external only. 

36. And the LORD spoke to Moses, 

36. But again there is revelation from the Lord by 

saying, 

Divine Truth giving the perception. 

37. Speak to Eleazar the son of Aaron 

the priest, that he take up the censers
out of the burning, and scatter you 
the fire yonder; for they are holy; 

37. To the man of the Spiritual Church derived from 
the Celestial, through orderly influx, that the 
externals of worship considered in themselves are 
to be elevated and preserved, and that the profane 
love which perverts them is at the same time to be 
rejected, because external worship is the proper 
receptacle of what is internal, and is therefore holy.

38. Even the censers of these sinners 

38. Even that external worship which is merely 

against their own lives, and let them 
be made beaten plates for a covering 
of the altar: for they offered them 
before the LORD, therefore they are 
holy: and they shall be a sign to the 
children of Israel. 

representative of what is internal, the abuse of 
which causes spiritual death; and that, therefore, it 
is to be made the ultimate form of true internal 
worship; for with the wicked, externals without a 
corresponding internal are, at least, an outward 
acknowledgement of the Lord, and to the man of 
the church are useful as guides and incentives to 
internal worship. 

225

39. And Eleazar the priest took the 

brazen censers, which they that were
burnt had offered; and they beat 
them out for a covering of the altar: 

39. And therefore also the man of the Spiritual Church
devoutly engages in external worship from natural 
good, even as, apparently, does he who is 
internally in selfish love, and is, at length, 
consumed by it; and thus external worship 
becomes truly the expression of that which is 
internal; 

40. To be a memorial to the children of 

40. And is a token to the man of the church in all its 

Israel, to the end that no stranger, 
which is not of the seed of Aaron, 
come near to burn incense before the
LORD; that he be not as Korah, and 
as his company: as the LORD spoke 
to him by the hand of Moses. 

states, that no affection which is not derived from 
celestial good constitutes true spiritual worship, 
and consequently it is to be rejected, lest man 
should come into the profanation of good and 
truth; and this is the dictate of Divine Truth from 
Divine Good. 

41. But on the morrow all the 

congregation of the children of Israel
murmured against Moses and against
Aaron, saying, You have killed the 
people of the LORD. 

42. And it came to pass, when the 

congregation was assembled against 
Moses and against Aaron, that they 
looked toward the tent of meeting: 
and, behold, the cloud covered it, 
and the glory of the LORD appeared. 

41. But yet the fact remains that, for the time being, 
the man of the church who is in externals, is 
opposed to Divine Truth and Divine Good, which 
constitutes the internal church, being persuaded 
that outward worship for the sake of self only is 
true worship from Divine Good. 

42. But it invariably happens in such a state, that when
there is a nearer approach of the Lord through the 
Word in its literal or spiritual sense, 

43. And Moses and Aaron came to the 
front of the tent of meeting. 

43. And Divine Truth and Divine Good are 

manifested, 

44. And the LORD spoke to Moses, 

44. That then there is perception from the Lord, 

saying, 

45. Get you up from among this 

45. That a state of external worship without internal, 

congregation, that I may consume 
them in a moment. And they fell 
upon their faces. 

when persisted in, causes the separation of interior 
good and truth, and will result in the destruction of
internal worship, unless there be repentance and 
humiliation. 

226

46. And Moses said to Aaron, Take your 
censer, and put fire therein from off 
the altar, and lay incense thereon, 
and carry it quickly to the 
congregation, and make atonement 
for them: for there is wrath gone out 
from the LORD; the plague is begun. 

47. And Aaron took as Moses spoke, and
ran into the midst of the assembly; 
and, behold, the plague was begun 
among the people: and he put on the 
incense, and made atonement for the 
people. 

48. And he stood between the dead and 
the living; and the plague was 
stayed. 

46. And therefore it is the dictate of Divine Truth to 

the man of the church who is in good, that external
worship must be combined with real worship from
love and from truth from the Lord, and that this 
must certainly be done zealously by the natural 
man, in order that the evil of merely external 
worship may be removed, for otherwise man is 
averted from the Lord and remains are destroyed. 

47. And the man of the internal church recognizes the 

truth of all this, being in good, and eagerly 
endeavours to make his external worship 
harmonious with his internal, because he perceives
that mere outward devotion is destructive of 
remains, and that therefore it must be continually 
removed by the help of the Lord. 

48. And when he earnestly separates from himself all 
selfish motives in worship, and is zealous to 
worship the Lord from genuine truth and good, 
then are remains preserved with him. 

49. Now they that died by the plague 
were fourteen thousand and seven 
hundred, besides them that died 
about the matter of Korah. 

49. For there must be the destruction of remains when 
man totally profanes the good and truth of the 
church, as well as when he makes outward 
devotion the all of worship. 

50. And Aaron returned to Moses to the 
door of the tent of meeting: and the 
plague was stayed. 

50. But when good is conjoined with truth Internally, 
and there is also full acknowledgement of the Lord
externally, then is the worship of the Lord perfect, 
and remains are no longer destroyed. 

REFERENCES AND NOTES

1. Korah the son of Izhar, the son of Kohath the son of Levi, denotes those who are in faith alone 
in a state of the church which is merely external, and who act from strong natural affection, 
which, —in its purity,—is derived from Divine Truth and Divine Good, because by Korah is 
meant bald, frozen, icy, and therefore by him are denoted those in faith alone, in a state of the 
church which is merely external, 33018, 934, by Izhar is meant fine olive oil, and therefore by 
him is denoted, in the best sense, a state of good derived from truth, but here, in the opposite 
sense, strong natural affection, 886; by Kohath is meant congregation, assembly, and therefore
by him is denoted the truth of the church, and in the highest sense Divine Truth in its 
brightness, 7843, chap 3:17, 29, 9684, and by Levi is meant adhering, and therefore by him is 
denoted charity or good, and in the highest sense Divine Good, 3875; Dathan and Abiram the 
sons of Eliab, denote those who delight in mere ceremonies, and those who falsify the truth, 
both—in their best form— derived from Divine Truth conjoined with Divine Good, because 
by Dathan are meant laws or rites, and therefore by him is denoted delight in mere 
ceremonies, 31473 by Abiram is meant the father of fraud, or a high father, and therefore by 

227

him are denoted, in this rase, those who falsify the truth, 3703, 4459, 795, and by Eliab is 
meant God my father, and therefore by him is denoted Divine Truth conjoined to Divine Good,
2001, 3703; On the son of Peleth, denotes those who, from the violence of their evil passions, 
destroy the heavenly life, because by On is meant pain, or force, or iniquity, and therefore by 
him is denoted the violence of evil passions, 5713, 8168, 9937, while by Peleth,—the meaning
of which does not appear in the lists consulted,—as a son or descendant of Reuben, is 
evidently denoted some form of faith without charity which is destructive of the heavenly life, 
2435; Dathan, Abiram, and On, being all sons of Reuben, denotes three forms of corrupted 
faith gradually more intensified as the signification of each shows; their being associated with 
Korah, denotes the conjunction of falsities with evil; and their taking men, denotes that, 
although all these principles are outwardly of the church, as to faith in the understanding, they 
are in reality exalted against the truth, 3870. 

2. Their rising up against Moses, denotes exaltation against Divine Truth, 10413, 7010; "with 
certain of the children of Israel, two hundred and fifty princes of the congregation," denotes 
supporting themselves, in their rebellion, apparently by the primary doctrines of the church, 
1482, 7843, 3654; princes of the congregation, or rather assembly, denotes having relation to 
affection, 7843; called to the assembly, denotes as to intelligence, the original word in this 
instance being that often translated "meeting," 9373, 3755; men of renown denotes, according 
to the series, as to activity, 2009; and two hundred and fifty denotes in sufficiency as to the 
conjunction of falsity and evil, 10255. 

3. Assembling themselves together against Moses and against Aaron, denotes that this 

combination of the wicked is not only against Divine Truth but also against Divine Good, 
7010, 9946, 6338; saying to them, denotes the insinuation of falsities with the man of the 
church in temptation, 1822; "you take too much upon you, seeing all the congregation are 
holy, every one of them, and the Lord is among them," denotes that what is affirmed to be 
from good and truth is from pride and the love of ruling, 9946, 7010, 7843, 8788, 2001; and 
"wherefore then lift you up yourselves above the assembly," or rather congregation, "of the 
Lord," denotes that, in reality, every man is led by selfish love; and that by this the Lord 
governs him, 10413, 7843, 2001. The "congregation" here denotes falsities derived from evils 
which the wicked affirm to be truths derived from good.

4. Moses falling upon his face when he heard it, denotes that the truly spiritual man, being thus 

tempted, comes into profound humiliation, 7010, 3507, 1999. 

5. Speaking to Korah and all his company saying, denotes opposition to the influx of evil and 

falsity from the hells, by influx from the Lord through the heavens involving the perception, 
ver. 1, 2951, 1822; in the morning the Lord showing who are His and who is holy, denotes that
the real truth will be made manifest in a state of illustration from the Lord as to those who are 
in genuine truth and genuine good, 4214, 2001, 9229; causing him to come near to Him, 
denotes that genuine truth has conjunction with good, 3572; and causing him whom He shall 
choose to come near to Him, denotes that genuine good has conjunction with the Lord, 3755, 
9229. 

6.

"This do; take you censers, Korah and all his company," denotes that, nevertheless, the Lord 
permits those who are interiorly in evils and falsities to assume the appearance of sincere 
worship, ver. 1, 5755, 9475, 51202. 

228

7. Putting fire into the censers, and incense upon them before the Lord to-morrow, denotes this 
even as to the zeal of love to the Lord and charity to the neighbour continually, 934, 9475, 
3998; the man whom the Lord shall choose being holy, denotes that Divine Love Itself decides
who is in truth and who is in good, 2001, 3755, 9229; and "you take too much upon you, you 
sons of Levi," denotes that the real character of man is determined by his state internally, and 
not by his state externally, wherein he assumes the appearance of charity, 6172, 3875. 

8. Moses saying to Korah, "Hear now, you sons of Levi," denotes that the man of the true church 
perceives from Divine Truth, and by his obedience to that truth, causes the tempters to feel his 
opposition to them, discerning, ver. 9, 7010, 1522, ver. 1, 2542, 3875. 

9.

"Seemeth it but a small thing to you," denotes that it is of the greatest importance to 
understand, as appears from the evident meaning of the words, namely, that it was not a small 
thing, 3946, 8458, 3877; the God of Israel separating the Levites from the congregation, or 
assembly of Israel, denotes that charity and not faith alone is that which distinguishes the man 
of the Spiritual Church particularly, chap 1:49, 50, 3875, 3877; the God of Israel denotes that 
the man of the church contends from Divine Truth against evil, 2001, 4286, 4287; being 
brought near, denotes that charity gives conjunction with the Lord, 3572; to do the service of 
the tabernacle of the Lord, denotes that it is the function of the spiritual man, who is in charity,
to minister to the celestial man, who is in love to the Lord, chap 1:50, 3210, 9946; and 
standing before the congregation, or assembly, to minister to them, denotes that charity, at the 
same time, ministers to the natural man, because, in this case, the assembly in relation to the 
Levites denotes what is external and thus the natural man, 3136, 7843, 51643. And that charity 
is a medium of conjunction may be seen 92753. 

10. By the Lord bringing Korah near, and all his brethren the sons of Levi, denotes that by such 

conjunction the external man is hallowed or sanctified, 3755, 9229, 3875, 7843; and by "seek 
you the priesthood also," is denoted that the spiritual man cannot perform the functions of the 
celestial, ver. 1, 9946. 

11. "Therefore you and all your company are gathered together against the Lord," denotes that the 
corrupted spiritual man with his falsities is in opposition even to Divine Good Itself, ver. 1, 
2001; and "what is Aaron that you murmur against him?" denotes opposition, not simply to 
celestial good, which claims no merit, ver. 1, 9946, 27152, 4007. 

12. Moses sending to call Dathan and Abiram; and their saying, "We will not come up," denotes 
that the Divine Truth investigates the state of the corrupted man, as to external worship, and 
the falsification of truths, which worship and truths are, in their purity, derived from truth 
conjoined with good; but it is the thought of the corrupted man, that he will not submit to 
Divine Truth, 7010, 2397, 3659, ver. 1, 1543. 

13. "Is it a small thing that you have brought us up out of a land flowing with milk and honey?" 
denotes because he regards as all-important the pleasures and delights of the merely natural 
man, 3946, 8458, 1543, 5406, 56203; "to kill us in the wilderness," denotes that he despises 
the instruction and restraint, which the course of regeneration imposes, 4727, 2708; and "but 
you must needs make yourself a prince over us," denotes that he despises the (so-called) 
assumption that the Divine Law is primary in the church, 7010, 48592, 1482. 

229

14. Moses not having brought them into a land flowing with milk and honey, denotes that the 

corrupted man does not believe in the heavenly life of truth and goodness with their delights in
the natural man, 56203; not giving them an inheritance of fields and vineyards, denotes that he 
does not believe in goodness and truth as the real inheritance of man from the Lord, 9139, 
2658; Moses putting out the eyes of those men, denotes that they consider that their own 
intelligence, derived from selfish love, is true intelligence, 7010, 2148, ver. 1; and their not 
being willing to come up, denotes determined opposition to Divine Truth both as to the will 
and understanding, 1543. 

15. Moses being very angry, denotes that the wicked are averted from Divine Truth, 7010, 5034; 
saying to the Lord "Respect not You their offering," denotes that the man of the church, in 
temptation, perceives that they are only in the hypocritical acknowledgement of the Lord, 
7010, 1822, 2001, 9293, 10420; and not taking one ass from them, nor hurting one of them, 
denotes that Divine Truth, in regeneration is not destructive of the natural powers in their 
integrity, and that neither is it disposed to injure the natural affections, 1949, 9055. 

16. Moses saying to Korah, "Be those and all your congregation, or assembly, before the Lord, 

you and they, and Aaron to-morrow," denotes the dictate of Divine Truth, that those who are in
faith alone with its errors, as well as those who are in genuine good, must alike submit 
themselves to Divine Judgement continually, 7010, 1822, ver. 1, 7843, 2001, 9946, 3998. 

17. Taking every man his censer, denotes that every one will, in the Judgement, reveal his true 
character in his outward actions, because, specifically, the censer denotes the external or 
outward life, which is the receptacle and expression of the internal, 51202; putting incense 
upon them, denotes the internal worship expressed in the external, 9475; bringing each man 
his censer, with the incense, before the Lord, denotes that this is effected by the nearer 
presence of the Lord, which discovers the exact quality of each individual, as to the external 
state derived from the internal, 3572, 223, 2001; two hundred and fifty censers, denotes the 
exact quality of every one, whether it be little or much, as to good and truth, 10255; and you 
also and Aaron, each his censer, denotes that this applies especially to the ruling principles as 
to evil or good, ver. 1, 9946. 

18. Taking every man his censer; putting fire in them; laying incense thereon; and standing at the 
door of the tent of meeting with Moses and Aaron, denotes that this also actually takes place in
the intermediate state, where both the wicked and the good are assembled. ver. 17, 934, 3136, 
2356, 2357, 35402, 7010, 9946. 

19. Korah assembling all the congregation against them into the door of the tent of meeting, 

denotes that the wicked, with all their errors, are eager to rely on the spiritual things of the 
church from selfish love, ver. 1, 7843, 2356, 2357, 35403, 7010, 9946; and the glory of the 
Lord appearing to all the congregation, denotes that in the Judgement the power of Divine 
Good and Divine Truth conjoined, becomes manifested to all, 8427. 

20. This is evident, because by Jehovah is denoted the Divine Being as to His love, 2001; by 

speaking is denoted influx, 2951; by Moses is denoted Divine Truth, or the Word, 7010; by 
Aaron is denoted Divine Good, 9946; and by saying is denoted perception, 1822. 

21. "Separate yourselves from among this congregation that I may consume them in a moment," 

denotes that, in the first place, they are about to be overwhelmed in the extremity of 

230

temptation, and to perish from the dominion of evil. This appears by considering that Moses 
and Aaron represent Divine Truth and Divine Good, 7010, 9946; that, with regard to the 
wicked, these are separated from them in the Judgement, or, in other words, that they are 
totally vastated and left to their own life of evil, which is denoted by the Lord consuming them
in a moment, 2438, 10431, 3356; and that with regard to the good, this verse describes the 
extremity of temptation, separating themselves therefore signifying that they can no longer 
endure the presence of evil, and being consumed in a moment, the perception that they are 
about to be overwhelmed by their own evils, 8165. 

22. Moses and Aaron falling upon their faces, denotes a more profound degree of humiliation, 
7010, 9946, 1999; their saying, "O God, the God of the spirits of all flesh," denotes the 
acknowledgement that the Lord governs man by Divine Truth operating first in his spiritual 
degree, which operation shall afterwards manifest itself in his natural degree, 2535, 2001, 
10283; and "shall one man sin, and will you be angry with all the congregation?" denotes that 
although evil in the temptation appears to prevail, in reality it is their natural man which 
appears to be in aversion from the Lord, ver. 1, 7843, 5798. 

23. This is evident, because by Jehovah is denoted the Divine Being as to His love, 2001; by 

speaking is denoted influx, 2951; by Moses is represented Divine Truth, or the Word, 7010; 
and by saying is denoted perception, 1822. 

24. Speaking to the congregation, or assembly, saying, "Get you up from about the tabernacle of 

Korah, Dathan, and Abiram," denotes that their external man is, as the effect of the temptation,
to be entirely separated from evils and falsities, 2951, 3395, 1543, 35403, ver. 1. 

25. Moses rising up, and going to Dathan and Abiram, and the elders of Israel following him, 
denotes that then they feel an elevation as to Divine Truth and Divine Good in themselves 
which clearly manifests the falsity of external worship without internal, and of the profanation 
of truth by evil affections, 7010, 1543, 6524, 3335. 

26. Speaking to the congregation and saying, "Depart, I pray you, from the tents of these wicked 
men, and touch nothing of theirs, lest you be consumed in all their sins," denotes perception 
and thought that the external man as well as the internal is separated from the evils and 
falsities, which cause the temptation, yea, from all contact therewith, by which means the 
wicked are entirely vastated, and the good are delivered, 2951, 3395, 5827, 1566, ver. 1, 
10130, 8165. 

27. Getting up from the tabernacle of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram on every side, denotes that the 
spiritual man, as to both his internal and external powers, is completely delivered from false 
worship, 7843, 1543, 1566, ver. 1, 2973; and Dathan and Abiram coming out, and standing at 
the door of their tents, and their wives and their sons and their little ones, denotes that those 
who are in merely external worship, and in falsities from evil, are made manifest as to their 
true character, and thus as to affections, as to thoughts, and as to the appearance of innocence, 
ver. 1, 9927, 3136, 2356, 1566, 915, 489. 430.

28. Moses saying, "Hereby you shall know that the Lord has sent me to do all these works; for I 
have not done them of mine own mind," denotes that, further, there is now perception from 
Divine Truth, even in the external man, thus separated, that there shall be testification with 

231

them that all salvation and purification are from the Lord, and not at all from man himself, 
7010, 1822, 7843, 2230, 2001, 6996, 63, 8329. 

29. "If these men die the common death of all men; or if they be visited after the visitation of all 
men, then the Lord has not spoken by me," denotes that if those who have perverted the good 
of the church, and falsified its truths deliberately, are saved of themselves, by giving up the life
of evil and falsity, in the Judgement, because the Lord has provided that all may be saved who 
are willing, then indeed is Divine Truth, or the Word, not a revelation from Divine Good as a 
means of salvation, ver. 1, 1408, 6588, 7010, 2001. 

30. By the Lord making a new thing, or creating a creation, is denoted that if, on the other hand, it 
is already manifested from Divine Good, through the revelation of truths not before known, 
10373; by the ground opening her mouth, and swallowing them up with all that appertain to 
them, is denoted that by confirmation in the life of evil the corrupted man is given up to all the
falsities proceeding therefrom, both as to the internal and external of his life, 8306; by going 
down alive into the pit, or into Sheol, is denoted that he is then delighted with nothing more 
than his own evil by which he is condemned to hell, 8306, 695; and by understanding that 
these men have despised the Lord, is denoted that then it will be seen that evil was chosen 
deliberately, 2230, 1608, 2001. 

31. It coming to pass, denotes a change or somewhat new, 4979; Moses making an end of 

speaking all these words, clearly denotes according to Divine Truth, 7010, 1288, and the 
ground cleaving to pieces that was under them, denotes that, in the Judgement, all the outward 
professions on which the corrupted man relies, are taken away from him, 8306, 566, 990, 
8184, 4564. 

32. The earth opening her mouth and swallowing them up, and their households, and all that 

appertained to Korah, and all their goods, denotes that he is overwhelmed in his own merely 
natural delights, thereby condemning himself to hell, and this completely as to every faculty of
the will, and every power of the understanding, 8306, ver. 1, 3128, 7120, 1717. 

33. They and all that appertained to them going down alive into the pit, or into Sheol, the earth 
closing over them, and their perishing from among the assembly, denotes that thus the 
corrupted man enters into his eternal condition of life in the hells; his external man is made 
one with his internal; and he is no longer in the intermediate state, in which regeneration alone
is possible by means of truths, 8306, 695, 2576, 913, 7655, 7843. 

34. All Israel round about them fleeing at the cry of them; and saying, "lest the earth swallow us 
up," denotes that the man of the church who is in temptations, is delivered by the Lord from 
the infestations of the wicked, because he perceives that the confirmation of what is of the 
spiritual man by the natural man, when it is falsity conjoined with evil, is spiritual death, 3654,
2973, 7563, 2240, 1822, 8306, ver. 32. 

35. Fire coming forth from the Lord and devouring the two hundred and fifty men that offered 

incense, denotes that the Divine Love, in the heart of the regenerated member of the church, 
entirely overcomes all tendency to profane worship by making it external only, 934. 5149, ver. 
2. 

232

36. This is evident, because by Jehovah is denoted the Divine Being as to His love, 2001; by 

speaking is denoted influx, 2951; by Moses is represented Divine Truth, or the Word, 7010: 
and by saying is denoted perception, 1822. 

37. Speaking to Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, that he take up the censers out of the burning, 

and scatter you the fire yonder; for they are holy, denotes perception to the men of the 
Spiritual Church, derived from the Celestial, through orderly influx, that the externals of 
worship, considered in themselves, are to be elevated and preserved; and that the profane love 
which perverts them is at the same time to be rejected, because external worship is the proper 
receptacle of what is internal, and is, therefore, holy, 2951, 10017, 9812, 3613, 9475, 5120, 
1309, 934, 9956. 

38. "Even the censers of these sinners against their own lives," denotes even that external worship 
which is merely representative of what is internal, the abuse of which causes spiritual death, 
because external worship separated from internal may represent true worship, but is not the 
expression of it, 9475, 5120, and because such external worship is like a dead body without 
spiritual life, 1000, and is therefore sinful, Isaiah 1:4, 11, 12, 622; "and let them be made 
beaten plates for a covering of the altar," denotes that all external worship ought to be the 
ultimate form of true internal worship, because what is beaten, or spread out, denotes the 
adaptation of the external man as a receptacle of the regenerated internal by Divine power, 
8043 on Isaiah 44:24; the plates denote such a receptacle as corresponds to, and therefore 
adequately manifests the internal, 9930, 9932; at the same time, the plate as a covering, 
denotes that which veils interior good and truth, and also conceals from man, during 
regeneration the full depravity and dangers of the merely selfish life, as one meaning of the 
Hebrew word for plate here used, shows, 2576; and the altar denotes the true worship of the 
Lord, 4541; "for they offered them before the Lord, therefore they are holy," denotes that, with
the wicked, Externals, without corresponding Internals, are at least an outward 
acknowledgement of the Lord in worship, and are, on that account, holy, 9293; and "they shall 
be a sign to the children of Israel," denotes that, to the man of the church, they are useful as 
guides and as incentives to internal worship, 2037, 3654. 

39. Eleazar the priest taking the brazen censers, which they that were burnt had offered; and their 

being beaten out for a covering of the altar, denotes that, therefore, also the man of the 
Spiritual Church devoutly engages in external worship from natural good, even as, apparently, 
does he who is in selfish love internally, and is at length consumed by it; and thus external 
worship becomes truly the expression of that which is internal, 10017, 9812, 9475, 5120, 425, 
9293, ver. 38. 

40. Being a memorial to the children of Israel, denotes a token to the man of the church in all its 
states, 6888, 3654; no stranger, not of the seed of Aaron coming near to burn incense before 
the Lord, denotes that no affection which is not derived from celestial good constitutes true 
spiritual worship, 1097, 10249, 3572, 9475, 10579; not being as Korah and his company, 
denotes rejection lest man should come into the profanation of good and truth, ver. 2; and "as 
the Lord commanded him by the hand of Moses," denotes that this is the dictate of Divine 
Truth from Divine Good, 2001, 5486, 878, 7010. 

41. On the morrow all the congregation, or rather assembly, of the children of Israel murmuring 
against Moses and against Aaron saying, "You have killed the people of the Lord," denotes 
that, for the time being, the man of the church, who is in Externals, is opposed to Divine Truth 

233

and Divine Good, which constitutes the internal church, being persuaded that outward 
worship, for the sake of self only, is true worship from Divine Good, 10497, 7843, 3654, 8351,
7010, 9946, 3387, 1259, 2001. 

42. It coming to pass, denotes a change, or somewhat new, 4979; all the congregation assembled 
against Moses and against Aaron, denotes in such a state, ver. 41; and looking toward the tent 
of meeting, and behold the cloud covering it, and the glory of the Lord appearing, denotes the 
perception that there is, in temptation, a nearer approach of the Lord through the Word in its 
literal or spiritual sense, 2150, 59226, 35403. 

43. Moses and Aaron coming to the front of the tent of meeting, denotes that Divine. Truth and 

Divine Good are manifested, 7010, 9946, 3572. 

44. This is evident, because by Jehovah is denoted the Divine Being as to His love, 2001; by 

speaking is denoted influx, 2951; by Moses is represented Divine Truth, or the Word, 7010; 
and by saying is denoted perception, 1822. 

45. "Get you up from among this congregation," or assembly, "that I may consume them in a 

moment"; and their falling upon their faces, denotes that a state of external worship without 
internal, when persisted in, causes the separation of interior good and truth; and will result in 
the destruction of internal worship, unless there be repentance and humiliation, 1543, 7843, 
10431, 1999. 

46. Moses saying to Aaron, denotes a dictate of Divine Truth to the man of the church who is in 

good, 7010, 1822, 9946; taking the censer, putting fire therein, and laying incense thereon, 
denotes that external worship must be combined with real worship from love and from truth 
from the Lord, 9475, 5120, 934; carrying the censer quickly to the congregation, and making 
atonement for them, denotes that this must certainly be done zealously by the natural man, in 
order that the evil of mere external worship may be removed, 9475, 5120, 7843, 10042, 9946; 
and wrath going out from the Lord and the plague beginning, denotes that, otherwise, man is 
averted from the Lord and remains are destroyed, 5034, 5798, 10219. 

47. Aaron taking as Moses spoke, and running into the midst of the assembly, or rather 

congregation, denotes that the man of the internal church recognizes the truth of all this, being 
in good, and eagerly endeavours to make his external worship harmonious with his internal, 
9946, 7010, 2951, 3131, 7843; the plague being begun among the people, denotes the 
perception that merely outward devotion is destructive of remains, 10019, 1259; and putting 
on incense and making atonement for the people, denotes that, therefore, it must be 
continually removed by the Lord, 9475, 5120, 10042, 9946. 

48. Aaron standing between the dead and the living, and the plague being stayed, denotes that 

when the man of the church earnestly separates from himself all selfish motives in worship, 
and is zealous to worship the Lord from genuine truth and good, then are remains preserved 
with him, 9946, 3136, 81, 10219. 

49. They that died of the plague being fourteen thousand and seven hundred besides those that 
died about the matter of Korah, denotes that there must be the destruction of remains when 
man totally profanes the good and truth of the church, as well as when he makes outward 
devotion the all of worship, 81, 10219, 4177, 8400, vers. 32, 33. 

234

50. Aaron returning to Moses to the door of the tent of meeting and the plague being stayed, 

denotes that when good is conjoined with truth internally, and there is also full 
acknowledgement of the Lord externally, then is the worship of the Lord perfect, and remains 
are no longer destroyed, 9946, 7010, 2356, 35403, 10219. 

DISCUSSION

In commencing our commentary on this chapter, it will be useful to observe how the meaning of the 
four names, Levi, Kohath, Izhar and Korah, gives their correspondence and thence their spiritual 
signification. Levi was named from cleaving to, or adhering, and therefore signifies love or charity, by 
which only there is conjunction with the Lord, and between one person and another; Kohath means 
congregation, or assembly, and therefore he signifies the truth that is conjoined with love, or charity, 
being first derived from it, as a son from a father; and hence Levi and Kohath, in the best sense, clearly 
represent internal good and truth, or the celestial and spiritual principles in man respectively. Again, 
Izhar means fine olive oil, and therefore, in the highest sense, denotes celestial love, but in this case, 
because he was the son of Kohath, external or natural good derived from spiritual truth, or what is often
called the good of truth; and Korah means bald, frozen, icy, and therefore signifies the absence of the 
truth and good denoted by the hair of the head, and by warmth, but as the son of Izhar, truth without 
good, or what is the same, faith without charity, or faith alone, as it is commonly called.

Hence, then, we see that it is not a mere supposition, or assumption that Korah and his supporters, in 
rebellion against Moses and Aaron, represent that state of the church in general, or of an individual in 
particular, in which faith without charity prevails, and consequently, in which there is no true love to 
the Lord and the neighbour, which properly constitutes genuine worship. And it is here to be noted, 
therefore, that Korah and his company represent a degraded state of the church, because there could not
be a state of faith without charity otherwise; and that, therefore, also they represent the degraded state 
of the Christian Church, which the Lord foretold, when He was in the world, and of which He said, "the
love of many shall wax cold" (Matt 24:12), and "when the Son of Man comes, shall He find faith on the
earth" (Luke 18:8). But these prophecies have now actually been fulfilled. For not only has the 
Christian Church of the past been degraded and corrupted by the prevailing love of dominion and 
ecclesiastical supremacy on the one hand, but also by the prevailing doctrine of salvation by faith alone
on the other. And as this is a matter of true history at the present time, therefore it may justly be 
concluded that the present age is the age of the Lord's second advent, as taught in the doctrine of the 
New Church (HH 1; TCR 779), and as confirmed by the revelation of the internal sense of the Word. 
And that is why it is now possible to show clearly, that in our chapter, we have so wonderful and so 
striking a description of the evil consequences that must follow, in the case of all those who think that 
they can be saved by faith in the doctrines of the church only, without having lived according to the 
Lord's commandments. For it is written, "Not every one that says to me Lord, Lord, shall enter into the 
kingdom of heaven; but he that does the will of my Father which is in heaven" (Matt. vii. 21). And here
it is only necessary to add that, as may be seen in the explanation in giving the references, the meanings
of all the other names given in these introductory sentences are equally significant; and how especially 
remarkable it is, that persons of the tribe of Reuben, who signifies faith in the understanding, should 
have been the leaders with Korah in claiming an equal right with Moses and Aaron to assume the 
function of lawgivers and of the priesthood.

But the next section shows, to begin with, that we are all tempted, more or less, to rest in faith alone; 
and continues by showing how it is to be resisted. And we see from ver. 4, that a state of humility is the 

235

first essential of safety; and that the second is dependence upon the Lord for a state of illustration. "In 
the morning the Lord will show who are His and who is holy." Moreover, we may notice here also, the 
repetition in the latter part of the following verse, involving the proper use of both the intellect and the 
heart, or will, in those who truly worship the Lord, holiness here having relation to the former, and the 
Lord's choosing to the latter. And then a profound truth follows. For those in faith alone are allowed for
a long time, which is involved in the expression, "to-morrow," to assume the appearance of being a 
genuine church, and of apparently saving many souls. And this occurs for two reasons: first, because it 
is good that men should be induced, in certain states, to reform themselves, even by means of doctrine, 
having the appearance of the truth, apparently supported by the Word, and seeming to result in an 
orderly life; and, secondly, because, in similar states, such persons cannot apprehend the genuine truths 
of the Word in its literal sense.

But those who are interiorly enlightened perceive and condemn the presumptions of the wicked, who 
are in faith alone; affirm also that were they even in faith from charity, internally, as well as externally 
and in appearance only, they could not perform the functions of the celestial, denoted by the priesthood;
and condemn them for separating truth from good, or faith from love, signified by Korah and his 
company murmuring against Aaron.

This, however, is not all. For those who are interiorly enlightened, and are here represented by Moses, 
also scrutinize and condemn those whose worship consists in mere ceremonies, denoted by Dathan, and
those who wickedly falsify the truth, signified by Abiram; but these are persistent in their externalism; 
prefer the delights of the merely natural man; and suppose that they would actually lose all enjoyment 
of life in the obscurity of their state of instruction and restraint, signified by being killed in the 
wilderness. And thus they are averted from Divine Truth, while the man of the true church in his 
temptation is led to see their hypocrisy, and recognizes that a truly religious life does not deprive man 
of legitimate natural delights, but on the contrary sanctifies them. But the concluding part of the section
is indeed very impressive, since it shows that, in the Judgement about to take place, evil and error, and 
merely external worship will be fully exposed and separated; and that the good will realize their own 
heavenly life, and be established in the interior truths of the Word, which is appropriately represented 
by the glory of the Lord appearing.

And now it follows, in the third section, as a preliminary experience to the good, that it seems to them 
in their extremity, that they are about to perish, which is represented by the determination of the Lord to
destroy the whole congregation, while the same statement involves that the wicked will in reality be 
entirely vastated; for the word here translated "congregation," should really be rendered "assembly," 
and therefore it denotes, on the one hand, the good, and on the other hand, the wicked, as to the state of 
their wills, and it is the state of the will and not the state of the understanding that decides in the 
Judgement. Moreover, it appears clearly from what follows, that, in this verse, the assembly is only 
assumed to be in evil, while yet it was not so, it only denoting, as far as the good are concerned, the 
state of their external man in the temptation; and this is the reason why they were afterwards separated 
from Korah and his company as well as Moses and Aaron, this finely representing the result of the 
temptation, namely, that the external man is more closely conjoined, and thus harmonized, with the 
internal (ver. 27). But again, there is another very interesting thing arising from ver. 22. In the first 
instance, it was Moses only who fell upon his face (ver. 4); but here it is both Moses and Aaron, and 
this is why a greater degree of humiliation is denoted. For temptations reveal more and more to the 
spiritual man, that, of himself, he is nothing but evil, and that, from the Lord, he receives all good 
continually. And therefore he now acknowledges that it is the internal man that sins, or that consents to 
the promptings of evil spirits through his external man, and therefore that the natural man is not the real

236

culprit. For the internal man must decide whether the natural man is to be governed by selfishness or by
the Lord; and when, as here described, he confesses his sin, acknowledging his dependence on the Lord
only, then, as it is said, although evil in the temptation appears to prevail, yet it is the Lord by Divine 
truth and good that really does so, and the natural man is now only apparently in aversion, as is 
signified by the Lord being angry with the whole congregation, or rather assembly; by the instruction 
given to them; and by their separating themselves, accordingly. And now, therefore, what a grand 
experience it is, when we are thus victorious by the Lord's help; when we can perceive that our natural 
man is becoming not only submissive but harmonious; and when we can truly from the heart both see 
and feel that we are realizing the Lord's life of genuine love and charity by the renunciation of our own 
selfish life!

The fourth section next demands our attention, as it contains important teaching in its internal sense. 
We all can remember the saying of Paul, "I die daily," and can see what he means. He was continually 
giving up the life of selfishness. This, then, is what is meant by dying the common death of all men. 
For no man can be regenerated without dying this death; and that this life is to be entirely given up, or 
in other words, that this death is to be finally endured in the Judgement, appears from the signification 
of the visitation of all men. "It is appointed to all men once to die, and after this comes the Judgement" 
(Heb 9:27). See the reference, 6588 and also 10509. We must die physically, and also by giving up the 
selfish life in the Judgement. Hence, then, we see what is meant spiritually by dying the common death 
of all men; and, moreover, it is called common, because any one who chooses may thus die and thus be 
regenerated; and then when the Judgement comes he will be prepared for heaven.

But now what is the new thing described in ver. 30? Is it to be entirely overwhelmed and given up to 
the merely natural life, which is to go down alive into the pit, or into Sheol? By no means. For this is 
what has always happened to the wicked who confirmed themselves in their wickedness. But the real 
character of what is meant by the condemnation of the wicked to hell for their wickedness, has not 
always been known; and therefore, when it does become known by a revelation of Divine Truth, 
generally, in the consummation of the age, or specifically to each individual who by Judgement is 
condemned, and to the good who witness the condemnation, then it is called a new thing. And hence, 
therefore, the interpretation given of vers. 30-35, according to the correspondences of the various terms
as they occur. But also the interpretation of the last verse of the section requires a few words of 
comment. For we must consider why the two hundred and fifty men who offered the incense received a
punishment different from that of the rest? Those men, be it here observed, had a double representation.
As associated with Korah, they denoted those in faith alone who perverted the primary doctrines of the 
church, falsifying them in order to confirm themselves in the selfish life, and in the persuasion that they
could live that life, and yet be saved. Thus they represented evil and falsity confirmed internally, while 
the rest signified the same confirmed externally, so that correspondentially, the latter were swallowed 
up by the earth, while the former were consumed by fire, because they denote such as are more deeply 
immersed in selfish love than the rest. On the other hand, however, these princes represented the 
primary doctrines of the church among the good who having overcome in their temptation, separated 
themselves from a perverted worship, the consequence being that, in them, these doctrines, or truths, 
were conjoined with good; for this also is signified by fire coming forth from the Lord and consuming 
those princes. But see for illustration 1 Kings 18:38. 

And this consideration naturally prepares us for understanding our last sections, which are certainly not
without interest to us as the conclusion of the account. For the preservation of the censers of those who 
offered the incense conveys the very important lesson that external worship is always to be preserved, 
while all selfish motives by which it may be influenced are to be continually rejected. And is it not 

237

indeed a fact which every one may verify for himself, that men do engage, even in the worship of the 
Lord, often from selfish and worldly motives? Yea, do we not know that even persons in the process of 
regeneration may do this while yet internally they do mean when they do any good work, or attend the 
services of the sanctuary, that they are willing to thus worship the Lord truly. And these thoughts may 
lead us to the reflection as to the reason why Eleazar the son of Aaron was instructed to collect the 
censers and preserve them. It was to denote that it is the function of the spiritual man rather than of the 
celestial, or of the understanding rather than of the will, to guide the affections and to elevate the 
thoughts in the performance of uses, or in seasons of devotion, so that the worship of the Lord therein 
may not be perverted, or profaned by the mixture therewith of inferior motives. And then the 
symbolism that the censers should be made into plates as a covering of the altar, is very suggestive that 
all external acts ought not only to be the expression of true internal motives, but also their defence and 
protection. For who does not know very well from experience that good motives, either in work or in 
worship, will quickly pass away if they are not thus adequately expressed and represented in words and
in actions?

And well, therefore, is it said further in connection with this work that it should be for a memorial that 
there is no true worship at all, and no true usefulness at all, which has not good for its motive, and truth
as its means, or in other words, that love to the Lord, love to the neighbour, and the love of uses thence 
alone constitute the real worship of the Lord. Let us mark well the teaching that immediately follows. 
And this, first of all, is that, notwithstanding a person may well know, that his inward motive should be 
the love of the Lord and the neighbour, yet external motives for doing good and for worshiping the 
Lord may, for a time, prevail. And therefore it happens that there must of necessity be more revelation, 
and additional conflict, until the man of the church is convinced that external worship must be 
combined with real internal worship, in order that the evil of merely external worship may be removed.
For these certainly involve the destruction of all heavenly principles internally. And now, therefore, we 
see that the external man must finally be brought into perfect harmony with the internal, and that this is 
represented most appropriately by Aaron making atonement for the people. For true atonement is 
nothing else but the reconciliation of man with the Lord, by the Lord (2 Cor 5:19), and the 
reconciliation of the external man with the internal, by the internal from the Lord. But, on the other 
hand, let it here be noted also that persistence in merely the selfish worship of the Lord, in a state of 
faith without charity, represented by the rebellion of Korah, involves also the profanation of the truth 
and the total destruction of remains; and that, therefore, the man of the church should never rest in the 
great conflict of life, until good is conjoined with truth in himself, both externally and internally, as 
represented by Aaron returning to Moses at the door of the tent of meeting.

Numbers Chapter 17

SUMMARY OF THE SPIRITUAL SENSE

1. Revelation is made, that the power of truth is manifested according to the good from which it 
proceeds; that the quality of celestial love is manifested in celestial truth, and that of spiritual 
love in spiritual truth; that all truths are derived from Divine Good; that truth conjoined with 
good is powerful in good works; and that he who is in this state is no longer in temptation, 
vers. 1-6. 

2. Again: all truths are acknowledged to be from the Lord through the celestial heavens; and 
hence when man enters into interior states through the reception of good, his truths are 
conjoined with good, and particularly is celestial good conjoined with its truth, thereby 
producing the fructification of good and truth, in successive degrees, in all the heavens; and 
hence it is made manifest that every one has truths in their power, according to his good from 
the Lord, vers. 7-9. 

3. And revelation is therefore made that celestial truth from celestial good is inmost truth, in 

which is all power to govern lower truths; and the spiritual man thence confesses that, from 
himself he is without good and without truth; and that he who, from himself, presumes to 
approach the Lord in worship, must inevitably suffer spiritual death, vers. 10-13. 

THE CONTENTS OF EACH VERSE

1. And the LORD spoke to Moses, 

1. There is revelation from the Lord by Divine Truth 

saying, 

giving the perception, 

2. Speak to the children of Israel, and 
take of them rods, one for each 
fathers' house, of all their princes 
according to their fathers' houses, 
twelve rods: write you every man's 
name upon his rod. 

2. By influx with the man of the church, that the 

power of truth is manifested according to the good 
from which it proceeds, or in other words, 
according to the ruling love in societies and 
individuals; and according to the primary truths 
derived from that love in all completeness, the 
quality of the good of every one being known and 
confirmed by his. truths. 

3. And you shall write Aaron's name 

3. And thus that the quality of celestial love is 

upon the rod of Levi: for there shall 
be one rod for each head of their 
fathers' houses. 

manifested in celestial truth, and consequently the 
quality of spiritual love in spiritual truth, love 
itself having no power and no quality except by 
means of truths in every particular case. 

239

4. And you shall lay them up in the tent
of meeting before the testimony, 
where I meet with you. 

4.

It is to be acknowledged also that all truths in 
general and in particular are derived from Divine 
Good, which by truths forms and distinguishes the 
heavens, and thus in particular the inmost heaven 
through which is revelation from the Lord. 

5. And it shall come to pass, that the 
man whom I shall choose, his rod 
shall bud: and I will make to cease 
from me the murmurings of the 
children of Israel, which they 
murmur against you. 

6. And Moses spoke to the children of 
Israel, and all their princes gave him 
rods, for each prince one, according 
to their fathers' houses, even twelve 
rods: and the rod of Aaron was 
among their rods. 

5. So that it is of the Divine Providence that truth 

conjoined with good is powerful to produce good 
works; and that he who is in this state is no longer 
in temptations, nor does he oppose Divine Truth 
from the love of power derived from selfish love. 

6. And so by the influence of Divine Truth in 

general, the external man is moved to action, and, 
through the primary truths of faith acknowledges 
the supremacy of that truth, and that from it 
particular truths have power from the particular 
good to which they give a quality, and this in all 
completeness, the power of truth from celestial 
good being particularly distinguished. 

7. And Moses laid up the rods before 

7. And all truths are thus acknowledged to be from 

the LORD in the tent of the testimony.

8. And it came to pass on the morrow, 
that Moses went into the tent of the 
testimony; and, behold, the rod of 
Aaron for the house of Levi was 
budded, and put forth buds, and 
bloomed blossoms, and bare ripe 
almonds. 

the Lord through the celestial heavens, where good
is intimately conjoined with truth and is in the 
greatest power in consequence. 

8. And hence it happens continually that when man 
enters into interior states through the reception of 
good, his truths are conjoined with good, and 
particularly in celestial good conjoined with its 
truth, thereby producing the fructification of good 
and truth in successive degrees in all the heavens. 

9. And Moses brought out all the rods 
from before the LORD to all the 
children of Israel: and they looked, 
and took every man his rod. 

9. And thence it is made manifest by Divine Truth 

that every one has truths in their power according 
to his good from the Lord; and that every one, as 
from himself, understands and practises truths. 

240

10. And the LORD said to Moses, Put 
back the rod of Aaron before the 
testimony, to be kept for a token 
against the children of rebellion; that
you may make an end of their 
murmurings against me, that they die
not. 

10. And revelation is therefore made from the Lord by
Divine Truth that celestial truth from celestial 
good is inmost truth in which is all power to 
govern lower truths; that there is no power in 
truths profaned from selfish love; and thus that 
temptations must cease with the spiritual man, 
when he is fully governed by truths conjoined with
good and made fruitful in good works. Nor can 
persons in such a state ever be overwhelmed with 
evil and error. 

11. Thus did Moses: as the LORD 

commanded him, so did he. 

11. And all this is from Divine Truth, which is the 
governing power with man from the Lord. 

12. And the children of Israel spoke to 
Moses, saying, Behold, we perish, 
we are undone, we are all undone. 

12. And the spiritual man now confesses that from 
himself he is without good and without truth in 
every degree of his life. 

13. Every one that comes near, that 

13. And that he who, from himself, presumes to 

comes near to the tabernacle of the 
LORD, dies: shall we perish all of us?

approach the Lord in worship, must inevitably 
suffer spiritual death.

that the quality of the good of every one is known, and confirmed by his truths, 9386, 145, 
4876. 

3. Writing Aaron's name upon the rod of Levi, denotes that the quality of celestial love is 

manifested in celestial truth, and consequently the quality of spiritual love in spiritual truth, 
4876, 9946, 3875, 145; and there being one rod for each of their fathers' houses denotes that 
love itself has no power except by means of truths in every particular case, 457, 551, 4876, 
7833, 385811. 

4. Laying up the rods in the tent of meeting, before the testimony "where I meet with you," 
denotes that it is to be acknowledged, also, that all truths in general and in particular are 
derived from Divine Good, which by Divine Truths forms and distinguishes the heavens, and 
thus, in particular, the inmost heaven through which is revelation from the Lord, 6725, 10227, 
35403, 9503, 10147. 

241

5.

"It shall come to pass," said by the Lord, evidently denotes what happens of the Divine 
Providence, 4979; the rod of the man whom the Lord should choose, budding, denotes that 
truth conjoined with good is powerful to produce good works, 158, 2001, 4876, 39004, 9553, 
1873; and the Lord making to cease the murmurings of the children of Israel, which they 
murmured against Moses, denotes that he who is in this state is no longer in temptations, nor 
does he oppose Divine Truth from the love of power derived from selfish love, 2001, 7597, 
8351, 7010. 

6. Moses speaking to the children of Israel, denotes the influence of Divine Truth in general, 

2951, 3654; all their princes giving him rods, for each prince one according to their fathers' 
houses, even twelve rods, denotes that the external man is moved to action, and through the 
primary truths of faith acknowledges the supremacy of that truth, 1482, 10227, 4876, 7833, 
457, 551, 38582; and Aaron's rod being among their rods denotes that from Divine Truth in 
general particular truths have power from the particular good to which they give a quality, and 
this in all completeness, the power of truth from celestial good being particularly 
distinguished, 9946, 38582, 385811. 

7. Moses laying up the rods in the tent of the testimony, denotes that all truths are thus 

acknowledged to be from the Lord through the celestial heavens, where good is intimately 
conjoined with truth, and is in the greatest power in consequence, 7010, 6725, 10227, 35403. 
9503. 4876, 223, 2001. 

8.

It coming to pass on the morrow, denotes that hence it happens continually, 4979, 3998; Moses
going into the tent of testimony denotes man entering into interior states through the reception 
of good, 3335, 9503; and the rod of Aaron for the house of Levi, having budded and put forth 
buds, having bloomed blossoms, and having borne ripe almonds, denotes that his truths are 
conjoined with good; and particularly, that celestial good is conjoined with its truth, thereby 
producing the fructification of good and truth in successive degrees in all the heavens, 4876, 
9946, 7833, 3875, 9553, 5622. 

9. Moses bringing out all the rods from before the Lord to all the children of Israel, denotes that 
it is made manifest by Divine Truth that every one has truths in their power, according to his 
good from the Lord, 7010, 1806, 4876, 2001, 3654; and their looking and taking every man 
his rod denotes that every one, as from himself, understands and practises truths, 2150, 6744, 
4876,

10. The Lord saying to Moses, denotes that revelation is therefore made from the Lord by Divine 

Truth, 2001, 7010; putting back the rod of Aaron before the testimony, denotes that celestial 
truth from celestial good is inmost truth, 4876, 9946, 9503; to be kept for a token against the 
children of rebellion, denotes that there is no power in truths profaned from selfish love, 3382,
2037, chap 16:2; making an end of their murmuring against me, denotes that temptations must 
cease with the spiritual man, when he is fully governed by truths conjoined with good and 
made fruitful in good works, 7597, 8351, 2001, ver. 8; and "that they die not," denotes that 
persons in such a state can never be overwhelmed with evil and error, 6119. 

11. Thus Moses doing; as the Lord commanded him so did he, denotes that all this is from Divine 
Truth, which is the governing power with man from the Lord, 7010, 5755, 5486, 5264. Thus, 

242

then, willing, thinking, and acting, with man, are here shown to be from the Lord by Divine 
Truth.

12. The children of Israel speaking to Moses, saying, "Behold, we perish, we are undone, we are 
all undone," denotes that the spiritual man now confesses that, from himself, he is without 
good and without truth in every degree of his life. This appears from the words themselves, 
which express humility as to the will, as to-the understanding, and as to the actions, 2908. This
is the result of victory in temptation with those who are in good from the Lord, 868. 

13. "Every one that comes near, that comes near to the tabernacle of the Lord, dies; and we perish 
all of us?" denotes that he who, from himself, presumes to approach the Lord in worship, must
inevitably suffer spiritual death, 3572, 3210, 2908. 

DISCUSSION

It is evident that the contents of this chapter, in the internal sense, are the conclusion of the subject of 
the last, and that they are intended to teach the universal truth that a state of good and truth conjoined is
that in which the heavenly life consists, and in which all temptation ceases. We may therefore 
profitably study the particulars here set forth.

Good and truth, or, what is the same thing, charity, or love and faith, are the two universal principles in 
the life of man from the Lord, so that it may be very properly said, that there is not a single thing in 
human nature which does not partake of these two, and not a single thing in the whole of creation 
which is not an image or likeness of some form of love and intelligence in man, from the Divine Love 
and Wisdom of the Lord. And as Love and Wisdom, self-existent, evidently constitute the Lord, and 
man is created and regenerated into the image and likeness of the Lord, it follows that the Lord is the 
infinitely glorious and Divine man, while human beings are perfect men just in proportion as they 
become perfect heavenly forms of love and wisdom or of good and truth.

Now, it is just this conjunction of affection and intelligence in man in equal proportions, with all 
variety, in each individual, that is represented in our chapter by the twelve rods, namely, one for each of
the tribes of Israel; and the thought, therefore, that comes first in the instruction here given is that the 
rod or staff is representative of the embodiment of good in truth, so that truth is nothing else but the 
form of good, just exactly as the Divine Wisdom is the form of the Divine Love, and as, therefore, the 
Only Begotten Son (John 1:18), is the form or outward appearance, or body, of the Divine Being. Thus,
then, it is absolutely true that in Jesus Christ our Lord dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily 
(Col 2:9), and that He is the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit in one person. And, in the highest 
sense, indeed, this is the rod of Aaron for the tribe of Levi; while, in the lower sense, each of the other 
rods, as well as the rod of Aaron, is the symbol of the fully regenerated man, of whom, 
notwithstanding, no two can ever be alike to eternity, because the Infinite Lord, in creating, or in 
regenerating man, cannot repeat Himself. And now, in conclusion on this point, we also see that it is 
confirmed and established by the statement that every one's name was to be written on his rod. The 
genuine character, therefore, of a good man is to be known from the kind of truth with which he is 
delighted.

But it is next to be observed that all the rods were required to be laid up in the tent of meeting before 
the testimony, that is, before the ark, which contained the two tables of stone, upon which were written 
the ten commandments, that being the place where the Lord met the Israelites. And here we see that 

243

more than one great and practical truth is involved. For, first of all, every man is bound to acknowledge
not only that all truth is from good, but that all good is from the Lord, as is denoted by the laying up of 
these rods. And, secondly, we here learn that Divine Good forms and distinguishes the heavens by 
Divine Truths; for the tent of meeting, as we have seen, is representative of all the heavens; in 
particular of the three heavens, the most holy place signifying the inmost heaven, the holy place 
denoting the middle heaven, and the courts standing for the ultimate heaven; while the tables of stone, 
with the writing upon them, symbolize all the Divine Truths proceeding from the Divine Good, and 
distinguishing the heavens with their innumerable societies. And thus, then, every society in the 
heavens, and every individual there, is particularly in the acknowledgement of the Lord, and that 
revelation is continually from Him, since this is what is meant by the words, "where I meet with you."

And, thirdly, our first section also conveys the most impressive teaching, that whereas truth conjoined 
with good inmostly is really productive of all forms of usefulness in heaven and upon earth, which is 
denoted by the rod of the man whom the Lord should choose budding, therefore it is the duty and the 
privilege of every regenerated man to love usefulness, and to practise it continually for its own sake.

And in the second section, therefore, it is not surprising that the truths of the first are intensified; for 
this must happen when man enters, as here correspondentially described by Moses actually laying, up 
the rods as directed, into interior states. For it is well known that regeneration is progressive from 
externals, and that when this takes place there must be an intensification of love and faith. But we have 
here properly to consider how man passes from an external state to a corresponding internal state; and 
this cannot be better illustrated than by referring to the manner in which the ascent from the lower side-
chambers to those above was made in the temple of Solomon. It it said in 1 Kings 6:8, that "the door of 
the middle chamber was in the right side of the house; and they went up by winding stairs into the 
middle chambers, and out of the middle into the third." And this, spiritually interpreted, is that "the 
entrance to a higher degree of life is by faith conjoined with charity, the ascent from the lower degree to
the middle and from the middle to the highest being made by the truths of the Word expressed in the 
actions of the life and united with love." For the first step, so to speak, in spiritual progress is to 
become acquainted with the truths of the Word; the second is to properly understand them; the third is 
to practise them; the fourth is to have the life elevated by so doing from a natural to a spiritual, state as 
to the understanding by its affection for truth; the fifth is to make this of the life by obedience from that
affection; the sixth is in this way to ascend one step further by being initiated into the affection for 
good; and the seventh is to confirm that affection by uniting truth with it by persistent and continual 
action, in the performance of uses without any selfish motive. And, of course, this progress is said to be
by winding stairs, because it involves a continual turning from evil to good on the plane of life in which
we are, and, at the same time, a continual elevation of state, from simple obedience in the natural life to
begin with, through obedience from spiritual motives in a higher degree, to obedience from celestial 
love in the highest degree. But another mode of explaining this may be seen in The Two Books of Kings
Explained, p. 82.

And now we may, further, very profitably take notice how the rest of this section, in the internal sense, 
illustrates what has just been said. For by what was done on the morrow is clearly represented what is 
successive or continuous in regeneration; and by the rod of Aaron budding, and blossoming, and 
bearing ripe almonds, is clearly denoted that truths are conjoined with good first in the understanding, 
and afterwards in the will, thence producing a mature state of obedience from pure love, a clear 
comprehension of what real spiritual and celestial life are, and a joyful acknowledgement tat this is the 
work of the Lord operating in the inmost of man's life, and extending itself to every plane and in every 

244

direction, all this being denoted by Moses bringing out the rods, by all the Israelites looking, and by 
each taking his rod.

But, proceeding to the last section, we have to reflect on what is meant spiritually by the rod of Aaron 
being put back before the testimony to be kept for a token against the children of rebellion. In what way
can we personally fulfill this command? We can only do it by acknowledging with all our hearts that all
power to worship the Lord by loving Him is from the Lord by means of the Word. For the Lord is the 
source of all power; and we continually receive power from Him through the celestial heavens, or, what
is the same thing, through celestial love, by means of celestial truth, to do anything that is good. But, 
again, the power of this truth is to be for a token against the children of rebellion. That is, it is to testify 
that when the subordinate truths of the Word are used for selfish purposes there is no power in them. 
And this happens because all power is from good by truth as a means, or from love by faith as a means;
and therefore it is clear that there is no power in faith alone to overcome our evil dispositions, any more
than there is power in our hands to raise themselves and to act without an effort of the will, guided by 
the understanding.

And we have further to reflect why this power is said especially to belong to celestial truth, and not also
to spiritual truths and natural truths. It is because celestial truth, more than any other, is truth conjoined 
with good or love. For the most holy place, where the ark was which contained the testimony, and 
particularly the ark itself, represented the inmost heaven, where the angels never, on any account, 
separate truth from good, but perceive what is true from their good and do it. And it is also because 
spiritual and natural are derived from celestial good, as an effect from a cause, and therefore all the 
power of spiritual and natural truths resides in what is celestial; and, moreover, what is remarkable is 
that celestial truths are in their greatest power when they operate through spiritual and natural good.

And therefore it now follows that he who acts from the love of good in any degree or on any plane of 
his life, has power to overcome all temptations; or, rather, temptations cease with him then. But, 
passing on, we observe that there is another wonderful effect which follows the acknowledgement and 
love of the Lord in sincerity, which is here represented by the laying up of the rod of Aaron before the 
testimony. For then even the spiritual and the natural man become conscious, more than ever they have 
been, that, of themselves, they are nothing but evil, and that it is not possible to approach the Lord in 
worship from selfish love. And it is said, "more than ever," because most persons in the beginning of 
regeneration do admit, from doctrine, and also, as they advance, from the understanding, that man of 
himself is nothing but evil, and is thus spiritually dead; and also that to love good and truth, and thus to 
love and worship the Lord and the neighbour (HH 16), is not possible when it is assumed to be done for
the sake of some selfish advantage, as, for example, when a person thus acts merely from a desire to 
escape from the miseries of hell, or to gain the happiness of heaven.

Hence, then, the chapter we have now gone through should prove very useful to us in its spiritual sense 
by causing us diligently to examine ourselves, lest we should have a name to live, when yet we are 
spiritually dead (Rev 3:1).

245

Numbers Chapter 18

SUMMARY OF THE SPIRITUAL SENSE

1. On the power given to those inmostly in good to fight against evil; the conjunction of those in 
charity with those in celestial love; and the functions of the latter and the former; also that no 
one in selfish love inmostly can truly perform those functions, vers. 1-7. 

2. The celestial man alone has perception, and through him is all illustration with the spiritual 
man; to the Lord through the celestial man is to be ascribed all that the spiritual man 
acknowledges to be from the Divine Love; and faith, which at first is separated, must be 
conjoined with charity, while impure natural affection must be purified, vers. 8-16. 

3. The good of faith in its three degrees is holy and must be ascribed to the Lord through celestial
love; and all illustration which the spiritual man receives from the Lord must be ascribed to 
Him through the celestial heavens; but the celestial man has perception; and the celestial and 
spiritual heavens are distinguished as love to the Lord is distinguished from love to the 
neighbour, vers. 17-20. 

4. Concerning the distinction between the celestial-natural and the spiritual-natural, vers. 21-32. 

THE CONTENTS OF EACH VERSE

1. And the LORD said to Aaron, You 
and your sons and your fathers' 
house with you shall bear the 
iniquity of the sanctuary: and you 
and your sons with you shall bear the
iniquity of your priesthood. 

1. There is perception from the Lord with those who 
are in celestial good, that is, with the Lord in His 
Human Nature, and with the celestial man, that he 
who is in good from the Lord in its three degrees 
of celestial, spiritual, and natural, shall have power
to fight against all evil, which power is given from
the Lord Himself, and is received by man 
externally as well as internally. 

2. And your brethren also, the tribe of 
Levi, the tribe of your father, bring 
you near with you, that they may be 
joined to you, and minister to you: 
but you and your sons with you shall
be before the tent of the testimony. 

2. And this is therefore specifically true also of those 
who are in charity, which is celestial love in an 
image, and from which is spiritual truth, for they 
have communication and conjunction with 
celestial good, and also minister thereto; but 
celestial good and truth thence derived alone enjoy
the immediate perception of truth from good. 

246

3. And they shall keep your charge, and
the charge of all the Tent: only they 
shall not come near to the vessels of 
the sanctuary and to the altar, that 
they die not, neither they, nor you. 

3. But those who are in charity and constitute the 

ultimate heaven, minister to celestial good, or to 
those who are in the inmost heaven, as well as to 
those who are in the middle and in the ultimate 
heaven; and yet they cannot participate in the 
functions of the superior heavens, or in their 
worship; for this would cause the destruction alike 
of the Natural, the Spiritual, and the Celestial. 

4. And they shall be joined to you, and 

keep the charge of the tent of 
meeting, for all the service of the 
Tent: and a stranger shall not come 
near to you. 

4. For the Natural have conjunction with the superior
heavens and minister to them, and also to those in 
the ultimate heaven internal and external; and one 
not of the church cannot perform the functions of 
the celestial and spiritual; 

5. And you shall keep the charge of the 
sanctuary, and the charge of the altar:
that there be wrath no more upon the
children of Israel. 

5. While the Celestial and Spiritual minister to 
inmost things from the Lord and to the pure 
worship of the Lord, in order that the inferior 
heavens may not be averted from the Lord. 

6. And I, behold, I have taken your 

brethren the Levites from among the 
children of Israel: to you they are a 
gift, given to the LORD, to do the 
service of the tent of meeting, 

6. And indeed, it is of Divine Good and Divine Truth,
and thus of the Divine Providence, that charity 
should be properly distinguished from faith or 
truth, and that it must be acknowledged to be from 
the Lord, giving conjunction with Him when it is 
expressed fully in the uses of worship and life. 

7. And you and your sons with you 

shall keep your priesthood for every 
thing of the altar, and for that within 
the veil; and you shall serve: I give 
you the priesthood as a service of 
gift: and the stranger that comes near
shall be put to death. 

7. And it is the function of the celestial and spiritual 
kingdoms conjoined to minister from good in all 
worship, and in everything celestial which is not 
perceived by the inferior heavens; for it is the 
delight of good to serve; this delight is wholly 
from the Lord; and it is perfectly free; but he who 
worships the Lord from selfish motives only has 
no spiritual life. 

8. And the LORD spoke to Aaron, And I,
behold, I have given you the charge 
of mine heave offerings, even all the 
hallowed things of the children of 
Israel, to you have I given them by 
reason of the anointing, and to your 
sons, as a due for ever. 

8. Further, there is influx from the Lord with the 

celestial man, and he alone has perception; that 
through him from the Lord also is all illustration 
with the spiritual man and with the natural man: 
and in short all charity, because through celestial 
love in all its degrees there is conjunction with the 
Lord, and thus the influx of love perpetually. 

247

9. This shall be your of the most holy 
things, reserved from the fire: every 
oblation of theirs, even every meal 
offering of theirs, and every sin 
offering of theirs, and every guilt 
offering of theirs, which they shall 
render to me, shall be most holy for 
you and for your sons. 

9. And therefore to the Lord through the celestial 

man as representing Him, is to be ascribed all that 
the spiritual man acknowledges to be from the 
Divine Love, namely, every celestial affection, 
every spiritual affection, every affection purified 
from sin, and every affection purified from error; 
for the spiritual man receives these freely from the 
Lord in this way, and therefore they are most holy. 

10. As the most holy things shall you eat
thereof: every male shall eat thereof; 
it shall be holy to you. 

10. For as the celestial man appropriates celestial 
good, so does he appropriate spiritual good 
expressing it in his truths, and by influx causing 
the holiness of both spiritual and natural love in 
the lower degrees of life. 

11. And this is your; the heave offering 
of their gift, even all the wave 
offerings of the children of Israel: I 
have given them to you, and to your 
sons and to your daughters with you,
as a due for ever: every one that is 
clean in your house shall eat thereof. 

11. And thus through the celestial man, the spiritual 
man has illustration and acknowledgement from 
the Lord; and these are from the Lord through the 
celestial man in every good thought and every 
good affection perpetually, being appropriated by 
every one who does the work of repentance, and 
thus purifies his life from evil. 

12. All the best of the oil, and all the 

best of the vintage, and of the corn, 
the firstfruits of them which they 
give to the LORD, to you have I given
them. 

12. And it must be acknowledged by the spiritual man 
that every celestial affection, every spiritual 
thought, and all the good of truth, are from the 
Lord in their earliest manifestation by the medium 
of celestial love. 

13. The firstripe fruits of all that is in 
their land, which they bring to the 
LORD, shall be your; every one that is
clean in your house shall eat thereof. 

13. For charity, as expressed in good works even in 

such a state of the church is from the Lord through
celestial love, and is appropriated by the celestial 
man in the spiritual degree of his life, and also by 
the spiritual man, when purification from sin is 
complete. 

14. Every thing devoted in Israel shall be

your. 

14. Also every affection devoted to the Lord with the 
man of the Spiritual Church is to be acknowledged
to be from the Lord through celestial love. 

248

15. Every thing that opens the womb, of 
all flesh which they offer to the 
LORD, both of man and beast, shall 
be your: nevertheless the firstborn of
man shall you surely redeem, and the
firstling of unclean beasts shall you 
redeem. 

16. And those that are to be redeemed of
them from a month old shall you 
redeem, according to your 
estimation, for the money of five 
shekels, after the shekel of the 
sanctuary (the same is twenty 
gerahs). 

17. But the firstling of an ox, or the 

firstling of a sheep, or the firstling of
a goat, you shall not redeem; they 
are holy: you shall sprinkle their 
blood upon the altar, and shall burn 
their fat for an offering made by fire,
for a sweet savour to the LORD. 

15. And every incipient principle, whether of good or 
truth, which the spiritual man receives from the 
Lord, whether it be internal or external, is to be 
ascribed to Him; but faith which at first is 
separated, must be conjoined with charity, and 
impure natural affection must be purified. 

16. And the purification of every natural affection 
commences from faith, the quality of that faith 
depending on its principle of good, accompanied 
by the acknowledgement of the Lord from remains
accordingly, for these remains are holy from good,
and truth is essentially from good. 

17. But the good of faith in its three degrees, namely, 
natural, spiritual, or celestial, is from the Lord, and
is not tainted with evil; it is holy; and it must be 
ascribed to Him. For such faith is conjoined with 
charity in all worship; and such charity must be 
acknowledged as proceeding from the Divine 
Love, as being consecrated by it, and therefore as 
being well pleasing and acceptable to the Lord. 

18. And the flesh of them shall be your, 

18. Besides which, also the good of faith must be 

as the wave breast and as the right 
thigh, it shall be your. 

ascribed to the Lord through celestial love, even as
are the good of charity and the good of celestial 
love. 

19. All the heave offerings of the holy 
things, which the children of Israel 
offer to the LORD, have I given you, 
and your sons and your daughters 
with you, as a due for ever: it is a 
covenant of salt for ever before the 
LORD to you and to your seed with 
you. 

19. In one word, all illustration in worship which the 
man of the Spiritual Church receives from the 
Lord must be ascribed to Him, even as to every 
perception of truth, and every delight in good, and 
this perpetually through the celestial heavens; for 
thereby is the reciprocal conjunction of good with 
truth and of truth with good between the celestial 
and spiritual man to eternity. 

249

20. And the LORD said to Aaron, You 
shall have no inheritance in their 
land, neither shall you have any 
portion among them: I am your 
portion and your inheritance among 
the children of Israel. 

20. But, on the contrary, there is perception from the 
Lord with the celestial man, that the celestial 
heavens are perfectly distinct from the spiritual 
heavens both as to truth and good; and that from 
the Lord is all celestial life, both as regards the 
Celestial and Spiritual, the distinction being that 
with the Celestial, love to the Lord is primary, and 
with the Spiritual love to the neighbour derived 
from love to the Lord. 

21. And to the children of Levi, behold, 
I have given all the tithe in Israel for 
an inheritance, in return for their 
service which they serve, even the 
service of the tent of meeting. 

21. And as for the Natural, or those who are in faith 
from charity, they receive from the Lord good 
according to their remains; this good being also 
according to their love of use in ministering to the 
superior heavens, and to the ultimate heavens. 

22. And now on the children of Israel 
shall not come near the tent of 
meeting, lest they bear sin, and die. 

23. But the Levites shall do the service 

of the tent of meeting, and they shall 
hear their iniquity: it shall he a 
statute for ever throughout your 
generations, and among the children 
of Israel they shall have no 
inheritance. 

24. For the tithe of the children of Israel,
which they offer as an heave offering
to the LORD, I have given to the 
Levites for an inheritance: therefore 
I have said to them, Among the 
children of Israel they shall have no 
inheritance. 

22. But the spiritual cannot enter into, and perform the
functions of the celestial; and if any one should be 
persuaded that he can, he must learn that it is 
impossible, because, in this case, he would have to
endure temptations in which he would fail, and be 
deprived of spiritual life. 

23. But the Natural nevertheless are capable of uses by
conjunction with the celestial and the spiritual 
man, and must endure temptations according to 
their quality; they are comparatively and 
perpetually in external worship in the process of 
their regeneration; and yet the good of their charity
is to be distinguished from the good of their faith, 
as being worship from love and not for the sake of 
reward, or as being the Lord's life in man which is 
not ascribed to self. 

24. For all who are in charity enjoy the good of 

remains, and thus the appearance of good as from 
themselves, and of illustration as from themselves,
with the perception at the same time, that their life 
of charity and their illustration are entirely from 
the Lord, and not from the external man. 

25. And the LORD spoke to Moses, 

25. And yet again, there is revelation from the Lord by

saying, 

Divine Truth giving the perception,

and understanding, that when the good of remains 
is attributed to them from the Lord, on account of 
the co-operation of the external man with the

28. And thus the spiritual must acknowledge that they 
have all their illustration from the Lord through 
remains, when the external man cooperates with 
the internal; and that all their good and their truth 
are from the Lord through the celestial heavens.

thence acknowledges that his inmost good and 
truth are from the Lord, and are to be ascribed to 
Him, just as he has ascribed to Him the good of 
truth and the truth of good, in the process of 
regeneration. 

31. And you shall eat it in every place, 
you and your households: for it is 
your reward in return for your 
service in the tent of meeting. 

31. And this good is to be appropriated in every state 
both internal and external; for this good is the only
reward which the spiritual man seeks in the 
performance of uses. 

32. And you shall bear no sin by reason 
of it, when you have heaved from it 
the best thereof: and you shall not 
profane the holy things of the 
children of Israel, that you die not. 

32. And thus also there is no longer any temptation 
when the inmost life of the natural man is 
acknowledged to be from the Lord, together also 
with the life of the internal man; and neither then 
is there any external, nor any possibility of 
spiritual death.

denotes in order that the inferior heavens may not be averted from the Lord, 5798, 3654,

6.

"I, behold, I have taken your brethren the Levites from among the children of Israel," denotes 
that indeed it is of the Divine Good and Divine Truth, and thus of the Divine Providence, that 
charity should be properly distinguished from faith or truth, 2001, 683, 1222, 3875, chap 3:12;
and their being to Aaron for a gift, given to the Lord to do the service of the tent of meeting, 
denotes that charity must be acknowledged to be from the Lord, giving conjunction with Him 
when it is expressed fully in the uses of worship and life, 9946, 5619, 3875, 5947, 35403. 

7. Aaron and his sons with him keeping their priesthood, denotes that it is the function of the 

celestial and spiritual kingdoms conjoined inmostly to minister from good, 10017, 3382; for 
everything of the altar, and for that within the veil, denotes in all worship, and in everything 
celestial which is not perceived in the inferior heavens, 4541, 25764, 3210; their serving 
denotes that it is the delight of good to serve, 5947; the Lord giving them their priesthood as a 

252

service of gift, denotes that this delight is wholly from the Lord, and is perfectly free, 5619, 
5947; and the stranger coming near being put to death, denotes that he who worships the Lord 
from selfish motives only, has no spiritual life, 10287, 3572, 6767. 

8. The Lord speaking to Aaron denotes influx from Him with the celestial man, 2001, 2951, 

10017; giving Aaron the charge of the heave offerings, denotes that the celestial man alone has
perception, 3382, 10093; the hallowed things of the children of Israel being given to Aaron, 
denotes the acknowledgement that through the celestial man from the Lord is all illustration 
with the spiritual and natural man, 10093, 5619; by reason of the anointing, denotes on 
account of their reception of charity, 99547; thie sons of Aaron denote the spiritual kingdom, 
and thus the reception of love and charity in all its degrees, 10017; and a due for ever denotes 
perpetual acknowledgement of the reception of love from the Lord, 7931. 

9. This being Aaron's of the most holy things reserved from the fire, denotes that, therefore, to 

the Lord, through the celestial man as representing Him, is to be ascribed all that the spiritual 
man acknowledges to be from the Divine Love, 9946, 10091, 10092, 10055; every oblation of 
theirs, even every meal offering of theirs, and every sin offering of theirs, and every guilt 
offering of theirs, denotes every celestial affection, 10129, every spiritual affection, 2177, 
every affection purified from sin, 3400, and every affection purified from error, 3400; and 
their being rendered to the Lord, and therefore being most holy for Aaron and for his sons, 
denotes that the spiritual man receives these freely from the Lord in this way, and that 
therefore they are most holy, 5619. 

10. "As the most holy things shall you eat thereof; every male shall eat thereof; it shall be holy to 
you," denotes that as the celestial man appropriates celestial good, so does he appropriate 
spiritual good, expressing it in his truths, and by influx causing the holiness of both spiritual 
and natural love in the lower degrees of life, 3210, 2187, 725, 10129. 

11. This being Aaron's, the heave offerings of their gift; even all the wave offerings of the children
of Israel, denotes that thus, through the celestial man, the spiritual man has illustration and 
acknowledgement from the Lord, 10017, 10093; their being given to Aaron and to his sons 
and daughters with him as a due for ever, denotes that these are from the Lord, through the 
celestial man in every good thought and in every good affection perpetually, 5619, 10017, 489,
7931; and every one that is clean in Aaron's house eating thereof, denotes appropriation by 
every one who does the work of repentance, and thus purifies his life from evil, 10017, 4545. 

12. All the best of the oil, and all the best of the vintage, and of the corn, the firstfruits of them 

which they give to the Lord being given to Aaron, denotes that it must be acknowledged by the
spiritual man that every celestial affection, every spiritual thought, and all the good of truth are
from the Lord in their earliest manifestation by the medium of celestial love, 886, 1071, 5295, 
9223, 10017, 5619. 

13. The firstripe fruits of all that is in their land, which they bring to the Lord being Aaron's; and 

every one that is clean eating thereof, denotes that charity as expressed in good works, even in 
such a state of the church, is from the Lord through celestial love, and is appropriated by the 
celestial man in the spiritual degree of his life, and also by the spiritual man, when purification
from sin is complete, 9223, 1873, 10017, 2187, 5619, 4545. 

253

14. Everything devoted in Israel being Aaron's, denotes that every affection devoted to the Lord 
with the man of the Spiritual Church is to be acknowledged to be from the Lord through 
celestial love, 8042, 5619, 10017. 

15. Everything that opens the womb of all flesh which they offer to the Lord both of man and 

beast being Aaron's, denotes that every incipient principle, whether of good or truth, which the
spiritual man receives from the Lord, whether it be internal or external, is to be ascribed to 
Him, 8043, 780, 5619, 2001, 8045, 10017; and the firstborn of man being redeemed, as well as
the firstling of unclean beasts, denotes that faith, which at first is separated, must be conjoined 
with charity, and that impure natural affection must be purified, 8042, 6280, 10130, 8045. 

16. Those that are redeemed being redeemed from a month old, denotes that the purification of 

every natural affection commences from faith, 6280, 851, 859; according to Aaron's 
estimation, denotes that the quality of faith depends on its principle of good, 10017, 2959, 
2966; the money, or silver, of five shekels after the shekel of the sanctuary, denotes 
accompanied by the acknowledgement of the Lord from remains; for remains are holy from 
good, 425, 5291, 3210; and the same is twenty gerahs, denotes that truth is essentially from 
good, 29597, 10222. 

17. Not redeeming the firstling of an ox, or of a sheep, or of a goat because they are holy, denotes 
that the good of faith in its three degrees of natural, spiritual and celestial is from the Lord, and
is not tainted with evil; it is holy; and it must be ascribed to Him, 2180, 4169, 8042; sprinkling
their blood upon the altar denotes that such faith is conjoined with charity in all worship, 
10047, 4441; and burning the fat for an offering made by fire for a sweet savour, or an odour 
of rest, to the Lord, denotes that such charity must be acknowledged as proceeding from the 
Divine Love, as being consecrated by it, and therefore as being well pleasing and acceptable to
the Lord, 10033, 10055, 10054. 

18. The flesh of them being Aaron's as the wave breast, and as the right thigh, denotes that also the
good of faith must be ascribed to the Lord, through celestial love, even as are the good of 
charity, and the good of celestial love, ver. 17, 10087, 10092. 

19. All the heave offerings of the holy things which the children of Israel offer to the Lord, 

denotes here all illustration in worship, which the man of the Spiritual Church receives from 
the Lord, because with the spiritual man there is illustration and not the peculiar perception of 
the celestial man, 10093; their being given to Aaron denotes that such illustration must be 
ascribed to the Lord, or must be acknowledged to be from Him through celestial love, 5619, 
10017; to your sons and to your daughters with you as a due for ever, denotes even as to every
perception of truth, and as to every delight in good, and this perpetually through the celestial 
heavens, 489, 7931; and it being a covenant of salt for ever before the Lord to Aaron and to his
seed with him, denotes that thereby is the reciprocal conjunction of good with truth and of 
truth with good between the celestial and spiritual man to eternity, 665, 666, 9207. 

20. By the Lord saying to Aaron, is denoted that there is perception from the Lord with the 

celestial man, 1822, 10017; by Aaron not having any inheritance in their land, nor any portion 
among the Israelites, is denoted that the celestial heavens are perfectly distinct from the 
spiritual heavens both as to truth and good, 10017, 2658, 4097, 3654; and by the Lord being 
Aaron's portion and inheritance among the children of Israel, is denoted that from the Lord is 
all celestial life, both with regard to the Celestial and Spiritual, the distinction being that, with 

254

the Celestial, love to the Lord is primary, and, with the Spiritual, love to the neighbour derived
from love to the Lord, 2001, 4097, 2658. 

21. By the children of Levi, are denoted the Natural, 10017; by the Lord giving them all the tithe 
in Israel, is denoted that they receive good according to their remains, 2001, 5619, 576, 2658; 
and by the service, which they serve, even the service of the tent of meeting, is denoted that 
this good is also according to their love of use in ministering to the superior heavens and also 
to the ultimate heavens, 7038. 35403. 

22. Henceforth the children of Israel not coming near to the tent of meeting, lest they bear sin and 
die, denotes that the Spiritual cannot enter into nor perform the functions of the Celestial; and 
that if any one should be persuaded that he can, he must learn that it is impossible, because, in 
this case, he would have to endure temptations in which he would fail, and would be deprived 
of spiritual life, 3654, 3572, 35403, 9937, 6767. 

23. The Levites doing the service of the tent of meeting, denotes that the Natural, nevertheless, are
capable of uses by conjunction with the celestial and spiritual man, 10017, 7038, 35403, 3875; 
their bearing their iniquity denotes that they endure temptations according to their quality, 
9937; a statute for ever throughout your generations, denotes that they are perpetually in 
external worship in the process of regeneration, 7884, 8357, 1041; and their not having any 
inheritance among the children of Israel, denotes that yet the good of their charity is to be 
distinguished from the good of their faith, as being worship from love and not for the sake of 
reward, or as being the Lord's life in man, which is not ascribed to self, 2658, 3654. 

24. The tithe of the children of Israel, denotes the good of remains with the man of the Spiritual 

Church, 576, 3654; their being offered as a heave offering, denotes the acknowledgement that 
illustration is from the Lord by remains, 5619, 10092-3; given to the Levites for an 
inheritance, denotes that all who are in the good of charity enjoy remains, and thus the 
appearance of good as from themselves, and of illustration as from themselves, 3875, 10017, 
2658; the Lord saying to them, denotes perception at the same time, 2001, 1822; and their not 
having an inheritance among the children of Israel denotes that their life of charity and their 
illustration are entirely from the Lord, and not from the external man, 3564, 2658, 10017. 

25. This is evident, because by Jehovah is denoted the Divine Being as to His love, 2001; by 

speaking is denoted influx, 2951; by Moses is represented Divine Truth, or the Word, 7010; 
and by saying is denoted perception, 1822. 

26. Speaking to the Levites and saying to them, denotes perception with those who are in charity, 
both as to the will and the understanding, 10017, 2951, 822; taking of the children of Israel the
tithe which the Lord had given them from the Israelites, denotes that when the good of 
remains is attributed to them from the Lord, as if their own on account of their co-operation, 
39382, 576, 2001, 8899, 3654, 2658; and offering up a heave offering of it for the Lord, the 
tithe of the tithe, denotes that they shall also receive illustration from the Lord, which is to be 
acknowledged as coming from Him through the remains thus again and continually stored up, 
10092-3, 576. 

27. Their heave offering being reckoned to the Levites as though it were the corn of the threshing-

floor and as the fullness of the winepress, denotes that this acknowledgement is attributed to 

255

the natural man who is in charity as good derived from truth, and as truth derived from good in
the course of regeneration, 10092-3, 63774. 

28. The Levites also offering a heave offering to the Lord of all their tithes received of the 

children of Israel, denotes that thus the Natural must acknowledge that they have all their 
illustration from the Lord through remains, when the external man co-operates with the 
internal, 10017, 10092-3, 576, 3654; and giving thereof the Lord's heave offering to Aaron the 
priest, denotes that they acknowledge that all their good and all their truth is from the Lord 
through the celestial heavens, 5619, 10092-3, 9946, 10017. 

29. Out of all their gifts offering every heave offering of the Lord of the best thereof, even the 

hallowed part thereof out of it, denotes that particularly it is to be acknowledged by the natural
man that, in receiving illustration from the Lord, it is through the inmost good, and the inmost 
truth with him, 5619, 10092-3, 2001, 10033, 3210. 

30. Therefore Moses saying to the Levites, denotes that hence again the natural man derives 

perception, 7010, 1822, 10017; the best thereof being heaved from it denotes the 
acknowledgement that his inmost good and truth are from the Lord, 10092-3; and it being 
counted to the Levites as the increase of the threshing-floor and as the increase of the 
winepress, denotes that these are to be ascribed to the Lord, just as they have ascribed to Him 
the good of truth and the truth of good in the process of regeneration, 63774. 

31. The Levites eating it in every place they and their households, denotes that this good is to be 
appropriated in every state both internal and external, 2187, 48434, 48435; and it being their 
reward for their service in the tent of meeting, denotes that this good is the only reward which 
the natural man, who is in charity, seeks in the performance of heavenly uses, 2658, 3816, 
7038, 35403, 10017. 

32. The Levites bearing no sin because of their heave offering, when they heaved from it the best 
thereof; and their not profaning the holy things of the children of Israel, nor dying, denotes 
that thus, also, there is no longer any temptation, when the inmost life of the natural man is 
acknowledged to be from the Lord together with the life of the internal man; and neither, then, 
is there any external worship separated from internal, nor any possibility of spiritual death, 
10017, 9937, 10092-3, 10033, 2658, 1326, 3654, 2908. 

DISCUSSION 

The first section of this chapter, in the internal sense, shows emphatically under the figure of Aaron and
his sons bearing iniquity, the way in which the Lord, when on earth, delivered all mankind from the 
absolute power of evil, and still delivers every individual who is willing to be delivered from his own 
actual evils by fighting for him against the wicked spirits who excite them to activity, and enabling 
him, as from himself, to overcome by co-operation with the Lord. And as this subject is very important 
indeed, the following quotation respecting it is here made: "That bearing iniquity means removing 
falsities and evils, or sins, with those who are in good, is on the ground of this being said of the Lord, 
for the Lord was represented by Aaron, and the whole work of salvation by his office or priesthood. It 
is known in the church that it is said of the Lord that He bore the sins for the human race; but still it is 
not known what is meant by bearing iniquities and sins. Some believe that the meaning of it is that He 
took upon Himself the sins of the human race, and suffered Himself to be condemned even to the death 

256

on the cross; and because the condemnation of sins was cast upon Him, that the mortals were thus freed
from damnation; also that the Lord by the fulfillment of the Law removed the damnation, since the Law
would have condemned every one who did not fulfill it. But this is not meant by bearing iniquity, for 
every man's deeds remain with him after death; their quality comes from the love and the faith—for 
love and faith constitute the life of a deed; wherefore those deeds cannot be removed by transfer to 
another who would bear them. From this it is evident that something else is meant by bearing iniquities;
but what is meant thereby may appear from the bearing itself by the Lord of iniquities or sins; they are 
borne by the Lord when He fights for a man against the hells, for of himself a man cannot fight against 
them, but the Lord alone does this, and indeed continually for every man, with a difference, however, 
according to the reception of the Divine Good and the Divine Truth. While the Lord was in the world, 
He fought against all the hells, and subdued them completely; hence, also, He became Justice; in this 
wise He redeemed from damnation those who received from Himself Divine Good and Truth. Unless 
this had been done by the Lord, no flesh could have been saved, for the hells are constantly with the 
man, and rule over him so far as the Lord does not remove them; and He removes them in the same 
proportion in which the man desists from evils. He who conquers the hells once, conquers them to 
eternity, and in order that the Lord might accomplish this, He made His Human Divine. Wherefore He 
who alone tights for man against the hells—or, what is the same thing, against evils and falsities, for 
they are from the hells—He is said to bear sins, for He alone upholds that burden. That by bearing sins 
is also signified the removal of evils and falsities from those who are in good, is on account of this 
being a consequence; for so far as the hells are removed from a man, so far evils and falsities are 
removed, because both of these, as said above, are from the hells; the evils and falsities, however, are 
sins and iniquities. How the case herein is may be seen in what was shown above, Nos. 9715 and 9809, 
where the Lord's Merit and Justice, and also the subjugation of the hells by Him, are treated of," 9937. 

But there are also two more points in this section that require a little notice. Charity, or love to the 
neighbour, generally considered, ministers to love to the Lord, this being signified by the functions of 
the Levites; while specifically, also, charity as manifested in the natural degree is denoted by them. And
thus every degree of good is operative from the Lord in causing the removal of evil. But, on the other 
hand, so-called worship from selfish motives is of no use in this respect, as is signified by the stranger 
not coming near, and suffering spiritual death in consequence of doing so. Now, whoever considers all 
these points carefully, both in the light of human experience and in the light of the general teaching of 
the Word, cannot fail to see the truth of them, and how very necessary it is that every one who earnestly
desires salvation should live according to them.

In the second section we notice, first of all, that all the heave offerings were given to Aaron and his 
sons, that is, to the priests of the Lord, as a due for ever. But a gift from the Lord to man, and also a gift
from man to the Lord, denote that what is represented by the gift is acknowledged to be from Him; and 
remembering how Aaron and his sons represent, respectively, celestial and spiritual good, which are 
love to the Lord and love to the neighbour, we have to inquire what this particular offering called the 
heave offering signifies, in order to understand why it was assigned to the priesthood, and particularly 
to the high priest, as a due for ever. It was because it signified the acknowledgement that the celestial in
particular, the spiritual in a secondary sense, and the natural man in a degree lower, are gifted from the 
Lord with the perception of truths, and the activity that comes from good. And it is said that the 
celestial in particular have this gift and acknowledge it, because, unlike the spiritual and natural man, 
they perceive at once that a thing is true without reasoning about it. Such were the people of the Most 
Ancient Church, and, in fact, all who lived before the period of that church. And they were called 
celestial because they were regenerated through their will or love of good, and not like the spiritual 

257

through their understanding and love of truth; and this was the reason why, from their state as to good, 
they could at once perceive what was true, and, consequently, what was not true. For it is said of them: 
"From the Lord they had perception continuously, which perception was such, that when they thought 
about those things which were treasured up in the memory, they instantly perceived whether it was true 
and good, insomuch that when anything false presented itself, they not only avoided it, but even 
regarded it with horror," 125. Thus we see how much superior were those who constituted the Most 
Ancient Church, while yet they had with them the remembrance of the falsities and, consequently, the 
evils which had troubled them in the course of their regeneration, and a perception of what was true 
and good far beyond that which is enjoyed by the Spiritual and the Natural Churches which succeeded.

Secondly, it is to be noticed that the perception of the spiritual and natural man is distinguished from 
that of the celestial, as illustration or enlightenment, and is specifically represented by the wave 
offering, ver. 11; and also that all the offerings of the children of Israel named were to be appropriated 
and eaten by the priests, to denote that what each of these represented is to be acknowledged, as 
received, from the Lord through celestial love. Or, in other words, these gifts to the priesthood, while, 
literally, they were a provision for them, seeing that they had no inheritance like the rest of the tribes, 
denoted spiritually that every one in the church appropriates good from the Lord through love to Him; 
and, on reflection, it must be manifest that the spiritual and natural man cannot enjoy and be supported 
by the various kinds of good, which the Lord freely gives, unless there is a sincere acknowledgement 
that all good is from Him and is grounded in love to Him.

And, thirdly, this section teaches emphatically that, in order that man may truly appropriate good, so 
that it occupies not only his internal but also his external man, he must be free from the defilements of 
the merely natural man by being purified through the work of repentance. For this purification is 
particularly signified by its being said, "every one that is clean in your house shall eat thereof." And, 
lastly, let it be well observed that by the redemption spoken of is denoted that every state of faith, 
which at first is not fully conjoined with charity, must, in the process of regeneration, be so conjoined 
with it, that the man of the church of every degree may enjoy the good that properly constitutes his life. 
And here, again, we see that it is good from the Lord of every kind that effects redemption, and not by 
any means truth separated from good, and, indeed, that this is why the redemption money was to be 
according to the shekel of the sanctuary, and why this is said to be twenty gerahs, namely, because 
twenty gerahs signifies all things of good, 10222. 

Having now just seen why and how faith not yet conjoined with good, and impure natural affections, 
can be redeemed by conjunction with good, we come next to the revelation, in the new section, that 
good of no degree is redeemed, because it is from the Lord, and that, in fact, instead of needing to be 
redeemed, it is that which redeems, and that, nevertheless, in the person who is being regenerated there 
must be the conjunction of truth thence proceeding with good; and also that then such good will be 
fully acknowledged to be from the Lord through celestial love, and may be appropriated and enjoyed as
if it were man's own. And thence it follows that even the spiritual and natural man, each in his degree, 
have illustration and perception corresponding to that of the celestial man. But still the celestial man 
has his own peculiar perception, as vers. 19, 20 strongly indicate, both affirming the continuity of the 
perception, and that such is the character of celestial good that no one who is in it can participate in that
of the spiritual or natural man, although, as particularly stated, the latter is derived from the former, and
there is reciprocal conjunction between them, which is denoted by a covenant of salt, since a covenant 
signifies conjunction, and salt corresponds to the desire of good for truth, and also the desire of truth 
for good. For the Lord loves everybody, and would save everybody, and yet none can be saved but 
those who by regeneration reject a11 selfish love and its evils and falsities, and consecrate themselves 

258

to the Lord by love to Him. How highly practical, therefore, are the truths of the internal sense of the 
Word as conveyed to us in this whole chapter.

And the last section shows this in a remarkable way, because it refers to the operation of Divine 
principles in the natural man. Let us consider it. We have been instructed that the celestial and spiritual 
man has each his own peculiar good, and now also we learn that it is the same with the celestial-natural
and the spiritual-natural man, the former being denoted by the Levites and the latter by the children of 
Israel as distinct from the Levites. For the Levites represent those who are in charity in the natural 
degree, and the Israelites denote those who are in faith there. And the impressive teaching is that those 
in faith cannot endure those temptations which are signified by bearing iniquity, because if they were 
introduced into them they would fail. Why is this? It is because there is not any conjunction with the 
Lord by faith, but only by charity. And it is the Lord only through the principle of good or charity that 
fights for man against evil. No one, therefore, who contends against evil simply from the principle that 
obedience to the truth will save him can be successful against it; although it is to be remembered that 
resistance to evil on this principle is a good thing; for it may lead up to a better state, that is, to a state 
of the love of obeying the Lord, and then it will become the good of faith, if not the good of charity. So 
that we are to be careful here properly to distinguish, when thinking of the spiritual-natural, between 
such of them as are in the good of faith and such as are only in the truth of faith, and to remember that 
it is the latter who are meant in ver. 22. And since these cannot be let into spiritual temptations, much 
less can they who are in faith without charity. But the natural man who is in charity, and who is 
specifically denoted by the Levites, can, according to his degree, "bear iniquity," or, under the Lord's 
banner, and by His perpetual aid, contend against the foes of his own household, each contention being 
signified by the service, and also by the warfare, of the Levites in the tent of meeting (chap 4:3). But 
also the celestial-natural man is distinguished from the spiritual-natural man by having the life of 
charity or good which is the Lord's life in man, and not man's possession, as is represented by the 
Levites not having any inheritance with the children of Israel. On the other hand, however, he who is in
charity in the natural man, and who is being prepared by regeneration for the ultimate heaven, is here 
distinguished by having his good from remains as is denoted by the Levites having for their support all 
the tithes of the children of Israel. This indicates, therefore, that the quality of the charity of the natural 
man is respectively inferior to that of the charity of the spiritual man of the second or middle heaven.

And now, lastly, there follows another interesting point in connection with the Levites. For they were 
required particularly to give to Aaron a tithe of the tithes, or tenths, that they received, as a heave 
offering, which denotes the acknowledgement on the part of the natural man who is in the good of 
charity that all his power to perceive truths, and all the activity of his life of good, denoted by the 
heaving, are from the Lord through the celestial and spiritual degrees of his life, or through the celestial
and spiritual heavens. Or, from another point of view, these tithes of tithes may be regarded as an 
acknowledgement that his illustration and activity is from remains thus again and continually stored up.
But these heave offerings of the tithes of tithes are also said to be as the increase of the threshing-floor, 
and as the increase of the winepress, to denote that the acknowledgement that remains are from the 
Lord continually, is similar to the acknowledgement that the good of truth and the truth of good are 
from Him in the course of regeneration, because the earlier acknowledgement, in a most orderly way, 
leads up to the later. For indeed the Lord must always be sincerely acknowledged as the source of life, 
and as the giver of every good and perfect gift. And, moreover, it is not surprising that, in this 
connection the appropriation of remains is spoken of; for this is similar to what is in some places 
described as the implantation of remains in the natural man, thus causing the External to be in all 
respects a most perfect representation of the Internal. We see, therefore, from the brief review of this 

259

section here given how all the things said in the internal sense concerning those represented by the 
Levites cohere, and come exactly into their right places in the description. And these considerations 
ought on that account to stimulate the man of the church in so living during his earthly life that he may 
at last realize the state of eternal happiness of being a perfected image and likeness of the Lord his 
Creator, Redeemer, and Regenerator.

Numbers Chapter 19

SUMMARY OF THE SPIRITUAL SENSE

1. There is revelation that the impure truth of the natural man is to be devoted to the Lord 

through truth proceeding from good; that it is to be prepared for purification; that it must be 
acknowledged to come from the Lord and must, therefore, be conjoined with good in the 
course of regeneration, vers. 1-4. 

2. All falsity and evil are to be separated from the truth; and through the influence of truth from 
good, purification shall be effected by the truths of the Word; and further particulars are then 
given concerning this process, vers. 5-10. 

3. Several cases are given in which this law of purification is to be applied; and in short, every 

one who does not apply this law by the confession that of himself he is nothing but evil, must 
remain in a state of impurity and be separated from the church, vers. 9, 11-22. 

THE CONTENTS OF EACH VERSE

1. And the LORD spoke to Moses and to

1. There is revelation from the Lord by Divine Truth 

Aaron, saying, 

and Divine Good giving the perception, 

2. This is the statute of the law which 
the LORD has commanded, saying, 
Speak to the children of Israel, that 
they bring you a red heifer without 
spot, wherein is no blemish, and 
upon which never came yoke: 

3. And you shall give her to Eleazar the
priest, and he shall bring her forth 
without the camp, and one shall slay 
her before his face: 

2.

3.

In reference to external things derived from 
internal, according to Divine Order by illustration 
from influx with the man of the Spiritual Church, 
that the impure truth of the natural man which, 
from the Lord, is perfect, free from falsity, and not 
having any conjunction with evil, 

Is to be devoted to the Lord through the truth 
proceeding from good, from which it is seen to 
form no part of heavenly order; and that therefore 
interior good requires that it shall be prepared for 
purification, 

4. And Eleazar the priest shall take of 
her blood with his finger, and 
sprinkle of her blood toward the 
front of the tent of meeting seven 
times: 

4. That it must be acknowledged to come from the 
Lord through the heavens, and must therefore be 
conjoined with heavenly good in the course of 
regeneration and thus become holy. 

261

5. And one shall burn the heifer in his 
sight: her skin, and her flesh, and her
blood, with her dung, shall he burn: 

5. So that all falsity and evil are to be separated 

through the influence of truth from good, and this 
as to things most external, as to things interior, and
as to inmost things, and thus as to everything 
infernal, by enduring temptations. 

6. And the priest shall take cedar wood,

6. And through the influence of celestial good 

and hyssop, and scarlet, and cast it 
into the midst of the burning of the 
heifer. 

7. Then the priest shall wash his 

clothes, and he shall bathe his flesh 
in water, and afterward he shall 
come into the camp, and the priest 
shall be unclean until the even. 

8. And he that burns her shall wash his 
clothes in water, and bathe his flesh 
in water, and shall be unclean until 
the even. 

purification shall be effected by truths interior and 
exterior, and by good. 

7. And thus truth from good shall be purified, and 
good itself shall be purified from falsity, so that 
both come into heavenly order when the state of 
purification is completed. 

8. And thus also interior good in the natural man, 
which rejects evil and falsity must be cleansed 
until the state of purification is completed. 

9. And a man that is clean shall gather 
up the ashes of the heifer, and lay 
them up without the camp in a clean 
place, and it shall be kept for the 
congregation of the children of Israel
for a water of separation: it is a sin 
offering. 

9. And by the operation of purified truth every 

remnant of what has served its use is removed, but 
yet remains in the memory, separated from the 
heavenly life, and is preserved as an aid to man's 
purification by truth, because it involves the 
confession on his part that of himself he is nothing
but evil. 

10. And he that gathers the ashes of the 
heifer shall wash his clothes, and be 
unclean until the even: and it shall be
to the children of Israel, and to the 
stranger that sojourns among them, 
for a statute for ever. 

10. For even he who is in purified truth internally is 
yet impure externally, and confesses this, being 
continually purified until the state ends. And 
indeed this confession is to be made alike by the 
man of the internal church as by the man of the 
external, and is perpetual with him. 

11. He that touches the dead body of any
man shall be unclean seven days: 

11. And every action from falsity derived from evil 

which has been acknowledged, produces a state of 
impurity which can only be removed by 
regeneration and purification, 

262

12. The same shall purify himself 

12. Because purification must be perfect and complete

therewith on the third day, and on the
seventh day he shall be clean: but if 
he purify not himself the third day, 
then the seventh day he shall not be 
clean. 

both as to truth and as to good, and thus must be 
continual during regeneration; for if this is not so, 
then no state of perfect regeneration can be 
reached. 

13. Whosoever touches the dead body of
any man that is dead, and purifies 
not himself, defiles the tabernacle of 
the LORD; and that soul shall be cut 
off from Israel: because the water of 
separation was not sprinkled upon 
him, he shall be unclean; his 
uncleanness is yet upon him. 

13. And therefore every one acting from the falsity of 
evil which is no longer with him a ruling motive, 
and not confessing his error that the Lord may 
purify him, renders his worship of the Lord impure
and separates himself from the truth; and he can 
only be restored by the application of the truth, 
which involves the confession that of himself he is
nothing but evil, and hence that he is impure both 
as to understanding and will. 

14. This is the law when a man dies in a 

tent: every one that comes into the 
tent, and every one that is in the tent,
shall be unclean seven days. 

14. This is the law for purification from falsity 
grounded in evil: every one affected with it, 
although the evil of that falsity be not his own, is 
yet impure and must be purified according to the 
order of regeneration; and every one to whom that 
evil appertains is impure, and must be purified 
according to the order of regeneration. 

15. And every open vessel, which has no

15. Also every one who is in spiritual truths which are 

covering bound upon it, is unclean. 

recipient of good; which, as yet, are not properly 
distinguished from merely natural things; and by 
which merely natural things are not regulated, is 
impure. 

16. And whoever in the open field 
touches one that is slain with a 
sword, or a dead body, or a bone of a
man, or a grave, shall be unclean 
seven days. 

16. And every one who, being a man of the church, is 
contaminated with falsity which is destructive of 
truth; by falsity from evil; by falsity from 
selfishness; or by falsity from the hells, is impure 
until fully regenerated. 

17. And for the unclean they shall take 

17. And such impurity can only be removed by the 

of the ashes of the burning of the sin 
offering, and running water shall be 
put thereto in a vessel: 

confession that man of himself is nothing but evil, 
and the application thereto of the living truths of 
the Word, which have been received into the 
memory. 

263

18. And a clean person shall take 

hyssop, and dip it in the water, and 
sprinkle it upon the tent, and upon all
the vessels, and upon the persons 
that were there, and upon him that 
touched the bone, or the slain, or the 
dead, or the grave: 

18. And this must be effected by the operation of the 
truth of the Word as manifested in its literal sense, 
and by the sanctification of the natural affections, 
of the natural understanding, of the interiors, and 
also of the spiritual or internal man which has been
contaminated by selfish feelings, by false 
persuasions, by falsities from evil, or by falsities 
from the hells. 

19. And the clean person shall sprinkle 

upon the unclean on the third day, 
and on the seventh day: and on the 
seventh day he shall purify him; and 
he shall wash his clothes, and bathe 
himself in water, and shall be clean 
at even. 

19. And this purification must be effected successively
during regeneration, until a state of good prevails, 
and this by the complete removal of interior evils, 
of exterior falsities and evils, and by a consequent 
state of purity even as to the comparative obscurity
of the external or natural man. 

20. But the man that shall be unclean, 

and shall not purify himself, that 
soul shall be cut off from the midst 
of the assembly, because he has 
defiled the sanctuary of the LORD: 
the water of separation has not been 
sprinkled upon him; he is unclean. 

20. But the man of the church who is conscious of his 
impurity, and yet deliberately remains in it must of
necessity be separated from all interior truths and 
good affections, because he has profaned the holy 
principles of the church, and has not confessed that
of himself he is nothing but evil without which his 
impurity must remain. 

21. And it shall be a perpetual statute to 
them: and he that sprinkles the water
of separation shall wash his clothes; 
and he that touches the water of 
separation shall be unclean until 
even. 

21. For this confession must be perpetual with the man
of the church, and every one making it sincerely 
will be purified externally as well as internally; 
and indeed, the slightest contact with truth 
contaminated by the persuasion that it is self-
derived, must inevitably be impure, until the 
obscurity arising from such contact is at its end. 

22. And whatever the unclean person 
touches shall be unclean; and the 
soul that touches it shall be unclean 
until even. 

22. And in short, every truth is rendered impure by 
contact with evil, and every contact with impure 
truth produces a state of impurity that can only be 
removed in the course of regeneration.

falsity, must be cleansed until the state of purification is completed, ver. 5, 3147, 5006, 683, 
10130, 7844. It is said here, "interior good in the natural man," because Eleazar the priest, 
denotes the interior good of the spiritual man, and Aaron the interior good of the celestial man;
and also because we may assume very fairly that the person who burned the heifer was a 
Levite, 10017.

of Israel for a water of separation, is denoted what is preserved as an aid to man's purification 
by truth, 868; and by its being a sin offering, is denoted that it involves the confession on his

being to the children of Israel, and to the stranger that sojourns among them, for a statute for

as by the man of the external, and is to be perpetual with him, 3654, 1463, 7884. 

11. He that touches the dead body of any man being unclean seven days, denotes that every action 
from falsity derived from evil which has been acknowledged, produces a state of impurity, 
which can only be removed by regeneration and purification, 10130, 390010, 429, 84, 716. 

12. The same purifying himself with the water of separation on the third day, and on the seventh 

day being clean, denotes that purification must be perfect and complete both as to truth and as 
to good, 4545, ver. 9, 901, 84, 716, 720, 683; and if he purify not himself on the third day, on 
the seventh day not being clean, denotes that purification must be continual during 
regeneration, for if this is not so, then no state of perfect regeneration can be reached, because 
the third day and the seventh both denote completeness and holiness, and thus involve all the 
states of regeneration signified by the days of creation in Genesis i.

13. Whosoever touching the dead body of any man, and not purifying himself defiling the 

tabernacle of the Lord, denotes that therefore every one acting from the falsity of evil, which is
no longer, with him, a ruling motive, and not confessing his error that the Lord may purify 
him, renders his worship of the Lord impure, 10130, 390010, 3210; being cut off from Israel, 
denotes separation from the truth, 5302, 3654; and his being unclean because the water of 
separation was not sprinkled upon him, his uncleanness yet being upon him, denotes that he 
can only be restored by the application of the truth, which involves the confession that of 
himself he is nothing but evil, and hence that he is impure both as to the understanding and 
will, ver. 9, 10130, 683. 

14. This being the law when a man dies in a tent: every one that comes into the tent and every one 
that is in the tent being unclean seven days, denotes the law for purification from falsity 
grounded in evil; namely, every one affected with it, although the evil of that falsity be not his 
own, is yet impure and must be purified according to the order of regeneration; and every one 
to whom that evil appertains is impure, and must be purified according to the order of 
regeneration, 5407, 1566, 6901, 1293, 10130, 84, 716. 

15. Every open vessel which has no covering bound upon it being unclean, denotes that every one 

who is in spiritual truths, which are recipient of good; which, as yet, are not properly 
distinguished from natural things, and by which natural things are not regulated, is impure, 
4875, 5145, 10130. 

16. Whosoever in the open field touches one that is slain with the sword, or a dead body, or a bone
of a man, or a grave, being unclean seven days, denotes that every one, being a man of the 
church, who is contaminated with falsity, which is destruction of truth; by falsity from evil; by 
falsity from selfishness; or by falsity from the hells, is impure until fully regenerated, 6767, 
390010, 38129, 29166, 10130, 84, 716. 

17. Taking, for the unclean, of the ashes of the burning of the sin offering, and running water 
being put thereto in a vessel, denotes that such impurity can only be removed by the 

266

confession that man of himself is nothing but evil, and by the application thereto of the living 
truths of the Word, which have been received into the memory, 10130, ver. 9, 3424, 3079. 

18. A clean person taking hyssop and dipping it into the water, denotes that this must be effected 
by the operation of the truth of the Word as manifested in its literal sense, 4545, 7918, 3424; 
sprinkling denotes the conjunction of truth with good, and thus sanctification, 10047; the tent 
denotes the natural affections, 1566; the vessels denote the natural understanding, 3079; the 
persons that were there denote the interiors, 1293; and he who touched the bone, or the slain, 
or the dead, or the grave, denotes the spiritual or internal man which has been contaminated by
selfish feelings, by false persuasions, by falsities from evil, or by falsities from the hells, ver. 
16. 

19. The clean person sprinkling upon the unclean on the third day and upon the seventh day, 

denotes that this purification must be effected successively during regeneration until a state of 
good prevails, ver. 12; on the seventh day purifying him, denotes the complete removal of 
interior evils, 84, 716; washing his clothes and bathing himself in water, denotes the removal 
of exterior falsities and evils, 3147, 5006, 683; and being clean at even, denotes a consequent 
state of purity even as to the comparative obscurity of the external or natural man, 4545, 7844.

20. The man that is unclean and who does not purify himself being cut off from the midst of the 
assembly, or rather congregation, denotes that the man of the church who is conscious of his 
impurity, and yet deliberately remains in it, must of necessity be separated from all interior 
truths and good affections, 10130, vers. 7, 8, 5302, 7843; defiling the sanctuary of the Lord, 
denotes to profane the holy principles of the church, 10130, 3210; and the water of separation 
not having been sprinkled upon him, and his being unclean, denotes that he has not confessed 
that, of himself, he is nothing but evil, and that without this, impurity must remain, ver. 9, 
10047, 10130. 

21. It being a perpetual statute to them, denotes that this confession must be perpetual with the 
man of the church, 868, 7884; he that sprinkles the water of separation washing his clothes, 
denotes that every one making it sincerely will be purified externally as well as internally, 
10047, ver. 9, 3147, 5006; and he that touches the water of separation being unclean until the 
evening, denotes that indeed the slightest contact with truth contaminated by the persuasion 
that it is self-derived, must inevitably be impure, until the obscurity arising from such contact 
is at its end, 10130, ver. 9, 7844. 

22. Whatsoever the unclean person touches being unclean; and the soul that touches it being 

unclean until even, denotes that every truth is rendered impure by contact with evil; and that 
every contact with impure truth, produces a state of impurity that can only be removed in the 
course of regeneration, 10130, 1000, 1040, 7844. 

DISCUSSION

Every one surely may see that all the ceremonials of this chapter were not enjoined to the Israelites by a
direct revelation of the Lord Himself to Moses for the benefit of the Israelites, without containing in 
themselves interior spiritual instruction for the man of the church in all ages. We may therefore 
reverently study those ceremonials in the light of the doctrine of correspondences now made known to 
mankind in the Arcana Coelestia. Why, then, it may be asked, was this red heifer to be taken and to be 

267

given to Eleazar the priest, to be slain before his face, and her blood to be sprinkled toward the tent of 
meeting exactly seven times? It was because the heifer signifies the impure truth of the natural man, 
which is to be purified during the course of regeneration. But what is impure truth? Can the truth which
comes from the Lord through the Word be really impure? Certainly it cannot. And that is just why it 
was commanded that the heifer chosen should be without spot, perfect, and one not having borne the 
yoke. All these things the references show. And it is well for us that we should recognize this initial fact
concerning the truth. It is holy and inviolable; and no effort of man can contaminate it. For if we 
always thought of truth in that light and remembered the Divine commandment, "You shall not take the
name of the Lord your God in vain," we should live purer lives than we do live. But also there is 
another point. Why was the heifer to be red? It was because red denotes good, or affection, and 
especially natural affection; and natural affection also, as well as truth, as given to man by the Lord, is 
pure. But since this good is, before regeneration, corrupted by man's selfishness, therefore it becomes 
impure good, and defiles the truth which we learn from the Word, by misapplication. And thus we see 
what is meant by impure good and thence by impure truth, and also why the heifer was to be red. Now 
it is well known that we all act in the beginning of our lives from natural affection, without much 
thinking of whether our actions are right or wrong; and when we have learned some truths, we very 
often either ignore them, or contaminate them, so to speak, with our impure and selfish affections. And 
therefore we can easily see that we must be purified from our selfishness in order that the truth with us 
may be pure; and besides, it must be evident that we cannot be purified by anything else but the pure 
truth and good that are from the Lord.

And therefore, secondly, we can comprehend why the heifer was required to be especially one not 
having borne the yoke. It was to represent the necessity of not deliberately contaminating our truths.

We notice, however, the other points in the section, so as to have a clear conception of its scope, as a 
general introduction, in the spiritual sense to all that follows. The heifer was to be given to the priest to 
denote the acknowledgement that our natural life, as to affection and intelligence, is the continual gift 
of the Lord, and is to be devoted to Him. Here, then, is another fundamental and practical truth in 
religion. And yet how unwilling the natural man is, at first, to do this! But we take another step. 
Somebody was to slay the heifer before the eyes of the priest. And this means, generally, that there 
must be a preparation for purification. For the old selfish affection must be slain before the truth in us 
can be kept pure. Thus, then, the slaying truly signifies the work of repentance, or the continual 
rejection of evil as a sin against the Lord, which is signified by the slaying of the animal before the 
eyes of the priest, or in the light of truth proceeding from good, on account of the priest being Eleazar, 
which means God my help, or the help of God. But not only so; for there is one thing more. The priest 
was required to sprinkle the blood of the heifer seven times in front of the tent of meeting, to denote 
that regeneration consists in a progressive conjunction of truth with good according to the order of the 
three heavens, since every one is first natural, then spiritual, and then celestial according to his degree, 
and sprinkling denotes conjunction, while seven times denotes the holy process of regeneration from 
beginning to end, as the references show.

Having thus seen the general process, we are now to consider the particulars as set forth in the second 
section. And, first, there is the burning of the heifer in the presence of Eleazar. A burnt offering in the 
best sense signifies entire devotion to the Lord, but of course such an offering was burned upon the 
altar, and denoted consecration to the Lord by love to Him, because fire corresponds to love; while this 
heifer was not burned upon the altar, and hence the burning denotes purification by temptations, which 
are excitements of the lusts of the unregenerate man, on the one hand, and the influence of truth from 
good on the other, so that a conflict is produced, in which lusts and falsities are rejected, and thus the 

268

natural life is purified. And in fact, there is no other way of being purified from evil and falsity but this.
It was by this means that the Lord Himself glorified or made Divine His Human Nature while He was 
in the world, expelling from it all the hereditary tendencies to evil derived from the virgin mother, and 
thus it was in this way that, by His own power acting in His Human life, He offered Himself up as a 
burnt offering. And herein we may see the proper connection between the enduring of temptations, 
which is signified by burning, in one sense, and the consecration of the Human of the Lord to the 
Divine, or its union with the Divine signified by a burnt offering in another sense; for the former were 
the means by which the latter was effected. And, indeed, the former were the means by which all 
mankind were delivered from the absolute dominion of evil, on the one hand, which constitutes the 
work of Redemption, while the latter was the full identification of the Human with the Divine, which is
properly meant by the Atonement, so that every man who is willing may approach the Lord in worship, 
as the manifested God, continually reconciling mankind to Himself, and actually delivering each 
individual from evil, by enabling him to endure and overcome in temptations, to be conjoined for ever 
with Himself, and at the same lime, so to make his external man a perfect image and likeness of his 
internal, that by regeneration completed, he becomes a perfect angel in heaven, and a form of beauty 
and usefulness for ever.

Hence we may see, therefore, how very much is involved in the internal sense by the burning of the 
heifer.

But passing over the remaining particulars of this description of the burning, the meaning of which 
sufficiently appears from what is said in giving the references, we have to consider those which 
immediately follow. Since the heifer represents the impure truth of the natural man, we first observe in 
general that the slightest contact with what is spiritually impure requires that man should be cleansed 
by the operation of the truth of the Word, which is denoted by washing in water; and this is a 
correspondence very well understood by almost every one, from its being so frequently named in the 
Word, and also from the general practice of baptism in the Christian Church from its commencement. 
But who could have conceived that in the church of the past, and even with some at the present time, 
the act of baptism itself should have come to be considered as producing regeneration, even in an 
infant. On the contrary, how much more reasonable is it, and how much more according to the teaching
of the Word, to recognize that washing, or baptism, is but the representative of regeneration, and may, 
therefore, be properly applied to an infant!

Returning, however, from this slight digression, we have to notice that the priest, as well as he who 
burned the heifer, and he who gathered the ashes, required washing, this properly denoting spiritual 
purification by the truth in successive order from Internals to Externals; for this purification is from the 
Lord, and His procedure is thus, while, at the same time, it begins in the Externals and proceeds to the 
Internals according to the man's experience. And it is also to be observed, that, while the priest, and he 
who did the burning, were required to wash their clothes, and also their bodies, the "clean" man, who 
gathered the ashes, had only to wash his clothes, and yet remained unclean until the evening. That is, he
was externally impure by only gathering the ashes of the heifer, but not internally impure, still 
requiring external purification on account of that act. Now the first two cases in vers. 7-8, denote the 
complete purification of man. as to the understanding and will, denoted by washing the clothes and also
the body, and complete purification also as to the interior and exterior man signified respectively by the
priest and by him who burned the heifer; and then it follows, that this clean man, now represented by 
one person, who had gathered up the ashes of the heifer, was also required to wash only his clothes. 
What, then, does this signify? It means spiritually that when man has been purified, yet still there must 
be the removal of what has served its use, denoted by the ashes of the heifer, by means of purified truth 

269

with him. For as the. heifer represents the impure truth of the natural man, so its ashes denote the 
remnants of impure states, which, although they cannot be absolutely abolished, as was the Lord's 
hereditary maternal life by His glorification, 2159, 2265, may yet be so separated in the heavenly state, 
as to occasion no disturbance, and this process of removal is denoted by the ashes being taken and 
preserved without the camp in a clean place, this clean place denoting, not only the memory of man 
from which in reality nothing can ever be obliterated, but the pure state in which the discordant things 
therein become quiescent (868, 1581). Thus, then, the "ashes," that is what is signified by them, are 
outside the camp, so to speak, and are preserved.

But now follows the most interesting and particular part of this wonderful process. For the ashes were 
to be kept, it is said, for a water of separation. That is, they were to be mingled with the water by which
persons were representatively purified. In the internal sense, however, this keeping of the ashes for that 
purpose clearly denotes that the remembrance of past states of evil, error, and impurity, is useful to the 
man of the church, as an aid in his regeneration, because it teaches him that when left to himself, his 
tendency is to decline into evil, and that nothing can save him except good from the Lord received by 
means of truth, and that this truth, which is represented by water that purifies, necessarily involves the 
acknowledgement that of himself he is nothing but evil, since otherwise he would not need purification.
And hence we learn that this acknowledgement is so important, that no one ever was, or ever can be, 
admitted into heaven, and remain there, without it. For "man, notwithstanding his being regenerated, is 
nothing but evil and falsity; and to souls after death, this fact is shown to the life." Also a man "has 
nothing of good and truth except from the Lord, and he has all evil and falsity from the proprium." And
thus "every man, and every spirit, yea, and every angel, if left even in the least degree to himself, 
would rush spontaneously into hell.... This the angels acknowledge; and he who does not acknowledge 
it cannot be with the angels," 868. Hence, then, we now see what the ashes of the heifer, and the water 
of separation really signify, and thus that there is no one in heaven who has not been made conscious 
that of himself alone he is nothing but evil, and that he could not have become so conscious, but by 
having experienced regeneration, involving deliverance from evil by the Lord.

And now it follows, therefore, according to the series, that he who in the course of regeneration has 
been internally purified by the reception of good from the Lord, and also externally purified by 
overcoming the evils in his natural man, through victory in temptations, is yet liable, until his 
Judgement is accomplished, to a recurrence of evil thoughts, this fact being represented by the 
necessary washing of the clothes of him who only gathered up the ashes of the heifer, and of his being 
impure until the evening. This, then, is the interpretation of the last verse in the section, the actual 
washing denoting here the acknowledgement of the regenerated man that, of himself, he remains 
nothing but evil, and can only be withheld therefrom by the Lord through the state of heavenly good 
which he has realized.

But we come now to the last section, and notice, first, its contents from vers. 11 to 16, What, spiritually,
is the dead body of a man? It is an evil state that has been acknowledged, repented of, and rejected. 
And how do we accidentally or otherwise touch that "dead body"? We do so when the thought of that 
evil recurs. And what is our duty in this case? We must again and again reject evil with abomination 
and horror, 125. But if our repentance has not been genuine, but only external, or from a selfish motive,
then it does not constitute regeneration. We must mark well that teaching. Now look at ver. 13. We may
become a tabernacle of the Lord, that is, we may be in genuine worship. But also we may at that time 
touch the body of a dead man, we may, that is, indulge in an evil thought. What shall we then do? We 
must purify ourselves with the water of separation, that is, we must strengthen the acknowledgement 
that, of ourselves, we are nothing but evil; or we may—for we are still as yet at liberty to choose—fall 

270

back into actual sin. Let us, then, pray to the Lord and choose the better part. Again: we may die in a 
tent only, without defiling the tabernacle of the Lord, that is, the state of evil or falsity that recurs, may 
be of the natural and not of the spiritual man with us. Or it may even be a delusion from some evil 
spirit coming into our tent, or indeed our own evil that thus troubles us. Yet still we require 
regeneration, and, of course, the water of separation, spiritually, which is implied. But still again: the 
trouble caused by recurring evil, may only affect the external of the natural degree as to the will, 
denoted by an open vessel, or as to the understanding, signified by being in the field, and even then 
there is impurity and regeneration is required. And thus we see very clearly, that the internal sense is 
here in a series from internal states to external, and that evils and falsities of various kinds may 
endeavour to assert themselves with us even when our regeneration may be advanced.

And now, finally, we are to consider our duty in respect to these things, and also the evil consequences 
resulting from them. We must, in short, be in the perpetual acknowledgement that, of ourselves, we are 
only evil; that regeneration must continue until it is fully accomplished; and that persistent 
watchfulness is necessary lest we should violate the law of our Lord, all these being essential to our 
ultimate deliverance from evil, and on full establishment in good. But the contents of each verse, as 
given in the series, are sufficient for the purpose here required, without further illustration, since the 
various points named have already received attention. Since, however, touching signifies 
communication, translation, and reception, 10130, and, consequently, spiritual infection, we may learn 
an important lesson from this chapter, and in particular from the last two verses. Let us beware of this 
spiritual infection. Let us separate ourselves diligently from every slightest tendency to evil in 
ourselves; and let us rather, by a good life from the Lord, eagerly cultivate association with good men 
and angels, in order that we ourselves may become angels, and be eternally delighted in continually 
receiving good from the Lord, and in communicating good to others.

Numbers Chapter 20

SUMMARY OF THE SPIRITUAL SENSE

1. A change in the state of the church is described, ver. 1. 

2. The opposition of the external to the internal man in a state of temptation, involving deficiency

as to truths, and a state of discontent, contention and strife, vers. 2-6. 

3. There is revelation, that man, as of himself, must exercise the power of interior truth in 

controlling the natural man, and searching the Word, that the natural man may be refreshed; 
and, in this case, even the internal man does this from a state of indignation; and yet there is an
abundant supply of truths, vers. 7-11. 

4. But Divine Good declares that such intelligence and affection cannot lead man to the heavenly

state which is entirely from the Lord; and that even the truths of the Word in such 
circumstances appear to intensify the temptation, vers. 12-13. 

5. Concerning the tendency with the man of the church, in temptation, to suppose that natural 

good which is selfish good, provided there be truths, is a genuine means of leading to the 
heavenly life, vers. 14-21. 

6. Revelation is given that corrupted good, or merely representative worship, or external worship

separated from internal, must be rejected, since it can form no part of the heavenly life, vers. 
22-29. 

THE CONTENTS OF EACH VERSE

1. And the children of Israel, even the 
whole congregation, came into the 
wilderness of Zin in the first month: 
and the people abode in Kadesh; and
Miriam died there, and was buried 
there. 

1. But the man of the church, both as to the will and 
the understanding now passes into another state, 
which is one of the obscurity of the natural man 
arising from a tendency to defend the truth from 
selfish impulses, and yet, as regards the interiors, 
one of faith under the influence of the affection of 
truth, which is a state of contention about truths, in
which merely natural faith ceases and is 
extinguished. 

2. And there was no water for the 

2. And secondly, truths appear to fail, and the 

congregation: and they assembled 
themselves together against Moses 
and against Aaron. 

3. And the people strove with Moses, 
and spoke, saying, Would God that 
we had died when our brethren died 
before the LORD ! 

external man is elevated against the internal both 
as to truth and good. 

3. And the External is arrayed against the Internal 

from the affection and the perception that it would 
have been better to have yielded to the delights of 
the merely natural man, in previous states of 
conflict, than to suffer this trial. 

272

4. And why have you brought the 
assembly of the LORD into this 
wilderness, that we should die there, 
we and our cattle? 

4. For why is this obscurity with those who have 

truths from the Lord? And why does it appear that 
good affections both interior and exterior must 
perish? 

5. And wherefore have you made us to 
come up out of Egypt, to bring us in 
to this evil place? it is no place of 
seed, or of figs, or of vines, or of 
pomegranates; neither is there any 
water to drink. 

5. And why have we been led from the delights of 
the natural life into such conditions as this, in 
which we are deprived of truth, of good, and of 
knowledge as to spiritual good internal and 
external? A state in which, indeed, even general 
truths can neither be acquired nor appropriated! 

6. And Moses and Aaron went from the
presence of the assembly to the door 
of the tent of meeting, and fell upon 
their faces: and the glory of the LORD
appeared to them. 

6. But in this extremity interior principles are 
separated from the merely natural man; are 
brought into communication with essential truth 
leading to and derived from heavenly good, into a 
state of profound humility; and into the perception 
of heavenly good and truth from the Lord. 

7. And the LORD spoke to Moses, 

7. And hence there is revelation from the Lord by 

saying, 

Divine Truth giving further perception, 

8. Take the rod, and assemble the 

congregation, you, and Aaron your 
brother, and speak you to the rock 
before their eyes, that it give forth its
water; and you shall bring forth to 
them water out of the rock: so you 
shall give the congregation and their 
cattle drink. 

8. That man, as of himself, must exercise the power 
of interior truth, in controlling and bringing into 
order the natural man, but really from inmost truth 
and good; that there must be influx of life from the
Lord in searching the Word, so that comforting 
truth may appear, and thus that the natural man 
may be refreshed both inwardly and outwardly. 

9. And Moses took the rod from before 
the LORD, as he commanded him. 

9. And the internal man receives from the Lord the 

power to resist evil, by influx and correspondence.

10. And Moses and Aaron gathered the 
assembly together before the rock, 
and he said to them, Hear now, you 
rebels; shall we bring you forth 
water out of this rock? 

11. And Moses lifted up his hand, and 
smote the rock with his rod twice: 
and water came forth abundantly, 
and the congregation drank, and their
cattle. 

10. But the man of the church as to truth and good, in 
a state of temptation, controls and arranges the 
natural man, appealing to the Word; but, in this 
case, even the internal man is impelled to obey 
from a state of indignation and to search the Word 
from self-derived intelligence. 

11. And thus it happens that such intelligence and 

such affection applied to the Word, seem to be the 
cause of an abundance of truths for the support of 
the natural man internal and external. 

273

12. And the LORD said to Moses and 

Aaron, Because you believed not in 
me, to sanctify me in the eyes of the 
children of Israel, therefore you shall
not bring this assembly into the land 
which I have given them. 

12. But Divine Good declares, concerning such natural
intelligence and affection, that because they are 
contrary to true faith in the Lord, which ought to 
guide the man of the church, in devoting himself 
outwardly as well as inwardly to the service of the 
Lord, and this both as to good and truth, therefore 
they cannot lead man to the heavenly state, which 
is entirely from the Lord. 

13. These are the waters of Meribah; 

13. For even the truths of the Word under such 

because the children of Israel strove 
with the Lord, and he was sanctified 
in them. 

14. And Moses sent messengers from 
Kadesh to the king of Edom, Thus 
says your brother Israel, You know 
all the travail that has befallen us: 

influence seem to intensify temptation, and not to 
remove it, by a state of continual contention and 
strife, while yet it is the evil of the natural man, 
which causes the temptation by opposing Divine 
Good; and it is the Lord Himself who really 
delivers man, and brings the Natural into harmony 
with the Spiritual. 

14. Nevertheless, he who is only in representative 

worship merely external, is still persuaded from 
the natural affection of truth, that natural good, 
which is selfish good, provided there be only 
truths, is a genuine means of leading to the 
heavenly life, in conjunction with spiritual good, 
because it is in the natural life that regeneration is 
effected. 

15. How our fathers went down into 

15. And the man of the church is instructed and 

Egypt, and we dwelt in Egypt a long 
time; and the Egyptians evil 
entreated us, and our fathers: 

apparently supported by this persuasion, while yet 
natural love merely, is opposed to and destructive 
of spiritual love both as to understanding and will. 

16. And when we cried to the LORD, he 
heard our voice, and sent an angel, 
and brought us forth out of Egypt: 
and, behold, we are in Kadesh, a city
in the uttermost of your border: 

16. And only when the man of the church truly 

supplicates, the Lord, by His love and by His truth,
delivers him from the bondage of merely natural 
love, and endows him with the affection of truth, 
which is intermediate between the natural and 
spiritual man. 

274

17. Let us pass, I pray you, through your
land: we will not pass through field 
or through vineyards, neither will we
drink of the water of the wells: we 
will go along the kings high way, we
will not turn aside to the right hand 
nor to the left, until we have passed 
your border. 

18. And Edom said to him, You shall not
pass through me, lest I come out 
with the sword against you. 

17. For in the temptation, the man of the church 

desires to enjoy the delights of the merely natural 
life, at the same time that he is willing to avoid its 
evils, its falsities, and even its appearances of truth
from the Word by which it is supported; moreover 
he is willing to be guided by the leading principles
of the Word, to continue in the path of rectitude 
without being diverted by evils or by errors, and 
thus to keep himself free from the evils of the 
world while passing through it. 

18. But the truth is that the corrupted natural man is 
utterly opposed to the spiritual man, and desires 
his destruction by means of falsities derived from 
evil. 

19. And the children of Israel said to 

him, We will go up by the high way: 
and if we drink of your water, I and 
my cattle, then will I give the price 
thereof: let me only, without doing 
any thing else, pass through on my 
feet. 

19. Yet in spite of this warning, the temptation of the 
spiritual man continues; and he thinks he will 
pursue the path of rectitude; that if he imbibes 
false doctrines internal and external his redemption
is still secure; and thus he is still persuaded that he 
may gratify his natural man and yet suffer no 
injury. 

20. And he said, You shall not pass 

through. And Edom came out against
him with much people, and with a 
strong hand. 

21. Thus Edom refused to give Israel 
passage through his border: 
wherefore Israel turned away from 
him. 

20. But the truth dictates that this cannot be; that the 
corrupted natural man is utterly opposed to man's 
spiritual progress both in affection and thought. 

21. And this leads the spiritual man to see the true 
quality of the corrupted natural; that he cannot 
make progress in the spiritual life by tampering 
with it; and that he must, therefore, separate 
himself, and advance by means of uncontaminated 
truths. 

22. And they journeyed from Kadesh: 
and the children of Israel, even the 
whole congregation, came to mount 
Hor. 

22. But there follows this temptation as to truth and as 
to good, a change of state from the affection, or 
from the good, of truth to a further state of 
desolation arising from the corrupted natural man. 

23. And the LORD spoke to Moses and 
Aaron in mount Hor, by the border 
of the land of Edom, saying, 

23. In which there is influx from the Lord as to truth 

and as to good giving the perception, 

275

24. Aaron shall be gathered to his 

24. That corrupted good, or merely representative 

people: for he shall not enter into the
land which I have given to the 
children of Israel, because you 
rebelled against my word at the 
waters of Meribah. 

worship, or external worship separated from 
internal must be rejected, since it can form no part 
of the truly heavenly life which is from the Lord, 
because it is contrary to Divine Truth; causes a 
disregard or misunderstanding of internal 
promptings; and provokes contention and strife 
about truths. 

25. Take Aaron and Eleazar his son, and 

25. And thus corrupted worship, and the appearances 

bring them up to mount Hor: 

of truth by which it is supported must be 
completely desolated; 

26. And strip Aaron of his garments, and
put them upon Eleazar his son: and 
Aaron shall be gathered to his 
people, and shall die there. 

27. And Moses did as the LORD 

commanded: and they went up into 
mount Hor in the sight of all the 
congregation. 

26. Those who are in such worship must be deprived 

of the truths by means of which they have been 
able to simulate true worship; a new arrangement 
of those truths with those who are in truth 
conjoined with good must follow; those in external
worship without internal must be associated with 
their like in the life eternal; and such worship must
be entirely rejected. 

27. And this actually happens, according to Divine 
Order; and corrupted worship is desolated, this 
being fully perceived by the regenerated man; 

28. And Moses stripped Aaron of his 

28. Those who are in mere external worship are 

garments, and put them upon Eleazar
his son; and Aaron died there in the 
top of the mount: and Moses and 
Eleazar came down from the mount. 

deprived of truths; and those who are in genuine 
worship are fully supplied with them; corrupted 
worship is vastated even as to inmost things; and 
Divine Good and Divine Truth conjoined cease to 
be desolated. 

29. And when all the congregation saw 
that Aaron was dead, they wept for 
Aaron thirty days, even all the house 
of Israel. 

29. But when, with the man of the church, a prior state
passes away, and a new state succeeds, there is 
mourning on account of lost truths, because good 
now triumphs, and the affection of truth as well as 
the affection of good is distressed.

"Wherefore have you made us to come up out of Egypt to bring us into this evil place?" 
denotes why had the spiritual man been led from the delights of the natural life into such 
conditions as this? 7843, 7010, 9946, 6183, 2625; and it being no place of seed, or of figs, or 
of vines, or of pomegranates; while there was no water to drink, denotes a state in which he is 
deprived of truth, of good, and of knowledge as to spiritual good internal and external, as well 
as into a state in which, indeed, even general truths can neither be acquired nor appropriated, 
57, 511313, 9552, 2702, 3168. 

6. Moses and Aaron going from the presence of the assembly, or rather congregation, denotes 
that, in this extremity, interior principles are separated from the merely natural man, 7010, 
9946, 3030, 7843; the door of the tent of meeting, denotes communication with essential truth 
leading to and derived from good, 2356, 35403; falling upon their faces, denotes entering into 
a state of profound humility, 1999; and the glory of the Lord appearing to them, denotes the 
perception of heavenly good and truth from the Lord, 5922. 

7. This is evident, because by Jehovah is denoted the Divine Being as to His love, 2001; by 

speaking is denoted influx, 2051; by Moses is represented Divine Truth, or the Word, 7010; 
and by saying is denoted perception, 1822. 

8. Taking the rod, denotes that man, as of himself, must exercise the power of interior truth, 

4876; assembling the congregation, or gathering together the assembly, denotes controlling 
and bringing into order the natural man, 7843; you and Aaron your brother, denotes in reality 
from Divine Truth and Divine Good, 7010, 0946, 9806; speaking to the rock before their eyes, 
that it give forth its water, denotes that there must be the influx of life from the Lord in 
searching the Word, so that comforting truth may appear, 2951, 85817, 8582, 2403, 2702; 

277

bringing forth the water out of the rock, denotes that thus man may be refreshed, inwardly, 
2702, 85817, 7010; and giving the congregation, and their cattle drink, denotes that the natural 
man may be refreshed inwardly and outwardly, 7843, 6049, 3168. 

9. Moses taking the rod from before the Lord, as He commanded him, denotes that the internal 

man receives from the Lord the power to resist evil by influx and correspondence, because 
Moses denotes the internal man, 7010; receiving the rod denotes correspondence, ver. 8; and 
the Lord commanding denotes influx, 5486. 

10. Moses and Aaron gathering the assembly, or congregation, together before the rock, denotes 
that the man of the church as to truth and good in a state of temptation, controls and arranges 
the natural man appealing to the Word, 7010, 9946, 7843, 85817; and saying to them, "Hear 
now, you rebels; shall we bring you forth water out of this rock?" denotes that, in this case, 
even the internal man is impelled to obey from a state of indignation; and to search the Word 
from self-derived intelligence, 1822, 2542, 1668, 8582. 

11. Moses lifting up his hand and smiting the rock with his rod twice, denotes such intelligence 
and such affection applied to the Word, because by lifting up the hand and the rod is denoted 
the exercise of power, 5327, 4876, and by Moses smiting the rock twice is denoted the 
operation of the understanding and the will in a state of indignation, while by the rock is 
denoted the Word, 8851', 8852 683; the water coming forth abundantly denotes an appearance 
of abundance of truths, 2702; and the congregation, or assembly, and their cattle drinking, 
denotes the support of the natural man, internal and external, 7843, 6049, 3168. 

12. The Lord saying to Moses and Aaron, denotes perception given from Divine Good to the man 
of the corrupted, and merely representative church, or in other words, the dictate of Divine 
Good concerning such natural intelligence and affection, 2001, 1822, 8582; "Because you 
believed not me to sanctify me in the eyes of the children of Israel," denotes because they are 
contrary to true faith in the Lord, which ought to guide the man of the church, in devoting 
himself outwardly as well as inwardly to the service of the Lord, and this both as to good and 
truth, 2001, 30, 8042, 2403, 3654; and "therefore you shall not bring this assembly," or rather 
congregation, "into the land which I have given them," denotes that they cannot lead man to 
the heavenly state, which is entirely from the Lord, 7843, 8898, 8899. 

13. These being the waters of Meribah; because the children of Israel strove with the Lord, and He
was sanctified in them, denotes that even the truths of the Word, under such influence, seem to
intensify temptation and not to remove it, by a state of continual contention and strife, while 
yet it is the evil of the natural man, which causes the temptation by opposing Divine Good; 
and it is the Lord Himself who really delivers man, and brings the Natural into harmony with 
the Spiritual, 2702, 1678, 3654, 2001, 1571, 2768, 8042. 

14. Here Moses denotes those who are in representative worship merely external as the content of 
the internal sense shows, ver. 12; his sending messengers from Kadesh, denotes persuasion 
from the natural affection of truth, 1678, 2503, 4239; the king of Edom denotes natural good, 
which is selfish good, to which truths are adjoined, 3322; his saying "your brother" Israel, 
denotes the assumption that natural good is a genuine means of leading to the heavenly life in 
conjunction with spiritual good, 3815, 3654; and "you know all the travail that has befallen 
us," denotes that it is in the natural life that regeneration is effected, 3322, 3318. 

278

15. "How our fathers went down into Egypt, and we dwelt in Egypt a long time; and the Egyptians

evil entreated us and our fathers," denotes that the man of the church is instructed, and 
apparently supported by this persuasion, while yet natural love merely is opposed to, and 
destructive of spiritual love, both as to understanding and evil, 1461, 6169, 2712, 6666, 37032.

16. Crying to the Lord denotes supplication, 6801; the Lord hearing their voice denotes that by 
His love and truth He delivers man, 6802, 6803, 4085; an angel denotes what is from the 
Divine, and thus love and truth, 4085; bringing the Israelites out of Egypt denotes deliverance 
from the bondage of merely natural love, 8866; and being in Kadesh, a city in the border of 
Edom, denotes being endowed with the affection of truth which is intermediate between the 
natural and spiritual man, 1678, 402, 3322, 8063. 

17. "Let us, I pray you, pass through your land," denotes that in the temptation the man of the 

church desires to enjoy the delights of the merely natural life, 3322, 3992; "we will not pass 
through field or vineyard, neither will we drink of the water of the wells," denotes that he is 
willing to avoid its evils and its falsities, and even its appearances of truth from the Word by 
which he is supported, 4440, 511710, 3168, 2702; "we will go by the king's high way," denotes
to be willing to be guided by the leading principles of the Word, 3335, 1672, 2234; "we will 
not turn aside to the right hand or to the left," denotes to continue in the path of rectitude, 
without being diverted by evils or errors, 4816, 9511; and "until we have passed your border," 
denotes to keep free from the evils of the world while passing through it, 3322, 3992, 8063. 

18. By Edom saying, "You shall not pass through me, lest I come out with the sword against you,"

is denoted that the corrupted natural man is utterly opposed to the spiritual man, and desires 
his destruction by means of falsities derived from evil, 3322, 1822, 3992, 8187, 279915. 

19. The children of Israel saying to him, "We will go by the high way," denotes that in spite of this
warning the temptation of the spiritual man continues, and he thinks he will pursue the path of 
rectitude, 3654, 1822, 3335, 1672, 2234; "if we drink of the water, I and my cattle," denotes 
that if he imbibes false doctrines internal and external, 3168, 2702, 3654, 6049; "then will I 
give the price thereof," denotes that his redemption is still secure, 2959, 2966; and "let me 
only, without doing any thing else, pass through on my. feet," denotes that he is still persuaded
that he may gratify his natural man, and yet suffer no injury, 4997, 3992, 2162. 

20. His saying, "You shall not pass through"; and Edom coming out against him with much 

people, and with a strong hand, denotes that the truth dictates that this cannot be; and that the 
natural man is utterly opposed to man's spiritual progress, both in affection and thought, 3322, 
3992, 8187, 8279, 1259, 8050. 

21. By Edom refusing to give Israel a passage through his border; and by Israel turning away from
him, is denoted that the spiritual man is led to see the true character of the corrupted Natural; 
that he cannot make progress in the spiritual life by tampering with it; and that he must, 
therefore, separate himself, and advance by means of uncontaminated truths, 3322, 3993, 
8063, 6226. 

22. The children of Israel, even the whole congregation, or rather assembly, journeying from 

Kadesh, and coming to mount Hor, denotes that following this temptation, as to truth and as to 
good, is a change of state from the affection, or from the good, of truth, to a further state of 
desolation arising from the corrupted natural man, 3654, 7843, 1457, 1678, 16754. 

279

23. The Lord speaking to Moses and to Aaron, saying, denotes influx from the Lord as to truth and
as to good giving perception, 2001, 2951, 7010, 9946, 1822; and in mount Hor, by the border 
of the land of Edom, denotes in a state of desolation arising from the corrupted natural man, 
16754, ver. 16. 

24. "Aaron shall be gathered to his people," denotes that corrupted or merely representative 

worship, or external worship separated from internal, must be rejected, 8588, 9928, 3255, 
4619; "for he shall not enter into the land which I have given to the children of Israel," denotes
since it can form no part of the truly heavenly life which is from the Lord, 8898, 8899; and 
"because you rebelled against my word at the waters of Meribah," denotes because it is 
contrary to Divine Truth; causes a disregard or misunderstanding of internal promptings; and 
provokes contention and strife about truths, 2001, 1288, vers. 8, 13. 

25. "Take Aaron and Eleazar his son and bring them up to mount Hor," denotes that thus corrupted
worship, and the appearances of truth by which it is supported, must be completely desolated, 
8588, 9928, 9812, 9813, 16754. 

26. "Strip Aaron of his garments and put them upon Eleazar his son," denotes that those who are 
in such worship must be deprived of the truths by means of which they have been able to 
simulate true worship, a new arrangement of those truths with those who are in truth conjoined
with good following, 8588, 9928, 4741, 9952, 9812, 9813; and "Aaron shall be gathered to his
people, and shall die there," denotes that those in external worship without internal must be 
associated with their like in the life eternal; and that such worship must be entirely rejected, 
3255, 4619, 10244. 

27. Moses doing as the Lord commanded, and their going up into mount Hor in the sight of all the 
congregation, denotes that this actually happens according to Divine Order, and that corrupted 
worship is desolated, this being fully perceived by the regenerated man, 7010, 4258, 5486, 
1728, 1675, 2403, 7843. 

28. Moses stripping Aaron of his garments, and putting them upon Eleazar his son, denotes that 

those who are in merely external worship are deprived of truths; and that those who are in 
genuine worship are fully supplied with them, ver. 26; Aaron dying there in the top of the 
mount, denotes that corrupted worship is vastated even as to its inmost things, ver. 26, 8827; 
and Moses and Eleazar coming down from the mount, denotes that Divine Good and Divine 
Truth conjoined cease to be desolated, 7010, 9946, 5637, 1675. 

29. The congregation, or rather, the assembly, seeing that Aaron was dead, and weeping for him 

thirty days even all the house of Israel, denotes that when, with the man of the church, a prior 
state passes away and a new state succeeds, there is mourning on account of lost truth, because
good now triumphs, and the affection of truth, as well as the affection of good, is distressed, 
7843, ver. 28, 2910, 3608, 6539, 9082, 2233, 4286. 

DISCUSSION

Wonderful are the changes of state through which the man of the church passes in the course of his 
regeneration; and such a change is described in the beginning of this chapter. Hence, then, from the 
correspondences we shall be able to realize whether we have been in anything like this state. To begin 
with, it was an obscure state signified by a wilderness; and it clearly appears that it was a state of faith 

280

and not so much a state of charity, because that is the signification of a month, which has relation to the
moon, as a state of charity or love has to the sun. And just as the moon derives her light from the sun, 
so does faith take its quality from love and charity, and also from selfish and worldly love, when it is 
influenced by those loves. Many times in his life does a man use his faith for selfish purposes; and this 
is just the state here described. For Zin means a buckler and also coldness, a buckler, of course, 
corresponding to the faith which defends like a shield, as Paul says, and coldness to the absence of 
love, with, at the same time, the activity of selfishness.

But this is only the state of the external man, while what follows describes something more interior. For
by the people abiding in Kadesh, which means what is holy, is denoted such a state, and by Miriam 
dying there is denoted the cessation of faith merely natural. But still this interior state was by no means 
a perfect one, since there was contention about truths, and this also is signified by Kadesh. Now all 
these things are shown in the places to which reference is given; and it is only necessary to add that all 
such fluctuating experiences as these, are, of course, the result of the continued activity of the selfish 
affections on the one hand, and of the love of truth on the other.

Proceeding, however, a step further, we notice that the temptation continues and becomes intensified; 
for truths fail with the spiritual man, and this is aptly represented by a scarcity of water. In the literal 
sense the want of water under the circumstances described was a very great calamity, because of the 
two general uses it serves. For it is both a cleanser and also a nourisher. No wonder, therefore, that the 
people were discontented and complained. But, spiritually, water corresponds to the truth of the Word, 
and many illustrations of this are to be met with in various parts of Scripture; but perhaps none are 
more interesting than the account of the Lord's conversation with the woman of Samaria at Jacob's 
well. "Whosoever drinks of this water shall thirst again: but whoever drinks of the water that I shall 
give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing 
up into everlasting life." That is, merely natural truth does not satisfy the soul of man; but spiritual truth
does so, and its only source is the Lord God the Saviour. And as water signifies the truth of the Word, 
so the two uses of water correspond respectively to purification from sin, and the nourishment of the 
soul; for by the truth we overcome evil, and by it also our spiritual life is supported as we journey 
through the wilderness of this world to the celestial state of heavenly love. And really it is a very grand 
thing for the man of the church when he thirsts for the living waters of Divine Truth. And it is a good 
thing for him when he is very eager for it, even though there may be contention and strife in attaining 
to it on account of the waywardness and contrariety of his natural affections. We may study with 
advantage, therefore, the internal sense of this section as given in the series, and particularly the interior
state of the spiritual man under the circumstances.

Here, then, are four things. When the natural man is so active as just described, interior principles are 
drawn inwards, and these are represented by Moses and Aaron, for those principles are Divine Truth 
and Divine Good. Secondly, they approach the door of the tent of meeting, signifying that there is 
communication with essential truth derived from good, or, in other words, with the Lord, Who is the 
door. Thirdly, there is a state of humiliation before the Lord, denoted by falling upon the face. And, 
lastly, there is revelation, or the perception of heavenly good and truth, denoted by the glory of the 
Lord appearing. And this verse, therefore, while cohering with the series, at the same time exhibits 
what happens in the general course of regeneration. For, first, there must be with all who are 
regenerated, separation from evil; secondly, there must be the acknowledgement of the Lord; thirdly, a 
state of humiliation will follow involving the confession that man, of himself, is nothing but evil; and, 
lastly, there will be the reception of truth and goodness. And this is very often the case in the internal 
sense of the Word, one striking example of which is Matt, xxv., which, as a whole, is descriptive of the 

281

process of the Judgement, each of the three parts into which it is divided presenting an aspect of that 
process, while yet describing it fully; and yet the three parts taken together denoting Judgement as to 
the affections; as to the intellect, and as to the actions of the life.

The third section presents us with another picture, however, and is worthy of careful study. And, first, it
is to be observed that the rod or staff, which was taken by Moses on this occasion, was the rod of 
Aaron, and, therefore, denoted truth from good in its power; and it is said, therefore, that man as of 
himself must exercise the power of interior truth, because it is afterwards said that Moses took the rod 
from before the Lord, the act of taking it according to the command of the Lord, denoting reciprocal 
action on the part of man and thus the correspondence of man with the Lord, and of the external man 
with the internal, when man willingly obeys the Lord, 48763, for there can only be this correspondence,
when man acts as of himself, and it is broken when man presumes to act of himself and is disobedient 
to the Lord. And indeed this is a most important distinction, as the story shows, since afterwards Moses
disobeyed by striking the rock instead of speaking to it, and thus acted of himself and not as of himself,
and consequently he and Aaron lost the privilege of entering into the promised land, for the latter 
evidently acted with the former, because Moses said, "Shall we bring you forth water out of this rock?" 
Hence, then, spiritually, when we act according to the Divine commandments, we act as of ourselves in
the proper exercise of our freedom and reason; but when we disobey we act of ourselves through the 
abuse of our freedom and reason. And hence, also, we see that it is willing obedience that gives 
correspondence and conjunction with the Lord, and not an imperfect obedience such as is here 
illustrated by Moses striking the rock, and not speaking to it as he had on this occasion been told to do. 
Let us beware, therefore, of acting selfishly, either in regard to the worship of the Lord in the sanctuary,
or in performing the various uses of life.

And again, we may also reflect on the fact that although Moses disobeyed, yet the water came forth 
abundantly from the rock. Why was this? It was because there was a partial obedience; and because, in 
the best sense, striking the rock twice corresponded to obedience both as to the understanding and will, 
and from humility of heart, and not from a hard heart, 3582, and even representative obedience had its 
correspondential effect at that time. Also, spiritually, an outward act of obedience to the laws of Divine 
Order produces a good result, and hence a man may from selfish and worldly motives perform many 
uses for the benefit of others, study the Word, learn its truths, and even preach and teach truths, and 
thus be a means of much good to others, without himself loving the good and the true, and so practising
them as to be regenerated thereby. And this is really the meaning of the words of Paul when he said, 
"And though I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I
have all faith so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing. And though I 
bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burned, and have not charity it 
profits me nothing" (1 Cor 13:2-3).

But the next short section shows all these truths in a remarkable way, and also how the best of men may
be betrayed, in states of temptation and trial, into actions, which in their hearts they yet despise and 
abominate. And also with regard to Moses and Aaron not being allowed to enter into the promised land,
we are clearly to understand that this historical fact represented that merely natural truths and love 
cannot enter into the heavenly kingdom; but must be fully rejected by man in the course of his 
regeneration, while yet the spiritual or celestial natural man does enjoy all heavenly delights in the 
ultimate degree of his life, because the new natural degree in every regenerated man is from the internal
or spiritual, and thus "the old natural, being formed of evils and falsities, must become as nothing, and 
when it becomes as nothing the man is gifted with a new natural, which is called the spiritual natural, 
spiritual from the circumstance that the spiritual is what acts by its means, and manifests itself by it, as 

282

the cause by the effects; and it is well known that the cause is the all of the effect; hence the new 
natural, as to thinking, willing, and producing effect, is merely a representative of the spiritual. When 
this is the case the man receives good from the Lord, and when he receives good, he is gifted with 
truths, and when he is gifted with truths, he is perfected in intelligence and wisdom, and when he is 
perfected in intelligence and wisdom, he is blessed with happiness to eternity," 56514. And now it is 
proper to add that we are not to infer from the circumstance that Moses and Aaron did not enter 
Canaan, that neither did they enter heaven after death; for at any rate we know that Moses did so (Matt 
17:3). But with regard to the second part of the section, namely, that the truth appears to cause 
contention and strife, experience shows that this is the case so long as men are in the state of truth 
leading to good, because the man of the church, as he advances in regeneration, becomes more and 
more anxious about the attainment of genuine truths; and besides this, the states of men vary so much, 
and freedom requires that each should form his own conception of the truth, which presents itself under
a different aspect to every one according to his prevailing state as to good; and the imperfection of the 
merely natural man intensifies these differences, until self is subdued, and charity begins to prevail.

But now we see in what follows, that the spiritual man is not only troubled in the course of his 
regeneration, by contentions about truths; for he is also persuaded that the merely natural affections 
will help him on the way to heaven. And all the particulars given, therefore, in this fifth section are 
really very interesting. And to begin with, how striking is this message of Moses to the king of Edom, 
as a description of the way in which we all desire, on our spiritual journey, to temporize and tamper 
with the merely natural man. In fact, we are quite charmed with him, because we have truths through 
his means; for it does appear to be the case, because, surely, the spiritual and the natural man are 
brothers! In the best sense indeed it is so; but, all the same, this thought of the regenerating man, which 
appears to be spiritual, is in reality from the merely natural. And here we may note how very insidious 
are our spiritual enemies, as they operate by influx upon us through our merely natural feelings, which 
seem to be quite proper! Here, then, is an important lesson for us.

And now just mark what follows. This natural man has been well instructed. He knows all about us. 
And no wonder, indeed, because it has been under his influence that we have acquired our first 
experiences of the spiritual life. For the oppression of the Egyptians has been very great, and we cannot
forget it. It arose from two sources. Our natural delights were then so strong that they compelled our 
obedience to them; and also the king of Egypt, or the truth as we then knew it, was exceedingly 
distasteful, so that our obedience to it also was a sore trial. How disagreeable was it for us even to learn
truths against our inclinations, and much more so to comply outwardly and unwillingly with their 
requirements! Yes, we remember it all; and that, also, these first troubles were not the worst, but that 
others followed, for there was the brick making, and the building, or the activity of the merely natural 
understanding and will with their vain thoughts and their foolish imaginations. And, secondly, we 
cannot forget the time when our deliverer came in the form of Divine Truth, or the Word, signified by 
Moses, and the Spirit of the Lord operating through it and causing our spiritual enemies to let us go 
free, that we might worship the Lord, even though in the wilderness, or very obscurely.

And yet now here we are, tampering with the old enemy in a new guise. For he is no longer an 
Egyptian, but an Edomite, and our brother. And we think we can travel through his country either 
without imbibing his falsities, or if we do so, by paying a fair price and receiving no injury; for we 
persuade ourselves that we will go by the king's high way; and we will be very conscientious. Now 
how many of us, spiritual men although we have been, have deluded ourselves in this way, by 
supposing that the merely natural man so well instructed, can not only do us no harm, but help us 
greatly. But now, lastly, we learn how this experience may be good for us. For the temptation brings out

283

the real character of merely natural love, which is essentially selfish; the spiritual man now sees this; 
and he turns another way by determining to make progress by means of uncontaminated principles of 
real truth and goodness. Let every man of the church, therefore, so determine.

Coming now to the last section, it is to be observed that an entirely different subject occurs in the literal
sense. But in the internal sense there is a connection; for it is evident that after the regenerating man has
passed through the temptations described by the deficiency of water and the desire to pass through 
Edom, which denote, respectively, contentions concerning truths, and the delusion that merely natural 
good is conducive to regeneration, it naturally follows in the series, that external worship separated 
from internal is rejected, which is represented by the death of Aaron on mount Hor. And, first, it is said 
that the children of Israel journeyed from Kadesh to mount Hor, to denote a change of state from the 
affection of truth in which there has been contention, to another state of temptation, in which there is 
desolation as to truth and good, because Hor means, in the best sense, that which conceives or shows, 
and also a mountain, thus denoting an elevated state; but in the opposite sense a state of desolation, 
16754; and as, moreover, mount Hor was upon the border of Edom, it thus denotes the influence of the 
merely natural man, ver. 16. And we now see, therefore, why mount Hor was the place where Aaron 
died, and where Eleazar took his place.

But, of course, the main spiritual teaching in this section is the change of state as to worship, and the 
consequent transfer of truths from those who are in merely representative and external worship to those
who are in genuine worship. Or, to express it with regard to the individual, it is a change in which 
truths are no longer used for selfish purposes, and in which they are used entirely for the glory of the 
Lord and the general good of mankind. For he only truly worships the Lord, who truly devotes his life 
to the service of man; and we say truly because the man who is without truths, although he may have 
the desire, is not properly supplied with the means of doing good. Hence, therefore, the great lesson to 
be learned from this section is, that if we wish to preserve our truths, we must diligently cultivate 
unselfishness, for it is one of the fundamental laws of human life that, in the perfect heavenly state, our 
truths must be in complete harmony with our state as to love and charity, and consequently in complete 
harmony with our eternal capacity for the performance of uses.

Numbers Chapter 21

SUMMARY OF THE SPIRITUAL SENSE

1. A temptation from the merely natural man, through its rational faculty, is described, vers. 1-3. 

2. Another temptation causing distress on account of falsities from evil, during which there is a 
tendency to return to merely natural states, and sensual lusts prevail; but there is application to
the Word, and earnest prayer for deliverance, and then revelation that the Lord's Human is to 
be made Divine through temptations, and that, therefore, every one in the church has power 
from Him, by faith, to overcome the promptings of the sensual life, vers. 4-9. 

3. Other changes of state in which the man of the church is protected, vers. 10-20. 

4. And lastly, he is disposed, in another state of temptation, to temporize with evils in general; 
but discovering his error, resists his enemies, both generally and in particular, by the help of 
the Lord, and thus the external man is subdued, both as to selfish love and worldly love, vers. 
21-35. 

THE CONTENTS OF EACH VERSE

1. And the Canaanite, the king of Arad,
which dwelt in the South, heard tell 
that Israel came by the way of 
Atharim; and he fought against 
Israel, and took some of them 
captive. 

2. And Israel vowed a vow to the 

LORD, and said, If you will indeed 
deliver this people into my hand, 
then I will utterly destroy their cities.

3. And the LORD hearkened to the voice
of Israel, and delivered up the 
Canaanites; and they utterly 
destroyed them and their cities: and 
the name of the place was called 
Hormah. 

1. And now therefore it happens that the natural man 
as to the Rational which is in external worship 
separated from internal, and in natural intelligence,
is affected by the state of the internal man, which 
is advancing towards the heavenly life; and 
conflict follows during which the freedom of the 
spiritual man is interrupted. 

2. But still, in the new state, the spiritual man is 
willing that the Lord may provide, and is 
consequently favoured with the perception that by 
overcoming the evil tendency in himself, his 
natural man will be consecrated to the Lord. 

3. And the Lord, in answer to earnest prayer, delivers
the man of the church from merely external 
worship, which is utterly rejected both in life and 
doctrine, so that now a state of true devotion is 
initiated.

4. And they journeyed from mount Hor
by the way to the Red Sea, to 
compass the land of Edom: and the 
soul of the people was much 
discouraged because of the way. 

4. And thus progress is made from a state of 
desolation as to truths into another state of 
temptation from the hells, not arising from the 
corrupted natural man as to its false doctrines, so 
much as from interior distress on account of 
falsities from evil; 

5. And the people spoke against God, 
and against Moses, Wherefore have 
you brought us up out of Egypt to 
die in the wilderness? for there is no 
bread, and there is no water; and our 
soul loatheth this light bread. 

5.

In which state Divine Truth, internal and external, 
is, as it were, despised; the tendency is to return to 
the state of the merely natural man and to reject 
regeneration because there are no remains of 
heavenly good and truth; and the good of truth, 
according to the needs of the state, is utterly 
disgusting. 

6. And the LORD sent fiery serpents 

6. The consequence of which is that sensual lusts 

among the people, and they bit the 
people; and much people of Israel 
died. 

begin to gain dominion, and much injury is done, 
both to the truth of the church and to its principles 
of good. 

7. And the people came to Moses, and 
said, We have sinned, because we 
have spoken against the LORD, and 
against you; pray to the LORD, that 
he take away the serpents from us. 
And Moses prayed for the people. 

8. And the LORD said to Moses, Make 
you a fiery serpent, and set it upon a 
standard: and it shall come to pass, 
that every one that is bitten, when he
sees it, shall live. 

9. And Moses made a serpent of brass, 

and set it upon the standard: and it 
came to pass, that if a serpent had 
bitten any man, when he looked to 
the serpent of brass, he lived. 

7. Wherefore there is earnest application to the Word;
it is confessed that evil tendencies have prevailed, 
and that perception has been lost both as to good 
and as to truth; while earnest prayer and 
intercession follows for deliverance. 

8. And hence there is revelation from the Lord by the
Word that the Human is to be made Divine even as
to the sensual and corporeal degrees by combats 
against hereditary tendencies to evil, or against all 
the hells and by victories over them; and that 
therefore every one in the church who, in 
temptation, flees from and contends against the 
evils of the natural man, has power from the Lord 
by faith in Him to overcome also, and to enjoy 
eternal life. 

9. And therefore it happens in the church, generally, 
that the Human of the Lord is acknowledged to be 
Divine by such combats and victories; and that 
when man, in temptations, suffers from evils 
arising from the abuse of his sensual nature, and 
by application to the Lord and faith in Him, 
conquers those evils, he comes into the enjoyment 
of eternal life. 

286

10. And the children of Israel journeyed,

10. But the man of the church is now let into states of 

and pitched in Oboth. 

the merely natural life; 

11. And they journeyed from Oboth, and

11. And thence into states in which evils are 

pitched at Iye-abarim, in the 
wilderness which is before Moab, 
toward the sunrising. 

predominant, inducing new temptations and a state
of obscurity from the proximity of adulterated 
good springing from selfish love, 

12. From thence they journeyed, and 
pitched in the valley of Zered. 

13. From thence they journeyed, and 

pitched on 

12. Which naturally leads to a state still more external,
in which there is a consciousness of adulterated 
good, 

13. And thence into free natural delight, by which the 
other side of Arnon, which is in the wilderness, 
that comes out of the border of the Amorites: for 
Arnon is the border of Moab, between Moab and 
the Amorites. ultimate truth and good are vitiated, 
and consequently into the obscurity of evil and 
falsity derived from it. For the truth of the Word 
perverted by adulterated good is the limit between 
that good and actual evil. 

14. Wherefore it is said in the book of 

14. Wherefore in the Ancient Word, which describes 

the Wars of the LORD, 
Vaheb in Suphah, 
And the valleys of Arnon, 

15. And the slope of the valleys

That inclineth toward the dwelling of
Ar,
And leaneth upon the border of 
Moab. 

the combats of the Lord with the hells, and also the
temptations of the man of the church, it is written: 
"He endured the extreme temptation by receiving 
influx from the hells, and from natural delights 
thence by the assumption of the Human in 
ultimates; 

15. And there is an intermediate state. He conquered 
the infernals, even as to their inmost evils and 
falsities, through which good is adulterated. 

16. And from there they journeyed to 
Beer: that is the well whereof the 
LORD said to Moses, Gather the, 
people together, and I will give them
water. 

16. Therefore the man of the church from similar 
states is delivered, and is comforted from the 
Word; for Divine Truth has ordained that thus, 
after temptation, he should be refreshed with 
abundance of truths. 

17. Then sang Israel this song:

17. So that he rejoices in the Lord with all his heart, 

Spring up, O well; sing you to it: 

and delights in His Word with all the power of his 
intellect. 

287

18. The well, which the princes dug,
Which the nobles of the people 
delved,
With the sceptre, and with their 
staves. 
And from the wilderness they 
journeyed to Mattanah: 

18. For, as from himself, by primary truths, he is 

enabled to search the Word; and as from himself, 
from good affections to penetrate its mysteries; 
while the Lord Himself operates inwardly, and 
man co-operates outwardly; and thus for obscurity 
he receives enlightenment from the Lord. 

19. And from Mattanah to Nahaliel: and 

19. But from this temporary state there is a decline to 

from Nahaliel to Bamoth: 

falsifications of truth; thence to a state of 
corrupted worship; 

20. And from Bamoth to the valley that 
is in the field of Moab, to the top of 
Pisgah, which looks down upon the 
desert. 

20. And thence to a state of adulterated good exterior 

and interior, indicating the proximity of another 
state of desolation and temptation. 

21. And Israel sent messengers to Sihon 

21. For the spiritual man is disposed to temporize with

king of the Amorites, saying, 

evils and thence thinks, 

22. Let me pass through your land: we 
will not turn aside into field, or into 
vineyard; we will not drink of the 
water of the wells: we will go by the 
king's high way, until we have 
passed your border. 

23. And Sihon would not suffer Israel to 
pass through his border: but Sihon 
gathered all his people together, and 
went out against Israel into the 
wilderness, and came to Jahaz: and 
he fought against Israel. 

22. That he may contemplate such evils without being 

drawn from the path of rectitude either into their 
voluntary or intellectual delights; or without 
imbibing their falsities, or being in the slightest 
degree contaminated with them. 

23. He discovers, however, that evil is of such a 

character that this cannot be; that falsities from 
evil are combined together against him under their 
prevailing motive; that a state of obscurity ensues; 
that this takes place in the intermediate state; and 
that a conflict follows. 

24. And Israel smote him with the edge 
of the sword, and possessed his land 
from Arnon to Jabbok, even to the 
children of Ammon: for the border 
of the children of Ammon was 
strong. 

24. But the spiritual man overcomes evil by the power 
of Divine Truth from the Lord, thus gaining 
possession of the natural man, even to the rejection
of its ultimate evils and to the dispersion of its 
falsified truths; for such truths appear to be very 
powerful against good and truth. 

25. And Israel took all these cities: and 

Israel dwelt in all the cities of the 
Amorites, in Heshbon, and in all the 
towns thereof. 

25. Moreover, the spiritual man now gains entire 
control of the natural understanding with its 
powers, which evil had before; and especially of 
the rational faculty of the natural man, and the 
affections of truth thereto belonging. 

288

26. For Heshbon was the city of Sihon 
the king of the Amorites, who had 
fought against the former king of 
Moab, and taken all his land out of 
his hand, even to Arnon. 

26. For this faculty which is fruitful in devices, is 
highly prized even by the wicked, who, by its 
means, engage in conflict with those who are in 
adulterated good, depriving them of those things 
by which they corrupt good and truth, even of the 
literal sense of the Word, which they pervert. 

27. Wherefore they that speak in 

27. Wherefore the Ancient Word, through the medium 

proverbs say, 
Come you to Heshbon, 
Let the city of Sihon be built and 
established: 

of its correspondences, teaches: "that the 
understanding of the merely natural man is 
predominant with the wicked, both as to thought 
and as to affection; 

28. For a fire is gone out of Heshbon, 
A flame from the city of Sihon: 
It has devoured Ar of Moab, 
 The lords of the high places of 
Arnon. 

28. That the love of the world and the love of self act 
through it as a means; that it overwhelms the 
pretensions, of those who are in the doctrines of 
corrupted good, even of those whose worship 
internally and externally is alike adulterated. 

29. Woe to you, Moab! 

You are undone, O people of 
Chemosh: 
He has given his sons as fugitives, 
And his daughters into captivity, 
Unto Sihon king of the Amorites. 

29. For such worship is doomed to destruction, and its 
falsities, even as to their inmost principles, are 
worthless, for its corrupted truths are no longer 
conjoined with good affections, and its perverted 
affections are no longer sustained by truths, and 
consequently become the slaves of falsity from 
evil. 

30. We have shot at them; 

30. And such falsities tend to the destruction of 

Heshbon is perished even to Dibon, 
And we have laid waste even to 
Nophah, 
Which reacheth to Medeba. 

adulterated good, and also devastate its perverted 
rational faculty internally and externally, as well as
its external affection for knowledge by which it 
supports itself from the literal sense of the Word." 

31. Thus Israel dwelt in the land of the 

Amorites. 

31. And in this way the spiritual man is triumphant, 
and completely overcomes the natural man. 

32. And Moses sent to spy out Jazer, and
they took the towns thereof, and 
drove out the Amorites that were 
there. 

32. And now, therefore, the doctrine of good works is 
truly investigated; it is become subservient to 
heavenly purposes; and every evil which had 
defiled it is expelled. 

33. And they turned and went up the 

33. And now, having overcome the false principle 

way of Bashan: and Og the king of 
Bashan went out against them, he 
and all his people, to battle at Edrei. 

derived from evil; there is made a fresh advance 
towards the destruction of essential evil itself 
which, with all its falsities, enters into conflict 
with the man of the church, when good begins to 
be confirmed in him. 

289

34. And the LORD said to Moses, Fear 
him not: for I have delivered him 
into your hand, and all his people, 
and his land; and you shall do to him
as you did to Sihon king of the 
Amorites, which dwelt at Heshbon. 

35. So they smote him, and his sons, and

all his people, until there was none 
left him remaining: and they 
possessed his land. 

34. Hence, therefore, there is revelation from the Lord 
by Divine Truth, that this evil must not be feared, 
because Divine Good is all powerful against it 
both as to its internal and external, and that it must
be subdued, even as the false principle from evil in
general, which had possessed the human 
understanding. 

35. And thus it actually happens; the spiritual man by 
the power of the Lord completely conquers the 
evil of merely natural love with all its errors, 
internal and external; and thus the natural man 
becomes harmonious with the spiritual man.

Israel vowing a vow to the Lord, denotes that still, in the new state, the spiritual man is willing
that the Lord may provide, 3732; and "If you will indeed deliver this people into my hand, 
then I will utterly destroy, or devote, their cities," denotes the perception that, by overcoming 
the evil tendency in himself, his natural man will be consecrated to the Lord, 1822, 5544, 
6091; while by destroying their cities which is here implied, is signified the rejection and 
condemnation of the falsities of evil, 402. 

3. The Lord hearkening to the voice of Israel and delivering up the Canaanites, denotes that the 
Lord, in answer to earnest prayer, delivers the man of the church from merely external 
worship, 2001, 2542, 1063; their utterly destroying them and their cities denotes to utterly 
reject, both in life and doctrine, such worship, ver. 2; and the name of the place being called 
Hormah, denotes that a new state of true devotion is initiated, 145, the word Hormah meaning,
in a bad sense, utter destruction, and in a good sense, consecrated to God, 6091.

4.

Journeying from mount Hor, by the way of the Red Sea, to compass the land of Edom, denotes
that thus progress is made from a state of desolation as to truths into another state of 
temptation from the hells, 1457, 1675, 8099; compassing the land of Edom denoting 
temptations not arising from the corrupted natural man as to its false doctrines, 2973, 3322; 
and the soul of the people being much discouraged because of the way, denotes "as from 
interior distress on account of falsities from evil," 1000, 1259, 8782 on Isaiah 37:27, 4861. 

5. The people speaking against God and against Moses, denotes that Divine Truth internal and 

external is, as it were, despised, 1259, 2271, 2001, 7010; "Wherefore have you brought us up 

290

out of Egypt to die in the wilderness?" denotes that the tendency is to return to the state of the 
merely natural man, 8866, 5013, 2908, 2708; there being no bread and no water, denotes the 
rejection of regeneration because there are no remains of heavenly good and truth, 4976; and 
their soul loathing the light or vile bread, that is, the manna, denotes that the good of truth, 
according to the needs of the state, is utterly disgusting, 1000, 7768, 8464, 8487. 

6. The Lord sending fiery serpents among the people; their biting the people; and much people of
Israel dying, denotes the consequence, namely, that sensual lusts begin to gain dominion, and 
that much injury is done both to the truth of the church and its principles of good, 276, 191, 
251, 6400, 304. 

7. The people coming to Moses and saying, "We have sinned, because we have spoken against 

the Lord and against you," denotes that there is earnest application to the Word; it is confessed 
that evil tendencies have prevailed; and that perception has been lost both as to good and truth,
1259, 6117, 7010, 5076, ver. 5; "pray to the Lord that He may take away the serpents from us,"
denotes earnest prayers, 2535, 251; and Moses praying for the people, denotes that 
intercession follows for deliverance, 7010, 8573. 

8. The Lord saying to Moses, "Make you a fiery serpent and set it upon a standard," denotes 
revelation from the Lord by the Word, that the Human is to be made Divine even as to the 
sensual and corporeal degrees, 2001, 1822, 7010, 38635, 8624; by combats against hereditary 
tendencies to evil, or against all the hells, and by victories over them; and "it shall come to 
pass that every one that is bitten, when he sees it, shall live," denotes that therefore every one 
in the church who, in temptation, flees from, and contends against, the evils of the natural 
man, has power from the Lord, by faith in Him, to overcome also, and to enjoy eternal life, 
4979, 6400, 38635, 290. 

9. Moses making a serpent of brass and setting it upon a standard, denotes that therefore it 

happens in the church generally, that the Human of the Lord is acknowledged to be Divine by 
such combats and victories, 38635, 8624; and it coming to pass that if a serpent had bitten any 
man, when he looked to the serpent of brass he lived, denotes that when man, in temptations, 
suffers from evils arising from the abuse of his sensual nature, and by application to the Lord 
and by faith in Him, conquers those evils, he comes into the enjoyment of eternal life, 4979, 
6400, 38635, 290. 

10. The children of Israel journeying and pitching in Oboth, denotes that the man of the church is, 
let into states of the merely natural life, as appears from the signification of journeying as 
denoting progress and instruction, and thus a change of state, 3654, 1457; of pitching a tent as 
denoting, in this case, disjunction and not conjunction, 1598, 1616; and of Oboth, which is 
perhaps derived from the Hebrew word for bottles or wineskins, as denoting, therefore, what is
merely natural, 2674, 3079. Also that what is merely natural is here denoted by Oboth appears 
from the consideration o! the series of things which follows.

11. Journeying from Oboth, and pitching in Iye-Abari in the wilderness which is before Moab 

toward the sunrising, denotes and thence into states in which evils are. predominant inducing 
new temptations, and a state of obscurity from the proximity of adulterated good springing 
from selfish love, because journeying denotes a change of state, 1457; from Oboth denotes 
merely natural love, ver. 10; pitching denotes further conjunction with evil or disjunction from

291

good, 1598, 1616; Iye-Abarim means the heaps of Abarim, or the heaps of the region beyond, 
and therefore denotes the predominance of evils inducing new temptations, 4197, 7408, 6978 
end, 79262; a wilderness denotes a state of obscurity, 2708; Moab denotes a state of 
adulterated good, 2468; and the sunrising denotes a state of selfish love, 2441, 10584. 

12. Journeying from there and pitching in the valley of Zered, denotes a state still more external in
which there is a consciousness of adulterated good, 1457, 1598, 1616, 1723, 2468. It is said, "a
consciousness of adulterated good," because Zered was a valley in the land of Moab, and 
therefore denotes adulterated good; and the word means "luxuriant growth," and thus indicates
the activity of thought, or consciousness, 2646, 6749. 

13. Journeying from there and pitching on the other side of Arnon, denotes progress into free 

natural delight, because Arnon means rejoicing, or leaping for joy, 1457, 1598, 1616; in the 
wilderness denotes a state of obscurity, 2708; coming out of the border of the Amorites 
denotes that ultimate truth and good are vitiated by evil, 8063, 1857, 1853; and Arnon being 
the border of Moab, between Moab and the Amorites, denotes that the truth of the Word 
perverted by adulterated good is the limit between that good and actual evil, 2468, 1857, 8063.

14. It being said in the book of the Wars of the Lord, "Vaheb in Suphah, and the valleys of Arnon,"
denotes that in the Ancient Word, which describes the combats of the Lord with the hells, and 
also the temptations of the man of the church, it is written: "He endures the extreme of 
temptation by receiving influx from the hells, and from natural delights thence, by the 
assumption of the Human in ultimates." This is shown by considering that "it is said" here 
means literally "it is written," and spiritually perception given to man, 1822; that the book of 
the Wars of the Lord is a part of the Ancient Word, 2897; that the wars of the Lord denote His 
temptations in the Human, and also the temptations of man for whom the Lord fights, 1664; 
that Jehovah and the Lord Jesus Christ are one and the same Person, 16643; that Suph means a
termination or completion, thus denoting the ultimate, the Suphah means a storm, or a whirl-
wind, thus denoting evil influences and temptation thence, causing disturbances in the mind or 
in the church, 10044, 5078, 842; that the Red Sea, or Suph, denotes the hells from which 
temptations come, 8099, 8184; that hence Vaheb in Suphah denotes the extreme of temptations
by influx from the hells, the meaning of the word Vaheb being uncertain; and that the valleys 
of Arnon denote natural delights, ver. 13, 1723. 

15. The slope of the valleys that inclineth toward the dwellings of Ar, and leaneth upon the border 
of Moab, denotes that there, in an intermediate state, the Lord conquered the infernals, even as
to their inmost evils and falsities, because the slope of the valleys is intermediate between the 
lowest ground and the highest, and therefore clearly signifies an intermediate state, 1292, 
5852; inclining toward the dwelling of Ar, signifies that the Lord conquered the internals even 
as to their inmost evils and falsities, Ar being the chief city of the Moabites and therefore 
denoting such evils and falsities, 2451, 402; and leaning on the border of Moab denotes that, 
by those evils, good is adulterated in ultimates, 8063, 2468. 

16. The Israelites journeying hence to Beer, denotes that therefore the man of the church from 

similar states of temptation is delivered, and is comforted from the Word, 3654, 1457, 3194, 
2702; and this being the well whereof the Lord said to Moses, "Gather the people together and 
I will give them water," denotes that Divine Truth has ordained, from Divine Good, that thus, 

292

after temptation, he should be refreshed with abundance of truths, 2001, 7010, 6112, 1259, 
2702. 

17. Israel then singing this song: "Spring up O well; sing you to it," denotes that the man of the 
church rejoices in the Lord with all his heart, and delights in His Word with all the power of 
his intellect, 3654, 418, 2702, 683. 

18. "The well which the princes dug," denotes that, as from himself, by primary truths, man is 
enabled to search the Word, 2702, 1482, 3424; "which the nobles of the people delved," 
denotes that, as from himself, from good affections, he penetrates into its mysteries, 683, 
6372; "with the sceptre and with their staves," or "by the lawgiver, and with their staves," 
denotes that the Lord Himself operates inwardly, and man co-operates outwardly, because the 
"sceptre" or the "lawgiver," denotes truth from good internally, and thus the Lord's operation 
thereby, 487610, 6372; and staves, denote the power of truth externally, and thus man's co-
operation as from himself, 4876, 6372; and journeying from the wilderness to Mattanah 
denotes that for obscurity he receives enlightenment from the Lord, because Mattanah means 
the gift of the Lord, and thus enlightenment from good and truth, 5619, and a wilderness 
denotes obscurity, 2708. 

19. From Mattanah to Nahaliel, denotes that, from this temporary state, the spiritual man passes 
into a state of the falsification of truths, because Nahaliel means the valley of God, and thus 
denotes a low state of spiritual life from which truth is falsified, 1723, 2001; and from 
Nahaliel to Bamoth denotes thence to a state of corrupted worship, because Bamoth means 
high places, and therefore denotes worship, and in this place imperfect, or corrupted worship, 
as the following verse shows, 2722. 

20. From Bamoth to the valley that is in the field of Moab, to the top of Pisgah, which looks down

upon the desert, or upon Jeshimon, denotes thence to a state of adulterated good exterior and 
interior indicating the proximity of another state of desolation and temptation, because a valley
denotes a low state, 1723; the field of Moab, denotes the falsity of adulterated good, 368, 
2468; Pisgah means hill eminence, fortress, and thus denotes, in this case, the interior falsities 
by which the state of corrupted good is defended, 2722, 72973; and looking down upon the 
desert, or upon Jeshimon, denotes another state of desolation and temptation impending, 2708,
37085 on Ps 107:4. 

21. Israel sending messengers to Sihon king of the Amorites, saying, denotes that the spiritual man

is disposed to temporize with evils, and thence thinks, 3654, 4239, 1857, 2506. 

22. "Let me pass through your land," denotes that he may contemplate such evils safely, 3992, 

1857; "We will not turn aside into field or into vineyard," denotes without being drawn from 
the path of rectitude either into their voluntary or intellectual delights, 4816, 2971, 9139; "we 
will not drink of the water of the wells," denotes without imbibing their falsities, 2702; and 
"we will go by the king's high way, until we have passed your border," denotes not being in the
slightest degree contaminated with them, 3335, 1672, 2234, 8063. 

23. Sihon not suffering Israel to pass through his border, denotes that evil is of such a character 
that this cannot be, because the king of the Amorites denotes the falsity of evil, 1682, 1857, 
and Sihon means rooting out, or conclusion, and thus signifies that falsity conjoined with evil 
utterly rejects good, and is the confirmation of the state of evil, 4317, 18572; Sihon gathering 

293

all his people together denotes that falsities from evil are combined against the man of the 
church under their leading or prevailing motive, 6112, 1259; going out against Israel into the 
wilderness denotes that a state of obscurity ensues, 2708; coming to Jahaz denotes that this 
takes place in the intermediate state, because by Jahaz is meant quarrel, dispute, or the going 
out of the. Lord, 6764, 5337; and fighting against Israel denotes a conflict following, 1664. 

24. Israel smiting him with the edge of the sword, denotes that the spiritual man overcomes evil 
by the power of Divine Truth from the Lord, 3654, 4251, 2799; possessing his land from 
Arnon to Jabbok, even to the children of Ammon, denotes thus gaining possession of the 
natural man even to the rejection of its ultimate evils and to the dispersion of its ultimate 
falsities, and also of its falsified truths, because by the land of the Amorites is signified the 
natural man where evils had predominated, 1857, 2183, by the valleys of Arnon are signified 
free natural delight, vers. 13, 14, by Jabbok are signified, in the best sense, ultimate truths with
their affection, but here ultimate falsities, and the word means dispersion, or pouring out, 
4301, and by the children of Ammon are signified falsified truths, 2468; and the border of the 
children of Ammon being very strong denotes that such truths appear to be very powerful 
against genuine good and truth, 2468, 8063. 

25. By Israel taking all these cities, is denoted that the spiritual man now gains entire control of 
the natural understanding with its powers, 3654, 402; and by dwelling in all the cities of the 
Amorites, in Heshbon and the towns, or daughters thereof, is denoted especially of the rational
faculty of the natural man, and the affections of truth thereto belonging, which evil had before,
1293, 489, 1857. For Heshbon means invention, industry, or thought; or he that hastens to 
understand or to build, and thus clearly denotes the rational faculty; and it is said, "the rational
faculty of the natural man," because it had belonged to both the Moabites and the Amorites, 
and was situated on the eastern side of the Jordan, 10332, 6263, 590, 5284, 657, 658, 4390, 
1304, 1585. 

26. Heshbon being the city of Sihon king of the Amorites, denotes that the rational faculty, which 

is fruitful in devices, is highly prized even by the wicked, ver. 25, 402, 1857; Sihon fighting 
against the former king of Moab denotes "who by its means engage in conflict with those who 
are in adulterated good," 1664, 2468; and taking all his land out of his hand, even to Arnon, 
denotes depriving them of those things by which they corrupt good and truth, even of the 
literal sense of the Word which they pervert, 567, 878, ver. 13, 1723. But it is said "even of the
literal sense of the Word, which they pervert," because Arnon, as a river and a boundary, 
plainly denotes this, ver. 13, 9340. 

27. Wherefore they that speak in proverbs saying, "Come you to Heshbon, let the city of Sihon be 

built and established," denotes that the Ancient Word, through the medium of its 
correspondences, teaches: "that the understanding of the merely natural man is predominant 
with the wicked, both as to thought, and as to affection," 2897, vers. 25, 26, 4390, 3388. 

28. "For a fire is gone out of Heshbon, a flame from the city of Sihon; he has devoured Ar of 

Moab, the lords of the high places of Arnon," denotes that the love of the world and the love of
self act through it as a means, 934; that it overwhelms the pretensions of those who are in the 
doctrines of corrupted good, 5149, 402, ver. 15, 2468; even of those whose worship internally 
and externally is alike adulterated, 10642, 2722, vers. 13, 14. 

294

29. "Wo to you, Moab! You are undone, O people of Chemosh," denotes that such worship is 
doomed to destruction, and its falsities even as to their inmost principles are worthless, 
Chemosh meaning "as handling or as taking away," and thus denoting the tendency of falsity 
from evil to deprive the man of the church of good and truth, 2468, 1259, 878, 24687, 246816; 
and "he has given his sons as fugitives and his daughters into captivity to Sihon king of the 
Amorites," denotes that its corrupted truths are no longer conjoined with good affections, and 
its perverted affections are no longer sustained by truths, consequently becoming the slaves of 
falsity from evil, 489, 382, 7990, vers. 21-23.

30. "We have shot at them; Heshbon is perished even to Dibon, and we have laid waste even to 
Nophah, which reacheth to Medeba," denotes that such falsities tend to the destruction of 
adulterated good, and also devastate its perverted rational faculty internally and externally, as 
well as its external affection for knowledge by which it supports itself from the literal sense of 
the Word, because by the Amorites shooting at the Moabites is denoted that evil tends to the 
destruction of adulterated good, 1857, 2686, 2468; by Heshbon perishing is denoted the 
devastation of the perverted rational faculty internally, ver. 25; by even to Dibon is denoted the
same externally, Dibon meaning understanding, abundance of knowledge, or of building, and 
thus signifying the same as Heshbon, ver. 25; by-laying waste even to Nophah, is denoted 
devastation as to the external affection for knowledge, this word meaning the blowing of a 
fire, and thus signifying natural desires excited by evil influences, 934, 5212, and laying waste
signifying devastation, 407; and by "which is to Medeba," is denoted the literal sense of the 
Word, Medeba meaning the water of rest, and thus signifying the Word in the literal sense, 
where Divine Truth is in its fullness and power in ultimates, or in a fixed basis consisting of 
human language, which is correspondential as to every expression, 2702, 9349. 

But it is proper to add here that the whole of this verse, in the literal sense, "is obscure and has 
been variously interpreted by critics," so that no less than five different meanings have been 
given to the phrase here rendered "which reacheth to Medeba," namely (1) "which extends to 
Medeba," (2) "and to Medeba," (3) "which belongs to Medeba," (4) "which is at Medeba," and
(5) "fire (has raged) to Medeba." In any case, however, the meaning of the terms "Nophah" 
and "Medeba," and consequently the correspondence of each term, clearly shows that the 
former has relation to affection or love, and the latter to intelligence or truth, and, moreover, 
there can be no doubt concerning the spiritual meaning of the whole verse, which is the 
complete vastation of those who are in adulterated good.

31. Thus Israel dwelling in the land of the Amorites, denotes that, on the other hand, the spiritual 

man is triumphant and completely overcomes the natural man, 3654, 1857. 

32. Moses sending to spy out Jazer; their taking the towns thereof; and their driving out the 

Amorites that were there, denotes that now, therefore, the doctrine of good works is truly 
investigated; that it becomes subservient to heavenly purposes; and that every evil which had 
defiled it is expelled, because by Moses sending to spy out, is denoted investigation, 2397, 
27145; by Jazer is meant he that helps, and therefore by this place, considered as a city, is 
denoted doctrine which aids in the interpretation of the Word; and it is. said the doctrine of 
good works, because this territory belonged to the tribe of Gad, 402, 3934; by taking the towns
of Jazer, is denoted that doctrine becomes subservient to heavenly purposes, through the 
affection of truth, 1664, 489, ver. 25; and by driving out the Amorites that were there is 
denoted that every evil which had defiled it is expelled, 1664, 1857. 

295

33. Turning and going up by the way of Bashan, denotes that a fresh advance is made towards the 

destruction of essential evil, because going up signifies advance, 1543, a way signifies 
doctrine, 2234, and Bashan means in the tooth, in the ivory, in the change, or in the sleep, thus 
denoting a state of essential falsity and evil, 44243, 61883, 41362, 150, AE 1638; Og the king 
of Bashan going out against Israel, he and all his people, denotes that essential evil with all its 
falsities enters into a conflict with the man of the church, because Og means a cake, and thus, 
in a good sense, charity, and in the opposite sense the love of the world, 7978, as a king, he 
denotes falsity, 1682, going out here, denotes evil influx, 5337, and with all his people, 
denotes with falsities, 1259; and going out to battle at Edrei, denotes conflict when good 
begins to be confirmed, because Edrei means a very great mass or cloud, and the death of the 
wicked, 1047, 6119, and war, denotes spiritual conflict, or temptation, 1664. 

34. By the Lord saying to Moses, is denoted revelation from the Lord by Divine Truth, 2001, 
7010, 1822; by not fearing him, is denoted that this evil must not be feared, 2826; "I have 
delivered him into your hand, and all his people and all his land," denotes that Divine Good is 
all-powerful against essential evil both as to its internal and external opposition, ver. 33, 1259, 
913, 2001, 878; and by doing to him as was done to Sihon king of the Amorites which dwelt in
Heshbon, is denoted that essential evil must be subdued even as was the false principle from 
evil in general, which had possessed the human understanding, vers. 23-25.

35. Smiting him and his sons, and all his people until there was none left him remaining; and 
possessing his land, denotes that the spiritual man, by the power of the Lord, completely 
conquers the evil of merely natural love, with all its errors internal and external, and that thus 
the natural man becomes harmonious with the spiritual man, 4251, 489, 1259, 5897, 2658, 
913. 

DISCUSSION

Remembering that evil has its origin in the natural degree of man's life, and that regeneration consists 
in putting off what is merely natural, and in being born again into the life of the new natural man, we 
cannot be surprised that the internal sense of the Word has very largely to describe the states of the 
natural man under its various aspects, as we see in the last chapter and now in this. And the Canaanites 
especially are symbolic of the natural or external man as to his false and selfish worship. Even of the 
Lord also, as to His early state in His Human life, it is said, "the Canaanite was then in the land," and 
afterwards, as He advanced, "The Canaanite and the Perizzite were then in the land," to denote the 
presence of hereditary evil and falsity with Him. For in taking upon Him our fallen human nature, it 
was unavoidable that He should receive from the virgin mother tendencies to evil through which He 
was tempted, and was thus able by His own power, as a man like other men, to contend with, and 
overcome the infernal hosts, and thus preserve to eternity the free-will of man, and redeem him from 
the absolute dominion of evil. This, therefore, was the essence, so to speak, of the work of Redemption 
in general, and through it the Lord is now for ever able to redeem each individual, from his actual evils,
by preserving in him the power to follow the Lord, in his regeneration, and also overcome like Him. 
This, then, is the subject of our first section. It is a temptation through the merely natural man, and 
particularly through the rational faculty of that man. For Arad means, as we have seen, a wild ass, and 
this denotes our natural reason in its opposition to spiritual truth. And it is a fact that we do all, in the 
course of our lives, get taken prisoners by this king Arad and have need of personal deliverance by the 
Lord.

296

But the Lord does not save us from the delusions of natural reason without our own co-operation with 
Him; and this is what is described in the rest of the section. We must, like the Israelites, go by the way 
of the spies; we must vow a vow to the Lord, which practically means giving up our natural wills, and 
submitting to the Divine Will; and we must entirely destroy, or devote all merely natural powers to 
destruction. For we cannot have the merely natural life, and at the same time enjoy the new natural life,
and, moreover, if we wish to reason truly concerning Divine things as taught in the Word, we must not 
reason only according to the appearances of truth there, nor must we confuse appearances with realities
and thus form to ourselves false doctrine; but we must judge not according to the appearance, but 
according to righteous judgement. For if we reason according to appearances, we may come to believe 
that our God is an angry God and takes vengeance upon His enemies; or we may conceive of Him as 
three persons each by himself God and Lord", and thus we may actually think of three gods, while yet 
we delude ourselves by saying that there is only one without having formed a distinct and clear idea of 
that one. How much better, therefore, to judge righteously, and acknowledge the One God in Whom is 
the Divine Trinity of three Essentials, which together constitute the one Divine Person of our Lord and 
Saviour Jesus Christ in Whom dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily (John 14:8-18; compared 
with Matt 28:18-20, and Colos 2:9; and also John 8:17-18, compared with John 8:58). Let us beware, 
then, of Arad the king of the Canaanites, and not permit ourselves to be deluded by him.

In the second section, the first point that requires our attention is the distinction that is to be carefully 
made between a state of desolation as to truths, or as to genuine doctrine, and a state arising from the 
falsities of evil, or from evils themselves represented by the way to the Red Sea. For now there is not 
only a deficiency of water, but there is a deficiency of bread, that is, a distaste for good, which is the 
result of the influx of falsities from evil. And then the consequences are the prevalence of sensual lusts 
which are denoted by fiery serpents. And experience proves that the falsities derived from sensual lusts 
are far more dangerous to the life of the spiritual man than are falsities of doctrine. Also, that is the 
reason why the serpent is not only representative of what is merely sensual and corporeal, but in 
addition, of selfish love, and of all the evils thence originating, two striking examples of which are to 
be found in Gen 3:15 and in Rev 12:9. But the example in our section is especially interesting, as it 
shows that the Lord, in His glorification, made even the sensual and corporeal principles in Himself 
Divine, thus rising from the dead with His whole body complete; and that, as the Lord conquered all 
the powers of evil on man's behalf, so every member of the church by faith in Him, which involves 
love to Him and obedience to His commandments, has power to overcome all evil, and thus spiritually 
to sit down with Him on His throne, even as He sat down with His Father on His throne; from which 
remarkable passage we are evidently not to understand that the Lord, in heaven, actually sits beside His
Father, or that the fully regenerated man actually sits beside his Lord; for this would clearly be to 
entertain a merely sensual idea of the Lord's great work of Redemption, and of the effect of man's 
regeneration, and also produce in the minds of men an idea of more than one Lord, which is contrary to
the very-principle of all true religion, namely, that the Divine Being is ONE, both in essence and in 
person (Zech 14:9). May we therefore overcome all evil by power from Him continually, even as He 
overcame, and thus united in Himself the Human with the Divine to eternity. And lastly, in this 
connection we may also remember that in heaven, which spiritually is the Lord's throne, the 
regenerated natural degree of man's life will be in perfect harmony with the higher degrees, and will 
have its appropriate satisfactions, as is so finely represented by the words, "The wolf and the lamb shall
feed together, and the lion shall eat straw like the ox; and dust shall be the serpent's meat. They shall 
not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain, says the Lord" (Isaiah 65:25; 39943); where by dust being
the serpent's meat is plainly meant the satisfactions of the sensual life in outwardly expressing the joys 

297

and delights of the heavenly life of usefulness. For then even the spiritual body, with all its senses, will 
be obedient to the mind and heart, and fully express their thoughts and affections.

And now, in the third section, we are to note other changes of state with the man of the church denoted 
by the journeying of the Israelites to Oboth, to Iye-Abarim, to Zered, and to the other side of Arnon, all 
which, according to the meaning and thence to the correspondence of the names, combined with the 
signification of the wilderness, of the sunrising, of the valley, and of the border, clearly denotes a 
generally declining state, a state of obscurity, the activity of selfish love and consequently of 
adulterated good, and a state of free natural delight, which is the limit between that good and actual 
evil. And when we reflect that the Israelites actually made these journeys, that the meaning of each 
term must describe spiritually the quality of the state, and also how naturally disposed we all are thus to
decline and contaminate the good we receive from the Lord with our own actual states of error and 
selfishness, we may see how exactly the Word has been given by Divine inspiration to describe the 
states of the church in general, of the individual in particular, and in the supreme sense of the 
glorification of the Lord, and of His victories over the hells, for our redemption and salvation. The 
lesson, therefore, that we all have to learn from these things is, first of all, one of trust and confidence 
in the Lord our Saviour, Who has provided us with so wonderful a revelation of Divine and Spiritual 
truths adapted to our requirements, and secondly one of continual watchfulness, as we pass through 
life, lest we should allow ourselves to be beguiled through the delights of the merely natural man into 
states of adulterated good, and even into states of evil in general, while yet our hearts and our 
understandings inwardly are determined from the Lord to overcome all obstacles, and at last to make 
our natural life exactly conformed to our spiritual life, which is indeed the object we must continually 
strive to attain amid all our fluctuations and weaknesses. For we remember that the Lord said to His 
disciples, "Watch and pray that you enter not into temptation: the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh 
is weak" (Matt 26:41).

But here we are arrived at a point in which we have a quotation from the Ancient Word, and therefore 
the following remarks concerning it may here be of use: "In the Word wherever wars are treated of, and
mentioned, no other wars are signified in the internal sense than such as are spiritual. There were also 
books in the Ancient Church which were entitled the Wars of Jehovah, as appears from Moses, Num 
21:14-16, which being written in the prophetic style, had an internal sense, and treated of the Lord's 
combats and temptations, and also of the combats and temptations of the church, and of those who are 
of the church; this is evident from the circumstance that some things were taken from there by Moses. 
The same is also evident from other books of that church which were called the books of the Prophetic 
Enunciators, concerning which see Num 21:27-30, in which nearly the same words occur as in 
Jeremiah, compare Num 21:28 and Jeremiah 48:45, whence also it may be concluded that the Ancient 
Church had writings, both historical and prophetical, which were Divine and inspired, and which in the 
internal sense treated of the Lord and His kingdom, and that these writings were the Word to that 
church, as the historical and prophetical books of our Word are to us, which in the literal sense treat of 
the Jews and Israelites, but in the internal sense, of the Lord, and of those things which are His," 2686; 
and see also 2897. But coming back to the quotation from this Ancient Word, we shall see for ourselves
that its language is not only poetical, but also highly correspondential.

For it is evident that the book of the wars of the Lord can signify nothing but the temptations of the 
Lord, for He engages in no other wars; and that this book also describes the conflicts of the spiritual 
man in which the Lord fights for him, and delivers him, is because the glorification of the Lord is the 
pattern of the regeneration of man, and there can be no regeneration apart from conflicts against evil. 
And as the word Suph means a termination or completion, therefore it signifies the ultimate, while 

298

Suphah also means a storm, and thus temptation; and further, as Suph, or the Red Sea, denotes the 
hells, therefore it is said "He endured the extreme of temptation by receiving influx from the hells." 
Also as the valleys of Arnon denote natural delights, we see that influx from the hells is into man's 
natural delights; and indeed it is not possible that any one can be tempted by the internals unless there 
be some delight with him into which the influx can take place. But it is to be carefully remembered 
here that in the Lord's case there was no actual evil, but only hereditary tendencies thereto, while in 
man's case he is not tempted through hereditary tendencies, but through his actual evils; and it is very 
important indeed that this distinction should be properly understood; because from this we can also 
understand how it was that the Lord by His victories entirely expelled from His Human every vestige 
of the maternal hereditary life, rising from the dead in His Human body, now Divine, while man, on the
other hand, although victorious by the Lord's help, retains with him to eternity the heredity into which 
he was born, and also his own evils, which by regeneration are not abolished, but are removed and 
become quiescent, or as if they did not exist. See therefore again 1444, 16672, 868. 

And from these remarks it will be evident that all that follows in the section continues to speak of the 
Lord's glorification, in the supreme sense, and man's regeneration in the internal sense, and shows 
especially how consolation comes after temptation, and is succeeded by further conflicts; and we must 
now therefore consider these as set before us in the last section. And first it is to be well observed that 
the spiritual man in the course of his regeneration is just as much disposed to temporize with evil in 
general as he has been to do so with regard to evil as manifested in the natural affections; but he learns 
by experience that this cannot be. For manifestly if we reflect upon the matter we shall find that it is 
impossible to serve two masters in this way, and that every one must finally become either altogether a 
form of good to which truth is conjoined, or a form of evil to which falsity is conjoined. This, then, is 
the first great lesson of our section; and we must imitate the conduct of the Israelites who entirely 
overcame the Amorites, by ourselves entirely overcoming not only evil in general, but even the 
essential principle of evil which is the love of self, or selfishness, and is represented by Og the king of 
Bashan.

But, of course, this general and positive teaching involves the several particulars which follow. And one
of them is that conflict must take place in an intermediate state, which is represented by Jahaz. For this 
word means quarrel or dispute; and so long as evil still has some influence over us, so long we must 
continue in this intermediate state; but when we have conquered the whole natural man, represented by 
the kingdoms of Sihon and Og, comes into subjection, subordination, and harmony with the spiritual 
man. But next we have to consider another side of the subject. For what will happen if, instead of 
overcoming evil, we live in a state of adulterated good, and persist in doing so? Certainly that, of 
course, evil will overcome us just as the Amorites had overcome the Moabites, who in the Word always
signify this adulterated good in its various degrees and aspects. And this is what is representatively 
described in the following part of the section, and also in the second quotation from the Ancient Word, 
the particulars of which, as given in the series, and as explained in connection with the references, are 
most interesting, because they show the wonderful character of the Word in its internal sense; prove 
that the church has passed through similar experiences in all ages; and demonstrate that the corrupted 
man, as well as the regenerated man, cannot remain in the intermediate state, but must become entirely 
subject to evil, even as the Moabites became subject to the Amorites. That is to say, spiritually, the 
confirmed Moabite is bound to become in his Judgement a confirmed Amorite. Hence, then, we now 
see the importance of the quotation from the Ancient Word just in this place, and especially of the 
contents of its latter part as descriptive of the complete vastation of the corrupted man. And this 
therefore is the third great lesson in studying this part of our subject, namely, that the true spiritual man 

299

must determine not to be overcome by evil, but on the contrary, to overcome evil with good as 
described in ver. 31 in its spiritual sense. And consequently it is not enough to conquer evil only in its 
general form, but it is necessary also to conquer essential evil, that is, the very principle of evil which is
selfishness, even as the Israelites not only overcame the Amorite king, but Og the king of Bashan also. 
And here again a particular study of each term used in the description shows how very exactly every 
one is used in its true correspondential sense, and has its appropriate place in the series. For truly "The 
law of the Lord is perfect, converting the soul, the testimony of the Lord is sure, making wise the 
simple: the statutes of the Lord are right, rejoicing the heart; the commandment of the Lord is pure, 
enlightening the eyes" (Ps 19:7-8).

Numbers Chapter 22

SUMMARY OF THE SPIRITUAL SENSE

1. The man of the church comes into a state of the adulteration of good externally, ver. 1. 

2. But those who are internally in such a state fear genuine spiritual truths, vers. 2-4. 

3. And hence they consult falsity derived from evil, which interprets the Word from selfish love, 

vers. 5-7. 

4. The false teacher, however, is forbidden to cause aversion from the Lord in the truly spiritual 

man, and, outwardly, he is constrained to submit, vers. 8-14 

5. But he is now more strongly tempted by evil, inwardly desiring to comply with its promptings,
notwithstanding his knowledge of the truth; and hence he is permitted to go forward in the 
path of error, vers. 15-21. 

6. And yet Divine Truth is really opposed to him, while, by means of his rational powers he 

endeavours to carry out his purposes, ver. 22. 

7. But even natural reason recognizes Divine Truth, and is afraid of it, being thereby diverted 

from error and urgent for the cultivation of good, while evil is persistent, and therefore injures 
the Rational, ver. 23. 

8. Again, the progress of error is impeded by the opposition of the truth in an accommodated 

form, yet still the false teacher persists, the natural affections are injured, and the Rational is 
further perverted, vers. 24-25. 

9. And, thirdly, Divine Truth opposes error in the state where falsity is confirmed, and the 

Rational is therefore prostrated, but still has power to speak, from the Lord, convincing truths; 
and reproof from Divine Truth Itself follows, producing repentance, but only outwardly, vers. 
26-35. 

10. And therefore the false teacher is permitted to continue his career and to come into 

communication with adulterated good, vers. 36-41. 

THE CONTENTS OF EACH VERSE

1. And the children of Israel journeyed,
and pitched in the plains of Moab 
beyond the Jordan at fericho. 

2. And Balak the son of Zippor saw all 
that Israel had done to the Amorites. 

1. But the man of the Spiritual Church, in advancing 
towards the heavenly life, is in a state of the 
adulteration of good, as to the external man who is
in the knowledges of goodness and truth. 

2. And the evil derived from the falsity of such good,

is disturbed by the predominance of the spiritual 
man over the evil of the natural man in general. 

301

3. And Moab was sore afraid of the 

3. For those who are confirmed in the evil of 

people, because they were many: and
Moab was distressed because of the 
children of Israel. 

corrupted good, greatly fear genuine truth, because
it prevails against them; and are brought into 
distress by the powerful influence of the man of 
the church. 

4. And Moab said to the elders of 

4. And therefore they have the perception through the

Midian, Now shall this multitude 
lick up all that is round about us, as 
the ox licketh up the grass of the 
field. And Balak the son of Zippor 
was king of Moab at that time. 

5. And he sent messengers to 

Balaam.the son of Beor, to Pethor, 
which is by the River, to the land of 
the children of his people, to call 
him, saying, Behold, there is a 
people come out from Egypt: behold,
they cover the face of the earth, and 
they abide over against me: 

6. Come now therefore, I pray you, 

curse me this people; for they are too
mighty for me: peradventure I shall 
prevail, that we may smite them, and
that I may drive them out of the land:
for I know that he whom you bless is

cursed. 

falsities that are confirmed in them, that spiritual 
truths will take away all their delights, even as 
corrupted natural affection takes away all spiritual 
truth. And such evil natural affections derived 
from falsity, are the governing principles with 
those who adulterate good. 

5. Wherefore these consult falsity derived from evil, 
which interprets the truth from selfish love, and 
from knowledges most external, desiring 
communication, and inspiring the perception, that 
the man of the Spiritual Church, having been 
delivered from the tyranny of the merely natural 
life, and having been instructed in Divine Truths in
all fullness, is opposed to adulterated good; 

6. That therefore his destruction is desired, because 
falsity cannot withstand truths, but yet that it may 
possibly prevail, and in fact do injury, in order that
truths may be separated; being possessed by the 
delusion that falsity of this kind is all-powerful, 
and is either able to effect conjunction with heaven
through selfish love, or to cause aversion from it. 

7. And the elders of Moab and the

elders of Midian departed with the 
rewards of divination in their hand;

to him the words of Balak. 

evil of adulterated good and in its falsities, in such 
a state of the church or of the individual, seek to 
gain communication with those who teach truth 
from selfish principles, by exerting and stimulating
in them the love of reward, and having done so, to 
scatter the fears of adulterated good, and aid those 
who desire to throw off the influence of the 
spiritual man.

8. And he said to them, Lodge here this
night, and I will bring you word 
again, as the LORD shall speak to me:
and the princes of Moab abode with 
Balaam. 

9. And God came to Balaam, and said, 
What men are these with you? 

10. And Balaam said to God, Balak the 
son of Zippor, king of Moab, has 
sent to me, saying, 

8. And hence the false prophet from his selfishness, 

temporizes with the insinuations of evil and falsity,
suggesting delay in the state of obscurity, and that 
an answer shall be given according to the Word of 
the Lord; for corrupted good and its falsities 
abides with those who would teach truth for selfish
purposes. 

9. But Divine Truth also has influence with them 

externally, and suggests inquiry as to the quality of
evil influences. 

10. And confession is made that evil from the falsity 

of corrupted good insinuates, 

11. Behold, the people that is come out 
of Egypt, it covers the face of the 
earth: now, come curse me them; 
peradventure I shall be able to fight 
against them, and shall drive them 
out. 

11. That the man of the Spiritual Church is delivered 
from the bondage of the natural man, has been 
instructed, and is predominant in the external man;
and that therefore corrupted good desires the 
suppression of him, or, if possible, to fight against 
him and to destroy him. 

12. And God said to Balaam, You shall 

12. But the false prophet, or teacher, perceives from 

not go with them; you shall not curse
the people: for they are blessed. 

13. And Balaam rose up in the morning, 
and said to the princes of Balak, Get 
you into your land: for the LORD 
refuseth to give me leave to go with 
you. 

14. And the princes of Moab rose up, 
and they went to Balak, and said, 
Balaam refuseth to come with us. 

the Word in his understanding, that he ought not to
be associated with corrupted good and its falsities; 
and also that the man of the church is not averted 
from the Lord but has conjunction with Him. 

13. And therefore, in a state of illustration, 

superstition, and fear, he desires to separate 
himself from corrupted good and its falsities, 
leaving them in their own delights, because the 
power of Divine Truth prevails with him in that 
state. 

14. And consequently evil and its falsity are 

apparently separated from communication with the
Word falsified; and it is perceived by the corrupted
man that he cannot avail himself of its influence. 

15. And Balak sent yet again princes, 
more, and more honourable than 
they. 

15. But still, corrupted good is persistent, and again 

communicates with the false teacher by exciting in
him the love of reward more intensely. 

16. And they came to Balaam, and said 
to him, Thus says Balak the son of 
Zippor, Let nothing, I pray you, 
hinder you from coming to me: 

16. And thence the false teacher perceives, from the 
evil derived from the falsity of adulterated good, 
that he ought by all means to be conjoined with the
evil of corrupted good. 

303

17. For I will promote you to very great 
honour, and whatever you say to me 
I will do: come therefore, I pray you,
curse me this people. 

17. For the love of honour, and glory, and reward, and 
evil, is willing, for the sake of its own ends, to be 
submissive to the power of the Word falsified, 
desiring eagerly the destruction of genuine truths. 

18. And Balaam answered and said to 

18. But the false teacher thinks, from the evident force

the servants of Balak, If Balak would
give me his house full of silver and 
gold, I cannot go beyond the word of
the LORD my God, to do less or 
more. 

19. Now therefore, I pray you, tarry you 
also here this night, that I may know 
what the LORD will speak to me 
more. 

20. And God came to Balaam at night, 
and said to him, If the men be come 
to call you, rise up, go with them; 
but only the word which I speak to 
you, that shall you do. 

of the truth, that although corrupted good should 
be able externally to enrich him with all abundance
of truths and good affections together, yet it is 
impossible to exceed the limits of Divine Truth, 
which outwardly controls the wicked, and compels
their obedience. 

19. And yet under the influence of selfish love which 
causes obscurity, he still temporizes, in the hope 
that even the Lord Himself may change. 

20. And therefore, according to his state of obscurity, 
he perceives from Divine Truth, when selfish 
impulses and thoughts are strong, that he must be 
drawn on by them, while still he is aware that he 
cannot exceed the force of Divine Truth from the 
Lord. 

21. And Balaam rose up in the morning, 

21. And therefore, in another state of illustration, he is 

and saddled his ass, and went with 
the princes of Moab. 

22. And God's anger was kindled 

because he went: and the angel of 
the LORD placed himself in the way 
for an adversary against him. Now 
he was riding upon his ass, and his 
two servants were with him. 

roused to activity, adapting the rational faculty of 
the natural man to his selfish aspirations, and then 
proceeds to communicate with adulterated good. 

22. But by so doing he is averted from Divine Truth, 
which cannot but be actually opposed to his 
fallacies and infatuation. He is led forward, 
however, by delusive arguments supported by 
external appearances of good and truth. 

23. And the ass saw the angel of the 

23. But the Rational, in spite of its condition, 

LORD standing in the way, with his 
sword drawn in his hand: and the ass

into the field: and Balaam smote the 
ass, to turn her into the way. 

perceives Divine Truth from Divine Good as its 
opponent, and also its power to destroy falsity; and
therefore it is diverted from the path of error, and 
naturally tends to conjunction with good; but the 
affection of falsity perverts the Rational, and 
forces it to bend to its requirements. 

304

24. Then the angel of the LORD stood in 
a hollow way between the vineyards,
a fence being on this side, and a 
fence on that side. 

24. Again the progress of error is opposed by Divine 
Truth from Divine Good as manifested in the 
obscure perception of spiritual truths limited by 
the appearances of good and truth in the external 
or natural man. 

25. And the ass saw the angel of the 

25. And still the Rational perceives that Divine Truth, 

LORD, and she thrust herself to the 
wall, and crushed Balaam's foot 
against the wall: and he smote her 
again. 

as before, is opposed to it; and although deluded 
by appearances, is strongly drawn to them, the 
natural affections thus being injured; and again the
affection of falsity perverts the Rational to cause it
to err. 

26. And the angel of the LORD went 

further, and stood in a narrow place, 
where was no way to turn either to 
the right hand or to the left. 

26. And yet again the progress of error is impeded by 
Divine Truth from Divine Good in the state where 
falsity is confirmed, and where, therefore, no 
divergence from the path of error is possible. 

27. And the ass saw the angel of the 

LORD, and she lay down under 
Balaam: and Balaam's anger was 
kindled, and he smote the ass with 
his staff. 

27. But still the Rational perceives the opposition of 
Divine Truth from Divine Good, and at the same 
time is prostrated by the force of truth on the one 
hand, and falsity on the other; and the false teacher
being confirmed in error is averted from the truth 
and the Rational is still more injured by ultimate 
falsified truths. 

28. And the LORD opened the mouth of 
the ass, and she said to Balaam, 
What have I done to you, that you 
have smitten me these three times? 

28. And yet, even then, it has power from the Lord to 
utter truths, and to charge the depraved will with 
injustice, as to the rejection of good, the rejection 
of truth, and confirmation in errors. 

29. And Balaam said to the ass, Because 
you have mocked me: I would there 
were a sword in mine hand, for now 
I had killed you. 

29. And thence the Rational perceives that it is 

naturally opposed to evil and error, and that evil 
desires its destruction by means of falsity, through 
which all sense of right or wrong is obliterated. 

30. And the ass said to Balaam, Am not I
your ass, upon which you have 
ridden all your life long to this day? 
was I ever wont to do so to you? And
he said, Nay. 

30. And yet, in spite of all, Divine Good speaks 

through the Rational, and insinuates that it is the 
servant of the will, and has been obedient to it 
through the course of life, nor is it ever 
uninfluenced by the will; and this the corrupted 
man is compelled to acknowledge. 

31. Then the LORD opened the eyes of 

31. And now, therefore, even the false teacher is 

Balaam, and he saw the angel of the 
LORD standing in the way, with his 
sword drawn in his hand: and he 
bowed his head, and fell on his face. 

caused to perceive that Divine Truth from Divine 
Good is totally opposed to him, and that truth is 
destructive of falsity, and therefore, externally, he 
is submissive both as to the understanding and 
will. 

305

32. And the angel of the LORD said to 
him, Wherefore have you smitten 
your ass these three times? behold, I 
am come forth for an adversary, 
because your way is perverse before 
me: 

32. And from the Lord he perceives that he has abused
the Rational, has rejected good and truth, and has 
confirmed himself in falsity; and also that Divine 
Truth must necessarily oppose him, because of his 
perverted state; 

33. And the ass saw me, and turned 

33. That the Rational in every case had perceived the 

aside before me these three times: 
unless she had turned aside from me,
surely now I had even slain you, and 
saved her alive. 

truth, and had been disposed to avoid error; and 
that unless this had been so, liberty of choice 
would not have been left to the corrupted will, 
even when the Rational was free. 

34. And Balaam said to the angel of the 
LORD, I have sinned; for I knew not 
that you stood in the way against me:
now therefore, if it displease you, I 
will get me back again. 

34. Whence the corrupted will now perceives that it 

has opposed Divine Truth, and has been blinded by
selfish desires; and therefore, from selfish fear, it 
is willing to be outwardly obedient. 

35. And the angel of the LORD said to 

35. But now Divine Truth teaches that every man must

Balaam, Go with the men: but only 
the word that I shall speak to you, 
that you shall speak. So Balaam 
went with the princes of Balak. 

be left to act according to reason and liberty; and 
yet that the Divine Providence secretly controls all
things for the best; and thus the corrupted man 
decides in favour of his own selfish desires. 

36. And when Balak heard that Balaam 
was come, he went out to meet him 
to the City of Moab, which is on the 
border of Amon, which is in the 
utmost part of the border. 

36. And therefore the state of adulterated good is 

intensified by communication with the corrupted 
understanding; for the will flows into the 
understanding and conjoins itself therewith in 
accommodated doctrine, which, in this case, is the 
conjunction of evil with falsity on the ultimate 
plane of life. 

37. And Balak said to Balaam, Did I not 
earnestly send to you to call you? 
wherefore earnest you not to me? am
I not able indeed to promote you to 
honour? 

37. And the corrupted understanding perceives from 
the impulses of the depraved will that it desires to 
confirm its state by falsities. Why then has there 
been hesitation? And is not selfish love able to 
promote and exalt its votaries? 

38. And Balaam said to Balak, Lo, I am 
come to you: have I now any power 
at all to speak any thing? the word 
that God puts in my mouth, that shall
I speak. 

39. And Balaam went with Balak, and 
they came to Kiriath-huzoth. 

38. But the corrupted will now perceives from the 
light of truth itself, present in the corrupted 
understanding, that indeed it desires to gratify 
selfish love, but that it cannot overcome the power
of genuine truth, and must, even from selfish 
considerations, comply with its requirements. 

39. And therefore the conjunction of the corrupted 
understanding and the depraved will is, as yet, 
most external. 

306

40. And Balak sacrificed oxen and

sheep, and sent to Balaam, and to the
princes that were with him. 

understanding by the force of its affections both 
external and internal, and thus makes that 
conjunction a little stronger. 

41. And it came to pass in the morning, 
that Balak took Balaam and brought 
him up into the high places of Baal, 
and he saw from there the utmost 
part of the people. 

41. And then in a state of illustration from the falsities 

of corrupted worship from selfish love, the 
corrupted understanding is gifted, for the time 
being, with the perception of the opposing truths 
of the church remotely.

towards the heavenly life, 3654, 1457; pitching in the plains of Moab, denotes coming into a

external man who is in the knowledges of goodness and truth, 1585, 10300 end.

2. By Balak the son of Zippor seeing what Israel had done to the Amorites is denoted that the evil
derived from the falsity of such good is disturbed by the predominance of the spiritual man, 
over the evil of the natural man in general, because Balak means one that wastes and destroys,
and thus he denotes evil, a son denotes derivative truth or falsity, and Zippor means a bird or 
sparrow, and therefore also denotes truth or falsity, 411, 10510, 5912, 489, 778; to see denotes 
to perceive, and in this case disturbance as the effect of seeing, 2150; Israel denotes the 
spiritual man, 3654; and the Amorites denote evil in general, 1857. 

3. By Moab are denoted those who are confirmed in the evil of adulterated good, 2468; by being 
sore afraid of the people is denoted greatly fearing those who are in truths, 390, 1259; by 
"because they were many" is evidently denoted that truths are abundant and prevail, 6172; and
by Moab being distressed because of the children of Israel, or by their abhorring the children 
of Israel, is denoted that they are brought into distress by the powerful influence of the man of 
the church, 59, 3654. 

4. Moab saying to the elders of Midian, denotes the perception of adulterated good through the 

falsities confirmed, 2468, 1822, 3242, 2348; "Now shall this multitude lick up all that is round
about us," denotes that spiritual truths will take away all their delights, 7843; "as the ox licketh
up the grass of the field," denotes even as corrupted natural affection takes away all spiritual 
truth, 2180, 5149, 5101; and Balak the son of Zippor being the king of Moab at that time, 
denotes that such evil natural affections derived from falsity are the governing principles with 
those who adulterate good, ver. 2, 1682, 2468, 2212. 

5. Balak sending messengers to Balaam the son of Beor, denotes that evil consults falsity derived
from evil, because Balak denotes evil, ver. 2, sending messengers denotes consultation, 4239; 
Balaam means old age, or ancient of the people, or the destruction of the people, and therefore
denotes falsity confirmed, 2348, 1259, 10510, and Beor means burning foolish, mad, and 
therefore denotes evil, 9055, 42173, 51456; to Pethor which is by the River, to the land of the 
children of his people, denotes which interprets the truths from selfish love, and from 
knowledges most external, because Pethor means uttering, interpreting, explaining, and 

307

therefore denotes these things, spiritually, 5168, 6620; the River, or the Euphrates, denotes 
knowledges most external, 1585, 1866, 120, and the land of the children of his people, 
denotes, in this case, a state of selfish love, 1733, 1992, 4112; a people come up from Egypt, 
denotes the man of the Spiritual Church delivered from the tyranny of the merely natural life, 
8866; covering the face of the earth, denotes having been instructed in Divine Truths in all 
fullness, 2576; and abiding over against Balak, denotes opposition to adulterated good, 1293, 
6907.

"Come now therefore, I pray you, curse me this people," denotes that the destruction of the 
spiritual man is desired, 245; "for they are too mighty for me," denotes that falsity cannot 
withstand truths, 8315; "peradventure I shall prevail that we may smite them," denotes that it 
may possibly prevail, and do injury, 3927, 6758; "that I may drive them out of the land," 
denotes in order that truths may be separated, 386; and "for I know that he whom you bless is 
blessed, and he whom you cursest is cursed," denotes being possessed by the delusion that 
falsity of this kind is all powerful, and is either able to effect conjunction with heaven or to 
cause aversion from it, ver. 5, 3530, 245. 

7. The elders of Moab, and the elders of Midian, denote those who are in adulterated good and in

its falsities, ver. 4; departing with the rewards of divination in their hand, denotes seeking to 
gain communication with them who teach truths from selfish principles, 9927, 3956, 3698, 
878; and their coming to Balaam and speaking the words of Balak, denotes exciting and 
stimulating in them the love of reward, and having done so to scatter the fears of adulterated 
good, and aid those who desire to throw off the influence of the spiritual man, 1853, vers. 5, 6.

8. Balaam saying, "Lodge here this night," denotes that the false prophet, from his selfishness, 

temporizes with the insinuations of evil and falsity, suggesting delay in the state of obscurity, 
8002, 1712; "and I will bring you word again as the Lord shall speak to me," denotes, 
evidently, that an answer shall be given according to the Word of the Lord, 1288, 2951, 2001; 
and the princes of Moab abiding with Balaam, denotes that corrupted good and its falsities 
abides with those who would teach the truth for selfish purposes, 1482, 2468, ver. 5. 

9. God coming to Balaam, denotes that Divine Truth also has influence with them externally, 
2001, 1853, ver. 5; and saying, "What men are these with you?" denotes the suggestion of 
inquiry as to the quality of evil influences, 1822, 2693, ver. 4. 

10. Balaam saying to God, "Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, has sent to me saying," 

denotes that confession is made that evil from the falsity of corrupted good insinuates, ver. 5, 
1822, 2001, ver. 2. 

11. "Behold, the people is come out of Egypt," denotes that the man of the Spiritual Church is 
delivered, 8866; "it covers the face of the earth," denotes that he has been instructed fully, 
2576; "now, come curse me them," denotes that corrupted good desires the suppression of him,
245; his coming out from Egypt also, evidently, denotes predominance in the external man, 
1851; and "peradventure I shall be able to fight against them, and shall drive them out," 
denotes if possible to fight against him, and to destroy him, 1664, 386. 

12. God saying to Balaam, denotes that the false prophet or teacher perceives from the Word in his

understanding, 2001, 1822, ver. 5; "You shall not go with them," denotes that he ought not to 
be associated with corrupted good and its falsities, 3335, ver. 4; "You shall not curse the 

308

people," denotes that the man of the church is not averted from the Lord, 245; and "for they 
are blessed," denotes that he has conjunction with Him, 3530. 

13. Balaam rising up in the morning, denotes a state of illustration, superstition and fear, 7306; it 
is said superstition and fear, because these are the states, as to the understanding and will, of 
the false prophet, 28263; his saying to the princes of Balak, "Get you to your land," denotes 
that he desires to separate himself from corrupted "good and its falsities, 1822, 1842, ver. 2, 
2468; and "for the Lord refuseth to give me leave to go with you," denotes that the power of 
Divine Truth prevails with him in that state, because although Jehovah denotes Divine Good, 
this is not realized by the false prophet except in externals; and to refuse in this case signifies 
the operation of Divine Truth, as it were, separate from Divine Good, 2001, 4990. 

14. The princes of Moab rising up and going to Balak, and saying, "Balaam refuseth to come with 

us," denotes that, consequently, evil and its falsity are apparently separated from 
communication with the Word falsified; and it is perceived by the corrupted man that he 
cannot avail himself of its influence, 1842, 2465. 3335. ver. 5, 4990. 

15. Balak sending yet again princes more honourable than they, denotes that still corrupted good is
persistent, and again communicates with the false teacher by exciting in him the love of 
reward more intensely, ver. 2, 4239, 1842, 8897. 

16. Their coming to Balaam and saying to him, "Thus says Balak the son of Zippor, 'Let nothing, I
pray you, hinder you from coming to me,'" denotes that thence the false teacher perceives from
the evil derived from the falsity of adulterated good that he ought by all means to be conjoined
with the evil of corrupted good, ver. 5, 1822, ver. 2, 5934. It is said here, "conjoined," and not 
merely "to communicate," or "to be present," on account of the words "let nothing hinder 
you," which clearly denote strong desire, 3173 on Gen 24:56, taking the term "hinder," or 
"delay," or "keep back," in the opposite sense here implied.

17. "For I will promote you to very great honour, and whatever you say to me I will do," denotes 
that the love of honour and glory and reward and evil is willing, for the sake of its own ends, 
to be submissive to the power of the Word falsified, ver. 5, ver. 2, 8897; and "Come therefore, 
I pray you, curse me this people," denotes that evil eagerly desires the destruction of genuine 
truths, ver. 2, 245, 1295. 

18. Balaam answering and saying to the servants of Balak, denotes that the false teacher thinks 

from the evident force of the truth, ver. 5, 6943, ver. 2; and "If Balak would give me his house 
full of silver and gold, I cannot go beyond the word of the Lord my God to do less or more," 
denotes that although corrupted good should be able, externally, to enrich him with all 
abundance of truths and good affections, yet it is impossible to exceed the limits of Divine 
Truth, which outwardly controls the wicked and compels their obedience, ver. 2, 5619, 1488, 
425, 3335, 1288, 2001, 5264. 

19. "Now therefore, I pray you, tarry you here this night that 1 may know what the Lord will 
speak to me more," denotes that yet under the influence of selfish love, which causes 
obscurity, he still temporizes, in the hope that even the Lord Himself may change, ver. 5, 3613,
1712, 2230, 2001, 2951. 

309

20. God coming to Balaam at night and saying to him, denotes that therefore, according to his 
state of obscurity, he perceives from Divine Truth when selfish impulses and thoughts are 
strong, 2001, ver. 5, 1712, 1822; it is said "when selfish impulses and thoughts are strong," 
because the messengers of Balak and their message involve this, vers. 13, 16, the men 
representing Balak, ver. 2, and their coming and calling Balaam, denote presence and influx, 
7955; Balaam rising up and going with the messengers, denotes that the false teacher is drawn 
on by evil and falsity, 2401, 3335; and "but only the word that I speak to you, that shall you 
do," denotes that still he is aware that he cannot exceed the force of Divine Truth from the 
Lord, ver. 18. 

21. Balaam rising up in the morning, saddling his ass, and going with the princes of Moab, 

denotes that therefore, in another state of illustration, he is roused to activity, adapting the 
rational faculty of the natural man to his selfish aspirations, and proceeding to communication 
with adulterous good, ver. 5, 2401, 7306, 2781, 3335, vers. 15, 16. 

22. God's anger being kindled because he went, denotes that by so doing he is averted from Divine
Truth, 2001, 5798; the angel of the Lord placing himself in the way for an adversary against 
him, denotes that it cannot but be opposed actually to his fallacies and infatuation, 6280, 
279920, 9314; and Balaam riding upon his ass, and his two servants with him, denotes that he 
is led forward by delusive arguments supported by external appearances of good and truth, 
27616, 2781, 9034, 5194. 

23. The ass seeing the angel of the Lord standing in the way, with his sword drawn in his hand, 

denotes that the Rational, in spite of its condition, perceives Divine Truth, from Divine Good 
as its opponent, and also its power to destroy falsity, 2781, 2150, 6280, 279920, 3136, 4861; 
the ass turning aside out of the way and going into the field, denotes diversion from the path of
error, and tendency to conjunction with good, 2781, 2330, 2971; and Balaam smiting the ass to
turn her into the way, denotes that the affection of falsity perverts the Rational, and forces it to 
bend to its requirements, ver. 5, 6758, 4861. 

24. The angel of the Lord standing in a hollow way between the vineyards, denotes that the 

progress of error is opposed by Divine Truth from Divine Good, as manifested in the obscure 
perception of spiritual truths, 6280, 279920, 3136, 4715, 4861, 1071; and a fence being on this 
side and a fence on that side, denotes limitation by the appearances of good and truth in the 
external or natural man, 6419, 4410. In this verse, the "hollow way" is taken to mean the same 
as a valley, and reference is made accordingly, because the Hebrew expression is formed from 
a word which means the palm or hollow of the hand; and as it is here applied in connection 
with the fences, plainly signifies a state of the obscure perception of truth peculiar to those in 
the condition represented by Balaam.

25. The ass seeing the angel of the Lord, denotes that still the Rational perceives that Divine 

Truth, as before, is opposed to it, 2781, 2150, 6280, 279920; thrusting herself against the wall 
denotes being deluded by appearances, and strongly drawn to them, 6419; crushing Balaam's 
foot against the wall, denotes that the natural affections are injured, 2162; and smiting the ass 
again, denotes that again the affection of falsity perverts the Rational to cause it to err, ver. 22. 

26. The angel of the Lord going further, and standing in a narrow place where was no way to turn 
either to the right hand or to the left, denotes that yet again the progress of error is impeded by 

310

Divine Truth from Divine Good in the state where falsity is confirmed, and where, therefore, 
no divergence from the path of error is possible, 6280, 3335, 3136, 37l6, 285115, 4861, 4410, 
10702. 

27. The ass seeing the angel of the Lord, denotes that still the Rational perceives the opposition of 
Divine Truth from Divine Good, 6280, 2150, 279920; lying down under Balaam, denotes 
prostration at the same time by the force of truth on the one hand and falsity on the other, 
6390, 9257, 6280, ver. 5; Balaam's anger being kindled, denotes the confirmation of the false 
principle and aversion from the truth, 5798; and smiting the ass with his staff, denotes that the 
Rational is still more injured by ultimate falsified truths, 6758, 4876. 

28. The Lord opening the mouth of the ass, denotes that yet even then the Rational has power, 
from the Lord, to utter truths, 6987, 2781; saying to Balaam, denotes perception, 1822; 
Balaam, as the rider of the ass, denotes the depraved will, 8265; and "What have I done to you 
that you have smitten me these three times?" denotes a charge of injustice as to the rejection of
good, ver. 23, the rejection of truth, ver. 25, and confirmation in errors, ver. 27. 

29. Balaam saying to the ass, denotes that the Rational perceives, or, in other words, that the 

wicked man is compelled to acknowledge, 1822; "Because you have mocked me," denotes that
the Rational is naturally opposed to evil and error, 2781, 2403; and "I would there were a 
sword in my hand, for now I had killed you," denotes that evil desires the destruction of the 
Rational by means of falsity, through which all sense of right and wrong is obliterated, 2799, 
878, 4727. 

30. The ass saying to Balaam, "Am not I your ass upon which you have ridden all your life long to
this day?" denotes that yet, in spite of all, Divine Good speaks through the Rational, and 
insinuates that it is the servant of the will, and has been obedient to it through the course of 
life, 2781, 1822, 8265, 4366, 2838; "Was I ever wont to do so to you?" denotes that the 
Rational is never uninfluenced by the will, 2781, 5755, 8265; and Balaam saying, "Nay," 
denotes that this the corrupted man is compelled to acknowledge, 1822, 8265. 

31. The Lord opening the eyes of Balaam, denotes that now, there-lore, even the false teacher is 

caused to perceive, 2001, 212, ver. 5; his seeing the angel of the Lord standing in the way, with
his sword drawn in his hand, denotes that Divine Truth from Divine Good is totally opposed to
him, and that truth is destructive of falsity, 2150, 6280, 3136, 4861, 279920; and his bowing 
his head and falling on his face, denotes that, externally, he is submissive both as to the 
understanding and will, 2153, 5145, 1999. 

32. The angel of the Lord saying to him, "Wherefore have you smitten your ass these three 

times?" denotes that, from the Lord, the false teacher perceives that he has abused the 
Rational, has rejected good and truth, and has confirmed himself in falsity, 6280, ver. 28; and 
"behold, I am come forth for an adversary because your way is perverse," or headlong, or 
ruined "before me," denotes that Divine Truth must necessarily oppose him, because of his 
perverted state, 6280, 9314, 4861, 9252, 9265. 

33. "And the ass saw me, and turned aside before me these three times," denotes that the Rational 
in every case had perceived the truth, and had been disposed to avoid error, 2781, 2150, 6280, 
6226, 222; and "unless she had turned aside from me, surely now I had even slain you and 

311

saved her alive," denotes that unless this had been so, liberty of choice could not have been 
left to the corrupted will, even when the Rational was free, 6226, 4727, 726. 

34. Balaam saying to the angel of the Lord, "I have sinned," denotes that the corrupted will now 

perceives that it has opposed Divine Truth, 4839; "for I knew not that you stood in the way 
against me," denotes that it has been blinded by selfish desires, 2230, 3136, 4861, ver. 5; and 
"now therefore, if it displease you, I will get me back again," denotes that, from selfish fear, it 
is willing to be outwardly obedient, 4839, 4069. It is said here "by selfish desires," and "from 
selfish fear," because such is the state of those confirmed in evil by falsity, as the context 
shows.

35. The angel of the Lord saying to Balaam, "Go with the men," denotes that Divine Truth teaches
that every man must be left to act according to reason and liberty, 6280, 1822, ver. 5, 3335, 
vers. 15, 16, 10612; "only the word that I shall speak to you, that shall you speak," denotes 
that yet the Divine Providence secretly controls all things for the best, 1288, 2951, 10774, 
10779; and Balaam going with the princes of Balak, denotes that thus the corrupted man 
decides in favour of his own selfish desires, ver. 5, 3335, vers. 15, 16. 

36. Balak hearing that Balaam was come, denotes that therefore the state of adulterated good is 

intensified by communication with the corrupted understanding, ver. 2, 3869, ver. 5, 1853; his 
going out.to meet him to the City of Moab, denotes that the will flows into the understanding 
and conjoins itself therewith in accommodated doctrine, 4247, 402, 2468; and the city being 
on the border of Arnon, in the utmost part of the border, denotes that, in this case, it is the 
conjunction of evil with falsity on the ultimate plane of life, 8063, chap 21:13, 26. 

37. Balak saying to Balaam, "Did I not earnestly send to you to call you?" denotes that the 

corrupted understanding perceives from the impulses of the depraved will that it desires to 
confirm its state by falsities, ver. 2, 1822, ver. 5, 6047; "Wherefore earnest you not to me?" 
denotes plainly, "Why, then, has there been hesitation?" vers. 12, 13; and "Am I not able 
indeed to promote you to honour?" denotes that selfish love is able to promote and exalt its 
votaries, ver. 2. 

38. Balaam saying to Balak, "Lo, I am come to you; have I now any power at all to speak to you? 
The word that God puts in my mouth, that shall I speak," denotes that the corrupted will now 
perceives from the light of truth itself, present in the corrupted understanding, that indeed it 
desires to gratify selfish love, but that it cannot overcome the power of genuine truth, and 
must, even from selfish considerations, comply with its requirements, ver. 5, 1822, ver. 2, 
5934, ver. 35. 

39. Balaam going with Balak, and their coming to Kiriath-huzoth, denotes that therefore the 

conjunction of the corrupted understanding and the depraved will is, as yet, most external, 
because by Kiriath-huzoth is meant the city of streets, of courts, of out-fields, of suburbs, and 
thus it denotes an external state, or a state most external, 2336, 3271, 7407, Lev 25:34, 6078. 

40. Balak sacrificing oxen and sheep, and sending to Balaam and the princes that were with him, 
denotes that the depraved will now influences the understanding by the force of its affections 
external and internal, and thus makes that conjunction a little stronger, ver. 2, 923, 2180, 4239,
ver. 5, 1482. 

312

41. It coming to pass in the morning denotes the occurrence of a state of illustration, 4979, 7306; 

Balak taking Balaam, and bringing him up into the high places of Baal, denotes the falsities 
from selfish love from which is corrupted worship, 2722, 10642; and his seeing from there the 
utmost part of the people denotes that the corrupted understanding is gifted, for the time being,
with the perception of the opposing truths of the church remotely, 2150, 3695, 1259. 

DISCUSSION

In commenting upon this most interesting chapter, even in its literal sense, let us, to begin with, 
consider all together the first three sections. The picture in general is the state of the church, when so 
far depraved as to be confirmed in its state of adulterated good. And this is evident from the whole 
contents of this chapter in its internal sense, and also from the contents of the two chapters following; 
as well as from what is said in ver. 1, namely, that the children of Israel pitched in the plains of Moab, 
beyond Jordan, at Jericho. For by pitching a tent is here denoted the conjunction of falsity with evil; 
beyond the Jordan manifestly signifying as to the external man, and by Jericho some knowledge of 
good and truth in that state. But it must not be forgotten that the children of Israel, specifically, denote 
the true church as to its internal state in this narrative.

But next we have to consider the signification of Balak the son of Zippor the king of the Moabites, and 
his fear of the Israelites; and as Balak means what wastes and destroys, it is clear that he denotes the 
inmost principle of evil which corrupts good, this being derived from the falsity signified by Zippor, 
which means a bird or sparrow, and some suppose this was only a particular name of Balak, while 
others think it may have been the name of the former king of Moab (chap 21:26), whom Sihon the king
of the Amorites had conquered; but in any case it is clear that Zippor, from correspondence, denotes the
falsity productive of the evil denoted by Balak; that is, the falsity derived from the evil of selfish love, 
for evidently this is that by which good from the Lord is adulterated. For in Ps 84:3, the sparrow 
denotes spiritual truth (AE 39111), but here in the opposite sense, falsity; and if we take the Hebrew 
word to mean a sparrow in particular, and not a bird in general, then, as being one of the smaller birds, 
it will correspond to the falsity from selfish love acting through the sensual love, namely, that sensual 
love into which man is first born, and which first adulterates good from the Lord. Our lesson, therefore,
in this connection is that we must be particularly careful in not allowing our good to be contaminated 
with such falsity. But we now learn also another lesson, namely, that they who are confirmed in evil, 
like those here represented by Balak and the Moabites, are inspired with fears, by the proximity of 
spiritual good and truth, not, however, because these are the cause of any fear, but on account of the 
opposition and aversion of the wicked themselves to what is good and true, and because this fear is 
intensified by the falsities in which they are confirmed, as is shown, by the spiritual sense of ver. 4. For 
the Midianites denote such falsities, as we have already seen. And here, too, we may be reminded that 
"in general all who in the hells are ruled by fears (HH 543), and also that "there is no fear in love: but 
perfect love casteth out fear, because fear has punishment; and he that fears is not made perfect in love"
(1 John 4:18). Hence, therefore, we may now understand well the spiritual meaning of Balak and the 
Moabites, and also of the Midianites, who play so important a part in this history.

But now Balak sends messengers to the false prophet Balaam. And it is particularly interesting to 
observe, again, how the meaning of the proper names gives their correspondence, and also how the 
sense derived from the combination of these correspondences coheres with the subject and with the 
series of the internal sense of vers. 5-7. And consider here two points. First of all corrupted good, in its 
confirmed state, values the truth of the Word, and seeks by its means, as falsified by the corrupted 

313

understanding, to secure its ends, which, of course, are selfish ends. And this thing, as, indeed, we 
know from history, has actually taken place in former perverted churches; and also there is a strong 
tendency in the unregenerated and yet imperfect man of the church thus to act. And, secondly, the 
corrupted understanding is excited and stimulated by the love of reward, and for the sake of such 
reward is willing, if it only be permitted, to curse instead of to bless, good and true spiritual principles, 
or the church which is the embodiment of such principles. Let every person, therefore, search in his 
own heart and mind, and beware of these two things, in his own case, in order that his progress in 
regeneration may not be hindered thereby. For evils in ourselves cannot be overcome if we do not know
that they are evils.; we cannot know this unless we see them to be so by means of the truth; and they 
cannot be seen unless they appear. And this accounts for the fact that people begin to be tempted when 
they have established in themselves some principles of truth.

And now the fourth section provides us with more food for reflection. It is plain from the signification 
of Balak and Balaam that the one represents evil and the other falsity, and therefore, also, that by Balak 
sending messengers to Balaam is denoted the influx of evil into falsity, or influx from the hells with 
those who are disposed to confirm falsities from their selfish love of reward. And therefore, also, by 
Balaam saying to Balak's messengers, "Lodge here this night," is denoted the encouragement all of us 
are disposed to give to evil influences; and it will be seen in the sequel of this history, both literally and 
spiritually, what the final result of giving such encouragement is, when it is persisted in. Hence, then, 
let the man of the church determine early in his life to steadily oppose the impulses of evil in himself 
by the adoption of truth from the Lord through the Word in sincerity, and not for selfish and 
hypocritical purposes, as in the case of Balaam and those whom he represents. For it is certain that he 
who deliberately makes use of what he knows to be the truth simply to gain his own ends is in a very 
dangerous position. But now see, in the next place, what the natural effect of the reception of the truth 
into our minds really is. For by God coming to Balaam in the night is signified that, even when we are 
inclined to entertain and temporize with the evil delights intensified in us by wicked spirits, conscience 
speaks to us and urges us to examine ourselves as to the quality of our merely natural appetites and 
passions. And thus what in the literal sense of the Word applies to only one person, in the spiritual 
sense is applicable to all men. And besides this, observe here that the term "God," has especial 
reference to the truth, while the term Lord, or Jehovah, has reference to good. And thirdly, note the 
confession of Balaam. In the light of the Truth, the corrupted man knows the quality of the evil that 
besets him, and he also knows the quality of the true church; and yet, internally, he hates the good and 
the true and cherishes the evil. For what Balak wishes in this case, is the wish of Balaam also. This 
account therefore, looked at internally, really shows how the corrupted understanding at last becomes 
one with the corrupted will, and rejects the truth, even as the will has rejected the love of it. And yet, 
while the state of probation lasts he is not without the capacity to see the truth, nor without the capacity
to adopt it in sincerity. And moreover, from his fear of the consequences, he is able outwardly to 
conform to it, as the last verses of the section show.

But before concluding we have, again, two considerations to impress upon ourselves. For first of all, 
the truth teaches that man is forbidden to associate himself with what is false and evil, but on the 
contrary, to reject them. And therefore it is the primary work of every man in his regeneration, to avoid 
evil as a sin, and not merely to do so because it is dangerous or hurtful. Balaam sent back the 
messengers, but only through selfish fear; the sincere man, on the contrary, rejects evil, and also falsity,
because they are opposed to what is good, and on that account are equally opposed to what is true. And 
secondly, the truth cannot, from its very nature, cause harm to any one, nor can it cause the aversion 
from good which is involved in cursing; but on the other hand, it leads inevitably to a state of good, and

314

therefore it is the means of conjunction with the Lord, by love. And so it is well for us just at this point 
also, to emphasize the fact, that it is evil itself that constitutes hell, and goodness itself that constitutes 
heaven, and consequently that where evil is, truth cannot abide, while where good is, what is false 
cannot abide permanently.

But, coming to the fifth section, we have particularly to notice that it describes the decision of the will 
to act contrary to the teaching of the truth, and this is evident in the beginning, from the fact that Balak 
now sends to the false prophet princes more and more honourable than the former. That is, while the 
number of the messengers were increased, their dignity was also greater, thus indicating, spiritually, an 
appeal to the selfish affections, as well as to the intellect proud of its acquirements and its powers. And 
that is the reason why, in the first appeal, the messengers say, "For I know that he whom you bless is 
blessed, and he whom you cursest is cursed," whereas in the second the insinuation is, "I will promote 
you to very great honour, and whatever you say to me I will do." Hence, therefore, we may here 
remember with advantage that every man, having the opportunity of being regenerated, is required to 
make the decision whether he will or not, both from his understanding and his will, and, indeed, 
principally from the will, because this is the real man, and the understanding only so far as it agrees 
with the will. And, again, another important point now before us is that, whatever may be the state of 
him who is confirmed in wickedness, as to the understanding or the will, signified by silver and gold, 
or whatever may be his attitude towards truth and goodness, yet still the Lord governs him by Divine 
Truth, and compels his obedience to the laws of Divine Order in his own sphere and on his own plane; 
not, indeed, that either Divine Good or Divine Truth compel, but that the fear of suffering, or 
punishment with the wicked man and also with infernals does this. For it must be manifest from the 
character of selfish love that finally, through this fear, it will prefer a life of constrained obedience 
(Matt 25:46; HH 480, 543), to a life of perpetual punishment; and therefore it is said of the infernals, 
who are permitted for the wisest of reasons (HH 696) to inflict punishment on others, that these 
governors dare not pass beyond the limits prescribed for them (HH 543). Hence, now we see the exact 
spiritual value of the words uttered by Balaam: "I cannot go beyond the word of the Lord my God, to 
do less or more." And that this actually refers to the infernals is evident from the representation of 
Balak and Balaam.

One point more, however, remains to be noticed, and that is that the Lord gives His consent for Balaam
to go with the messengers. Why is this? It is in order to teach the eternal truth that neither the Divine 
Being Himself, nor any angel of heaven, ever compels an infernal to act contrary to his own will. And 
hence we see that in the next section, which must now be considered, it is said that God's anger was 
kindled because he went, and that the angel of the Lord placed himself in the way for an adversary 
against him. And this requires particular attention. For God, or the Lord as to His Divine Truth, 2001, is
never angry, nor does the Lord, or the Divine Good, ever act as an adversary. But it is the wicked man 
himself who is opposed to Divine Truth, and thus causes the appearance of anger and opposition in the 
Lord. For if the Lord were really the changeable Being that the states of man cause Him to appear to 
be, the universe could neither have been created, nor could it be preserved. Let man therefore be as 
careful in distinguishing between appearances and realities in the Word of the Lord as the scientist is in 
doing so with regard to the Works of the Lord in creation. And, proceeding to the other section, we see 
further the need of this caution. The appearance was that the ass saw the angel of the Lord by means of 
its ordinary sight, but the reality was that it saw by spiritual sight; and also the appearance was that the 
ass spoke, while yet it was not the ass but the angel. For it is not possible for material eyes to see 
anything in the spiritual world, nor had the ass the power to speak and think rationally, 1880, 1637, 
1638, AE 1404. Before, however, considering the internal sense, it may be observed, by way of 

315

illustration, that although animals do not live for ever, because they have not the higher degrees of life, 
yet still their life is from the spiritual world, for "the wonderful knowledge which is, as it were, 
implanted in every animal is generally known" (HH 108); they have also a "spiritual part" (HH 435); 
and "he who believes that natural heat produces their loves is much deceived, for there is an influx of 
the spiritual world into the natural, and not of the natural world into the spiritual; and all love is 
spiritual because it is of the life itself" (HH 567); from all which it may be comprehended, in some 
measure, how the ass of Balaam was able to see the angel of the Lord.

And now, in taking a general review of the spiritual sense of the rest of the chapter, it will be best to 
consider the three states in which the corrupted man is, as he advances in the path of evil and error, the 
first being a state of enlightenment, and freedom, nevertheless, to act according to his evil will; the 
second being a state of obscurity limited by the appearance of good and truth in the external or natural 
man; and the third being a state in which falsity is confirmed, and there is no divergence from the path 
of error, as appears from vers. 21, 24, and 26 respectively. And can we not see that those are all brought
about by every wicked man himself in his determination to act contrary to the truth which he knows, 
indeed, but does not love? There is no wonder, therefore, that it appears to him through his rational 
mind as the angel of the Lord with a sword drawn in his hand, as an angel because it is in reality truth, 
conjoined with good, and with a sword because of the opposition between truth and falsity. And here 
we come to a thing that is very remarkable. Balaam expresses no surprise when the Lord opened the 
mouth of the ass, but replies to him as if it was quite a natural event. Herein, therefore, is set forth a 
common spiritual experience. For those represented by Balaam know very well indeed that the Lord 
speaks to them through their rational faculty, and condemns their wickedness, even as the ass reproved 
the false prophet. But yet this fact does not make them value the power of reason as they should by 
ascribing it to the Lord, and following its teaching. On the contrary, it excites their rage, and enkindles 
in them a strong desire to destroy in themselves the power of seeing the truth. And this, moreover, is 
what actually comes to pass with him who is confirmed in wickedness. And so it follows that the 
corrupted man is compelled to acknowledge that the Rational is always the faithful servant of the will, 
and, from the Lord, would never lead man astray. But, again, we have a most interesting point. The 
Lord opened the eyes of Balaam. That is, literally, He opened his spiritual sight so that he might see the
angel with the drawn sword; but spiritually, He elevates the understanding of the corrupted man, so that
he perceives his own opposition to Divine Truth; that he has perverted his rational faculty by the abuse 
of his liberty; that now he can only be externally obedient from fear, and that, in spite of his wish to the
contrary, he will yet be compelled to speak and act according to the truth. This, therefore, really is a 
summary of the spiritual teaching, from vers. 31-35 inclusive, and involves most weighty truths 
concerning the final state of a bad man. And we proceed now to consider the remainder of the chapter. 
For careful thought, in connection with the correspondences of the Word, will show that it describes the
conjunction of the corrupted will and understanding in the ultimate plane of life: and at the same time 
that the understanding is still capable of being elevated so as to perceive truths, under certain 
circumstances, that is, when separated, for the time being, from the depraved will. And concerning this,
as a conclusion, we here transcribe the following: "Evil spirits are sometimes seen turned towards the 
quarters of heaven, and then they have the intelligence and perception of truth, but no affection for 
good; and therefore as soon as they turn themselves backwards to their own quarters, they cease to be 
in the intelligence and in the perception of truth, and say that the truths which they had before heard 
and perceived are not truths, but falsities; they also wish falsities to be truths. I am informed with 
regard to this turning, that with the evil the understanding can be so turned, but not the will; and that 
this is provided of the Lord to the intent that every one may be able to see and acknowledge truths, but 
no one receives them unless he is in good, because it is good which receives truths, and never evil. The 

316

case is similar with man, in order that he may be amended by truths; but still he is not amended any 
further than he is in good. On this account man can, in like manner, be turned to the Lord, but if he is in
evil as to life, he soon turns himself back again, and confirms in himself the falsities of his evil in 
opposition to the truths which he had understood and seen; and this takes place when he thinks within 
himself from his own interior state" (HH 153).

Numbers Chapter 23

SUMMARY OF THE SPIRITUAL SENSE

1. On the false worship of those who are in adulterated good, from selfish love most external, in 
order that there may be, with the man of the true church, aversion from the Lord, vers. 1-6. 

2. But the corrupted understanding which is internally in agreement with the depraved will, is 

compelled, nevertheless, externally, and yet truly, to show that the good man has conjunction 
with the Lord, vers. 7-12. 

3. Secondly, the same false worship is continued with the same object; the will and 

understanding of the corrupted man are more closely conjoined in another state; and they 
receive revelation again contrary to their wish, vers. 13-26. 

4. And, thirdly, they still desire to make a final effort to shake off the influence of the good and 
the true, in a state of the interior will, from which they discern that they are about to be quite 
desolated as to both, vers. 27-30. 

THE CONTENTS OF EACH VERSE

1. And Balaam said to Balak, Build me 
here seven altars, and prepare me 
here seven bullocks and seven rams. 

2. And Balak did as Balaam had 
spoken; and Balak and Balaam 
offered on every altar a bullock and 
a ram. 

3. And Balaam said to Balak, Stand by 
your burnt offering, and I will go; 
per-adventure the LORD will come to 
meet me: and whatever he shows me
I will tell you. And he went to a bare 
height. 

1. And now there is perception from falsified truths 

with him who is in adulterated good, that the Lord 
must be worshiped superstitiously from natural 
and spiritual affections apparently in all 
completeness and in all holiness. 

2. And this is actually effected; for natural affection 
and spiritual affection, seem to be in true worship 
as to will and understanding. 

3. And it seems to corrupted good that such worship 
must be genuine and constant; also that there is 
aspiration under the influence of falsified truths, 
after interior communication with the Lord, and 
the desire that selfish worship may he accepted; 
also that thus the corrupted man is to be 
enlightened. But in this worship there, is no 
genuine good or truth. 

4. And God met Balaam: and he said to
him, I have prepared the seven altars,
and I have offered up a bullock and a
ram on every altar. 

4. Although there is external communication. And 

therefore the corrupted man is fully persuaded that
he is in genuine worship both as to the natural and 
spiritual minds. 

318

5. And the LORD put a word in 

Balaam's mouth, and said, Return to 
Balak, and thus you shall speak. 

6. And he returned to him, and, lo, he 
stood by his burnt offering, he, and 
all the princes of Moab. 

5. Moreover, there is influx from the Divine Good by
Divine Truth into the intellect of the corrupted 
man giving the perception that although, interiorly,
he is in adulterated good, yet, exteriorly, he must 
utter genuine truths. 

6. And therefore now, the corrupted man receives 
revelation according to his state which is that of 
earnest external worship without internal both as 
to will and understanding. 

7. And he took up his parable, and said,

7. And hence there is perception from the Word 

From Aram has Balak brought me, 
The king of Moab from the 
mountains of the East: 
Come, curse me Jacob, 
And come, defy Israel. 

through its genuine literal sense in which is the 
spiritual sense, that adulterated good surely desires
the knowledges of good and truth; also that 
falsified truth thence is given externally, for 
conjunction by love with the Lord, while yet it is 
inwardly in aversion therefrom both as to natural 
and spiritual realities; 

8. How shall I curse, whom God has 

not cursed? 
And how shall I defy, whom the 
LORD has not defied? 

8. And is compelled to acknowledge, nevertheless, 
that what is manifestly true cannot be false; and 
that what is manifestly good cannot be evil. 

9. For from the top of the rocks I see 

9. For all natural truths are seen from natural good, 

him, 
And from the hills I behold him: 
Lo, it is a people that dwell alone, 
And shall not be reckoned among the
nations. 

and all spiritual truths are seen from spiritual good,
and both are manifestations of the Lord; while the 
man of the Spiritual Church is in faith conjoined 
with charity, nor can he be in the prevailing love of
evils. 

10. Who can count the dust of Jacob, 

Or number the fourth part of Israel? 
Let me die the death of the righteous,

And let my last end be like his! 

11. And Balak said to Balaam, What 

have you done to me? I took you to 
curse mine enemies, and, behold, 
you have blessed them altogether. 

10. Nor is the quality of the regenerated natural man 
as to the abundance of truth, or of the will of the 
regenerated spiritual man as to conjunction with 
the Lord, known to any but the Lord Himself. And 
even the corrupted man appears to be desirous of 
regeneration, and this too, both as to the will and 
understanding. 

11. And it is perceived by the corrupted man in spite 
of his evil state, not only that he is essentially in 
evil and desires the destruction of good and truth, 
but also that these are utterly opposed to him, 
because they are from the Lord and give 
conjunction with Him. 

319

12. And he answered and said, Must I 

not take heed to speak that which the
LORD puts in my mouth? 

12. But still, in externals, he acknowledges the Lord 
and His Word, and is compelled to put on the 
appearance of reverence for it, and even to utter its
precepts, as if they proceeded from genuine faith 
and charity on his part. 

13. And Balak said to him, Come, I pray
you, with me to another place, from 
whence you may see them; you shall
see but the utmost part of them, and 
shall not see them all: and curse me 
them from there. 

13. But now a change of state takes place, in which the
corrupted will and the perverted understanding are 
more closely conjoined; and then there is another 
perception of opposing goods and truths somewhat
more internal, the desire to cause aversion 
continuing. 

14. And he took him into the field of 
Zophim, to the top of Pisgah, and 
built seven altars, and offered up a 
bullock and a ram on every altar. 

15. And he said to Balak, Stand here by 
your burnt offering, while I meet the
Lord yonder. 

14. For, under the influence of selfish love the 

understanding contemplates the truths of the 
church, and investigates their quality preparing 
again to simulate genuine worship both as to the 
natural and spiritual affections. 

15. And again such worship is continued and 

communication with the Lord is sought for, 

16. And the LORD met Balaam, and put a
word in his mouth, and said, Return 
to Balak, and thus shall you speak. 

16. Such communication being granted according to 

the state, while still the corrupted understanding is 
interiorly conjoined with adulterated good, 

17. And he came to him, and, lo, he 

stood by his burnt offering, and the 
princes of Moab with him. And 
Balak said to him, What has the 
LORD spoken? 

18. And he took up his parable, and said,

Rise up, Balak, and hear; 
Hearken to me, you son of Zippor: 

19. God is not a man, that he should lie; 
Neither the son of man, that he 
should repent: 
Has he said, and shall he not do it? 
Or has he spoken, and shall he not 
make it good? 

17. And this conjunction actually takes place while 
there is yet more earnest devotion as to both 
affection and thought, revelation from the Lord 
being eagerly desired. 

18. And hence this is given from the genuine truth of 
the Word in which is the spiritual sense, namely, 
that adulterated good must be elevated as to the 
understanding, that it may perceive the good and 
truth of the Word, 

19. And must learn indeed, that Divine Truth is not 

like human thought, changeable and liable to err; 
and that Divine Good is not like human affection, 
variable and needing repentance; for what is 
essentially true, that the Divine Being always 
does; and what is essentially good, that He always 
promotes. 

320

20. Behold, I have received 
commandment to bless: 
And he has blessed, and I cannot 
reverse it. 

21. He has not beheld iniquity in Jacob, 
Neither has he seen perverseness in 
Israel: 
The LORD his God is with him, 
And the shout of a king is among 
them. 

20. Nor it is possible for even the perverted 

understanding, when brought into the light of 
truth, to avoid seeing that the good have 
conjunction with the Lord, nor can evil prevent 
this conjunction with those who are in good. 

21. For with them the natural man is obedient to 

natural truths, and the spiritual man is obedient to 
spiritual truths; and with them good is conjoined to
truth internally and externally; 

22. God brings them forth out of Egypt; 
He has as it were the strength of the 
wild-ox. 

22. They are delivered from all the evils of the natural 
man corrupted; and are endowed with the full 
power of natural good from the Lord. 

23. Surely there is no enchantment with 

23. Nor can they be overcome by those who pervert 

Jacob, 
Neither is there any divination with 
Israel: 
Now shall it be said of Jacob and of 
Israel, 
What has God worked! 

and prostitute Divine Truths, when they are made 
to appear as falsities in the natural or spiritual 
degree of their minds. For both the natural and 
spiritual man regenerated are under the protection 
of the Lord, and to Him all their salvation is due. 

24. Behold, the people rises up as a 

24. And the regenerated natural, acting from 

lioness, 
And as a lion does he lift himself up:

He shall not lie down until he eat of 
the prey, 
And drink the blood of the slain. 

regenerated spiritual affection, is all powerful; and 
so also is natural truth conjoined with that 
affection; nor does the good man at all rest until 
good and truth are fully appropriated by him, and 
until the evil and falsity of adulterated good are 
entirely removed. 

25. And Balak said to Balaam, Neither 
curse them at all, nor bless them at 
all. 

25. But the corrupted man who is confirmed in his 
wickedness desires entire separation from both 
natural and spiritual good. 

26. But Balaam answered and said to 
Balak, Told not I you, saying, All 
that the LORD speaks, that I must do?

26. And at the same time, in that state, he clearly 

perceives from the light of truth in his 
understanding, that he is compelled externally to 
be obedient to the laws of Divine Order. 

27. And Balak said to Balaam, Come 

now, I will take you to another place;
peradventure it will please God that 
you may curse me them from thence.

27. And yet he is so infatuated from selfish love, that 
he still desires to make a final effort to shake off 
the influence of the good and the true by further 
delusions. 

321

28. And Balak took Balaam to the top of
Peor, that looks down upon the 
desert. 

28. And therefore he is now led into the state of the 

interior will, from which he discerns that he is 
about to be quite desolated as to all good and truth.

29. And Balaam said to Balak, Build me 
here seven altars, and prepare me 
here seven bullocks and seven rams. 

29. While still from the corrupted understanding he is 
disposed again to simulate true worship, and this 
both as to the natural and spiritual affections as 
before. 

30. And Balak did as Balaam had said, 
and offered up a bullock and a ram 
on every altar. 

30. And he proceeds to do so, in reality devoting to 

selfish worship every natural affection and every 
spiritual affection. 

REFERENCES AND NOTES

1. Balaam saying to Balak, "Build me here seven altars, and prepare me here seven bullocks, and
seven rams," denotes that now there is perception from falsified truths, with him who is in 
adulterated good, that the Lord must be worshiped, superstitiously, from natural and spiritual 
affections, apparently in all completeness and in all holiness, chap 22:5, 2, 1822, 153, 4541, 
7346, 716, 10021, 10042

2. Balak doing as Balaam had spoken, denotes that this is actually effected, 4258; and offering on
every altar a bullock and a ram, denotes that natural affection and spiritual affection seem to 
be in true worship as to will and understanding, 10021, 10042. It is said, "as to will and 
understanding," because Balak and Balaam signify the will and understanding respectively, 
chap 22:5, 2. 

3. Balak being told by Balaam to stand by his burnt offering, denotes that it seems to corrupted 

good that such worship must be genuine and constant, 7436, 1822, 923; Balaam going, that the
Lord perhaps might come to meet him, denotes aspiration, through falsified truths, after 
interior communication with the Lord, and the desire that selfish worship may be accepted, 
3335, 2001, 4247; "Whatsoever he shows me I will tell you," denotes that thus the corrupted 
man is to be enlightened, 2001, 2807, 3209; and Balaam going to a bare height, denotes that in
this worship there is no genuine good or truth, 3335, 2722. 

4. By God meeting Balaam is denoted external communication, 2001, 4247; and by Balaam 
saying, "I have prepared the seven altars, and I have offered a bullock and a ram on every 
altar," is denoted that the corrupted man is fully persuaded that he is in genuine worship, both 
as to the natural and spiritual minds, ver. 1. 

5. The Lord putting a word in Balaam's mouth and saying, "Return to Balak, and thus shall you 
speak," denotes that there is influx from Divine Good by Divine Truth into the intellect of the 
corrupted man, giving the perception that although interiorly he is in adulterated good, yet 
exteriorly he must utter genuine truths, 2001, 1288, 8068, 4217, 2619. 

6. Balaam returning to Balak, his standing by his burnt offering, and all the princes of Moab with
him, denotes that, therefore, the corrupted man receives revelation according to his state, 
which is that of earnest external worship without internal, both as to the will and 
understanding, 4217, 7436, 923, 1482, 2468. 

322

7. Balaam taking up his parable and saying, denotes perception from the Word through its 
genuine literal sense in which is the spiritual sense, 4637, 1822; "From Aram has Balak 
brought me," denotes that adulterated good surely desires the knowledges of good and truth, 
1234; "the king of Moab from the mountains of the East," denotes that falsified truth thence is 
given externally for conjunction by love with the Lord, 1672, 2468, chap 22:5, 795, 1451; and 
"Come, curse me Jacob, come, defy Israel," denotes that yet it is inwardly in aversion 
therefrom both as to natural and spiritual realities, 5934, 245, 5973. 

8.

9.

"How shall I curse, whom God has not cursed? And how shall I defy, whom the Lord has not 
defied?" denotes compulsion to acknowledge, nevertheless, that what is manifestly true cannot
be false; and that what is manifestly good cannot be evil, 245, 2001. 

"From the top of the rocks I see him, and from the hills I behold him," denotes that all natural 
truths are seen from natural good, and all spiritual truths from spiritual good, 8827, 10438, 
2150, 5973; and "Lo, it is a people that dwell alone, and shall not be reckoned among the 
nations," denotes that the man of the Spiritual Church is in faith conjoined with charity, nor 
can he be in the prevailing love of evils, 1259, 10160, 471. 

10. "Who can count the dust of Jacob, or number the fourth part of Israel?" denotes that neither is 
the quality of the regenerated natural man, as to the abundance of truth, or of the will of the 
regenerated spiritual man as to conjunction with the Lord, known to any but the Lord Himself,
10217, 1610, 10136, 5973; and "Let me die the death of the righteous, and let my last end be 
like his!" denotes that even the corrupted man appears to be desirous of regeneration, and this, 
too, both as to the will and understanding, chap 22:5, 6221, 712, 683. 

11. Balak saying to Balaam, "What have you done to me?" denotes that it is perceived by the 
corrupted man in spite of his evil state, chap 22:2, 1822; and "I took you to curse mine 
enemies, and, behold, you have blessed them altogether," denotes not only that he is 
essentially in evil, and desires the destruction of good and truth, but also that these are utterly 
opposed to him, because they are from the Lord, and give conjunction with Him, 245, 2851, 
3514. 

12. Balaam answering and saying, "Must I not take heed to speak that which the Lord puts in my 
mouth?" denotes that still, in externals, he acknowledges the Lord and His Word, and is 
compelled to put on the appearance of reverence for it, and even to utter its precepts as if they 
proceeded from genuine faith and charity on his part, 6943, 42924, 2001, 2951, 3313. 

13. Balak saying to Balaam, "Come, I pray you, with me to another place from whence you may 
sec them," denotes that now a change of state takes place, in which the corrupted will and 
perverted understanding are more closely conjoined, 1853, 2625, 2150; "you shall see but the 
utmost part of them, and shall not see them all," denotes that then there is another perception 
of the man of the church or of opposing goods and truths somewhat more internal, 2150, 3695,
5973; and "curse me them from here," denotes that the desire to cause aversion still continues, 
245. 

14. Balak taking Balaam into the field of Zophim, to the top of Pisgah, and building seven altars 

and offering a bullock and a ram on every altar, denotes that under the influence of selfish love
the understanding contemplates the truths of the church, and investigates their quality, 
preparing again to simulate genuine worship both as to the natural and spiritual affections, 

323

because the field of Zophim, being in Moab, denotes a religious corruption, 4440, 2468; the 
top or head of the mountain here signifies, in the opposite sense, selfish love, Pisgah meaning 
a hill, 8827; Zophim means watchmen, or observers, and thus those who investigate, 10134; 
and building altars and offering the animals, denotes the simulation of genuine worship both as
to natural and spiritual affections, ver. 1. 

15. Balaam saying to Balak, "Stand here by the burnt offering, while I meet the Lord yonder," 

denotes that again such worship is continued, and communication with the Lord is sought for, 
ver. 3. 

16. The Lord meeting Balaam; putting a word in his mouth; and saying, "Return to Balak, and 
thus shall them speak," denotes that such communication is granted according to the state, 
while still the corrupted understanding is interiorly conjoined with adulterated good, ver. 5. 

17. Balaam coming to Balak, who stood by his burnt offering, and the princes of Moab with him; 
and the latter saying, "What has the Lord spoken?" denotes that this conjunction actually takes
place, while there is yet more earnest devotion as to both affection and thought, revelation 
from the Lord being eagerly desired, ver. 6. 

18. Balaam taking up his parable and saying, denotes that revelation from the Lord is given by 

means of the genuine truth of the Word in which is the spiritual sense, 4637, 1822; and "Rise 
up, Balak, and hear, hearken to me, you son of Zippor," denotes that adulterated good must be 
elevated as to the understanding that it may perceive the good and truth of the Word, 2401, 
8361, chap 22:2, 683. 

19. "God is not a man that he should lie; neither the son of man, that he should repent," denotes 
that Divine Truth is not like human thought, changeable and liable to err; and that Divine 
Good is not like human affection, variable and needing repentance, 2001, 429, 7120, 8908, 
587; and "Has he said and shall he not do it? Or has he spoken and shall he not make it good?"
denotes that the Divine Being always does what is essentially true; and that He always 
promotes what is essentially good, 629, 2951, 683. 

20. "Behold, I have received commandment to bless: and he has blessed, and I cannot reverse it," 
denotes that it is not possible for even the perverted understanding, when brought into the light
of truth to avoid seeing that the good have conjunction with the Lord, nor can evil prevent this 
conjunction with those who are in good, chap 22:5, 3514, 5973, 2001, 4816. 

21. "He has not beheld iniquity in Jacob, neither has he seen perverseness in Israel," denotes that 
with them the natural man is obedient to natural truths; and the spiritual man is obedient to 
spiritual truths, 2150, 9937, 9252, 5973; and "The Lord his God is with him, and the shout of a
king is among them," denotes that with them good is conjoined with truth internally and 
externally, 2001, 8815, 1672, 5973. 

22. "God brings them forth out of Egypt; he has as it were the strength of the wild-ox," denotes 
that the good are delivered from all the evils of the natural man corrupted; and are endowed 
with the full power of natural good from the Lord, 2001, 8866, 6343, 2180, 5973. 

23. "Surely there is no enchantment with Jacob; neither is there any divination with Israel," 

denotes that the good cannot be overcome by those who pervert and prostitute Divine Truth, 
when they are made to appear as falsities in the natural or spiritual degree of their minds, 

324

3698, 7297, 5973; and "Now shall it be said of Jacob and of Israel, What has God worked!" 
denotes that both the natural and spiritual man regenerated are under the protection of the 
Lord, and to Him all their salvation is due, 5973, 2001, 8329. 

24. "Behold the people rises up as a lioness, and as a lion does he lift himself up," denotes that the 

regenerated Natural acting from regenerated spiritual affection is all powerful; and so also is 
natural truth conjoined with that affection, 1259, 6367, 725, 1543; and "He shall not lie down 
until he eat the prey, and drink the blood of the slain," denotes that the good man does not at 
all rest, until good and truth are fully appropriated by him, and until the evil and falsity of 
adulterated good are entirely removed, 5973, 3606, 2187, 3168, 5763, 1851, 4735, 4503. 

25. Balak saying to Balaam, "Neither curse them at all, nor bless them at all," denotes that the 

corrupted man who is confirmed in his wickedness, desires entire separation from both natural
good and spiritual good, chap 22:2, 5, 1822, 245, 3514, 5973. It is the affection involved in 
these words that involves the desire for entire separation; and they describe the actual internal 
state of those represented by Balak and Balaam.

26. Balaam answering and saying to Balak, "Told not I you saying, All that the Lord speaks that I 
must do?" denotes that, at the same time, in that state, he clearly perceives from the light of 
truth in his understanding, that he is compelled, externally, to be obedient to the laws of Divine
Order, 6943, 3209, 1822, 2001, 2951, 4258. 

27. Balak saying to Balaam, "Come now, 1 will take you to another place; peradventure it will 

please God that you may curse me them from there," denotes that yet he is so infatuated from 
selfish love that he still desires to make a final effort to shake off the influence of the good and
the true by further delusions, 1822, 1853, 2625, 2001, 8361, 245. 

28. Balak taking Balaam to the top of Peor that looks down upon the desert, or upon Jeshimon, 
denotes that therefore he is now led into the state of the interior will from which he discerns 
that he is about to be quite desolated as to all good and truth, because by Peor is meant a hole 
or opening, and Baal-peor was an idol of Moab; and hence by the top or head of mount Peor is
denoted the interior will of those who are in adulterated good, 8827, 2468, 5145; by looking 
down is denoted discernment, in this case, as to evil and falsity, 248, 58955; and by the desert 
or Jeshimon is denoted a slate of desolation, 2708. 

29. Balaam saying to Balak, "Build me here seven altars, and prepare me here seven bullocks, and
seven rams," denotes that still from the corrupted understanding, he is disposed again to 
simulate true worship, and this both as to the natural and spiritual affections as before, ver. 1. 

30. Balak doing as Balaam had said to him, and offering a bullock and a ram on every altar, 

denotes that he proceeds to do so, in reality devoting to selfish worship every natural affection 
and every spiritual affection, ver. 2. 

DISCUSSION

It is necessary, in commencing our review of this chapter, to explain what is meant generally by the 
statement of the first section that the false worship of those who are in adulterated good, arises from a 
desire to produce aversion from the Lord in the man of the true church. It is clear that Balak and 
Balaam together denote those who are in adulterated good as to the will and understanding; it is also 

325

evident that the Israelites represent those who are of the true Spiritual Church; and therefore it follows 
that the desire of Balak that Balaam should curse the Israelites, denotes that a state of confirmed 
adulterated good ends in aversion from the Lord, because cursing denotes aversion, 245, and the evil 
desired for another returns upon him who cherishes it, besides which while the Israelites were in the 
plains of Moab, they represent the man of the church under the influence of adulterated good, and to be
in such a state tends to produce aversion from the Lord. It may seem, however, to some, to be a very 
strange thing that the man of the true church should be in such a state, just before his admission into the
promised land, or into the true heavenly state; but it must be remembered that there are several degrees 
of adulterated good, and that, indeed, the good of every one is more or less contaminated by selfish 
motives until he is fully regenerated; also that, in the case of a corrupted church with man, the new 
state of the church cannot be fully established until the falsities and evils of the old state are removed.

And, secondly, in regard to this section, we are to notice that the external worship of those in corrupted 
good, resembles, in outward appearance the worship of the true spiritual man, and that this is 
represented by the altars built by Balak, and by a bullock and a ram being offered on every altar. For 
bullocks signify the devotion of the natural affections to the Lord, and rams denote the devotion of the 
spiritual affections to Him, so that the corrupted worship here represented seems altogether as if it were
true worship from natural and spiritual affection, or from external and internal good at the same time. 
But since it was not so, therefore it next follows that Balaam went to seek for revelation to a bare 
height, to denote that, in this worship, there is really no genuine good or truth. And yet we shall see as 
we proceed all through the account, that the corrupted man, or the corrupted church is obliged to teach 
Divine Truths from the Word, and thus that there is a remnant with whom there is true religion in every 
state of mankind. For Balak standing by his burnt offering with all the princes of Moab, evidently 
denotes the confirmed state of corrupted good, and thus the most degraded state of a corrupted church. 
But we now have to consider the contents of the second section.

And what is remarkable here is, that the understanding of the corrupted man is capable of perceiving 
not only the truths of the literal sense of the Word, but also its interior truths; for by taking up a parable 
is plainly meant that the literal sense of the Word is symbolic, and hence that every part of it contains a 
spiritual or internal sense. But as we have but recently commented on this capacity of the wicked to 
understand truths under certain circumstances, we proceed to notice what the interior truths are which 
are revealed in this place. And, first, there is the general truth that the Word is so composed as to 
abound in continual double expressions respectively, referring to the understanding and the will of 
man; and that this is particularly the case in these prophecies of Balaam.

Then comes the desire of the bad man to cause aversion from the Lord in the good man, and to do this 
both externally and internally, because Jacob denotes the man of the church as to the natural, and Israel 
the same as to the spiritual degree, as the references show; and when we think of this, we become 
sensible of the absolute necessity that, in regeneration, the good and the evil must be entirely separated;
for were this not the case both generally and as to every particular in individuals, heaven could not be 
an eternal abode for the good, nor could the hells be kept in subjection, and brought into that exact 
arrangement according to the laws of order there, which renders the eternal condition of the wicked 
tolerable upon their own plane of life through the continued operation of the Divine Mercy. And then 
we see in what immediately follows, that the wicked in their final state have yet no power whatever to 
do injury to the good, because those who love truth in sincerity cannot be averted from Divine Truth, 
nor can those who love good sincerely be averted from Divine Good, on account of the entire 
opposition between truth and falsity and between good and evil. Hence, therefore, let the man of the 
church, as he proceeds on his way heavenward, be more than ever determined to be separated from 

326

everything false and evil, and hence, too, we see why, just as man is nearing his eternal home, every 
form of adulterated good, and of falsified truth, is to be rejected. For in the words of this prophecy is 
described the complete self-condemnation of the evil, and consequently also the complete justification 
of the good.

But now follows a description of the positive state of the good; and it is worth a careful study. For by 
Israel being seen from the top of the rocks and from the hills is denoted that the capacity of the man of 
the true church to perceive truths, is from his state as to good; by the people dwelling alone, is signified
that, in the perfect state of man truth is fully conjoined with good; and by their not being reckoned 
among the nations, is represented the entire deliverance of those who are in the love of truths, from all 
the evils of the selfish life. These surely are three things greatly to be desired, and earnestly to be 
striven after; but the fourth, as described in ver. 10, shows that, in consequence of these, the man of the 
true church now enjoys an unlimited supply of truths and good affections, so unlimited indeed, that 
only the Lord Himself knows the quality of his ever increasing angelic perfection. And further, all this 
is just because he has been willing, from the Lord, to endure the death of the righteous, by giving up 
the life of sin and selfishness, and thus establishing himself in a permanent final state of heavenly good 
and felicity.

Passing over now the next two verses, which are sufficiently explained in giving the references, we 
have to consider the third section. And first of all the change of state here described under the figure of 
going to another place, requires to be reflected upon. We know very well that as far as the natural world
is concerned, we may travel from one place to another, and thus that our outward circumstances may 
change, and yet that internally we may remain in the same state. But it is not so in the spiritual world, 
because the appearances of space which are there, vary according to the state of the mind. And this is 
the reason why, in the spiritual sense of the Word, all the changes of place named in the literal sense, 
denote changes of state; and it is very remarkable also, that the meaning of the very names of the places
mentioned, in every case corresponds to the spiritual state described. It is so, therefore, in the narrative 
before us, and consequently the correspondences show the quality of the new state here represented. 
And thus, as we have seen, the field of Zophim, and the top of Pisgah, denotes a state of watchfulness 
derived from a state of confirmed selfish love; and as, on the former occasion, the false prophet was 
only brought to the high places of Baal, which denote the falsities from selfish love, we see that the 
second state is a more internal state of confirmed evil than the first, and that the top of Pisgah signifies 
such a state. But, nevertheless, it is to be here also observed, that the second state of the perception 
concerning the good, granted to the prophet, was also an interior perception, as plainly appears from 
the particulars that follow, which we have now to consider. But before doing so, it ought to be 
explained that so far as the real state of the corrupted man himself is concerned, there was less 
perception of the truth than in the former case, which indeed is also signified by Balaam not seeing all 
the people but only the utmost part of them, as described in ver. 13. For it is a fact that the wicked, in 
proportion as they become more determined in their wickedness, are separated from the truth and reject
it (Matt 25:29).

And now, therefore, the prophet again takes up his parable, as it is said, that is, utters Divine Truths in 
the correspondential language of the Word, causing the corrupted man, in spite of himself, to recognize,
first, the unchangeableness of the Lord, and then the real character of the regenerated man on account 
of his conjunction with the Lord. And hence it is declared concerning him that he is free from all falsity
and evil, and on the contrary, is made perfect both internally and externally in all that is good and true; 
that the natural man no longer has any power over him, and yet that it is all powerful by virtue of good;
that, to him, no longer can falsity appear as truth, nor evil as good, because he is protected by the Lord; 

327

and, finally, that such is the power of natural good and truth with him, from the Lord, that he will not 
rest satisfied until all the evil and falsity of adulterated good are entirely overcome in the state of 
transition in which he is. And thus we see, from the remaining part of the section, namely, from the 
internal sense of vers. 25-26, that the corrupted man has accomplished the second stage in his 
separation, as to the will and understanding, from spiritual truth and good, while yet he is compelled by
the necessities of his case to outwardly acknowledge the truth and obey it. Let us now, therefore, 
observe in the next section the preparation that is made for his final separation in order that the spiritual
man may be completely delivered from his influence. For it is impossible that the latter, when fully 
regenerated, can remain in the intermediate state.

And, of course, there is another change of state which is denoted by Balak saying to Balaam, "Come, 
and I will take you to another place." And here it is to be observed that all through the description 
internally, it is the will of the wicked man that decides as to his eternal condition; for Balak represents 
the will, and it is this that draws the understanding with it, just exactly as Balak in every case 
conducted Balaam to different localities, the truth being that every man, good and bad alike, finally 
becomes such as he is as to the will, and not such as he is as to the understanding without the will (HH 
474, 508 end). We have now to see, therefore, the quality of the will which is here represented by 
Balak, and which is described in ver. 28 as a place called "the top of Peor that looks down upon the 
desert, or upon Jeshimon." And turning to the explanation, we find that this is the interior state of the 
corrupted will, which discerns that it is about to be quite desolated as to all good and truth, because by 
Peor is meant a hole or opening, and Baal-peor was an idol of Moab; and hence that by the top or head 
of mount Peor is denoted the interior will of those who are in adulterated good; that by looking down is
denoted discernment; in this case as to evil and falsity; and that by the desert, or Jeshimon, is denoted a 
state of desolation, because that is the meaning of the word Jeshimon. May we not, therefore, at this 
point, desire most earnestly and pray to the Lord that we may never be brought into such a state as this, 
in which we shall be determined to reject all good and truth, while yet as the remainder of the section 
shows we are intent upon pretending, hypocritically, to worship the Lord in order that, like Balaam, we 
may perhaps gain a merely selfish advantage? But we shall see, however, in the next chapter, the result 
of this hypocritical worship.

Numbers Chapter 24

SUMMARY OF THE SPIRITUAL SENSE

1. And now the corrupted man, therefore, ceases to pervert the truth, and begins to contemplate 
the rejection of all truth; but he is able also to behold the state of the spiritual man as in 
heavenly order, and can discern truths in a state of apparent humility, vers. 1-4. 

2. The happy state of the truly spiritual man is described, as to good and truth, as to deliverance 

from evil, and as to his power, from the Lord, against evil, vers. 5-9. 

3. But the corrupted man conjoins in himself evil and falsity; he more clearly feels and perceives 

the opposition between himself and the spiritual man; and he recognizes that the truth cannot 
be changed to promote evil and error, and that he must be entirely separated from it, vers. 10-
14. 

4. A prophetic description of the coming of the Lord; of the process of Judgement, by which the 
external man in the case of the good, is made one with the internal; and of the same process in 
the case of the wicked, by which they are totally vastated as to all good and truth, vers. 15-25. 

THE CONTENTS OF EACH VERSE

1. And when Balaam saw that it 

pleased the LORD to bless Israel, he 
went not, as at the other times, to 
meet with enchantments, but he set 
his face toward the wilderness. 

1. But now the corrupted understanding, perceiving 
that, from Divine Good, the spiritual man has 
conjunction with the Lord, ceases to pervert the 
truth by making it appear as falsity, and is led 
interiorly to contemplate the rejection of all truth. 

2. And Balaam lifted up his eyes, and 
he saw Israel dwelling according to 
their tribes; and the spirit of God 
came upon him. 

3. And he took up his parable, and said,

Balaam the son of Beor says, 
And the man whose eye was closed 
says: 

4. He says, which hears the words of 

God, 
Which sees the vision of the 
Almighty,
Falling down, and having his eyes 
open: 

2. But also, the understanding being elevated, he is 
enabled to contemplate the state of the spiritual 
man as in heavenly order according to general 
truths, and, for the time being, is influenced by 
Divine Truth. 

3. And thus perceives from the genuine literal sense 
of the Word, in which is revealed the internal 
sense, that the corrupted understanding derived 
from the corrupted will, from itself, is unable to 
see truths. 

4. But that still, when influenced externally both as to
affection and thought, he can discern truths in a 
state of apparent humility, and of spiritual 
enlightenment.

5. And that the truly spiritual man is a form of 

Your tabernacles, O Israel! 

loveliness both as to external and internal life. 

6. As valleys are they spread forth, 
As gardens by the river side, 
As lign-aloes which the LORD has 
planted, 
As cedar trees beside the waters. 

7. Water shall now from his buckets, 
And his seed shall be in many 
waters, 
And his king shall be higher than 
Agag, 
And his kingdom shall be exalted. 

8. God brings him forth out of Egypt;

He has as it were the strength of the 
wild-ox:
He shall eat up the nations his 
adversaries,
And shall break their bones in 
pieces,
And smite them through with his 
arrows. 

6. For in lowest states of good he is abundant in 

truths; and in lowest states of truth is nourished 
from the Word; his realizations of interior truths 
from victory in temptation, are from the Lord 
alone; and his perceptions of internal truth are 
from the Word; 

7. Truths in abundance are with him in their 

receptacles, and the increase of good and truth 
with him is according to his reception of truths in 
all their variety; his central governing principle of 
Divine Truth is superior to all falsities from 
interior evil, and his state of good is superior to all 
selfish delights. 

8. He is delivered from the bondage of the natural 
man by the power of the truth; he is gifted with 
full power against evil, as if from himself, even in 
the natural degree; he has power to overcome all 
evils that oppose him; and he can disperse all 
falsities by means of the truths of the Word. 

9. He couched, he lay down as a lion, 

9. He is at rest from the conflicts of temptation as to 

And as a lioness; who shall rouse 
him up? 
Blessed be every one that blesses 
you, 
And cursed be every one that curses 
you. 

truth and as to good, when fully regenerated; he 
has conjunction with the Lord as to all his 
faculties; and he is averted from all evils. 

10. And Balak's anger was kindled 

10. And now therefore the corrupted man is altogether

against Balaam, and he smote his 
hands together: and Balak said to 
Balaam, I called you to curse mine 
enemies, and, behold, you have 
altogether blessed them these three 
times. 

averted from Divine Truth, and there is with him 
the conjunction of evil and falsity; and it is 
perceived that, although the corrupt will desires 
the destruction of good and truth, yet they are 
secure against his attacks even in the greatest 
degree. 

330

11. Therefore now flee you to your 

place: I thought to promote you to 
great honour; but, lo, the LORD has 
kept you back from honour. 

12. And Balaam said to Balak, Spake I 
not also to your messengers which 
you sentest to me, saying, 

11. Consequently he desires entire separation from the
truth; he had been persuaded that, by means of 
truths he should be able to promote all selfish 
purposes, but he is now forced to the conviction 
that Divine Love is totally opposed to selfishness 
and its rewards. 

12. And yet the corrupted man is made aware that 
truth from the Lord had always been clearly 
revealed to him, and that he had received the 
perception, 

13. If Balak would give me his house 
full of silver and gold, I cannot go 
beyond the word of the LORD, to do 
either good or bad of mine own 
mind; what the LORD speaks, that 
will I speak? 

13. That although he should be enriched with an 

abundance of knowledge and delight in the 
understanding, yet that could not change the truth, 
nor could it promote both good and evil; for the 
truth is not from man, but from the Lord who is 
unchangeable. 

14. And now, behold, I go to my people: 
come, and I will advertise you what 
this people shall do to your people in
the latter days. 

14. And further that now, therefore, the truth must be 
taken away from the wicked, and be given to the 
good; and that it reveals the state of the good and 
the evil alike in the Judgement. 

15. And he took up his parable, and said,

Balaam the son of Beor says, 
And the man whose eye was closed 
says: 

15. And thus that from the Divine Word, in which is 
the spiritual sense, it may be known, that even 
those who are in falsity from evil and are blind as 
to all genuine truths. 

16. Me says, which hears the words of 

God,
And knows the knowledge of the 
Most High,
Which sees the vision of the 
Almighty,
Falling down, and having his eyes 
open: 

17. I see him, but not now: 

I behold him, but not near: 
There shall come forth a star out of 
Jacob, 
And a sceptre shall rise out of Israel, 
And shall smite through the corners 
of Moab,
And break down all the sons of 
tumult. 

16. May yet be compelled to outward obedience, and 
also to the realization of truth in its outward form 
as a manifestation of Divine Good, as an 
exhibition of the Divine Omnipotence, as 
producing the semblance of humility, and as giving
revelation. 

17. For he perceives that the Lord reveals Himself in 
the Word and yet that the wicked reject Him; he 
knows that He is manifested as Divine Truth, and 
yet that the wicked do not love this Truth; for he 
knows that the Lord has revealed Himself even to 
the natural man in the natural world, and to the 
spiritual man in the spiritual world, fully 
overcoming the powers of evil, and delivering man
from the dominion of falsity; 

331

18. And Edom shall be a possession, 
Seir also shall be a possession, 
which were his enemies; 
While Israel does valiantly. 

18. And therefore also that His Human has been made 
Divine both as to good and as to truth, although, 
through hereditary evil from the mother, it had 
been subject to temptation; and that thus the 
Spiritual Church has been formed, and the spiritual

19. And out of Jacob shall one have

finally conjoined to Divine Good. And corrupted 
good, therefore, is entirely separated from all truth 
and is conjoined with falsity. 

REFERENCES AND NOTES

1. Balaam seeing that it pleased the Lord to bless Israel, denotes that the corrupted understanding
perceives from Divine Good, that the spiritual man has conjunction with the Lord, chap 22:5, 
2150, 2001, 5304, 3514, 3654; his not going, as at other times, to meet with enchantments, 

332

denotes that he ceases to pervert the truth by making it appear as falsity, 3335, 3698, 7297; and
his setting his face toward the wilderness, denotes that he is led, interiorly, to contemplate the 
rejection of all truth, 358, 2708. 

2. Balaam lifting up his eyes denotes that the understanding of the depraved and corrupted man 

is elevated, 2148; seeing Israel dwelling according to their tribes, denotes the contemplation of
the state of the spiritual man as in heavenly order according to general truths, 2150, 3654, 
1293, 3858; and the spirit of God coming upon him, denotes that, for the time being, he is 
influenced by Divine Truth, 9818, 2001. 

3. Balaam taking up his parable and saying, denotes that thus he perceives from the literal sense 
of the Word in which is revealed the internal sense, 4637, 1822; and "Balaam the son of Beor 
says, and the man whose eye was closed (or is opened), says," denotes that the corrupted 
understanding derived from the corrupted will, from itself, is unable to see truths, because 
Balaam means old age, or ancient of the people, or the destruction of the people, and therefore
denotes falsity confirmed, and thus the corrupted understanding, 2348, 1259, and Beor means 
burning, foolish, mad, and therefore denotes evil, and thus the corrupted will, 9055, 42173, 
51456; because the Hebrew word, which is rendered "is opened" in the A.V., is translated "was
closed" in the R.V. with "is opened" in the margin, while the lexicons give the meaning as "to 
close"; and because the eyes denote the understanding, and to have the eyes closed evidently 
denotes not to see or understand truths, 2701.

"He says which hears the words of God," denotes that still he can discern truth externally from
some affection, 4404, 2001, 1288; "which sees the vision of the Almighty," denotes when 
influenced externally as to thought, 2701; and "falling down and having his eyes open," 
denotes, when in a state of apparent humility and of spiritual enlightenment, 1999, 6567, 2148.

"How goodly are your tents, O Jacob, your tabernacles, O Israel!" denotes that the truly 
spiritual man is a form of loveliness, both as to external and internal life, 553, 3080, 414, 
5973. 

"As valleys are they spread forth," denotes that in lowest states of good, he is abundant in 
truths, 1723, 3708, 4398; "as gardens by the river side," denotes that in lowest states of truth 
he is nourished from the Word, 99, 100, 2702; "as lign-aloes which the Lord has planted," 
denotes that his realizations of interior truths, from victory in temptation, are from the Lord 
alone, 10252, 10258, 2001, 8326; and "as cedar trees beside the waters," denotes that his 
perceptions of internal truths are by means of the Word, 7918, 2702. 

It is to be observed in connection with this verse, that the word translated "spread forth," is 
rendered "planted" in 108, 370318, 38586, and elsewhere, thus involving the idea of the 
process of regeneration, as well as of abundance; also that the planting of the lign-aloes carries
with it the idea of abundance as well as that of planting; and, thirdly, that in 108, the word 
which is here rendered "lign-aloes," is translated "tents," while yet in 27024, 38586, and 63353,
we have "lign-aloes," the author's Latin term in 108 being "tentoria," and in the other places 
"santalos." Hence, then, we have an apparent inconsistency, for which it is necessary to 
account; for why should "tentoria," or "tents" be found in the first instance, and "santalos" or 
"lign-aloes" in all the others? The explanation appears to be, that the Hebrew words for tents 
and lign-aloes differ only in the vowel points attached to the first letter, and thus that, 

333

inadvertently, the term meaning lign-aloes was rendered by "tentoria" in AC 108, but, 
correctly, by "santalos in all the other cases. In future editions of AC therefore, would it not be 
advisable and justifiable to print "lign-aloes" in 108, with a short explanatory footnote giving 
the reason why? And it may be useful, before we proceed, to point out, in this place, that "lign-
aloes," or "wood of aloes," otherwise called Agile Wood, Eagle Wood, or Agallochum, is the 
inner part of the trunk of Aquilaria ovata and Aquilaria agallochum, trees of the natural order 
Aquilariacae, and has no connection with aloes as commonly understood.

"Water shall flow from his buckets, and his seed shall be in many waters," denotes that truths 
in abundance are with the spiritual man in their receptacles; and that the increase of good and 
truth with him is according to his reception of truths in all their varieties, 2702, 3079, 3728, 
726, 6172; "and his king shall be higher than Agag, and his kingdom shall be exalted," denotes
that his central governing principle of Divine Truth is superior to all falsities derived from evil,
and that his state of good is superior to all selfish delights, 1672, 8593, 795. 

"God brings him forth out of Egypt," denotes that he is delivered from the bondage of the 
natural man by the power of the truth, 2001, 8866, 503, 5079; "he has, as it were, the strength 
of the wild-ox," denotes that he is gifted with full power against evil, as if from himself, even 
in the natural degree, 6343, 2180, 5973; "he shall eat up the nations his adversaries," denotes 
that he has power to overcome all evils that oppose him, 5149, 1868, 9314; and "he shall break
their bones in pieces, and smite them through with his arrows," denotes that he can disperse all
falsities by means of the truths of the Word, both externally and internally, 9163, 157, 3812, 
8800, 2686, 38129, 440211. 

In the last two references the words here rendered "smite them through with his arrows," are 
translated "smash" or "bruise their weapons." The signification, however, is substantially the 
same, namely, the dispersion of falsities internally.

"He couched, he lay down as a lion, and as a lioness; who shall rouse him up?" denotes that he
is at rest from the conflicts of temptation as to truth and as to good, when fully regenerated, 
even in the natural degree, 63676, 725; and "Blessed be every one that blesses you, and cursed 
be every one that curses you," denotes that he has conjunction with the Lord as to all his 
faculties; and that he is averted from all evils; or in other words, all good men have 
conjunction with the Lord, and all wicked men are averted from the Lord, 3514, 245.

9.

10. Balak's anger being kindled against Balaam, and his smiting his hands together, denotes that 
now, therefore, the corrupted man is altogether averted from Divine Truth, and there is with 
him the conjunction of evil and falsity, chap 22:2, 5, 5798, 10082, 10061, 8783; and Balak 
saying to Balaam "I called you to curse mine enemies, and behold you have altogether blessed 
them these three times," denotes the perception that although the corrupt will desires the 
destruction of good and truth, yet they are secure against his attacks, even in the greatest 
degree, 1822, 6047, 245, 3514, 4495. 

11. "Therefore now flee you to your place," denotes that consequently he desires entire separation 

from the truth, 34382, 2625; "I thought to promote you to great honour," denotes that he had 
been persuaded that, by means of truths he should be able to promote all selfish purposes, 
because Balaam represented the truth ostensibly; and to promote to honour, said by Balak, 
denotes to promote selfish purposes, 8897, 81483; and "lo, the Lord has kept you back from 

334

honour," denotes that he is now forced to the conviction that Divine Love is totally opposed to 
selfishness and its rewards, 8897. 

12. Balaam saying to Balak, "Spake I not to your messengers which you sentest to me, saying," 
denotes that yet the corrupted man is made aware that truth from the Lord, had always been 
clearly revealed to him, 1822, 2951, 4239. 

13. "If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot go beyond the word of the 
Lord to do either good or bad of mine own mind. What the Lord speaks that will I speak," 
denotes that although he should be enriched with abundance of knowledge and delight in the 
understanding, yet that could not change the truth, nor could it promote both good and evil; for
the truth is not from man, but from the Lord Who is unchangeable, chap 22:18. 

14. "And now behold I go to my people," denotes that now, therefore, the truth must be taken from
the wicked and given to the good, Balaam here representing the truth which he had uttered 
from the Lord, and his people those in truth from good, 3335, 1295; also from another point of
view, Balaam representing the corrupted man as to the understanding, these words signify that 
the wicked deliberately choose falsities, 1259; and "Come, and I will advertise you what this 
people shall do to your people in the latter days," denotes that the truth reveals the state of the 
good and the evil alike in the Judgement, because Balaam is again about to represent the truth,
and to utter it from the Lord; "this people," clearly denotes the Israelites, who signify the good,
5973; Balak's people denote those confirmed in adulterated good, and thus in evil, chap 22:2, 
2468; and the "latter days" denotes the consummation of the age, and therefore the Judgement,
3353. 

15. Balaam taking up his parable and saying, denotes that from the Divine Word, in which is the 
spiritual sense, it may be known, 4637, 1822; and "Balaam the son of Beor says, and the man 
whose eye was closed says," denotes that even those who are in falsity from evil, and are blind
to all genuine truths, may have external perception, ver. 3. 

16. "He says which hears the words of God," denotes that still he may be compelled to outward 

obedience, 4404, 2001, 1288; "and knows the knowledge of the Most High," denotes and also 
to the realization of truth in its outward form as a manifestation of Divine Good, 2230, 920; 
"which sees the vision of the Almighty," denotes an exhibition of the Divine Omnipotence, 
2701, 020; and "falling down and having his eyes open," denotes as producing the semblance 
of humility, and as giving revelation, 1999, 6567, 2148. 

17. "I sec him, but not now: I behold him, but not near," denotes that he perceives that the Lord 

reveals Himself in the Word and yet that the wicked reject Him; he knows that He is 
manifested in Divine Truth and yet that the wicked do not love this truth, 2150, 6843, 683; 
"there shall come forth a star out of Jacob; and a sceptre shall rise out of Israel," denotes that 
he knows that the Lord has revealed Himself even to the natural man in the natural world, and 
to the spiritual man in the spiritual world, 92933, 487610, 5973; "and shall smite through the 
corners of Moab, and break down all the sons of tumult, or of Sheth," denotes that He fully 
overcomes the power of evil, and delivers man from the dominion of falsity, 9494, 2468, 
10643, 7975. The last reference describes the quality of those in adulterated good; who are 
called the sons of Sheth, or of tumult.

335

18. "And Edom shall be a possession, Seir also shall be a possession, which were his enemies; 
while Israel does valiantly," denotes that therefore also His Human has been made Divine, 
both as to good and truth, although through hereditary evil from the mother, it had been 
subject to temptation; and that thus the Spiritual Church has been formed, and the spiritual 
man, as from himself has power against evil, 1675, 3322, 1817. 8323, 10481, 5973. 

19. "And out of Jacob shall one have dominion, and shall destroy the remnant from the city," 

denotes that by the Human the Lord exercises His Omnipotence, and expels from the church 
the prevailing power of evil, 3654, 5973, 8967, 10814, 2401-2, 468, 402. 

20. Balaam looking upon Amalek, and taking up his parable and saying, "Amalek was the first of 
the nations; but his latter end shall come to destruction," denotes that Divine Truth teaches that
the most insidious falsity from evil, although predominant with the unregenerate, is to be 
utterly destroyed, with the regenerate, 4637, 1822, ver. 15, 8593, 3382, 1259. 

21. Balaam looking on the Kenite, and taking up his parable and saying, "Strong is your dwelling 
place, and your nest is set in the rock," denotes that the most extreme falsity of faith alone, 
although appealing strongly to the merely natural man, and being established apparently upon 
the Word, 4637, 1822, 1867, 1293, 776, 85817. That the Kenite denotes faith, appears from the
signification of the rock; and that, in this case, it is faith alone appears from the prophetic 
words of Balaam in the series of the internal sense.

22. "Nevertheless Kain, or the Kenite, shall be wasted, until Asshur shall carry you away captive,"
denotes that those in faith alone shall be utterly devastated by the power of even the corrupted 
Rational, 7039, 119, 9164. 

23. Balaam taking up his parable and saying, "Alas, who shall live, when God does this?" denotes 
that Divine Truth teaches that the truth shall be triumphant also, even in the natural degree, 
4637, 1822, 34, 2001, 2618. It is said "even in the natural degree," because verses 21 and 22 
describe the state of those in faith alone as to the voluntary and rational powers, and therefore 
this describes their state in the lower degree.

24. "But ships shall come from the coast of Kittim, and they shall afflict Asshur, and shall afflict 
Eber; and he also shall come to destruction," denotes that the knowledges of Divine Truth, in 
the hands of the good, shall overcome the merely natural Rational, as well as all external 
worship separated from internal; for this also shall be destroyed, 6385, 8063, 1156, 5973, 119, 
1241, 10510. 

25. Balaam rising up and going, and returning to his place; and Balak also going his way, denotes 
that Divine Truth itself is elevated above all natural delights, is separated from them, and is 
finally conjoined to Divine Good. And corrupted good, therefore, is entirely separated from all
truth and is conjoined with falsity, ver. 2, 2401, 3335, 2288, 2625, chap 22:2, 10422. 

DISCUSSION

Let us now review the contents of this chapter, and notice particularly one or two very interesting 
points in the first section. The time must come, in the life of every bad man, on account of his departure
from good, and therefore, in reality from truth also, when ho will no longer be able to make truth 
appear as falsity, or falsity as truth; and this is what is represented in the historical fact, that Balaam, on

336

the occasion of this third sacrifice, did not go as before to seek for enchantments. For we read: "If there
arise in the midst of you a prophet or a dreamer of a dream, and he give you a sign or a wonder, and the
sign and the wonder come to pass, which he spoke to you saying, Let us go after other gods which you 
have not known, and let us serve them; you shall not obey the words of that prophet, or the dreamer of 
that dream, because Jehovah tempts you" (Deut 13:1-4). And concerning this it is said that "the 
prediction itself was from the Divine, but the persuasion to worship other gods was from the proprium 
of the prophet, to whom it was permitted for the sake of tempting, as it is said. Hence also it is, and 
from other causes, that on many occasions in olden time, they who worshiped Baalim and other gods, 
also prophesied, saw visions, and dreamed dreams, and likewise that the things spoken by them came 
to pass, whereby many were led astray (concerning which see Jeremiah, chap. xxiii.); besides others 
who were called diviners, soothsayers, sorcerers, and pythons, who were among those who studied 
natural magic, whereby nothing of what was Divine could be foretold, but only what was contrary to 
the Divine, that is, contrary to the Lord, and contrary to the good of love, and the truth of faith in Him. 
This is magic, whatever it may appear in external form," 3698. See also 7297; and remember that from 
these passages we may learn that we ought not to depend on outward signs and miracles alone as 
testifications of the truth, but upon true doctrine drawn from the Word of the Lord, and especially on 
the effect of true doctrine in leading to the renunciation of all selfishness and to all the blessings 
springing from a holy and pious life of charity and faith.

But we must here notice also another thing. Sometimes it happens that a knowledge of the internal 
sense of the Word is of great assistance in deciding as to the correct meaning of an expression in the 
original languages in which the Word was written. And a case of this kind occurs here, which is worthy 
of our attention. For we find that, in the third verse of our chapter a certain word is translated "closed" 
with a note in the margin to the effect that it may also mean "opened." But the fact that the R.V. 
evidently prefers "closed," no doubt because it is more correct according to the lexicons, leads us to 
consider which interpretation really agrees best with the series of the spiritual sense. And we have 
preferred that of the R.V. giving the spiritual meaning accordingly, because it involves an important 
truth concerning the corrupted man, and, indeed, concerning every one, namely, that from himself he is 
not able to see truths; while the next verse shows that, nevertheless, even a wicked man may do this by 
the Lord's permission, when it may serve an important and useful purpose, even although it is of no real
benefit to himself. On the other hand, however, we find that, in AE 140, the term "opened" is preferred 
to "closed," and is said to signify illumination as to the understanding; and, of course, this will mean 
spiritually, as to the understanding only, since it describes the state of the corrupted man. And in 
concluding this section we must not forget that now also the man confirmed in evil, has his mind really 
directed towards the falsities of evil, or in other words, to that state of desolation as to good and truth 
which is denoted by Jeshimon.

In the second section we have to contemplate, as even the false prophet does, spiritually, the state of the
good man, who has conjunction with the Lord which is signified by being blessed; and since this 
conjunction can only be by love to Him and charity to the neighbour, therefore it is so emphatically 
said at the end of it, "Blessed is every one that blesses you, and cursed is every one that curses you." 
That is, all good men have conjunction with the Lord, because they reciprocate His love; and all 
wicked men are in aversion from the Lord, because they do not reciprocate His love, the Lord's love 
remaining steadfast to every one even to eternity. But it is to be observed in studying this description, 
that all interior delights and perceptions are symbolized by outward delights and perceptions, since, in 
heaven, there is the full enjoyment of all external things, because they correspond so exactly to what is 
internal. For the tents of Jacob, aptly represent the outward life of the good, while the tabernacles of 

337

Israel denote their interior life and their worship. Now it is frequently said that heaven is an eternal 
Sabbath, that is, an eternal state of the worship of the Lord. But they greatly err, who imagine that this 
worship consists of external adoration and praise continually. On the contrary, it is the eternal 
expression of man's inmost loves and delights, which are from the Lord, in his external words and 
actions; and this is really why tents and tabernacles are both mentioned, and also why the nation is first 
called Jacob and then Israel. And it is because the prophet was inspired to see, as it were, the beauty 
and the glory of the angelic life both at once, the outward form so perfectly corresponding to the 
inward state. And how finely, indeed, does the sixth verse describe this manifestation of interior 
blessedness in exterior happiness! And if we compare the two couplets of that verse, we may see 
clearly how the first describes natural pleasures, and the second spiritual delights. And then we may 
notice how the next verse sets before us the great abundance of even the lowest receptacles of good and
of truth; while by his king being higher than Agag, and by his kingdom being exalted is very plainly 
denoted that "his central governing principle of Divine Truth is superior to all falsities from interior evil
and his state of good superior to all selfish delights." But here we remark in passing that Agag is 
supposed to have been a general name for the Amalekite kings, just as Pharaoh was for the kings of 
Egypt; also that the word means "roof" or "floor," and thus denotes, correspondentially, what is highest 
and lowest, and thus a state of aspiring selfish love, which desires dominion over all things, besides 
which we know too, that the Amalekites signify interior falsities and evils, which beset the man of the 
church, during regeneration, so that it is said concerning them that "the Lord will have war with 
Amalek from generation to generation" (Exod 17:16). We finish this section, however, by observing 
that again is the power of the true spiritual man over all evil greatly magnified, showing, by a most 
expressive symbolism, that there is no spiritual enemy, which by the power of the Lord he is not able to
fully conquer.

And now combining the last two sections, some remarks may be made on the general prophecy of 
Balaam with which the account ends. But look, first, at ver. 10, and observe how thoroughly the 
corrupted man is given up to all evil; for it is said that now Balak's anger was kindled against Balaam, 
and that he smote his hands together in order to denote this complete aversion which culminates in the 
full conjunction of falsity with evil. For the two hands signify the will and the understanding, and 
smiting them together is a most forcible symbol of the conjunction of these in an aggravated state of 
evil. And, then, again, the three times in which the Israelites had been altogether blessed, is another 
very strong way of emphasizing the completeness of the salvation of the man of the true church, since, 
everywhere in the Word the number three denotes what is complete and full, many examples of which 
will readily occur to those familiar with its histories in the Old Testament and in the New. And yet, 
upon the surface, it here appears as if Balaam, who denotes the understanding, was separated from 
Balak who denotes the will; but this is because the false prophet is now compelled, under an inspiration
that he cannot control, to put on the representation of the true prophet. Let us then reverently consider 
his prophecy, which indeed in its internal sense it deeply concerns us all to understand.

For, first, the church in general has long known that, by the star coming forth out of Jacob, and the 
sceptre rising out of Israel, is signified the coming of the Lord into the world for the redemption and 
salvation of mankind. But while this is true, yet the real nature and character of that redemption and 
salvation, have been, through the corruptions of the ages, and the prevailing selfishness of men, but 
very imperfectly comprehended. But the opening of the Word as to its internal sense, has revealed the 
truth, as it shines forth from many parts of scripture; and in the prophecy now before us we have a 
striking example. For in reality, redemption consisted in the deliverance of all mankind from the 
powers of hell, by whom human liberty of choice between good and evil was on the point of being 

338

taken away; and this deliverance the Lord accomplished in His Human Nature while He was in the 
world, by suffering Himself to be tempted, and by conquering in every temptation, thus reducing the 
hells into subjection, and the heavens into order, and so preserving man's freedom for ever, at the same 
time glorifying His Human, and thus providing a new and living and eternal way of access to' Himself, 
which can never more be violated; and, therefore, now, through this great work, every one who chooses
may actually be delivered from evil, and become actually receptive of good from the Lord. And thus 
now we see in what way it is that every man can be saved who earnestly desires it, by faith in the Lord 
God the Redeemer and Saviour, by love to Him, and by obedience to His commandments, since He 
constantly gives to every individual the power to shun his evils, and also the power to do good 
altogether, as from himself, and this because in His Divine Human He has all power in heaven and 
upon earth, and can save to the uttermost every one who approaches Him and worships Him as the 
manifested God in whose single Person is embodied the Divine Trinity of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. 
This great victory, therefore, of the Lord in His Human Nature, is what is represented by the victories 
of Israel under the leading of the Star and Sceptre, the former denoting the power of Divine Truth, and 
the latter the power of Divine Good, in overcoming the dominion of evil for man and in man even for 
ever; and the nations themselves, as the references show, denoting the evils belonging to man, which by
the Divine Power and Love, each person who freely chooses, is able to overcome, even as the Lord 
Himself overcame. How very much, therefore, is involved in the grand prophecy of Balaam, which 
indeed does not appear upon the surface, but which is able in very truth to make those who heed it wise
to salvation!

Numbers Chapter 25

SUMMARY OF THE SPIRITUAL SENSE

1. The man of the Spiritual Church, before being made perfect, claims merit to himself for his 
good deeds, and consequently worship is profaned by falsity; and revelation takes place that 
such worship and its falsifications must be destroyed, vers. 1-5. 

2. For by such worship the church is not only in secret, but openly corrupted, except that those 
who are in good, and in a state of temptation, zealously destroy it in themselves, and thus 
completely, vers. 6-9. 

3. Concerning the happy state, even to eternity, of those who are in celestial-natural good and 

thus overcome, vers. 10-13. 

4. The quality of the wicked who thus profane good and truth is described, and involves 

separation from the church, a state of confirmation in evil and falsity externally, and of the 
violation of the heavenly marriage internally, vers. 14-15. 

5. Wherefore the man of the church is instructed that he must persistently oppose the deceitful 

insinuations of all falsity from evil, vers. 16-18. 

THE CONTENTS OF EACH VERSE

1. And Israel abode in Shittim, and the 
people began to commit whoredom 
with the daughters of Moab: 

2. For they called the people to the 

sacrifice of their gods; and the 
people did eat, and bowed down to 
their gods. 

1. But the man of the Spiritual Church, before being 
made perfect, claims merit to himself for his good 
deeds, and consequently is influenced by the 
falsity derived from the evil of adulterated good, 
and falsifies the truth. 

2. And consequently also Divine worship is profaned
by falsities; evil is appropriated; and there is a 
decline to a state of falsity from corrupted good. 

3. And Israel joined himself to Baal-

3. And thus the church is in selfish love the most 

peor: and the anger of the LORD was 
kindled against Israel. 

4. And the LORD said to Moses, Take 

all the chiefs of the people, and hang
them up to the LORD before the sun, 
that the fierce anger of the LORD may
turn away from Israel. 

external, and is averted from the Lord. 

4. Therefore there is perception from the Divine 
Good by the Divine Truth that the essential 
principles in such worship lead men to a state of 
confirmation in selfish love, unless there is 
repentance by which aversion may be removed 
and conjunction established. 

340

5. And Moses said to the judges of 

Israel, Slay you every one his men 
that have joined themselves to Baal-
peor. 

6. And, behold, one of the children of 
Israel came and brought to his 
brethren a Midianitish woman in the 
sight of Moses, and in the sight of all
the congregation of the children of 
Israel, while they were weeping at 
the door of the tent of meeting. 

5. And also perception is given from Divine Truth to 
the rational faculty, that the man of the church 
must at once reject such profane worship. 

6. For it certainly happens with such false 

worshipers, that infernal falsity conjoined with evil
will openly corrupt the church, especially as to the 
affections of good, and as regards Divine Truth 
internal and external, even when, in a state of 
temptation there is mourning on account of lost 
truth, and fluctuation between good and evil. 

7. And when Phinehas, the son of 

7. But when he, who is tempted, is principled in love 

Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, 
saw it, he rose up from the midst of 
the congregation, and took a spear in
his hand; 

8. And he went after the man of Israel 
into the pavilion, and thrust both of 
them through, the man of Israel, and 
the woman through her belly. So the 
plague was stayed from the children 
of Israel. 

9. And those that died by the plague 
were twenty and four thousand. 

to the Lord and love to the neighbour, even as to 
the natural man from the Lord through the celestial
and spiritual heavens, and perceives himself thus 
beset, he prepares to oppose evil and falsity by 
Divine Truth from the Word, 

8. Endeavouring, by a change of state, to search out 

and destroy them in himself, and this he 
accomplishes both as to thought and affection, in 
the course of the conflict; and thus the church is 
delivered from the consequences of profane 
worship, which would involve the complete 
destruction of remains. 

9. But, however, he who perseveres in his 

wickedness is completely devastated as to all good
and truth. 

10. And the LORD spoke to Moses, 

10. But with the good there is further perception from 

saying, 

the Lord by Divine Truth, 

11. Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son 
of Aaron the priest, has turned my 
wrath away from the children of 
Israel, in that he was jealous with my
jealousy among them, so that I 
consumed not the children of Israel 
in my jealousy. 

12. Wherefore say, Behold, I give to him

my covenant of peace: 

11. That celestial - natural good from the Lord through

the celestial and spiritual heavens removes 
aversion from the Lord and promotes conjunction 
with Him, because it is zealous for the 
preservation of the integrity of good and truth in 
worship, and by its life and actions promotes the 
removal of aversion from the Lord, so that man, in
this case, is not vastated. 

12. Wherefore it is perceived that conjunction with the
Lord and heavenly peace belong to celestial-
natural good, 

341

13. And it shall be to him, and to his 
seed after him, the covenant of an 
everlasting priesthood; because he 
was jealous for his God, and made 
atonement for the children of Israel. 

14. Now the name of the man of Israel 
that was slain, who was slain with 
the Midianitish woman, was Zimri, 
the son of Salu, a prince of a fathers' 
house among the Simeonites. 

13. And that to eternity it is true that love, charity, and 
obedience from love and charity always effect 
regeneration by conjunction with the Lord from 
Whom is all celestial love; for this love is 
eminently zealous for good and truth; and thence 
also is the removal of all evil, by which man is 
reconciled to God. 

14. But the quality of him who, being a man of the 
church, is vastated as to all good and truth, 
because he has corrupted and falsified them, is 
such, that he must be separated from the church, 
since he has confirmed himself in a state of 
opposition to it, although he has been in its 
primary truths, which teach that faith in the 
understanding must be followed by obedience in 
the life. 

15. And the name of the Midianitish 

15. And the quality of the falsity by which such are 

woman that was slain was Cozbi, the
daughter of Zur; he was head of the 
people of a fathers' house in Midian. 

deluded, is that it delights in lying, externally, and 
in the destruction of the heavenly marriage 
internally, its central principle being the very 
essential of all falsity. 

16. And the LORD spoke to Moses, 

saying, 

16. And therefore there is further revelation from the 
Lord by Divine Truth giving the perception, 

17. Vex the Midianites, and smite them: 

17. That all such falsity should be utterly destroyed 

both as to will and thought, 

18. For they vex you with their wiles, 

with which they have beguiled you 
in the matter of Peor, and in the 
matter of Cozbi, the daughter of the 
prince of Midian, their sister, which 
was slain on the day of the plague in 
the matter of Peor. 

18. Because it is aggravating and deceitful, especially 
in making external worship alone or from selfish 
motives, appear to be lawful, and still more in 
promoting deceit, and in violating the heavenly 
marriage, through the abuse of intellectual truth by
falsifications, and by the destruction of remains, 
when corrupted worship is confirmed as true.

In the reference it is shown that Eleazar denotes the natural degree, which is according to the

death of Nadab and Abihu he took up their representation, and also after the death of Aaron, 
the representation of the celestial degree.

8. His going after the man of Israel into the pavilion, denotes an endeavour by a change of state 
to search out and destroy evil and falsity in himself, 3335, ver, 6, 32424; and his thrusting both

course of the conflict, 4727, 476; while by the plague being stayed from the children of Israel 
is denoted that the church is delivered from the consequences of profane worship which would
involve the destruction of remains, 10219, 3654.

11. "Phinehas the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest," denotes celestial-natural good from 

the Lord through the celestial and spiritual heavens, ver. 7; "has turned my wrath away from 
the children of Israel," denotes that this removes aversion from the Lord and promotes 
conjunction with Him, 5798, 2001, 10702; "in that he was jealous with my jealousy among 
them," denotes because it is zealous for the preservation of the integrity of good and truth in 
worship, 8875; and "so that I consumed not the children of Israel in my jealousy" denotes that,
by its life and actions, celestial-natural love promotes the removal of aversion from the Lord, 
so that man, in this case, is not vastated, 10431, 3654 8875.

12. "Wherefore say, Behold I give to him my covenant of peace," denotes that it is perceived that 
conjunction with the Lord and heavenly peace belong to celestial-natural good, 1822, 666, 
8899. 

13. "It shall be to him, and to his seed after him the covenant of an everlasting priesthood; because
he was jealous for his God, and made atonement for the children of Israel," denotes that, to 
eternity, it is true that love, charity, and obedience from love and charity, always effect 
regeneration by conjunction with the Lord from Whom is all celestial love; for this love is 
eminently zealous for good and truth, and thence also is the removal of all evil, by which man 
is reconciled to God, ver. 7, 726, 666, 9946, 8875, 2001, 10042, 3654. 

14. The name of the man of Israel that was slain, who was slain with the Midianitish woman, 

being Zimri the son of Salu, a prince of a fathers' house among the Simeonites, denotes that 
the quality of him who. being a man of the church, is vastated as to all good and truth, because
he has corrupted and falsified them, is such that he must be separated from the church, since 
he has confirmed himself in a state of opposition to it, although he has been in its primary 
truths, which teach that faith in the understanding must be followed by obedience in the life, 
145, 476, 3654, 4727, 1482, 7833, 3869. But Zimri means my field, my vine, my branch, and is
derived from a root which means cut off or pruned, and thus he denotes a corrupted man of the
Spiritual Church requiring to be separated on account of his corruption, because confirmed in 
evil, 1071, 5302, 3292; and his being the son of Salu and a Simeonite, denotes his origin and 
quality as one who has been disposed to obedience from faith, 5912, 3869. 

15. The name of the Midianitish woman that was slain being Cozbi the daughter of Zur, and his 

being head of the people of a fathers' house in Midian, denotes that the quality of the falsity by

heavenly marriage, internally, its central principle being the very essential of all falsity, 145, 
476, 3242, 4727, 3728, 7833. But Cozbi means a liar, and thus she denotes falsity, externally; 
Zur means adulterous, and therefore denotes what destroys the heavenly marriage, internally, 
and Zur being the head of a people of a fathers' house in Midian, denotes that its central 
principle, indeed, is the very essential of all falsity, 3728, 1259, 7833. 3242.

16. The Lord speaking to Moses saying, denotes that therefore there is further revelation from the 

Lord by Divine Truth giving the perception, 2001, 2951, 7010, 1822. 

17. "Vex the Midianites and smite them," denotes that all falsity should be utterly destroyed both 

as to will and thought, 9313, 4251, 3242. 

18. "For they vex you with their wiles with which they have beguiled you in the matter of Peor," 
denotes "because it is aggravating and deceitful, especially in making external worship alone,

or from selfish motives, appear to be lawful," vers. 2, 3; "and in the matter of Cozbi the 
daughter of a prince of Midian their sister, which was slain on the day of the plague in the 
matter of Peor," denotes "and still more in promoting deceit, and in violating the heavenly 
marriage, through the abuse of intellectual truth by falsifications, and by the destruction of 
remains, when corrupted worship is confirmed as true," vers. 6-9, and 14-15, 1475. 

DISCUSSION

From this interesting little chapter we learn, in the literal sense, that although the false prophet Balaam 
was not permitted to curse the children of Israel, as Balak so earnestly desired, the reason being 
because they represented the true Spiritual Church of the Lord, yet he afterwards succeeded in 
gratifying the king of the Moabites by enticing the Israelites to the worship of their false gods, and also 
to commit whoredom with the women of Midian, by which, as we have learned, is represented the 
falsification of the truth of the church by those who are in a state of adulterated good; for the Israelites, 
while in the plains of Moab, also represented such profanation of the truth. And that this action of the 
Israelites occurred through the advice of Balaam we learn from chap 31:16. But our first section 
especially teaches that when the man of the church is in this state of adulterated good, he is led to claim
merit to himself for his good deeds, which is signified by the people abiding in Shittim. For this word 
means, according to Cruden, what turns away or divests, or scourge, or rods, or thorns, and thus 
denotes the evils and falsities of selfish love, which claim merit to themselves for their good deeds on 
account of the wood which grew in that district; wood signifying the good of merit. But, in the best 
sense, this place, for the same reason, denotes "the goods of merit which are from the Lord, and thus 
which are the Lord's alone (as) appears from the signification of wood as denoting the good of merit, 
concerning which see nos. mo, 2784, 2812, 4943, 8740. The good of merit is the good which proceeds 
from the Lord's Divine Human, and which is Christian good, that is spiritual good with man," 9472. 
Now this passage requires particular attention, for otherwise it may be misunderstood. It is said that the
good of merit is spiritual good with man, but as just above it is also said that such goods are the Lord's 
alone, it is evident that in proportion as any one receives this good and acknowledges it, in the same 
proportion he will cease to claim merit to himself, or to be selfishly delighted with the good he does. 
One of the indications, therefore, that we are in spiritual good is that we cease to claim merit because 
we do good for the sake of good, and are ashamed of the selfish feeling of pleasure because we have 
done some good thing. And hence now we see what is meant spiritually, in the opposite sense, by the 
Israelites abiding in Shittim, when they bowed down to the gods of the Moabites, and committed 
whoredom with the daughters of Moab.

But in the other part of this section we are to understand, by the punishment inflicted upon the chiefs, 
that whenever man profanes worship by making it selfish, he becomes more and more confirmed in 
selfishness, unless he repents truly and utterly rejects such worship. It is essential, therefore, that every 
man of the church should most diligently avoid these three evils, namely, the claiming of merit, 
worshiping the Lord only from selfish motives, and falsifying the truth of the Word by doing so. And 
we now proceed to the second section.

And the important lesson here set before us in the internal sense is that so surely as we love and 
practise any evil thing in secret, so surely it will happen that we shall at length corrupt the church to 
which we belong by practising it openly, just as one of the children of Israel brought to his brethren a 
Midianitish woman in the sight of all the congregation of the children of Israel. And particularly will it 
come to pass, if we persist in falsifying the truth of the church by conjoining it with evil affections, 

345

while yet we appear before men as pious and good Christians, that at length our wickedness will be 
made manifest to all, unless we diligently do the work of repentance internally as well as externally, 
even because we have been made conscious of our sinfulness, and have spiritually wept at the door of 
the tent of meeting, by which is signified mourning on account of lost truth, and fluctuation between 
good and evil in a state of temptation.

And also we next have to reflect upon what immediately follows; for this describes the state of 
temptation, and the victory which must surely be ours if, indeed, we are determined to do what is here 
taught. First, then, in order to successfully overcome the tendency in ourselves to profane worship, 
even the worship of a good life, as well as that of the sanctuary, we must act from the affection of 
natural good, which the Lord has given us, and no longer from selfish motives; for it is this natural 
good which is represented by Phinehas the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, as the meaning 
of the name Phinehas clearly shows, as well as the signification of Eleazar, and Aaron, as given in the 
foregoing explanation. It may here be asked, however, how we can act from this natural good if we 
have it not, and if we are only conscious of selfish good. The answer is that no one who is acquainted 
with the truths of the church from the Word needs to be without this natural good, because these truths 
are given in order that every one may act according to them, and not according to his own merely 
selfish impulses and desires; and when a person does this he acts from the natural good, which comes 
from the Lord, and is embodied in truths he has learned. For good continually flows in from the Lord 
into the truths which a man knows, and when he obeys those truths, even simply because they are 
truths, then he has natural good from the Lord, and he is filled with zeal to destroy in himself the falsity
and evil which pervert and falsify the truth, and make him fancy that selfish worship is true worship. 
And here we have to remember also that this natural good comes to us from the Lord through spiritual 
and celestial good, namely, such good as is represented by Eleazar and Aaron respectively.

But now we read that Phinehas took a spear in his hand, with which he destroyed the guilty couple, in 
consequence of which the plague among the Israelites was stayed. And we learn from the explanation 
already given that this spear signifies Divine Truth from the Word. Hence therefore we have a very 
valuable practical lesson. That is, we learn that no state of evil can be overcome simply by the 
knowledge of the truth, or by the desire to be good which flows into such knowledge. On the contrary, 
if we wish to conquer evil by power given to us in natural good from the Lord, we must properly apply 
the truth from the Word, which condemns as well as exposes the very evil by which we are troubled. 
And as for the plague, we also know that it denotes the destruction of remains, by which is meant that 
the good and truth stored up in the interior degrees of the human mind by the Lord is no longer of use 
in promoting the salvation of man, although nothing that is good and true can ever be absolutely 
destroyed.

But next we have to consider the reward of Phinehas; and here indeed, as at the close of the last 
chapter, we saw clearly the real meaning of the Lord's work of Redemption, so now we have clearly set
before us His work of Atonement, or of the reconciliation of man with God through the reception of 
good from Him. For this is exactly the teaching of the apostle Paul where he says, "God was in Christ, 
reconciling the world to Himself, not reckoning to them their trespasses" (2 Cor 5:19), as well as the 
teaching in the spiritual sense of the early chapters of the book of Leviticus. And, in this connection, it 
may be useful to point out the true doctrine of imputation, or of reckoning, as it is here called. For can 
any one imagine, for a moment, that the all-loving and all-wise God and Lord can impute to a finite 
man anything, which he cannot possess, as a finite man? And when this is seen to be impossible, it may
also be seen that neither could the sins of mankind be imputed to the Lord the Redeemer so that He 
suffered the punishment due to man; nor could the righteousness of the Lord be imputed to man, so that

346

he could be righteous on account of the Lord's obedience; for Redemption was a Divine work, and 
could not be thus imputed. But, in the true sense, evil is not imputed to a person who believes in the 
Lord, is redeemed by Him, and regenerated, because he ceases to be in evil, by such redemption and 
regeneration; while good is imputed to such a person because he is in good from the Lord continually 
by virtue of such redemption and regeneration. And lastly the covenant of peace here given to 
Phinehas, denotes that conjunction with the Lord and heavenly peace belong to him who is in celestial-
natural good, since this means no longer any conflict between the internal and external man, on account
of the perfect harmony between them. This then is the glorious prospect for all those who truly love the
Lord.

And now, again combining the last two sections, we cannot fail, in the first instance, to notice once 
more the adaptability of the names here mentioned to the purposes of the inner sense, through the 
correspondence of the meaning of each; and although that of Salu does not appear in our lists, yet we 
find the word under a root which, in one of its forms, signifies opposition through selfish love, and we 
know that this is the character of those represented by Zimri. And secondly, we are led to reflect that it 
is the duty of the man of the Spiritual Church, earnestly and intelligently, by power given from the 
Lord, to contend against all forms of falsity from evil. For such falsities, as the narrative in the literal 
sense, and the series of the internal sense forcibly show, are calculated, when cultivated, to prove 
destructive of all heavenly principles. May we then, here and in other parts of the Word in which the 
Midianites are named, and represent in the internal sense falsities from evil, profit by the instruction 
given, and especially remember that only truth and good can agree together, and by no means falsity 
and good; while, notwithstanding, those who innocently believe some falsity to be the truth, because 
their religion teaches that it is so, are excused for their error, if they are in good — even the good 
represented by Phinehas — and are at length delivered entirely from such falsities, and have given to 
them truths agreeing with their good. And thus we now see that the last section of our chapter sets 
prominently before us the law of Divine Order concerning the final removal of falsities in the church 
and in the individual.

THE CONTENTS OF EACH VERSE

1. And it came to pass after the plague, 
that the LORD spoke to Moses and to 
Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, 
saying, 

1.

It happens in the spiritual life that after states of 
evil and temptation, when remains are destroyed 
or suffer injury, that the Lord by Divine Truth, 
interior and exterior, derived from Divine Good, 
gives the perception, 

2. Take the sum of all the congregation 
of the children of Israel, from twenty
years old and upward, by their 
fathers' houses, all that are able to go
forth to war in Israel. 

2. That the states of man, from states of the 

intelligence of truth to states of the love of good, 
including all who can engage in the conflicts of 
temptation, are to be re-ordinated and re-arranged. 

3. And Moses and Eleazar the priest 

spoke with them in the plains of 
Moab by the Jordan at Jericho, 
saying, 

3. And this takes place from Divine Truth and Divine
Good when revelation is made in a state of the 
adulteration of good, and a state most external as 
to the knowledges of good and truth, 

348

4. Take the sum of the people, from 

4.

twenty years old and upward; as the 
LORD commanded Moses and the 
children of Israel, which came forth 
out of the land of Egypt. 

In which nevertheless there is some intelligence, 
and some good arising from the Lord's work of 
Redemption through influx into the interiors and 
exteriors.

sons of Reuben; of Hanoch, the 
family of the Hanochites: of Pallu,

numbered of them were forty and 
three thousand and seven hundred 
and thirty. 

5. And of faith in the understanding which is first as 
to outward appearance in the Spiritual Church, the 
derivations are, that which gives instruction 
including those who teach; that which causes 
veneration for the truth, comprising those who 
instruct in things interior; 

6. That which accurately defines truths, including 
those who teach more interiorly; and that which 
unites truth with good, including those who 
establish faith in themselves by conjunction with 
charity. 

7. All these are derivations of faith; and their quality 
is that arising from a full course of temptations, 
involving perfection as to truths, and a holy state 
of good and truth conjoined. 

8. And the sons of Pallu; Eliab. 

8. And from veneration for truth is derived the good

Dathan, and Abiram. These are that 
Dathan and Abiram, which were 
called of the congregation, who 
strove against Moses and against 
Aaron in the company of Korah, 
when they strove against the LORD: 

9. From which proceed in their order, exterior truths, 
interior truths, and interior good; but the latter 
being falsified and adulterated, although, in their 
purity distinguished in the church by their eminent
uses, are opposed to Divine Truth and Divine 
Good, when associated with corrupted worship 
from selfish love. 

10. And the earth opened her mouth, and
swallowed them up together with 
Korah, when that company died; 
what time the fire devoured two 
hundred and fifty men, and they 
became a sign. 

10. The consequence of which is condemnation to hell
when external things prevail, and interior things 
are vastated through the violence of evil passions, 
all these being a token of the opposition of selfish 
love to Divine Love. 

11. Notwithstanding the sons of Korah 

11. But nevertheless genuine truth from good cannot

be destroyed.

without internal; and those which are done from 
affection conjoined with some conflicts in the 
work of repentance;

preparation for spiritual conflict against interior 
evils; a full state of good; and relative 
completeness as to truths. 

52. And the LORD spoke to Moses, 

52. And there is revelation from the Lord by Divine 

saying, 

Truth giving the perception, 

53. Unto these the land shall be divided 

for an inheritance according to the 
number of names. 

54. To the more you shall give the more 
inheritance, and to the fewer you 
shall give the less inheritance: to 
every one according to those that 
were numbered of him shall his 
inheritance be given. 

55. Notwithstanding the land shall be 
divided by lot: according to the 
names of the tribes of their fathers 
they shall inherit. 

53. That every one shall be in his own good according 
to regeneration from the Lord; and according to 
the states ordained and arranged by Him in 
consequence. 

54. By those who are in good from truths, and by 

those who are in charity, good is received from the
Lord accordingly; and the quality is according to 
the ordination and arrangement of truths in good 
by Him. 

55. And this is of the Divine Providence, particular 
truths and goods being arranged under general 
truths and goods. 

56. According to the lot shall their 

inheritance be divided between the 
more and the fewer. 

56. For of Divine Providence it is that good must be 
either spiritual or celestial with the man of the 
church. 

57. And these are they that were

numbered of the Levites after their 
families: of Gershon, the family of 
the Gershonites: of Kohath, the 
family of the Kohathites: of Merari, 
the family of the Merarites. 

distinguished from those who are in the good of 
truth; and their derivations are those who are in 
obscurity as to good, those who are in brightness 
as to good; and those who are in obscurity as to 
truth from good. 

58. These are the families of Levi: the 

family of the Libnites, the family of 
the Hebronites, the family of the 
Mahlites, the family of the Mushites,
the family of the Korahites. And 
Kohath begat Amram. 

58. And of these the derivations are those who are in 
greater obscurity as to good; those who are in less 
brightness as to good; thoss who are in obscurity 
as to good and truth; and those who are in truth 
without good. But on the other hand, Divine Truth 
from the Lord produces inmost good. 

354

59. And the name of Amram's wife was 
Jochebed, the daughter of Levi, who 
was born to Levi in Egypt: and she 
bare to Amram Aaron and Moses, 
and Miriam their sister. 

60. And to Aaron were born Nadab and 

Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar. 

59. And the quality of the truth conjoined with inmost 
good is most excellent, being the affection of truth 
from good derived from the Lord through the work
of redemption; and thence proceed by conjunction 
with inmost good, celestial good, celestial truth or 
the Divine Law and the good of faith which 
appertains to intellectual truth. 

60. But celestial good produces spiritual good internal 
and external; and then again natural good internal 
and external. 

61. And Nadab and Abihu died, when 
they offered strange fire before the 
LORD. 

61. And yet when spiritual truth and good are 

profaned by the man of the church, spiritual death 
is the consequence. 

62. And they that were numbered of 
them were twenty and three 
thousand, every male from a month 
old and upward: for they were not 
numbered among the children of 
Israel, because there was no 
inheritance given them among the 
children of Israel. 

62. And the quality of love and charity by means of 
truths, commencing from a state of faith and 
proceeding to the good of charity, according to 
ordination and arrangement, is the full conjunction
of good and truth; but good apart from truth cannot
be ordinated and arranged even in the celestial 
heaven; nor is celestial good to be confused with 
spiritual good. 

63. These are that they were numbered 
by Moses and Eleazar the priest; 
who numbered the children of Israel 
in the plain of Moab by the Jordan at
Jericho. 

64. But among these there was not a 

man of them that were numbered by 
Moses and Aaron the priest; who 
numbered the children of Israel in 
the wilderness of Sinai. 

65. For the LORD had said of them, They
shall surely die in the wilderness. 
And there was not left a man of 
them, save Caleb the son of 
Jephunneh, and Joshua the son of 
Nun. 

63. And the quality of the church inwardly, according 
to ordination and arrangement, is known only from
the Lord by means of Divine Truth and Divine 
Good; from these only is it known, by those who 
are in the Spiritual Church by conflict against evil,
and who are prepared for interior conflict, in a 
state of adulterated good external as to both truth 
and good, and yet endowed with the knowledges 
of truth and good, by which falsities which defend 
evil are to be opposed. 

64. But none who are principled in what is evil and 
false, and who fear the spiritual conflict, can 
engage therein, even though they have been in 
obscure good, through defect of truths. 

65. For it is according to Divine Order from Divine 

Love, that such shall perish in their obscurity; and 
that none can be saved but those who are in truth 
from good by celestial love, and those who are in 
good from truth by spiritual love.

5. Reuben, the firstborn of Israel, denotes faith in the understanding which is first as to outward 
appearance in the Spiritual Church, because he is named from seeing, 3863, 3325, 3654; 
Hanoch, the family of the Hanochites, denotes the first derivative from faith, namely, that

dedication, 6078, 7007, 471, 7833; and Pallu, the family of the Palluites, denotes that which

8. The sons of Pallu being Eliab, denotes that from veneration for the truth is derived the good of

truth, because by Pallu is denoted veneration for the truth, ver. 5; sons denote what is 
derivative, 5912; and by Eliab is meant God my father, thus signifying truth producing good, 
2001, 3703. 

9. The sons of Eliab being Nemuel, Dathan, and Abiram, denotes that from the good of truth 

proceed, in their order, exterior truths, interior truths, and interior good, because by Nemuel is 
meant what is from God, and thus he signifies exterior truth, since he was a descendant of 
Reuben, 2001, 3868; by Dathan is meant laws or rites, and therefore he signifies interior truth 
for the same reason, 162, 3868; and by Abiram, in the best sense, is meant high father, and 
therefore he denotes interior good, 2148, 3703; and called of the congregation, or assembly, 
who strove against Moses and against Aaron in the company of Korah, when they strove 
against the Lord, denotes that the latter being falsified and adulterated, although in their purity 
distinguished in the church for their eminent uses, are opposed to Divine Truth and Divine 
Good, when associated with corrupted worship from selfish love, 9373, 9041, 7010, 9946, 
chap 16:1, 2001. 

10. The earth opening her mouth and swallowing them up, together with Korah, when that 

company died, what time the fire devoured two hundred and fifty men, and their becoming a 
sign, denotes that the consequence is condemnation to hell, when external things prevail, and 
interior things are vastated, through the violence of evil passions, all these being a token of the
opposition of selfish love to Divine Love, chap 16:32-35, 2037. 

11. By the sons of Korah not dying, is denoted that nevertheless genuine truth from good cannot 

be destroyed, 489. 8306, 8876, 8879, 8880. 

12. The sons of Simeon after their families, denote those who are in faith in the will, or in 

obedience, from a sense of duty, 3869, 7833; Nemuel, the family of the Nemuelites, denotes 
obedience from exterior good, because Nemuel, as before shown, means what is from God, 
and in this case exterior good, since this Nemuel was a son of Simeon, and is mentioned first, 
2001, 3869; Jamin, the family of the Jaminites, denotes interior good, because Jamin means 
the right hand, and thus denotes good, and it is said interior good according to the series, 
10061; and Jachin, the family of the Jachinites, denotes inmost good, because Jachin means 
firmly established, and therefore denotes, according to the series, inmost good, 984, 10061, 
1276, 1277; while the families denote clearly those who are in such goods respectively, 7833. 

13. Zerah, the family of the Zerahites, denotes diat lower good affections have their origin from 
celestial good external, because by Zerah is meant the east, rising of the sun, or brightness,

Shaul, the family of the Shaulites, denotes this again in celestial love internal, because by

14. These being the families of the Simeonites, denotes the good of truth in general, which is good

acquired in the beginning by obedience to truth for the sake of being led into good 
successively, as the previous verses show; and which culminates in the realization of the 
highest state of good of which any one is capable, 3869, 7833; and twenty and two thousand 
and two hundred denotes quality, namely, the full conjunction of good with truth and of truth 
with good, 5194, 2280, 8641, 10217.

17. Arod, the family of the Arodites, denotes good works done from the genuine affection for 

truth, because the Arodites, or Arva-dites, were an idolatrous nation in external worship 
without internal, and therefore represented such worship; but here, in the best sense, on 
account of the connection in which they are named, they denote obedience from the affection 
for truth, which follows obedience from natural delight, 1205; their city Aradus, which was 
situated on an island off the coast of Phoenicia, thus denoting genuine doctrine, 402, and its

45. The sons of Beriah being Heber, the family of-the Heberites, and Malchiel, the family of the 
Malchielites, denotes that from these again are derived truths still more interior as to life and 
doctrine; because by Heber is meant association, and therefore he denotes what relates to life, 
684, and by Malchiel is meant my king is God, and therefore he denotes what relates to 
doctrine, 1672, 2001. 

46. The name of the daughter of Asher being Serah, denotes that thus the genuine affection of 
good and truth is developed by means of natural delight, because by Serah is meant a 
princess, and therefore she denotes the affection of truth governing, 5912, 3938, 489, 1482, 
145. 

47. The families of the sons of Asher, according to those that were numbered of them, denotes the 
quality of natural delight, in general, according to ordination and arrangement, 10217; and 
fifty-three thousand four hundred, denotes fullness of good and truth with their conjunction, 
2141, 1686. 

48. The sons of Naphtali, after their families, denotes the resistance of the natural man in 

temptations and its derivations, 3927, 7833, 5912; Jahzeel, the family of the Jahzeelites, 
denotes the truth obeyed externally, in opposition to evil, because by Jahzeel is denoted 
according to the series, the first state of the regenerating man in resisting evil, Jahzeel 
evidently meaning the truth in an external form, 2001, 8690; and Guni, the family of the 
Gunites, denotes truth obeyed from the affection thereof, the meaning of this word not clearly 
appearing from the works examined, 8690. 

49. Jezer, the family of the Jezerites, denotes the formation of character, because this word means 
anything formed, 4985; and Shillem, the family of the Shillemites, denotes a state of peace 
with the good, and of retribution with the wicked, because by Shillem is meant made at peace 
with, or retribution, 9253. 

50. These being the families of Naphtali, according to their-families, denotes the quality of 

resistance to evil in general, and of its derivations, 3927, 7833; they that were numbered of 

362

them, denotes ordination and arrangement, 10217; and forty and five thousand and four 
hundred, denotes full resistance to evil in temptation, and fullness of truth conjoined with 
good, 730, 5708, 1686. 

51. These being they that were numbered of the children of Israel", denotes the quality of the man 

of the church in general, according to ordination and arrangement, and as to all his faculties, 
10217, 3654; and six hundred thousand, and a thousand seven hundred and thirty, denotes 
complete preparation for spiritual conflict against interior evils; a full state of good; and 
relative completeness as to truth, 7973, 2575, 728, 2966. 

52. This is evident, because by Jehovah, is denoted the Divine Being as to His love, 2001; by 

speaking is denoted influx, 2951; by Moses, is denoted Divine Truth, or the Word, 7010; and 
by saying, is denoted perception 1822.

53. "Unto these the land shall be divided for an inheritance, according to the number of the 

names," denotes that every one shall be in his own good, according to regeneration from the 
Lord; and according to the states ordinated and arranged by Him in consequence, 3705, 1799, 
2658, 3239, 10217, 145. 

54. "To the more you shall give the more inheritance," denotes to those who are in good from 
truths, 6172, 2658; "to the fewer you shall give the less inheritance," denotes that by those 
who are in charity, good is received from the Lord accordingly, 3417, 9373 end; and to every 
one according to those that were numbered of him shall his inheritance be given," denotes that 
quality is according to the ordination and arrangement of truths in good by the Lord, 10217. 

55. "Notwithstanding the land shall be divided by lot," denotes that this is of the Divine 

Providence, 10217, 3239; and "according to the names of the tribes of their fathers they shall 
inherit," denotes that particular truths and goods are arranged under general truths and goods, 
3858, 2658. 

56. "According to the lot shall their inheritance be divided between the more and the fewer," 

denotes that of Divine Providence it is that good must be either spiritual or celestial with the 
man of the church, 5049, 3239, 6172, 2658, 3417, 9374. 

57. These being they that were numbered of the Levites after their families, denotes that those 

who are in charity and love are distinguished from those who are in the good of truth, 10217, 
3875, 7833; Gershon, the family of the Gershonites, denotes those who are in obscurity as to 
good, because by Gershon is meant his banishment and change of pilgrimage, 996020, 1463; 
Kohath, the family of the Kohathites, denotes those who are in brightness as to good, because 
by Kohath is meant congregation, 6338, 7843, chap 3:29; and Merari, the family of the 
Merarites, denotes those who are in obscurity as to truth from good, because by Merari is 
meant bitterness, 7854, chap 3:17. 

58. These being the families of Levi, denotes further derivation from love and charity, 3875, 7833;
the family of the Libnites denotes those who are in greater obscurity as to good, because Libni 
was the son of Gershon, and his name means whiteness, 5912, chap 3:18; the family of the 
Hebronites, denotes those who are in less brightness as to good, because he was the son of 
Kohath, and his name means association, or friendship, 5912, chap 3:19; the family of the 
Mahlites, and the family of the Mushites, denotes those who are in obscurity as to both good 

363

and truth, because these were the sons of Merari, and their names mean respectively weak or 
diseased, and that which touches or takes away, 5912, chap 3:20; the family of the Korahites, 
denotes those who are in truth, but without good, because he was the grandson of Kohath, and 
his name means bald, frozen, icy, 5912, chap 16:1; and Kohath begetting Amram denotes that 
Divine Truth from the Lord produces inmost good, because although Kohath in a lower sense 
denotes, as a son of Levi, what is of charity, 7230, and the good of charity in brightness, chap 
3:17, yet in the supreme sense he signifies the Lord as to Divine Truth, even as Levi does the 
Divine Love in that sense, 3875; and by his begetting Amram is denoted that, in its procedure 
from the Lord, it produces inmost good and truth conjoined, Amram meaning an exalted 
people, exaltation having reference to good, 1735, and people denoting truth, 1259; and it is to
be observed that this inmost good is distinguished from the celestial good which it produces, 
and which is represented by Aaron, as the good of the inmost or supreme degree in man is 
distinguished from the good of the third degree in Him (HH 39). But if Kohath be taken to 
denote what is of charity, then by Amram will be denoted "derived good and truth," 7230. 

59. The name of Amram's wife being Jochebed, the daughter of Levi, who was born to Levi in 

Egypt, denotes that the quality of the truth conjoined with inmost good is most excellent, 
being the affection of truth from good derived from the Lord through the work of redemption, 
because by name is denoted quality, 145, by Amram is denoted inmost good, ver. 58; by 
Jochebed is meant the glory of the Lord, and honourable, and therefore by her is denoted what 
is most excellent, 4809; by a daughter of Levi is denoted the affection of truth from good 
derived from the Lord, 489, 3875, and by being born in Egypt is denoted through the work of 
redemption, 3860, 8866; and bearing to Amram Aaron, and Moses, and Miriam their sister, 
denotes that thence proceed by conjunction with inmost good, celestial good, celestial truth or 
the Divine Law, and the good of faith which appertains to intellectual truth, 10017, 7010, 
8337, 1475. But considering Amram to denote "derived good," and Jochebed to denote 
"kindred truth," in a lower degree, then it follows that Aaron and Moses and Miriam denote 
respectively "the doctrine of the church, the Law from the Divine," and the good of faith, 
7230, 8337, 1475. 

60. There being born to Aaron Nadab and Abihu, and Eleazar and Ithamar, denotes that celestial 
good produces spiritual good internal and external, and then, again, natural good internal and 
external; 9810-9813; and these are, in effect, "derivations of faith and charity," 7230. 

61. Nadab and Abihu dying when they offered strange fire before the Lord, denotes that when 
spiritual truth and good are profaned by the man of the church, spiritual death is the 
consequence, 9375, Lev 10:1-7. 

62. They that were numbered of them being twenty and three thousand, denotes their quality, 

namely, the full conjunction of good and truth, 5194, 2905, 2788, 10217; every male from a 
month old and upwards denotes by means of truths commencing from a state of faith and 
proceeding to the good of charity, 725, 851, 10225; and their not being numbered among the 
children of Israel because there was no inheritance given them among the children of Israel, 
denotes that good apart from truth cannot be ordinated and arranged even in the celestial 
heaven; nor is celestial good to be confused with spiritual good, 3875, 10217, 3654, 1802. 

63. These being they that were numbered by Moses and Eleazar the priest, denotes that the quality
of the church inwardly, according to ordination and arrangement, is known only from the Lord
by means of Divine Truth and Divine Good, 10217, 7010, 9946, 9812; and numbering the 

364

children of Israel in the plains of Moab, by the Jordan at Jericho, denotes that from Divine 
Truth and Divine Good only is it known by those who, in the Spiritual Church by conflict 
against evil, and who are prepared for interior conflict, in a state of adulterated good external 
as to both truth and good; and are yet endowed with the knowledges of truth and good by 
which falsities which defend evil are to be opposed, 10217, 4286, 4287, 2418, 2468, 6538, 
932510. 

64. Among those there not being a man of them that were numbered by Moses and Aaron the 

priest, who numbered the children of Israel in the wilderness of Sinai, denotes that none who 
are principled in what is evil and false, and who fear the spiritual conflict, can engage therein, 
even though they have been in obscure good through defect of truths, 128, 10217, 7010, 9946, 
3654, 8753. 

65. The Lord saying of them, "They shall surely die in the wilderness"; and there not being a man 
left of them, save Caleb the son of Jephunneh, and Joshua the son of Nun, denotes that it is 
according to Divine Order from Divine Love that such shall perish in their obscurity; and that 
none can be saved but those who are in truth from good by celestial love, and those who are in
good from truth by spiritual love, 2001, 1822, 2708, 10431, 2908, chap 14:35, chap 13:6, 8. 

DISCUSSION

As we read through this chapter and consider it first in a general way, our minds are naturally carried 
back to the beginning of this book of Numbers, in which there is a similar account of the numbering of 
the Israelites according to their tribes; and therefore the best commentary that can be here made will be 
a comparison of the spiritual or internal sense of what is here said with that of the previous account. For
while that describes the ordination and arrangement of the states of the man of the Spiritual Church by 
the Lord, in preparation for spiritual conflicts or temptations, this describes a similar ordination and 
arrangement after a long series of temptations; and we ought therefore to expect the differences to be 
now noticed. But some things are the same, and these also are interesting. It is, for example, always the 
Lord Who rearranges the states of man, since man only sees himself, as it were, outwardly, and from 
his outward life is apt to conclude concerning his inward states, and in doing this he may err. But the 
Lord sees man from the inmost, and thence knows the real quality of all his states internal and external,
and also exactly how these stand related to one another. Hence, then, it is clear that only the Lord can 
properly arrange the states of man at any period of his life. And consequently, also, it is the Lord who 
gradually leads each regenerated man into his own heavenly society, where he will be delighted to live 
and make progress for ever.

Another thing that is the same in both the accounts of the numbering is clearly stated in our first 
section. It is all that are able to go forth to war, that is, spiritually, it comprehends all those who, from 
previous instruction, can endure temptations. This latter numbering, therefore, implies that more 
temptations are to follow. Hence, then, we are not to conclude that the quality described by the numbers
of the tribes is final in either case, but only that it is not the same in either case. And, thirdly, the order 
of the tribes in both cases is generally the same, with a slight difference to be considered a little further 
on. That is, the state of truth leading to good still prevails, or man's spiritual state as distinguished from 
his celestial state still prevails, because the series commences with Reuben; and the signification of all 
the other tribes is modified by the signification of the tribe which leads, Reuben signifying truth of faith
in the understanding, and thus denoting the spiritual state, whereas Judah signifies celestial love, and 
thus denotes the celestial or heavenly state.

365

But now the first important difference that we have to note of the second description from the first is 
that the families of the various tribes are named, and not only the tribes themselves. And we see from 
the series of the spiritual sense, and also from the explanations, what this implies. For the various 
families in any tribe denote derivations of good and truth, and we may take the case of the tribe of 
Reuben as an example and as an illustration. The sons of Reuben were Hanoch, Pallu, Hezron, and 
Carmi; and these, from the correspondence of the meaning of the names, respectively signify that 
which gives instruction, and also those who teach; that which causes veneration for the truth, 
comprising those who instruct in things interior; that which accurately defines truths, including those 
who teach more interiorly; and that which unites truth with good, including those who establish faith in 
themselves by conjunction with charity. And can we not see clearly, therefore, that, in the four names, 
we have a regular series of those who are in faith and teach truths; and, also, that they describe 
regeneration as it proceeds from external states to internal states? But we now proceed, and notice that 
the son of Pallu was Eliab; and that this signifies that from veneration for the truth is derived the good 
of truth, this being exactly according to the course of man's experience in regeneration. And again we 
find that the sons of Eliab were Nemuel, Dathan, and Abiram, and that these denote, respectively, 
exterior truths, interior truths, and interior good in the best sense; but that in the opposite sense Dathan 
and Abiram signify those who are opposed to Divine Truth and Divine Good, when associated with 
corrupted worship from selfish love. From this brief review, therefore, of the spiritual meaning of the 
families of Reuben, we see how true are the correspondences of the holy Word, and how the spiritual 
sense therein involved describes man's spiritual states good and bad; and thence we may justly 
conclude, also, that this is the case with regard to all the other families of the tribes as named in their 
order in this chapter, even if we did not know that this is so, by means of the explanation given in their 
proper places concerning all the rest. And hence, too, we now know how very valuable are the accounts
of these families, when they are all understood spiritually. But in \vhat way are they valuable? They are
so, because they show that, as man advances in regeneration and his states are successively re-
ordinated and re-arranged by the Lord, he comes into superior states, and is able to discriminate more 
accurately in regard to the particulars of truth by which his life is regulated, just as the numbering of 
this chapter is more specific than is that in the first chapter of the book. The next important difference, 
however, between this chapter and the former is that the numbers in each of the tribes are different. Nor
is this to be wondered at either as to the literal or spiritual sense. For, literally, it could not surely be 
otherwise as the history shows; and, spiritually, the advanced states of the spiritual man cannot be 
precisely of the same quality, as were his earlly states, when, as yet, he had not conquered in 
temptations. But it is impossible, with the limited space at our disposal, to comment on the difference 
of the numbers in each tribe; one or two examples may suffice; and the reader, besides, can make a 
similar comparison with all the rest. Let us then, again, take the tribe of Reuben as our illustration. The 
number of the Reubenites in the first instance was forty and six thousand and five hundred, and this 
signified, according to the correspondences, truth confirmed by victories in temptation, both as to the 
understanding and will. That is, this is the capacity of those who are in faith in the understanding at the 
beginning of regeneration; for they must confirm the truth by this means in order to advance; and that 
they must do it both as to the understanding and the will is manifest because the will constitutes the 
man primarily. But now we may look at the number of the Reubenites in the second instance, and we 
find it is forty and three thousand and seven hundred and thirty, which, spiritually interpreted, is a full 
course of temptations, involving perfection as to truths, and a holy state of good and truth conjoined. 
And do we not here recognize that this is an advanced state of the spiritual man compared with the 
former? For although it is good to confirm truths, it is much better that truths should be conjoined with 
good, and thus that there should be a state of holiness in the life. And now, therefore, if we should 
examine and compare all the other cases according to the correspondences, we should find that, 

366

likewise, an advance of state is shown in the second instance. Without, therefore, illustrating this 
subject more at length, we proceed to notice some other differences between our present chapter and 
the former, which are not void of interest.

If we compare chap 1:46 with our present chapter, ver. 51, in the spiritual sense, we notice an 
interesting difference indicating further progress. But it is said in this chapter, "conflict against interior 
evils," because as man advances in regeneration this is his experience; and, also, "relative completeness
as to truth," because this also is involved in the fact that there are more conflicts.

And now, having finished the consideration of the second section with respect to the numbering, we 
have to notice the slight difference in the arrangement of the tribes between this and the former 
account, namely, that here Manasseh is put before Ephraim, whereas in the former case Ephraim is put 
before Manasseh. And in order to understand the reason of this we have to remember that, taking the 
tribes as a whole, and considering that Reuben commences the series, we know that the general subject 
is the Spiritual Church; and thence we can perceive that the first six tribes have relation to interior 
states of faith and love therein, and that the second six have relation to exterior states, or, in other 
words, the first six describe the state of the spiritual man, and the second six the state of the natural 
man. But as man advances in regeneration, it is the natural degree, in particular, which is brought into 
greater harmony with the spiritual. That is, man, as to the Natural, begins to regard good more than 
truth, or the life of charity more than the life of faith, or still, in other words, the new will of good, 
denoted by Manasseh, comes before the new understanding of truth, denoted by Ephraim. And this, 
then, is what is really represented in our chapter. For as Manasseh now leads the second six tribes, and 
not Ephraim, as before, this indicates that what he represents affects the representation of all the tribes 
that follow him.

And we pass now to the third section, concerning which the special point to be noted is the perfect 
harmony between the numbering and assigning the land accordingly, and dividing it by lot. Now, what 
is given by lot signifies what man receives of good and truth according to the Divine Providence, and 
what is given according to the number signifies what he receives according to his specific quality; and 
they both harmonize, since it is not the will of the Lord that any one should have more or less of 
heavenly blessedness, or of conjunction with Him, and of the equality of good and truth than he himself
is able to appropriate. It is very difficult for us fully to understand this perfect balance of Divine 
Providence and human freedom; but, undoubtedly, there is such a balance, and it is preserved in heaven
to eternity in every individual case.

But with regard to the last section, we only need in this place to observe that whereas, in the former 
account, the number of the Levites was twenty-two thousand, in this chapter it is twenty-three 
thousand, thus, again, denoting an advance as to quality in the case of those in charity and love, 
because twenty-two denotes the conjunction of truth with good, while twenty-three denotes the same in
all fullness.

Numbers Chapter 27

SUMMARY OF THE SPIRITUAL SENSE

1.

Instruction with regard to those who are in good without truths, and with regard to their 
salvation, vers. 1-11. 

2. Their origin and quality are described, and also their earnest desire for salvation and for the 

knowledge of the truth, vers. 1-4. 

3. Only Divine Truth conjoined with Divine Good can decide, and give the laws of order in this 

case, vers. 5-11. 

4. Concerning the separation of those who have been in merely representative worship, or in 

external worship without internal, and thence in mistaken zeal, that they may have a general 
view of heavenly principles in all their beauty, but cannot realize them, vers. 12-14. 

5. But, on the other hand, that those who are governed by the truth combating against evil, 

provided they contend in subordination to Divine Good and Divine Truth, will ultimately do 
so, if they are obedient, vers. 15-23. 

THE CONTENTS OF EACH VERSE

1. Then drew near the daughters of 

Zelophehad, the son of Hepher, the 
son of Gilead, the son of Machir, the 
son of Manasseh, of the families of 
Manasseh the son of Joseph: and 
these are the names of his daughters;
Mahlah, Noah, and Hoglah, and 
Milcah, and Tirzah. 

1. But now there is investigation by Divine Truth and
Divine Good concerning those who are in the 
affection of truth without truths, the origin of 
which is the fear of the Lord grounded in obscurity
as to knowledge, this fear being derived from the 
man who is in the beginning of regeneration, as to 
the understanding formed from the will of the 
natural man, which again has its origin in the new 
will of the spiritual man mediately through his 
new understanding, and thus from the Lord, 
through the celestial of the spiritual principle as 
distinguishing the Spiritual Church. And the 
quality of this affection is that it is weak for the 
want of truths; is distinctly elevated above merely 
natural good; is disposed strongly to confirm truth 
in general, and to abide in it; is thus further 
disposed to be governed by this truth; and what is 
more than all to have genuine delight therein. 

368

2. And they stood before Moses, and 

before Eleazar the priest, and before 
the princes and all the congregation, 
at the door of the tent of meeting, 
saying, 

2. And this affection acknowledges further that it is 
derived from Divine Truth and Divine Good, and 
is given to man by the Lord through the heavens; 
that it is especially in the acknowledgement of the 
Divine Human, and of all the primary and 
subordinate truths of the Word thence derived, and 
hence it has the perception, 

3. Our father died in the wilderness, 

3. That its approximate origin is the natural fear of 

and he was not among the company 
of them that gathered themselves 
together against the LORD in the 
company of Korah: but he died in his
own sin; and he had no sons. 

the Lord, which ceases in the course of 
regeneration; that it has not been contaminated by 
profanity in worship through faith alone; that it 
involves the acknowledgement that man of himself
is nothing but evil; and yet that it is entirely 
without truths. 

4. Why should the name of our father 
be taken away from among his 
family, because he had no son? Give 
to us a possession among the 
brethren of our father. 

4. And why, therefore, should this affection not have 
the quality of good from the Lord because it is 
without truths? For certainly it desires a possession
of inheritance in the heavenly kingdom, where 
good is the ruling principle! 

5. And Moses brought their cause 

5. But Divine Truth cannot decide this doubtful point

before the LORD. 

apart from conjunction with Divine Good. 

6. And the LORD spoke to Moses, 

6. And therefore there is revelation from the Lord by 

saying, 

Divine Truth giving the perception, 

7. The daughters of Zelophehad speak 

right: you shall surely give them a 
possession of an inheritance among 
their father's brethren; and you shall 
cause the inheritance of their father 
to pass to them. 

8. And you shall speak to the children 

of Israel, saying, If a man die, and 
have no son, then you shall cause his
inheritance to pass to his daughter. 

9. And if he have no daughter, then you
shall give his inheritance to his 
brethren. 

7. That the natural affection of good from the Lord 
discerns what is true; that this affection entitles 
man to a place in the heavenly kingdom, and has a 
specific use therein; and that indeed the fear of the 
Lord as in the beginning of regeneration, involves 
a holy fear which properly belongs to the 
regenerated man. 

8. And it is the dictate of Divine Truth to those who 
are of the Spiritual Church, that when man, during 
regeneration, is without truths, but is yet in the 
affection of truth, and thence of good, he shall 
inherit the heavenly kingdom, because he will 
receive truths in agreement with his particular 
affection. 

9. But if he is without the affection of truth, he shall 
yet inherit provided he is in mutual charity. 

369

10. And if he have no brethren, then you
shall give his inheritance to his 
father's brethren. 

11. And if his father have no brethren, 

then you shall give his inheritance to
his kinsman that is next to him of his
family, and he shall possess it: and it 
shall be to the children of Israel a 
statute of judgement, as the LORD 
commanded Moses. 

12. And the LORD said to Moses, Get 

you up into this mountain of Abarim,
and behold the land which I have 
given to the children of Israel. 

13. And when you have seen it, you also
shall be gathered to your people, as 
Aaron your brother was gathered: 

14. Because you rebelled against my 

word in the wilderness of Zin, in the 
strife of the congregation, to sanctify
me at the waters before their eyes. 
(These are the waters of Meribah of 
Kadesh in the wilderness of Zin.) 

10. Again, if he is not in mutual charity, but is yet in 
charity more remotely, he will still inherit. 

11. And lastly, if he is not in charity more remote, but 
in charity most remote, he shall still inherit the 
heavenly kingdom, having his position according 
to the good of his society, because it is a law of 
Divine Order that wherever there is good, there is 
the capacity for regeneration. 

12. Moreover, there is perception from the Lord with 
the man of the Spiritual Church, enabling him to 
see the principles which constitute heaven and the 
true church by an elevation of the mind in a state 
intermediate between merely natural love on the 
one hand and spiritual and celestial love on the 
other. 

13. But that such a state of perception does not 

continue with those who are in merely external 
zeal for instruction without internal, and that they 
must be associated with their like in the eternal 
world and state, since such zeal is derived from 
and is allied with merely external worship. 

14. And is really opposed to the Word of the Lord in a 
state of faith without charity, when the natural man
also is excited, and when truth which ought to be 
conjoined with good is separated from it, 
remaining in the understanding only. For such a 
state is one of mere strife and contention about 
truths, of outward holiness only, and of the 
absence of good as well as obscurity as to truths. 

15. And Moses spoke to the LORD, 

15. But it is the thought of the spiritual man derived 

saying, 

from Divine Good, 

16. Let the LORD, the God of the spirits 
of all flesh, appoint a man over the 
congregation, 

16. That a new state of the church is to succeed 

through the influence of Divine Good and Divine 
Truth, operating both internally and externally 
with man, in which it shall be governed by Divine 
Truth, 

370

17. Which may go out before them, and 
which may come in before them, and
which may lead them out, and which
may bring them in; that the 
congregation of the LORD be not as 
sheep which have no shepherd. 

18. And the LORD said to Moses, Take 

you Joshua the son of Nun, a man in 
whom is the spirit, and lay your hand
upon him; 

17. In every state of conflict and rest as to the spiritual
man and as to the natural man; for indeed the 
church cannot be governed by good alone, without
the truth which is the expression of that good, and 
which teaches and leads to good. 

18. And it is therefore the dictate of Divine Good by 
Divine Truth, that truth combating against evil 
perpetually, from an internal and not only from an 
external motive, will have transferred to it the full 
power of truth teaching and leading; 

19. And set him before Eleazar the 
priest, and before all the 
congregation; and give him a charge 
in their sight. 

19. And indeed will be conjoined internally with truth 
immediately proceeding from good, and externally
with truths in the natural degree, being there 
endowed with full power to govern. 

20. And you shall put of your honour 

upon him, that all the congregation 
of the children of Israel may obey. 

20. Because such truth combating is really from the 
Lord alone by Divine Truth, and consequently is 
worthy of full expression in every action of the 
life. 

21. And he shall stand before Eleazar the

21. And this truth shall also be in subordination to 

priest, who shall inquire for him by 
the judgement of the Urim before the
LORD: at his word shall they go out, 
and at his word they shall come in, 
both he, and all the children of Israel
with him, even all the congregation. 

Divine Truth from Divine Good which aids man in
temptation; and from that truth it receives 
revelation; and according to it all states of conflict 
and rest are regulated, even as to the subordinate 
governing principle, and as to the natural and 
spiritual powers which are governed. 

22. And Moses did as the LORD 

22. And this effect follows with him who is obedient; 

commanded him: and he took 
Joshua, and set him before Eleazar 
the priest, and before all the 
congregation: 

23. And he laid his hands upon him, and 
gave him a charge, as the LORD 
spoke by the hand of Moses. 

23. For the full power of inmost truth and good is 

manifested in truth combating; and subordinate 
powers are obedient thereto.

want of truths; is distinctly elevated above merely natural good; is disposed strongly to

that it is given to man by the Lord through the heavens, and that it is especially in the 
acknowledgement of the Divine Human, and of all the primary and subordinate truths of the 
Word thence derived; and that hence it has the perception, 8686, 1482, 7843, 2356, 35403, 
1822.

"Our father died in the wilderness," denotes approximate origin, namely, the natural fear of the
Lord, which ceases, in the course of regeneration, chap 26:33, 494, 2708; "and he was not 
among the company of them that gathered themselves together in the company of Korah," 
denotes not being contaminated by profanity in worship through faith alone, chap 16:1; "but 
he died in his own sin," denotes that it involves the acknowledgement that man of himself is 
nothing but evil, 494, 210, 868; and "he had no sons," denotes that yet it is entirely without 
truths, 489. 

"Why should the name of our father be taken away from among his family because he has no 
son?" denotes why, therefore, should this affection not have the quality of good from the Lord 
because it is without truth? 145, 3703, 7833, 489; and "Give to us a possession among the 
brethren of our father," denotes that certainly it desires a possession and inheritance in the 
heavenly kingdom where good is the ruling principle! 2535, 2658, 3705, 3703. 

5. Moses bringing their cause before the Lord, denotes that Divine Truth cannot decide this 
doubtful point apart from conjunction with Divine Good, 7010, 8685, 2335, 2001. 

6. This is evident, because by Jehovah is denoted the Divine Being as to His love, 2001; by 

speaking is denoted influx, 2951; by Moses is represented Divine Truth, or the Word, 7010; 
and by saying is denoted perception, 1822. 

7.

"The daughters of Zelophehad speak right," denotes that the natural affection of good from the
Lord discerns what is true, chap 26:33, 2271, 41513;" you shall surely give them a possession, 
of an inheritance among their father's brethren," denotes that this affection entitles man to a 
place in the heavenly kingdom, and has a specific use therein, 7010, 2658, 3705, 3703, 3803; 
"and you shall cause the inheritance of their father to pass to them," denotes that indeed the 
fear of the Lord, as in the beginning of regeneration, involves a holy fear which properly 
belongs to the regenerated man, 7010, 2658, chap 26:33, 2826. 

8.

"And you shall speak to the children of Israel, saying," denotes that it is the dictate of Divine 
Truth to those who are of the Spiritual Church, 7010, 3654, 1822; and "If a man die and have 

372

no son, then you shall cause his inheritance to pass to his daughter," denotes that when man, 
during regeneration, is without truths, but is yet in the affection of truth, and thence of good, 
he shall inherit the heavenly kingdom, because he will receive truths in agreement with his 
particular affection, 489, 1408, 2658, 4345-6.

9.

"And if he have no daughter, then you shall give his inheritance to his brethren," denotes that 
if he is without the affection of truth, he shall yet inherit, provided he is in mutual charity, 489,
2658, 3815. 

10. "And if he have no brethren then you shall give his inheritance to his father's brethren," 

denotes that if he is not in mutual charity, but is yet in charity more remotely, he will still 
inherit, 3803. 

11. "And if his father have no brethren, then you shall give his inheritance to his kinsman that is 
next to him of his family, and he shall possess it," denotes that if he is not in charity more 
remote, but in charity most remote, he shall still inherit the heavenly kingdom, having his 
possession according to the good of his society, 370317; and "it shall be to the children of 
Israel a statute of judgement, as the Lord commanded Moses," denotes that it is a law of 
Divine Order that wherever there is good, there is the capacity for regeneration, 3654, 7844, 
8357, 2001, 5486, 7010. 

12. The Lord saying to Moses, "Get you up into this mount Abarim, and behold the land which I 
have given to the children of Israel," denotes that there is perception from the Lord, with the 
man of the Spiritual Church, enabling him to see the principles which constitute heaven and 
the true church, by an elevation of the mind in a state intermediate between merely natural 
love on the one hand, and spiritual and celestial love on the other, 2001, 1822, 67521, 3705, 
1543, 3654. But it is said, "a state intermediate," because Abarim means passages, and 
therefore denotes such a state, 8321, 8323. 

13. "And when you have seen it them also shall be gathered to your people as Aaron your brother 
was gathered," denotes that such a state of perception does not continue with those who are in 
merely external zeal for instruction without internal; and that they must be associated with 
their like in the eternal world and state, since such zeal is derived from and is allied with 
merely external worship, 2150. 3705. 3255. chap 20:7-29. 

14. "Because you rebelled against my word in the wilderness of Zin," denotes opposition to the 

Word of the Lord in a state of faith without charity, chap. 20:1; "in the strife of the 
congregation," denotes when the natural man also is excited, because the congregation, or 
rather, the assembly, in relation to Moses, represents the natural in relation to the spiritual 
man, 7843; "to sanctify me at the waters before their eyes," denotes when truth which ought to
be conjoined with good is separated therefrom, 8042, 2702, 2403; and "these are the waters of 
Meribah of Kadesh in the wilderness of Zin," denotes that such a state is one of mere strife and
contention about truths, of outward holiness only, and of the absence of good as well as 
obscurity as to truths, 2702, 1678, 2503, 2708, chap 20:1. It was a state of outward holiness, 
because by Kadesh is meant holiness, and yet of the absence of good because by Zin is meant 
a buckler and coldness, 1788, 34. 

15. Moses speaking to the Lord, saying, denotes that it is the thought of the spiritual man derived 

from Divine Good, 6752*, 2271, 2951, 2001. 

373

16. "Let the Lord the God of the spirits of all flesh appoint a man over the congregation," or 

assembly, denotes that a new state of the church is to succeed through the influence of Divine 
Good and Divine Truth, operating both internally and externally with man, in which it shall be 
governed by Divine Truth, 2001, 10283 end, 7843, 2373, 2374, ver. 14. 

17. "Which may go out before them and which may come in before them," denotes in every state 
of conflict and rest as to the spiritual man, because by going out and coming in, is obviously 
meant, in this place, engaging in war and resting from it, and thus denotes the conflicts of 
temptation, and rest from them; even as the Lord, when He came forth from the Father, did so 
that He might engage in conflict with the hells, and when He returned to the Father, did so by 
uniting the Human to the Divine in Himself, 3736, 1664, 84; "and which may lead them out 
and which may bring them in," denotes the same as to the natural man, because the actual 
conflict, both in the case of the Lord and of man, is on the natural plane, and man contends 
against evil from the Lord, 4572, 16614; and "that the congregation of the Lord be not as sheep
which have no shepherd," denotes that, indeed, the church cannot be governed by good alone 
without the truth which is the expression of that good, and which teaches and leads to good, 
343, 5201, ver. 14. 

18. The Lord saying to Moses, denotes that it is the dictate of Divine Good by Divine Truth, 2001,
7010, 1822; "Take you Joshua the son of Nun, a man in whom is the spirit, and lay your hands 
upon him," denotes that truth combating against evil perpetually, from an internal and not only
from an external motive, will have transferred to it the full power of truth teaching and 
leading, 8595, 7010, 10023, 10283 end. Observe here that Joshua means a saviour, and 
therefore that he represents what delivers from evil; and also that Nun means what is 
perpetual or eternal, and that therefore it is said "perpetually"; for the conflict against evil 
must be perpetual, until the state of good is realized.

19. "And set him before Eleazar the priest, and before all the congregation, and give him a charge 

in their sight," denotes that truth combating will be conjoined internally with truth 
immediately proceeding from good, and externally with truths in the natural degree, being 
there endowed with full power to govern, 8595, 9946, 7843, 33823, 2401, ver. 14. 

20. "And you shall put your honour upon him that all the congregation of the children of Israel 

may obey," denotes that such truth combating is really from the Lord alone by Divine Truth, 
and consequently is worthy of full expression in every action of the life, 7010, 10797, ver. 18. 
7843, 3654, 5368. 

21. "And he shall stand before Eleazar the priest," denotes that this truth shall also be in 

subordination to Divine Truth from Divine Good, 3136, 9946; "who shall inquire for him by 
the judgement of the Urim before the Lord," denotes that from that truth it receives revelation, 
592211, 9905; "at his word shall they go out and at his word shall they come in," denotes that 
according to it all states of conflict and rest are regulated, ver. 17; and "he and all the children 
of Israel with him, even all the congregation," denotes even as to the subordinate governing 
principles, and as to the natural and spiritual powers which are governed, 8595, 3654, 7843. 

22. Moses doing as the Lord commanded him, and taking Joshua, and setting him before Eleazar 
the priest and before all the congregation, denotes that this effect follows with him who is 
obedient, ver. 21. 

374

23. Laying his hand upon him and giving him a charge as the Lord spoke by the hand of Moses, 

denotes that the full power of inmost truth and good is manifested in truth combating, and that 
subordinate powers are obedient thereto, vers. 18-19.

DISCUSSION

In commencing the reconsideration of this chapter, we cannot but notice the wonderful way in which 
the meaning of each name in the first verse of the first section corresponds to a certain quality, and how
the order of the names is exact according to the series of the internal sense. For example, the names 
Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah, the daughters of Zelophehad, respectively, denote the 
adulterated love of truth intensely, the same less intensely, the exterior love of truth, the interior love of 
truth, and the inmost love of truth as deduced from the meaning of them; and this series indicates a 
gradual improvement in state during regeneration. Hence, therefore, we see how perfect the Word is in 
its construction, just as perfect, indeed, as is any work of the Lord in creation.

But again considering the meaning of the word "Zelophehad," and thence its correspondence, we learn 
that he represents the fear of the Lord with man at the beginning of regeneration; and as this fear varies 
with persons in different states, and according to progress, we may profitably meditate upon it. For it is 
said in Ps 111:10, "The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom; a good understanding have all they
that do thereafter; his praise endures for ever"; and from these words we learn that this fear is a holy 
fear in itself; that its quality, externally, varies, and that it indicates a capacity for receiving and 
understanding truths successively, as our section shows. And now notice the internal teaching of the 
second verse. This fear acknowledges that it has a heavenly origin; that it especially acknowledges the 
Divine Human; and that thence it has the capacity of comprehending general and primary truths; that it 
does not profane worship; and that, of itself, it is nothing but evil. Why, then, should it not have a 
capacity for the life of heaven, although it is not, at first, supplied with the knowledge of truths? How 
many thousands are there in the Lord's universal church that are of this character! And truly should not 
every one of us, in a certain sense, be of this character, when he remembers that, of himself, he is 
without truth, and without good, and that he must continually receive them from the Lord? Well, 
therefore, is it said that this fear is the beginning of wisdom. For apart from it we should be disposed to 
ascribe our life to ourselves, and thus to "die in our own sins" in that way in which all do, who refuse to
acknowledge the Divine Being. But we will turn now to the second part of this subject.

Moses, it is said, brought the case of Zelophehad's daughters before the Lord, or before Jehovah; and 
since Moses represents Divine Truth, and Jehovah signifies, specifically, Divine Good, we thence learn 
that it is good, or love, and not truth apart therefrom, that determines as to whether any one is capable 
of enjoying the heavenly inheritance. And it is very remarkable, that most people can more easily and 
naturally draw a distinction between good and evil than between truth and falsity. For who does not 
plainly see without reasoning, that goodness produces happiness, and that wickedness produces misery,
as it were, naturally? Hence, then, we clearly see the truth of the internal sense of ver. 7. The true fear 
of the Lord is grounded in goodness; and they have an inheritance in the kingdom of heaven, who are 
willing to be good, even though they may not specifically know truths. And that this is according to 
Divine Order, appears from the rest of the section, which according to the correspondences, accurately 
defines the different kinds of good. For evidently the daughters of a man here may denote, when taken, 
universally, the highest affection of truth, and thence of the good from which that truth comes, namely, 
celestial good, or love to the Lord; his brethren may signify mutual charity, or love, to the neighbour, 
which is spiritual love; his father's brethren may represent a more remote degree of food peculiar to the 

375

inmost good of the ultimate heaven, which may be called natural good from the Lord, and his nearest 
kinsman, after that, may properly stand for the external good of the ultimate heaven, which may be 
called simple obedience to truth because the Lord so commands in His Word. And hence, now, we may 
see how it is that four kinds of good are here specified. It is in order that all kinds of good may be 
involved, and thence all kinds of truth; for the heavenly life consists of good and truth conjoined, and 
by no means of the former without the latter. And, moreover, the object of regeneration, in each case, is
to produce a heavenly form of good and truth in equality, and thus, too, an internal and an external state
in perfect harmony. This, then, is the meaning of the law, spiritually, which is given in the second 
section as a general law belonging to all who are regenerated. There is a place in heaven for every 
person who is willing to receive good from the Lord by that rejection of the selfish life which is 
expressed in the act of dying to sin and living to righteousness. And now it will be observed that, in the 
literal sense, there is no particular connection between the third section and the second; but some 
connection appears in the internal sense, because whereas every one who is in good from the Lord has 
an opportunity of being saved, yet those who are only externally in good, and not internally at the same
time, cannot be saved. And this is what is represented by Moses not being permitted to enter the 
promised land, but only being allowed to see it. For the lawgiver who was the head of the Israelitish 
nation, here represented that nation which was in worship merely external without an internal principle,
and whose religion, therefore, was merely selfish, and thus it could be a representative of a church 
without really constituting a church; and it is important that this should be understood, and also that no 
one whose worship is of such a character, to whatever church he may outwardly belong, can enter into 
the kingdom of heaven, while yet every one who is in good, as the previous section shows, can do so. 
Let the man of the true Christian Church, therefore, which is a Spiritual Church, carefully note the 
difference between the Israelitish and Jewish dispensation, and the Christian dispensation, and also 
carefully avoid in himself any tendency to worship the Lord simply on selfish grounds, and not for the 
sake of the goodness and the truth that constitute the Lord, proceed from Him, and make heaven in the 
human soul. And, moreover, one other point in connection with this particular subject must be 
considered. It does not necessarily follow that, because the Israelites, as a whole, were only in external 
worship, there were no good people and, therefore, no regenerated people among them. For history 
shows the contrary; and we may justly infer that among the patriarchs, prophets, and apostles of the 
Lord, as well as among the Israelites generally there were many who were saved, and also that this was 
the case, for example, with Abraham, with Moses, with Aaron, with Samuel, and with Isaiah. But, of 
course, this cannot be positively asserted of any of the persons here mentioned by name, since there is 
not sufficient evidence available to prove it. We proceed now, however, to consider the rest of the 
chapter.

And here, indeed, first speaking generally, who does not see that no one can come into a state of good, 
and thus form a part of the heavenly kingdom, who does not overcome evil by the power of the Lord 
continually given to him? All persons, therefore, who are regenerated, may be said to be represented by
Joshua, as well as it may be said, that by Joshua in the supreme sense is represented the Lord Himself 
in His accomplishment of the work of Redemption. But the particulars also are interesting. For "Moses 
speaking to the Lord," it is said, denotes that it is the thought of the spiritual man from Divine Good. 
See 2271. And the reason why this speaking to the Lord is still from the Lord, is because the power of 
true thought is from the Lord by the principle of good. We admit that this seems a little contradictory, 
but still it is correct, because every man is required to speak and to act as from himself; and if he does 
not do this, he cannot have conjunction with the Lord. And this is a fact so important that we require to 
think of it constantly.

376

And how really important, too, are the spiritual contents of the next verses, which might, of course, be 
elaborated very much. For we cannot do without the truth with which we must resist evil; we must 
engage in the conflict; we must overcome as the Lord overcame; we must acknowledge our Leader; 
and we must do our own part, while, at the same time, we depend upon the Lord as the Good Shepherd 
who tenderly cares for His sheep. And we see just here, that because Divine Truth flows into the good, 
or charity, that is in us, and not into the truth merely, therefore we can fight from our good by means of 
our truth, and not at all from any selfish principle. And so, in this place, there is involved the great 
principle of non-resistance to evil (Matt 5:39) in perfect harmony with a determined resistance. And we
must remember here, that it is good, or the internal principle, that gives its quality to truth combating, 
and makes this spiritual warfare so different from merely natural warfare. And here again, we see how 
it is good that reconciles man to the Lord by truth, and results in an eternal victory, and in an eternal 
rest. And now, indeed, we have only to read over the series of the internal sense, as formed from the 
correspondences, in the remainder of the chapter to realize some of the wonderful interior truths that 
have relation to the conflicts of temptation through which we must all pass. For it is the truth that we 
have actually acquired by instruction that afterwards becomes truth combating, vers. 18-20. And that it 
is so, we know from experience, when, in a real state of conflict, some truth of the Word, which we had
previously learned, comes, as it were, unbidden, suddenly to our assistance, and then we conquer, 
according to the teaching of the Lord, where He says, "And when they lead you to judgement, and 
deliver you up, be not anxious beforehand what you shall speak; but whatever shall be given you in that
same hour, that speak you; for it is not you that speak, but the Holy Ghost" (Mark 13:11). And, finally, 
we learn that the change of state, namely, from one of instruction to one of conflict, is absolutely 
necessary, and that this is represented by the obedience of Moses. For we may be sure that no state of 
real regeneration is the result of instruction and the Divine operation alone, but is only consummated 
when there is the obedience springing from both, which ensures and confirms their full and permanent 
conjunction.

Numbers Chapter 28

SUMMARY OF THE SPIRITUAL SENSE

1. Revelation and thence perception concerning the worship of the Lord generally through the 
reception of innocence from Him in every state of brightness and in every state of obscurity 
throughout the course of regeneration, vers. 1-8. 

2. Concerning this worship from a state of love and charity, in addition to the general state, vers. 

9-10. 

3. Also concerning worship from a state of faith conjoined with charity which is in greater 

fullness, and is yet implied and involved in the general state, vers. 11-15. 

4. The first general state of the regeneration of man and worship therein is described, it being 
also involved in the most general state, and having reference to his deliverance from evil by 
the work of redemption through the assumption of the Human by the Lord, vers. 16-25. 

5. Concerning the second general state of the regeneration of man, which is that of the 

implantation of truth in good, and his worship of the Lord in that state, which is also involved 
in the most general state, vers. 26-31. 

THE CONTENTS OF EACH VERSE

1. And the LORD spoke to Moses, 

1. There is revelation from the Lord by Divine Truth 

saying, 

giving the perception, 

2. Command the children of Israel, and 

say to them, My oblation, my food 
for my offerings made by fire, of a 
sweet savour to me, shall you 
observe to offer to me in their due 
season. 

2. That there is influx from the Lord with the man of 
the Spiritual Church, and thence thoughts with 
him, that the Lord must be worshiped by the 
acknowledgement that all good is from Him; that 
worship is to be from pure love; that it is grateful 
and well pleasing to the Lord, because it is the 
reciprocation of His love; and that it will be 
according to the varying states of the man of the 
church. 

3. And you shall say to them, This is 

3. And further there is perception, that the 

the offering made by fire which you 
shall offer to the LORD; he-lambs of 
the first year without blemish, two 
day by day, for a continual burnt 
offering. 

acknowledgement that all the good of love is from 
the Lord, involves also the acknowledgement that 
all the good of innocence is from Him; that this 
gives conjunction with the Lord, that it is purified 
from all evil; that it is embodied in inmost truth; 
that it is complete and full; and that it is 
continually received. 

378

4. The one lamb shall you offer in the 

4. Also that his innocence is received first in a state 

morning, and the other lamb shall 
you offer at even. 

5. And the tenth part of an ephah of 
fine flour for a meal offering, 
mingled with the fourth part of an 
hin of beaten oil. 

6.

It is a continual burnt offering, 
which was ordained in mount Sinai 
for a sweet savour, an offering made 
by fire to the LORD. 

of brightness, and secondly in a state of obscurity; 

5. That it is accompanied by spiritual good as much 
as is sufficient for conjunction and derived from 
celestial good in the middle degree of the mind; 

6. And is wholly and perpetually ascribed to the Lord
according to the laws of Divine Order made 
known to the man of the church even in his state of
obscurity when truths were deficient with him; 
worship thus being grateful and acceptable to the 
Lord, because proceeding from pure love; 

7. And the drink offering thereof shall 
be the fourth part of an hin for one 
lamb: in the holy place shall you 
pour out a drink offering of strong 
drink to the LORD. 

7. That it is also accompanied by spiritual truth as 

much as is sufficient for conjunction; and that such
truth is to be conjoined with good in the external 
man in a holy state of worship, by influx; and that 
it shall be both external and internal. 

8. And the other lamb shall you offer at
even: as the meal offering of the 
morning, and as the drink offering 
thereof, you shall offer it, an offering
made by fire, of a sweet savour to 
the LORD. 

8. And that this innocence is received in every state 
of obscurity, being accompanied as in states of 
brightness with celestial-spiritual good and truth; 
and is then also embodied in worship which is 
grateful and acceptable to the Lord because from 
pure love. 

9. And on the Sabbath day two he-

lambs of the first year without 
blemish, and two tenth parts of an 
ephah of fine flour for a meal 
offering, mingled with oil, and the 
drink offering thereof: 

conflict, when good is predominant and there is 
rest and peace, the reception of the inmost good of 
innocence from the Lord giving conjunction is 
intensified, since it includes the realization of a 
state of purification and fullness of worship as to

spiritual truth;

Sabbath, beside the continual burnt 
offering, and the drink offering 
thereof.

reception of that good generally in the course of 
regeneration. 

11. And in every new state of faith there is 

consecration to the Lord, and conjunction with 
him as to the natural affections; as to spiritual 
affections; and as to holy celestial affections 
received from Him in innocence, with purification,

379

12. And three tenth parts of an ephah of 
fine flour for a meal offering, 
mingled with oil, for each bullock; 
and two tenth parts of fine flour for a
meal offering, mingled with oil, for 
the one ram; 

12. Every natural affection being the ultimate, and 

therefore involving fullness of conjunction with 
spiritual and celestial affections; and every 
spiritual affection involving a less degree of 
conjunction, because not in ultimates, with 
celestial good external and internal: 

13. And a several tenth part of fine flour 
mingled with oil for a meal offering 
to every lamb; for a burnt offering of
a sweet savour, an offering made by 
fire to the LORD. 

14. And their drink offerings shall be 

half an hin of wine for a bullock, and
the third part of an hin for the ram, 
and the fourth part of an hin for a 
lamb: this is the burnt offering of 
every month throughout the months 
of the year. 

13. And every celestial affection involving the least 
degree of conjunction with the Lord, as to the 
reception of celestial truth and good from Him 
immediately, because the least in ultimates; the 
whole being fully consecrated to the Lord from 
pure love, and being acceptable to Him on account
of reciprocation in worship. 

14. In like manner also, in every new state of faith, the
reception of truths in the natural degree is in the 
greatest proportion; in the spiritual degree in less 
proportion; and in the celestial degree in the least 
proportion. And thus the Lord is acknowledged 
and worshiped in every state of faith generally, and
particularly as the giver of every good affection, 
and of every true thought, 

15. And one he-goat for a sin offering to

acknowledged and worshiped in every state as 
man's redeemer and saviour from sin, because 
purification from sin is the inevitable result of 
regeneration, and follows regeneration in every 
stage thereof. 

16. And in the first month, on the

of the regeneration of man commence, is 
redemption by the Lord from the absolute 
dominion of evil, and the reception of spiritual life
from Him through the assumption of the Human in
the world and its glorification. 

17. And on the fifteenth day of this 

17. And the first general operation of the Lord with

shall unleavened bread be eaten. 

man in his new state, is purification from falsities, 
and the successive appropriation of good 
according to the state, in the course of 
regeneration. 

18. In the first day shall be an holy 

convocation; you shall do no servile 
work: 

18. For even the first state of the reception of good is a
holy state representing heaven, and involving a 
rearrangement of truth and good with man; and it 
is also a state of rest from spiritual conflict. 

380

19. But you shall offer an offering made 
by fire, a burnt offering to the LORD; 
two young bullocks, and one ram, 
and seven he-lambs of the first year: 
they shall be to you without blemish:

20. And their meal offering, fine flour 
mingled with oil; three tenth parts 
shall you offer for a bullock, and two
tenth parts for the ram; 

21. A several tenth part shall you offer 
for every lamb of the seven lambs; 

22. And one he-goat for a sin offering, to

make atonement for you. 

19. And in it the Lord is acknowledged to be the 

source of all good by worship and consecration to 
His service from pure love, involving conjunction 
as to good natural affections, as to spiritual 
affection, and as to celestial affection, complete, 
and pure, and holy. 

20. Also therein the Lord is acknowledged as the 

source of all spiritual good derived from celestial, 
to be finally manifested in the natural man in 
fullness, but previously in the spiritual man in a 
less degree, 

21. And in the celestial man in the least degree, yet 

still holy and pure; 

22. For in every case the remission of evil by means of
truths, and reconciliation of the external man with 
the internal takes place, 

23. You shall offer these beside the burnt
offering of the morning, which is for 
a continual burnt offering. 

23. In addition to the consecration of the internal man 
by the sincere acknowledgement that all life is 
received from the Lord continually. 

24. After this manner you shall offer 

daily, for seven days, the food of the 
offering made by fire, of a sweet 
savour to the LORD: it shall be 
offered beside the continual burnt 
offering, and the drink offering 
thereof. 

25. And on the seventh day you shall 

have an holy convocation; you shall 
do no servile work. 

26. Also in the day of the firstfruits, 

when you offer a new meal offering 
to the LORD in your feast of weeks, 
you shall have an holy 
con-.vocation; you shall do no 
servile work: 

24. And purification, and the appropriation of good, 
by the sincere acknowledgement that life is 
continually received from the Lord, must be 
perpetual throughout the course of regeneration; 
implying the continual reception of the good of 
truth, from pure love, which is grateful and 
acceptable to the Lord on account of reciprocation;
and involving a specific as well as a general state 
of worship. 

25. And thus the completion of regeneration is full and
perfect reception of the heavenly life in which all 
truths are arranged under good in their order with 
every one; and in which all conflict with evil 
ceases. 

26. But in the second general state of man when truth 
is implanted in good, and when therefore there is a
new and increasing acknowledgement of the Lord,
and of the reception of spiritual and celestial life 
from Him, truths are still more perfectly arranged 
into heavenly order; and the state of freedom from 
spiritual conflict is still more advanced. 

381

27. But you shall offer a burnt offering 
for a sweet savour to the LORD; two 
young bullocks, one ram, seven he-
lambs of the first year; 

27. And consequently holy worship from love is also 
more perfect, being more grateful and acceptable 
to the Lord; and this as to the natural affections, as 
to the spiritual affections, and as to celestial 
affections in the good of innocence, having 
conjunction with the Lord, and being in proportion
full. 

28. And their meal offering, fine flour 
mingled with oil, three tenth parts 
for each bullock, two tenth parts for 
the one ram, 

28. For thus also the reception of spiritual and celestial
good is greater in degree, when it affects the 
natural man as well as the spiritual and celestial; 
less when it only affects the spiritual and celestial; 

29. A several tenth part for every lamb 

29. And least of all when it affects the celestial only. 

of the seven lambs; 

30. One he-goat, to make atonement for 

you. 

31. Beside the continual burnt offering, 

and the meal offering thereof, you 
shall offer them (they shall be to you
without blemish), and their drink 
offerings.

such truth is to be conjoined with good in the external man in a holy state of worship, by 
influx, and that it shall be both external and internal, 2190, 65025, 3728. And it is said "both

the reception of truths for the natural degree is in the greatest proportion; in the spiritual 
degree in less proportion; and in the celestial degree in the least proportion; or in other words, 
the truth conjoined with good in the ultimate, by application to the daily life, is most powerful 
and effective; the truth conjoined with good in the spiritual and celestial degrees only is less 
powerful and effective; and the truth conjoined with good only in the inmost or celestial

DISCUSSION

As the subject of this chapter is the same generally as that of Lev. xxiii., already considered, of course 
the internal sense is generally the same; and the commentary on that chapter, with its interpretation and 
explanation, may, therefore, usefully be consulted here. But the point of the first section is worship 
from the good of innocence in every state of brightness and every state of obscurity during 
regeneration, and indeed after regeneration. For who that is regenerated can cease to worship the Lord. 
But what is it to worship the Lord from the good of innocence which is represented so appropriately by 
the lamb? It is to worship Him from the inmost principle of good or love; and that this may be done by 
every one in every state of regeneration, is signified by the offering of a he-lamb every morning and 
every evening in the Israelitish and Jewish church. And this innocence consists in the heart-felt 
acknowledgement that all good is from the Lord, and consequently that man of himself is not in any 
good; also it is represented beautifully in the innocence of little children, which, although it is the 
innocence of ignorance, may become in the regenerated man the innocence of wisdom. And he who is 
in the latter innocence knows by experience that without the Lord he can do nothing; and the more 
knowledge he gains and applies to the uses of life, because it is from the Lord, the more conscious does
he become of his dependence upon Him, and that he is for ever in the safe-keeping of one who will 
never leave him nor forsake him. In short, the nearer any one approaches to the love which constitutes 
the Lord Himself, the more innocent will he become; for the Lord is essential innocence; and because 
innocence is the removal of all evil more and more, therefore the Lord is called the Lamb of God taking
away the sin of the world (John 1:29). Hence now we may see what is really meant spiritually by the 
offering of a lamb every morning and every evening. For whatever may be the state of any worshiper 
externally, if his worship of the Lord is sincere, the innocence of wisdom is its inmost principle, and 
will be fully manifested outwardly in his angelic life. And hence, too, we may see how the lamb is not 
only the representative of innocence itself, which is the inmost principle of all good, but also especially
of the highest kind of good which is called celestial, and distinguishes the angels of the third heaven, 
who are more in innocence than any others.

And if we notice now what accompanies this offering, and is called a meal offering, we also learn that 
spiritual good or charity is derived from this highest good and is conjoined with it; while proceeding a 
step further, and noting what is said of the drink offering, we also perceive that all truth is thence 

386

derived, and that it is powerful just in proportion as the holy principle of good is manifested in it, which
is meant by the strong drink poured out to the Lord.

But coming to the second section, we have to observe that throughout regeneration there are recurring 
states of rest and peace, denoted by the Sabbath; and that then the reception of the good of innocence 
from the Lord is intensified, and gives conjunction with Him; since it includes the realization of a state 
of purification and fullness of worship, as to celestial good, as to spiritual good, and as to spiritual 
truth; as well as the sufficiency which appertains to that good generally in the course of regeneration. 
And it is indeed a blessed thing for man that, ever and anon, he has such experiences; for therein he, as 
it were, stores up strength for future conflicts and for future victories, and also has a foretaste of the 
eternal state of rest from temptations in heaven itself which is indeed an eternal Sabbath, and is also 
represented by the Jewish Sabbath, as well as in a more spiritual way by the Christian Sabbath. The 
point, however, here to be particularly noted is the difference in the arrangement here and in Leviticus. 
For there the general state upon which all others depend is denoted by the six days of labour combined 
with the Sabbath as a day of rest, whereas in this account it is the daily morning and evening sacrifice 
that represents the general state. And that is why it is here said that the recurring Sabbath state is in 
addition to the reception of good generally, and is an intensification of it. Now when we consider these 
states, and how true they are to human experience, we cannot but be convinced also of the great use of 
the Christian Sabbath as a day of instruction in Divine things; as an incentive to a good and holy life; as
a manifestation of the effect of that life; and above all as an expression of the worship of the Lord 
involving all these things together. Nor need we be astonished that there are such recurring seasons of 
Divine Worship even in the heavens, with both the spiritual and celestial orders of angels according to 
the following clear and forcible statement:

"Divine worship in the heavens is not unlike that on earth as to externals, but it differs as to internals. In
the heavens, as on earth, there are doctrines, preachings, and temples. The doctrines agree as to 
essentials, but are of more interior wisdom in the higher heavens than in the lower. The preachings are 
according to the doctrines; and as they have houses and palaces (HH 183-190), so they have temples in 
which there is preaching. Such things exist in heaven because angels are continually being perfected in 
wisdom and love; for they have understanding and will equally as men, and the understanding is such 
that it may be continually perfected, and in like manner the will; the understanding by truths which are 
of intelligence, and the will by the goods which are of love" (HH 221). And, moreover, that there are 
temples for worship both among the celestial and spiritual angels may be seen from HH 223. But, 
however, "Divine worship itself, in the heavens, does not consist in frequenting temples, and hearing 
sermons; but in a life of love, charity, and faith, according to doctrines" (HH 222).

The third section in the internal sense, describes that state of the regeneration of man subordinate to the
general state which may be called a preparatory state when it precedes the Sabbath state, or a state of 
greater fullness when it follows it, and which is represented by the sacrifices offered at the beginning of
each month. For as the sun corresponds to a state of love, so the moon corresponds to a state of faith 
derived from love or leading to it. But this particular festival is not described in Leviticus in connection
with the others, and indeed what we have in this chapter is the only description of it given in the 
Pentateuch. And a consideration of its sacrifices shows that it denotes here a state of faith conjoined 
with charity, for faith separated from charity is not a true faith. Observe therefore first, that love, or 
charity, which is properly represented by the animals offered, is of a threefold quality, according to the 
degree of the mind in which it is manifested. For in the natural degree it appears as natural good; in the 
spiritual degree as spiritual good; and in the celestial degree as celestial good, and that, in fact, all these
kinds of good co-exist with him who is in a true faith, increasing in intensity as regeneration proceeds. 

387

The reason is because, with every one, faith at first is not conjoined consciously with love in the natural
degree, or in the spiritual degree, but only in the celestial or inmost degree of his life, and therefore 
love is in the least proportion with him in that state, which is denoted by the proportion of fine flour in 
the meal offering being the least for a lamb. But when, by continual persistence in obediences to the 
truths of faith, the conjunction of faith with charity descends, and is manifested also in the spiritual 
degree of the mind as well as in the celestial, then charity is in greater proportion with man, which is 
signified by the quantity of fine flour being greater for a ram than for a lamb. And lastly, when the 
conjunction of faith with charity still further descends, through obedience to the truth combined with 
the love thereof, and is manifested in the natural degree of the mind, then is love or charity with man in
the greatest proportion, which is represented by the quantity of fine flour being greater for a bullock 
than for a ram or a lamb. And it is evident that this is a true description of regeneration, because when 
love and charity are fully manifested in all the degrees of man's life together, and are conjoined with the
truths of faith, then the process is completed, and is accompanied by a full removal of evil and error 
which is denoted by the offering of a he-goat as a sin offering, this removal being gradually effected by 
the Lord with man throughout the whole course of his experience, making it possible that there should 
be this descent of love and charity and natural good. For unless there is repentance, or the actual 
removal of evil with each of us, there cannot be any realization of good, and therefore of the 
conjunction of good with truth and of truth with good.

But now there follows in the last two sections a description of the first and second general and 
subordinate states of man's regeneration, just as in Leviticus, with the exception that here there is an 
account of the offerings to be made, which are not mentioned there, and which are exactly the same as 
the monthly offering in both cases, so that the explanation just above given is applicable also in these 
places and therefore need not be repeated. On the other hand, there is, in Leviticus, an account of some 
sacrifices not given in this chapter, and therefore it is evident that the difference, in this respect, 
between the two chapters, is on account of the difference in the series of the internal sense. In each 
case, however, it will, we think, be found that the series is perfect and that the continuity of the general 
subject is sustained. And therefore we may here remember that, wherever in the literal sense there are 
repetitions of what has been before stated, so that there is necessarily a similar repetition in the internal 
sense, yet the different connections under which these repetitions occur necessarily, also, involves 
something new and interesting in the internal sense. For it is certain that there are no needless 
repetitions in the Word of the Lord, in which every single correspondential expression is used with the 
greatest exactitude, so that the spiritual sense may be perfect and harmonious throughout. This then 
will be sufficient as a commentary on the present chapter, the subject of which is continued and 
completed with the next.

Numbers Chapter 29

SUMMARY OF THE SPIRITUAL SENSE

1. There is revelation from the Lord by Divine Truth, following the implantation of truth in good,

and worship thence, which is described, vers. 1-6. 

2. Also there is complete purification from evil accompanied by a similar state of worship, vers. 

7-11. 

3. And this is succeeded by the third general stale of the regeneration of man, which is the 

implantation of good, the appropriate worship in which state is described, vers. 12-40. 

4. But this involves a description of the successive states of regeneration, showing first the 

opposition of the natural man to the spiritual, and worship in that state, vers. 12-16; secondly, 
the decrease of this opposition, when truths are full and efficient, vers. 17-19; thirdly, its 
greater decrease when this fullness and efficiency affect the external as well as the internal 
man, vers. 20-22; fourthly, its continued decrease when truths are implanted in good, vers, 23-
25; fifthly, that the decrease is greater still \vhen the external as well as the internal man is thus
affected, vers. 26-28; sixthly, a further decrease of the opposition of the natural man takes 
place when good is implanted there, vers. 29—31; seventhly, that it ceases altogether when 
good is implanted in the external as well as the internal man there, 32-34; and eighthly, that a 
new and perfect state succeeds in which there is a complete arrangement of truths and a full 
appropriation of good to eternity, vers. 35-40. 

THE CONTENTS OF EACH VERSE

1. And in the seventh month, on the 

first day of the month, you shall have
an holy convocation; you shall do no
servile work: it is a day of blowing 
of trumpets to you. 

2. And you shall offer a burnt offering 
for a sweet savour to the LORD; one 
young bullock, one ram, seven he-
lambs of the first year without 
blemish: 

1. And when the state of faith with the man of the 
church is full and holy, and love begins to he 
manifested, another rearrangement of truths takes 
place, and another season of spiritual rest is 
experienced; for then there is further revelation of 
Divine Truth from the Lord 

2. Then too, the Lord is acknowledged by worship 
from the holy principle of love which is grateful 
and acceptable to Him, as to innocence in the 
natural affections, in the spiritual affections, and in
the celestial affections, which are holy, which are 
embodied or expressed in truths, which are 
purified from sin, and which are perfect according 
to the state; 

389

3. And their meal offering, fine flour 
mingled with oil, three tenth parts 
for the bullock, two tenth parts for 
the ram, 

3. With the acknowledgement also that all spiritual 
good is derived from and conjoined with celestial 
good, in the greatest degree when it affects the 
natural man; in a less degree when it affects the 
spiritual man and the celestial man only; 

4. And one tenth part for every lamb of 

4. And in the least degree when it only affects the 

the seven lambs; 

celestial man; 

5. And one he-goat for a sin offering, to

make atonement for you: 

5. Accompanied by the increasing removal of evil by
means of truths, and thus by the closer conjunction
of the external man with the internal, 

6.

6. Beside the burnt offering of the new 
moon, and the meal offering thereof, 
and the continual burnt offering and 
the meal offering thereof, and their 
drink offerings, according to their 
ordinance, for a sweet savour, an 
offering made by fire to the LORD. 

In addition to the sincere worship of the Lord from
the previous new state of faith, with its appropriate
acknowledgement of the due reception of spiritual 
good; and in addition to the perpetual worship of 
the Lord in every state of brightness and obscurity,
and of the reception of spiritual truths according to
Divine Order; all this being grateful and 
acceptable to the Lord on account of reciprocation 
in worship from pure love. 

7. And on the tenth day of this seventh 
month you shall have an holy 
convocation; and you shall afflict 
your souls; you shall do no manner 
of work: 

7. And further, when the state of faith with the man 
of the church is thus full and holy, and when, 
consequently, remains are implanted, the 
rearrangement of truths still continues, and there is
complete purification from evil in the course of 
temptation, followed by a renewed state of 
spiritual rest and peace; 

8. But you shall offer a burnt offering 
to the LORD for a sweet savour; one 
young bullock, one ram, seven he-
lambs of the first year; they shall be 
to you without blemish: 

8. And consequently a renewed state of the worship 

of the Lord from pure love, involving again the 
reception of the good of innocence in the natural, 
in the spiritual, and in the celestial degrees of the 
mind, and this too with purification accordingly; 

9. And their meal offering, fine flour 
mingled with oil, three tenth parts 
for the bullock, two tenth parts for 
the one ram, 

9. And also, the reception of spiritual good conjoined
with celestial, in the greatest proportion when the 
natural man co-operates; in less proportion when 
only the spiritual and celestial co-operate; 

10. A several tenth part for every lamb 

10. And in the lease proportion when only the celestial

of the seven lambs: 

co-operates with the Lord; 

390

11. One he-goat for a sin offering; 

11. There being at the same time the 

beside the sin offering of atonement, 
and the continual burnt offering, and 
the meal offering thereof, and their 
drink offerings. 

acknowledgement that evil is removed by the 
Lord, specifically as well as generally, and that all 
worship from pure love is from the Lord, as well 
as the reception of all spiritual good conjoined 
with celestial, and of all spiritual truth. 

12. And on the fifteenth day of the 

12. And again, when the state of the implantation of 

seventh month you shall have an 
holy convocation; you shall do no 
servile work, and you shall keep a 
feast to the LORD seven days: 

13. And you shall offer a burnt offering, 
an offering made by fire, of a sweet 
savour to the LORD; thirteen young 
bullocks, two rams, fourteen he-
lambs of the first year; they shall be 
without blemish: 

truth is completed, and the state of the 
implantation of good commences, there is still 
another rearrangement of truths, a still more 
improved state of spiritual rest and peace, and a 
still greater appropriation of good from the Lord in
all holiness and fullness; 

13. And consequently it is now most intensely 

acknowledged that all love and all holy worship 
from pure love are from the Lord, and are grateful 
and acceptable to Him, as to the natural affections,
which in their first state are fully opposed to the 
spiritual after states of instruction are completed; 
as to the spiritual affections in which now truth 
and good are fully conjoined; and as to the 
celestial affections in fullness and purified from 
evil, in which now also truth and good are fully 
conjoined. 

14. And their meal offering, fine flour 
mingled with oil, three tenth parts 
for every bullock of the thirteen 
bullocks, two tenth parts for each 
ram of the two rams, 

14. And in this state also is the reception of spiritual 
good from celestial manifested in the greatest 
degree, when it is with the good of innocence in 
the natural man; in a less degree when with that 
good in the spiritual and celestial man only: 

15. And a several tenth part for every 
lamb of the fourteen lambs: 

16. And one he-goat for a sin offering; 
beside the continual burnt offering, 
the meal offering thereof, and the 
drink offering thereof. 

15. And in the least degree when it is in the celestial 

man only; 

16. Besides which, evil is now more than ever fully 
removed; worship from pure love is now more 
than ever powerful; and the reception of spiritual 
good and truth in every state is now more than 
ever complete. 

391

17. And on the second day you shall 
offer twelve young bullocks, two 
rams, fourteen he-lambs of the first 
year without blemish: 

18. And their meal offering and their 

drink offerings for the bullocks, for 
the rams, and for the lambs, 
according to their number, after the 
ordinance: 

19. And one he-goat for a sin offering; 
beside the continual burnt offering, 
and the meal offering thereof, and 
their drink offerings. 

17. But this perfect state involves not only all previous

states of the natural man, because it involves the 
first, but also each state in its order, and therefore 
that, in the second state, the natural man had not so
much power against the spiritual man, because 
truths were full and efficient, and because the 
conjunction of truth with good was potentially full 
in the spiritual and celestial degrees; 

18. With the like reception of spiritual good and truth 
conjoined with celestial in each degree of the mind
according to its quality, and according to Divine 
Law. 

19. As well as with the like remission of evil 

according to the state, and with the worship of the 
Lord from pure love in every state by the adequate
reception and acknowledgement of spiritual good 
and truth from the Lord. 

20. And on the third day eleven 

20. This perfect state also involves that, in the third 

bullocks, two rams, fourteen he-
lambs of the first year without 
blemish; 

21. And their meal offering and their 

drink offerings for the bullocks, for 
the rams, and for the lambs, 
according to their number, after the 
ordinance: 

22. And one he-goat for a sin offering; 
beside the continual burnt offering, 
and the meal offering thereof, and 
the drink offering thereof. 

stage, the natural man had still less power against 
the spiritual man because truths were more 
powerful, not only in the internal of the natural 
degree, but also in its external from a principle of 
obedience, and again because the conjunction of 
truth with good was potentially full in the spiritual 
and celestial degrees; 

21. With the like reception of spiritual good and truth 
conjoined with celestial in each degree of the 
mind, according to its quality, and according to 
Divine Law; 

22. As well as with the like remission of evil 

according to the state, and with the worship of the 
Lord from pure love, in every state, by the 
adequate reception and acknowledgement of 
spiritual good and truth from the Lord. 

392

23. And on the fourth day ten bullocks, 
two rams, fourteen he-lambs of the 
first year without blemish: 

23. This perfect state also involves that, in the fourth 
stage of conflict, the natural man had still less 
power against the spiritual, because then truths 
were implanted in good there, and because the 
conjunction of truth with good was again 
potentially full in the spiritual and celestial 
degrees; 

24. Their meal offering and their drink 

offerings for the bullocks, for the 
rams, and for the lambs, according to
their number, after the ordinance: 

24. With the like reception of spiritual good and truth 
conjoined with celestial in each degree of the mind
according to its quality, and according to Divine 
Law; 

25. And one he-goat for a sin offering; 
beside the continual burnt offering, 
the meal offering thereof, and the 
drink offering thereof. 

26. And on the fifth day nine bullocks, 
two rams, fourteen he-lambs of the 
first year without blemish: 

27. And their meal offering and their 

drink offerings for the bullocks, for 
the rams, and for the lambs, 
according to their number, after the 
ordinance: 

28. And one he-goat for a sin offering; 
beside the continual burnt offering, 
and the meal offering thereof, and 
the drink offering thereof. 

29. And on the sixth day eight bullocks, 
two rams, fourteen he-lambs of the 
first year without blemish: 

25. As well as with the like remission of evil 

according to the state, and with the worship of the 
Lord from pure love in every state by the adequate
reception and acknowledgement of spiritual good 
and truth from the Lord. 

26. This perfect state also involves that, in the fifth 
stage of conflict, the natural man had still less 
power against the spiritual, because then truths 
were implanted in good, not only in the internal of 
the natural degree, but also in the external, from a 
sincere affection for truth, and because the 
conjunction of truth with good was again 
potentially full in the spiritual and celestial 
degrees; 

27. With the like reception of spiritual good and truth 
conjoined with celestial in each degree of the 
mind, according to its quality and according to 
Divine Law; 

28. As well as with the like remission of evil 

according to the state, and with the worship of the 
Lord from pure love in every state by the adequate
reception and acknowledgement of spiritual good 
and truth from the Lord. 

29. This perfect state also involves that, in the sixth 

stage of conflict, the natural man had still less 
power against the spiritual, because then good was
implanted there, and because the conjunction of 
truth with good was again potentially full in the 
spiritual and celestial degrees; 

393

30. And their meal offering and their 

drink offerings for the bullocks, for 
the rams, and for the lambs, 
according to their number, after the 
ordinance: 

31. And one he-goat for a sin offering; 
beside the continual burnt offering, 
the meal offering thereof, and the 
drink offerings thereof. 

32. And on the seventh day seven 

bullocks, two rams, fourteen he-
lambs of the first year without 
blemish: 

33. And their meal offering and their 

drink offerings for the bullocks, for 
the rams, and for the lambs, 
according to their number, after the 
ordinance: 

34. And one he-goat for a sin offering; 
beside the continual burnt offering, 
the meal offering thereof, and the 
drink offering thereof. 

35. On the eighth day you shall have a 
solemn assembly: you shall do no 
servile work: 

36. But you shall offer a burnt offering, 
an offering made by fire, of a sweet 
savour to the LORD: one bullock, one
ram, seven he-lambs of the first year 
without blemish: 

30. With the like reception of spiritual good and truth 
conjoined with celestial in each degree of the 
mind, according to its quality and according to 
Divine Law; 

31. As well as with the like remission of evil 

according to the state, and with the worship of the 
Lord from pure love in every state, by the 
adequate reception and acknowledgement of 
spiritual good and truth from the Lord. 

32. And this perfect state also involves that, in the 
seventh stage, when conflict ceases, the natural 
man has no longer any power against the spiritual, 
because it is now harmonious therewith, and a 
state of rest and peace is established, not only in 
the internal of the natural degree, but also in its 
external, from a sincere affection for good, and 
because the conjunction of truth with good is now 
actually full in all the degrees of the mind; 

33. With the like reception of spiritual good and truth 
conjoined with celestial, in each degree of the 
mind, according to its quality and according to 
Divine Law; 

34. As well as with the full remission of evil according
to the state, and with the worship of the Lord from 
pure love in every state, by the full reception and 
acknowledgement of spiritual good and truth from 
the Lord in the natural degree. 

35. And in this new and perfect heavenly state there is 
complete arrangement of truths, and the full 
appropriation of good, together with the cessation 
of all spiritual conflict. 

36. And the acknowledgement of the Lord, and 

worship thence from pure love is full in every 
respect, and therefore grateful and acceptable in 
every respect, on account of reciprocation, as to 
the natural affections, as to the spiritual affections, 
and as to the celestial affections. 

394

37. Their meal offering and their drink 

offerings for the bullock, for the ram,
and for the lambs, shall be according
to their number, after the ordinance: 

37. Also as to the reception of spiritual good and truth 
conjoined with celestial in every degree of the 
mind, according to the heavenly quality of good, 
and according to the perfection of Divine Truth. 

38. And one he-goat for a sin offering; 
beside the continual burnt offering, 
and the meal offering thereof, and 
the drink offering thereof. 

38. And also as to deliverance from evil through the 

operation of the truth, besides genuine worship 
from pure love, in every state, and the reception of
spiritual good and truth in fullness in every state. 

39. These you shall offer to the LORD in 
your set feasts, beside your vows, 
and your freewill offerings, for your 
burnt offerings, and for your meal 
offerings, and for your drink 
offerings, and for your peace 
offerings. 

39. And this full acknowledgement, and worship, and 
reception of heavenly good and truth, is continual, 
or eternal; in every general state and in every 
particular state, and consequently, in every act of 
devotion to the Lord, in every act of freedom in 
worship, in every act of worship from pure love, 
and in every act of worship in which it is 
acknowledged that spiritual and celestial good and 
truth are continually received from the Lord.

power against the spiritual man because truths were full and efficient, 1335, 6, 8, 2089, 10021;
and "two rams and fourteen he-lambs of the first year without blemish," denotes because the 
conjunction of truth with good was potentially full in the spiritual and celestial degrees, ver. 
13. 

18. "And their meal offering and their drink offerings for the bullocks, for the rams, and for the 
lambs, according to their number, after the ordinance," denotes with the like reception of 
spiritual good and truth conjoined with celestial in each degree of the mind, according to its 
quality, and according to Divine Law, chap 28:12-14, 10217, 8357.

according to the state, 4169, 3400; and "beside the continual burnt offering, and the meal 
offering thereof, and their drink offerings," denotes with the worship of the Lord from pure 
love in every state, by the adequate reception and acknowledgement of spiritual good and truth
from the Lord, chap 28:3-7. 

20. "And on the third day eleven bullocks" denotes that this perfect state also involves that, in the 
third stage, the natural man had still less power against the spiritual man because truths were 
more powerful, not only in the internal of the natural degree, but also in its external from a 
principle of obedience, 9, 720, 9616, 10021; and "two rams and fourteen he-lambs of the first 
year without blemish," denotes again because the conjunction of truth with good was 
potentially full in the spiritual and celestial degrees, ver. 13.

the Lord, chap 28:3-7. 

26. "And on the fifth day nine bullocks," denotes that this perfect state also involves that in the

32. "And on the seventh day seven bullocks" denotes that this perfect state also involves that, in 
the seventh stage, when conflict ceases, the natural man has no longer any power against the 
spiritual man, because it is now harmonious therewith, and a state of rest and peace is 
established not only in the internal of the natural degree, but also in its external, from a sincere

the Spiritual Church in every state according to his needs, 7010, 3209, 3654, 2001, 5486. 

DISCUSSION

As the first section of this chapter is concerning the, feast of trumpets, by which is signified revelation 
from the Lord, the following quotation will be found useful: "In regard to revelation being either from 
perception or from speech with the angels through whom the Lord speaks, it is to be noted that those 
who are in good and thence in truth, especially those who are in the good of love to the Lord, have 
revelation from perception; whereas those who are not in good and thence in truth may indeed have 
revelations, yet not from perception, but by a living voice heard in them, thus by angels from the Lord; 
this latter revelation is external, whereas the former is internal. The angels, especially the celestial, have
revelation from perception, so also had the men of the Most Ancient Church, but hardly any one at the 
present day; whereas very many, even those who have not been in good, have had revelations from 
speech without perception, and also by visions and dreams. Such were most of the revelations of the 
prophets in the Jewish Church; they heard a voice, they saw a vision, and they dreamed a dream; but as 
they had no perception, they were merely verbal or visual revelations, without any perception of what 
they signified; for genuine perception exists through heaven from the Lord, and affects the intellectual 
spiritually, and leads it perceptibly to think as the thing really is, with an internal assent, the source of 
which it is ignorant of. It supposes that it is in it, and that it flows from the connection of things; 
whereas it is a dictate through heaven from the Lord, flowing into the interiors of the thought, 
concerning such things as are above the Natural and Sensual, that is, concerning such things as are of 
the spiritual world, or of heaven. Hence it may be manifest what it meant by revelation from 
perception. But the revelation from perception which the Lord had, Who is here represented by Joseph, 
and which is here treated of in the internal sense, was from the Divine in Himself, and thus was from 
Himself," 5121. 

Now this clear statement shows that the revelation represented by the blowing of the trumpets here 
spoken of is, in the spiritual sense, revelation from perception, such, generally speaking, as all have 
who are grounded in good through regeneration, from the Lord (John 7:17).

400

And now the particular points to be observed in connection with this feast are that the sacrifices of it 
are described which are not mentioned in Leviticus; and that they are the same exactly as those 
mentioned in the last chapter, except that only one bullock was offered instead of two. What therefore 
does this imply in the internal sense? It signifies that in states of revelation from the Lord there may not
be, necessarily, conjunction by good with Him in the natural degree, because the offering of two young 
bullocks denotes conjunction as to good natural affections, 10021, 5194, and therefore the offering of 
only one will denote no conjunction by natural good, or only preparatory conjunction thereby, since 
where there is good there is some conjunction.

The second section, however, carries our thoughts back not only to the teaching, in the spiritual sense, 
of Lev. xxiii., but also to the specific account of the ceremonies on the day of atonement, as described 
in Lev. xvi.; and the reader will naturally therefore recur to those, in considering the. account of the 
directions here given for the sacrifices, which are exactly the same as for the festival of trumpets. But it
is remarkable that there is no account of any such burnt offering in Leviticus. And yet surely it must 
form an important part of the ceremonials of that day; besides which, it is distinctly said of this 
complex burnt offering, that it is to be offered beside the sin offering of atonement, that is, beside the 
specified offerings in that chapter, just as, in the case of the other festivals, the offerings of this and the 
last chapter are additional to the ceremonials in Lev. xxiii. Now the question that arises is, why was this
addition, and what does it represent spiritually? And the answer appears clearly to be, that these new 
burnt offerings, in all the cases, are intended to denote the more genuine devotion of the heart to the 
Lord in worship as regeneration advances. For example, we are to keep the feast of the Passover and of 
Unleavened Bread, or to worship the Lord on account of our deliverance from evil, all through our 
lives, as directed in Lev 23:8; but when we pass from a state in which we are only under general 
instruction in spiritual things, to a state of successful warfare against the "foes of our own household," 
then our true worship of the Lord Becomes more decided, more earnest, more pronounced, and more 
specific, and this is represented by a more particular and detailed account of the burnt offering (Num 
28:19-23); and again when we have accomplished this warfare, and are fully entered into the heavenly 
state, we shall be in a confirmed state of true worship on account of deliverance from evil, because we 
shall be in our specific state of good conjoined with truth, as described in Deut 16:1-8, which will 
occupy our attention further on. For we may be sure we should not have had, in the Divine Word, these 
repeated and varying descriptions of the same things without a deep significance in the spiritual sense. 
And, moreover, we may here see also a positive evidence of the continuity and order of the books of 
the Pentateuch, showing that they were written as we now have them, that is, Leviticus after Genesis 
and Exodus and before Numbers, with Deuteronomy following, since what is contained in Exodus and 
in Leviticus is here referred to in Numbers, and afterwards again commented upon in Deuteronomy; 
while we can scarcely imagine that Genesis, which contains the history of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, 
and of the immigration of their posterity into Egypt, should not have been written prior to the account 
of their deliverance from Egyptian bondage. But the reason why, again, one bullock and not two 
constituted the part of the burnt offering denoting natural good, is that in worship for the removal of 
evil there is not the full conjunction with the Lord that distinguishes, for instance, full deliverance 
therefrom (chap 28:89); and also the reason why the rest of the offering was the same is because the 
higher degrees of the mind are potentially in full worship even when the natural degree is not so much 
affected. We turn now, however, to the last section, and its several subdivisions. This is concerning the 
feast of the ingathering of the harvest, also called the feast of Tabernacles, which, as we have seen, 
represents the state of the implantation of good, and thus the culmination of the life of man when he 
realizes good not only in the internal man, but also in the external, and when good therefore is fully 
appropriated (Lev 23:33-44).

401

And here again, in our chapter, we have a very particular account of the burnt offerings, which are so 
arranged as to represent the successive states of regeneration, and of the worship of the Lord therein, by
means of which the final state is reached. And we have to notice first that the offerings of each day 
were the same, except in regard to the number of bullocks. That is, the state of good with man is 
potentially the same in every state of regeneration, although it is not realized all at once in the natural 
degree on account of the opposition of evil. And what is meant by good being potentially the same is, 
that pure love to the Lord and love to the neighbour, according to the state of each person, with all the 
wisdom therein involved, are the things that have to be realized. We must all in our final heavenly state 
love the Lord and the neighbour in the highest degree possible to us; and we must attain to this state 
successively. And it should not be with any of us a mere ambition, or the thought of exceeding 
somebody else in our devotion to the Lord. For each of us has a certain capacity for usefulness, in 
heaven, from the unselfish love of use, and this is our capacity for loving the Lord and the neighbour. 
This is the great object of our life, so to speak; in this respect we are all alike; and when we have 
arrived at our journey's end we shall then be capable of developing our life to all eternity. And thus 
there will be eternal progress, and yet a fixed state. This then is the sense in which every person's 
worship of the Lord finally, that is, when good is implanted in truth with him, will be the same as that 
of every other person regenerated. We now therefore proceed to notice the steps in the process.

And the first state, or the first day's offering, after a course of instruction, is a feeling of opposition to 
the Divine life. Have we not all experienced that? A man is not naturally disposed to love the Lord, but 
on the contrary, he is opposed to such love. And, indeed, if any one does not know this to begin with he
cannot make any progress. But, then, how is he to be changed? It can only be by the operation of the 
Lord by His Holy Spirit upon the truths of the Word that he has learned; and this will bring him a little 
further, or into another day, in which he begins to be influenced by his truths, so that now there is a 
little less opposition on his part in his natural life. For truths are abundant with the regenerating man, 
and there is a little affection for good as well (ver. 17; John 3:5; Gen 1:6-8). And this leads the traveller 
on another stage, or into another day of his spiritual life, when as to his natural degree, he offers less 
opposition, also beginning actually to do the work of repentance (ver. 20; Gen 1:9-13).

But still this repentance is, in a great measure, on selfish grounds, as we all know from experience; and 
on account of this there must be a more decided advance, or another day in which the truths that have 
been received must be implanted in good, or in other words, in which the spiritual sun, which is Divine 
love, and the spiritual moon, which is faith derived from love, with the stars, which mean a greater 
delight in knowledge, now manifest themselves, and consequently the Internal of the natural man is 
affected, and the opposition of the merely natural life is weaker still (ver. 23; Gen 1:14-19). It will not 
do, however, for the religion of any one to be unselfish internally, and yet to continue to be selfish 
externally; for no person, at the same time in reality, can serve both God and Mammon. And therefore 
this implantation of truth in good must become external as well as internal, so that there may be still a 
less degree of opposition from merely natural love, and a greater degree of activity in the cultivation of 
Divine Truths, which constitutes further progress, or another day of more advanced spiritual life, which
is the fifth (ver. 26; Gen 1:20-23). Nor is this sufficient. For the implantation of truth in good is one 
thing, and the implantation of good in truth is another, since in the former a man does good only 
because he loves the truth, while in the latter he does good because it is good, and this is quite a 
different matter. But what is to make him do good for the sake of good? He can only accomplish this by
a conflict against evil. And this is really the correspondential value of the number six. For it is written, 
"Six days shall you labour and do all your work." That is, this conflict is not confined to one state of the
regenerate life, but belongs to them all, until the victory is gained. The sixth day, therefore, specifically 

402

denotes the final conflict; it is one stage more in the journey of life; and it overcomes the opposition of 
the merely natural man entirely, so that there is the implantation of good there, but to begin with, only 
as to the internal thereof (ver. 29; Gen 1:24-31).

It follows now, therefore, that there is a further advance; for there must be the implantation of good not 
only in the internal of the natural man, but also in the external; and this constitutes the state in which all
opposition from the merely natural man ceases, and in which the new natural man is completely in 
harmony with the spiritual or internal man. This, therefore, is the celestial or heavenly state, and therein
the inmost life of man is fully realized in his words and actions. But still there is one more day in the 
series, in order to denote the new state of heavenly life which is to endure for ever, and which involves 
all previous states and makes them one by virtue of the ruling love; and we may be sure that that is the 
reason why the burnt offering of that day consisted of only one bullock and one ram, and not more, as 
in the previous days; and because in this state there is now a perfect arrangement of good conjoined 
with truths, even in ultimates, therefore the expression "solemn assembly" is used, concerning which 
Lev 23:36 may be consulted with advantage; for there its specific application clearly appears.

Numbers Chapter 30

SUMMARY OF THE SPIRITUAL SENSE

1. When any one in the knowledge of the truth devotes himself to the Lord internally or 

externally by compelling himself to obedience, he must not profane the truth by acts of 
disobedience, vers. 1-2. 

2. When any one in the affection of truth in the beginning of regeneration, does the same, his 
devotion may be confirmed if it is in agreement with internal good, but not otherwise; and 
remission may follow, because ignorance or error prevents the agreement of external good 
with internal, vers. 3-5. 

3. Also if any one who is externally in truth conjoined with good does the same, similar results 

will follow, vers. 6-8. 

4. But devotion from merely selfish motives, results in the confirmation of falsity and evil, ver. 9.

5. While yet devotion from selfish motives apparently, when truth conjoined with good is 

predominant internally, may also be followed by genuine confirmation or not, vers. 10-12. 

6. For it is the state as to internal truth conjoined with good that decides, ver. 13. 

7. And therefore, generally, confirmation in good or otherwise, depends upon the state internally;
and it is the internal man that must endure temptations, and thus overcome evil, by power from
the Lord, in order that the external may come into harmony with it, vers. 14-15. 

8. All the foregoing are laws of Divine Order as to the conjunction of good and truth and as to 

the relation between the internal and external man, ver. 16. 

THE CONTENTS OF EACH VERSE

1. And Moses spoke to the heads of the
tribes of the children of Israel, 
saying, This is the thing which the 
LORD has commanded. 

2. When a man vows a vow to the 

LORD, or swears an oath to bind his 
soul with a bond, he shall not break 
his word; he shall do according to all
that proceeds out of his mouth. 

1. And now there is influx from the Lord by Divine 
Truth with the man of the Spiritual Church giving 
instruction, 

2. That when any one devotes himself to the Lord by 
willing that He may provide, or by confirming the 
truth in himself, which he has received into his 
understanding, thus compelling himself to obey 
from conscience, he must take heed not to profane 
the truth either inwardly or outwardly by any act 
of disobedience. 

404

3. Also when a woman vows a vow to 
the LORD, and binds herself by a 
bond, being in her father's house, in 
her youth; 

3. Also, when those who are in the affection of truth, 
from that affection devote themselves to the Lord 
by willing that He may provide, or by confirming 
the truth in their understandings, internally from 
conscience, as well as externally from the affection
of knowing, this being the form which truth from 
good takes in the beginning of regeneration; 

4. And her father hears her vow, and 

4. Then, if this determination of the will and 

her bond with which she has bound 
her soul, and her father holds his 
peace at her: then all her vows shall 
stand, and every bond with which 
she has bound her soul shall stand. 

understanding be in harmony with essential good 
from the Lord, this devotion and consecration, at 
first from comparatively external motives, shall be
confirmed inwardly. 

5. But if her father disallow her in the 
day that he hears; none of her vows, 
or of her bonds with which she has 
bound her soul, shall stand: and the 
LORD shall forgive her, because her 
father disallowed her. 

5. But if, on the other hand, such comparatively 

external devotion is not in harmony with essential 
good from the Lord, and this is revealed, such 
devotion is not to be confirmed inwardly, and 
remission will follow, because the vows arose 
from ignorance or mistake. 

6. And if she be married to a husband, 
while her vows are upon her, or the 
rash utterance of her lips, with which
she has bound her soul; 

6. And again if, with one in such a state, devotion be 
not only from the affection of truth, but also from 
the conjunction of truth with good, or of faith with 
charity, and yet the external man is led astray by, 
possibly, mistaking falsity for truth, 

7. And her husband hear it, and hold 
his peace at her in the day that he 
hears it: then her vows shall stand, 
and her bonds with which she has 
bound her soul shall stand. 

8. But if her husband disallow her in 

the day that he hears it; then he shall 
make void her vow which is upon 
her, and the rash utterance of her 
lips, with which she has bound her 
soul: and the LORD shall forgive her. 

7. Then, if such devotion be in harmony with the 
truth conjoined to good, it shall be confirmed 
inwardly both as to the will and as to the 
understanding. 

8. But if this be not the case, then such comparatively
external devotion shall not be confirmed inwardly, 
either as to the will or understanding, and there 
must be remission. 

9. But the vow of a widow, or of her 
that is divorced, even every thing 
with which she has bound her soul, 
shall stand against her. 

9. But devotion from merely selfish motives, either 
because truth has been rejected, or good has been 
adulterated, shall surely be followed by the 
confirmation of evil. 

10. And if she vowed in her husband's 
house, or bound her soul by a bond 
with an oath, 

10. While yet, if such devotion proceed inwardly from
truth conjoined to good, as to the will and as to the
understanding, 

405

11. And her husband heard it, and held 
his peace at her, and disallowed her 
not; then all her vows shall stand, 
and every bond with which she 
bound her soul shall stand. 

12. But if her husband made them null 
and void in the day that he heard 
them; then whatever proceeded out 
of her lips concerning her vows, or 
concerning the bond of her soul, 
shall not stand: her husband has 
made them void; and the LORD shall 
forgive her. 

11. And outwardly is in harmony with good and also 
with truth, then it shall be confirmed in the 
Judgement both as to the will and the 
understanding. 

12. Whereas if the contrary be the case, and such 

devotion is not in harmony with truth conjoined to 
good, then it shall not be confirmed in the 
Judgement either as to the will or the 
understanding because it is not from internal good,
and remission must certainly follow. 

13. Every vow, and every binding oath 
to afflict the soul, her husband may 
establish it, or her husband may 
make it void. 

13. For every act of devotion both as to the will and 
the understanding is to be confirmed or not to be 
confirmed according to the state as to internal truth
and good conjoined. 

14. But if her husband altogether hold 

his peace at her from day today; then
he establishes all her vows, or all her
bonds, which are upon her: he has 
established them, because he held his
peace at her in the day that he heard 
them. 

14. But if, in cases of devotion, the genuine ruling 
truth conjoined with good is altogether and 
continually in harmony therewith, as regeneration 
proceeds, then assuredly the external, in the 
Judgement, will be found to be confirmed in 
agreement with the internal, because this 
confirmation is the result of the harmony of truth 
with good internally which had been perceived.

void after that he has heard them; 
then he shall bear her iniquity.

contrary to internal good, then repentance and 
redemption must follow. 

16. These are the statutes, which the 

LORD commanded Moses, between a
man and his wife, between a father 
and his daughter, being in her youth, 
in her father's house.

conjunction of good and truth, and as to the 
relation between the internal and external man in 
the beginning of regeneration.

DISCUSSION

This chapter is a very interesting one, although it is so short. Almost every one knows what it is to vow 
a vow or to devote himself to a certain purpose; and it is well known, also, that vows may be made 
before the Lord, and also entirely on selfish grounds; or, again, they may be made before the Lord with 
a selfish object in view, or before Him without any selfish object in view. But at any rate, a vow is a 
sacred determination, or a fixed determination to carry out a certain purpose; and we cannot do better in
order to illustrate our subject than to quote the following passage: "Jacob vowed a vow, signifies a state
of providence. This appears from the signification of vowing a vow, as denoting in the internal sense, 
being willing that the Lord shall provide; consequently, in the supreme sense, in which the Lord is 
treated of, it denotes a state of providence. The reason is this, that in vows there is a desire and 
affection that what is willed may come to pass; thus, that the Lord may provide. Something of 
stipulation is implied, and at the same time something of a debt on the part of man, which he engages to
discharge in case he comes to possess the object of his wish; as, in the present instance, Jacob vows that
Jehovah should be to him for a God, and that the stone which he set for a pillar should be the house of 
God, and that he would tithe all that was given him, if Jehovah would keep him in the way, and give 
him bread to eat, and a garment to put on, and if he should return in peace to the house of his father. 
Hence it is evident that vows at that time were their several obligations, especially to acknowledge God
to be their God, in case He should provide for them what they desired, and also to repay Him by some 
gift, if He so provided. From these considerations it is very evident of what quality the fathers of the 
Jewish nation were, as, in this instance, Jacob, that as yet he did not acknowledge Jehovah, and that as 
yet he was undetermined in his choice, whether he should acknowledge Him or another for his God. 
This was a peculiar characteristic of that nation, even from the time of their fathers, that every one 
wanted to have his own God, and if any worshiped Jehovah, it only meant that he worshiped some god 
who was called Jehovah, and distinguished by that name, from the gods of all other nations; thus that 
their worship, even in this respect, was idolatrous, for the worship of a mere name, even the name of 
Jehovah, is nothing but idolatrous worship (see 1094); as is the case with those who call themselves 
Christians, and say they worship Christ, and yet do not live according to His precepts; these worship 
Him idolatrously, because they worship His name alone, for it is a false Christ whom they worship, 
concerning which false Christ see Matt 24:23-24," 3723. 

Hence, now, we see that vows may be entered upon from different motives, and that when they are 
religious vows, they may vary in quality, as the whole of our chapter shows, and especially as its 
spiritual sense shows. Let us, then, think about it, as it is stated in series, according to the 
correspondences.

The first section states a general law. And it teaches that a determination to serve the Lord, from some 
knowledge of Him, is to be fully carried out, because otherwise the knowledge, or the truth received is 
profaned; and we know, from our former studies, that the profanation of the truth is very dangerous, 
and of a varied character. But, all the same, there is a point in the life of every person in which he must 
freely choose to devote himself to the Lord, or not. For a vow, although it is a binding, carries with it 
the idea of free determination. None of us, however, in the beginning, love to be obedient, and we all 
feel the necessity of compelling ourselves to be so, and thus we see what a vow, spiritually, is. And 
then, again, we observe that this vow affects both the will and the intellect. We will that the Lord may 
provide, that is, we decide to give up our own will; and also we determine to obey the truth we have 
learned, which is, spiritually to bind ourselves by an oath, or in other words to compel ourselves to 
obey the truth, whether we like it or not. And, lastly, it is evident from the conclusion of this 

409

introductory section that our obedience ought to be genuine and true internally and externally. This vow
to the LORD, therefore, every one ought to make.

But coming to the next section, we learn that a vow may be made to serve the Lord not only under the 
influence of some knowledge of Him, from truths, or from the Word, but also from an affection for the 
truth; and this, as we have seen from the references, is denoted by a woman vowing a vow to the Lord, 
5946, 9096; and that this also may take place at the beginning of regeneration, is clear from its being 
said that the woman is in her father's house in her youth. And we cannot refrain, here, from considering
that if it is possible for any man or any woman (for either of these is meant in the internal sense, by the 
man of the first section, and the woman of the following sections), to make up his mind to devote 
himself, or herself, to the Lord sincerely, only having a little knowledge, much more is it possible, 
when there is affection for the truth, and not only some worldly or selfish love of it. For great is the 
power of the genuine love of truth for its own sake, or because it is truth. Still, however, we see from 
this section that the affection of truth may err. And this possibility is shown by its being said that the 
father of the woman, in this case, either holds his peace at her, or disallows her. For the father denotes 
essential good from the Lord; and any person may be essentially in good internally, and yet may 
externally be in errors; and it is important that we should remember this. But there is one more point; 
and it is involved in the expression, "The Lord shall forgive her because her father disallowed her." 
That is, there is the remission of evil, because the state of essential good in which the regenerating 
person is internally combined with the genuine love of the truth externally, causes the removal of evil, 
and consequently the ignorance or error is not imputed; or in other words, a resolution to serve the Lord
under the impression that a certain doctrine is true, when yet it is false, because it is contrary to 
essential good, and is thus disallowed by it, cannot be carried out, since regeneration is the conjunction 
of good with truth, and cannot be the conjunction of good with falsity or error.

But the third section describes a more internal state, because a woman married to a husband denotes 
truth conjoined with good; and thus these three cases are illustrations of the natural, spiritual, and 
celestial degrees, and orders of persons who may devote themselves to the service of the Lord. And yet 
still the possibility of error is again involved, especially in the words, "the rash utterance of her lips 
with which she has bound her soul." That is, this rash utterance may be in harmony with the good 
denoted by the husband, or it may not; and if it is in harmony, her husband is said to hold his peace at 
her, whereas, on the contrary, if it is not in harmony, he is said to make void the vow and the rash 
utterance. And also the remission, or removal, of the evil and error follows, because good, where it is 
conjoined with truth from the Lord, effects this.

And now the next section, which is only one verse, requires a little attention. For a widow or a divorced
woman is evidently to be taken as representing a state of separation from good on account of falsity or 
evil prevailing, since it is said their vow stands against them, and no remission is spoken of; for a 
widow may signify also any one who is in truth and earnestly desires good, 48443, and such can have 
their evils and errors remitted on account of that desire, since it implies the presence of good internally;
and a woman divorced on account of adultery, may represent one who is in evil, and is yet capable of 
amendment, and thus of being forgiven, or having his evil removed (AE 2227; John 8:11). We ought, 
therefore, to be particular, when we study the Word in its internal sense, in noting in what way its 
correspondential expressions are applied.

But the fifth section, on a cursory examination, appears to be but a repetition of the third; for they both 
represent a state of truth conjoined with good, in which there may be devotion to the Lord, either 
genuine or otherwise, and in which remission may follow in the case of error. But the former case is 

410

said to denote the external conjunction of truth with good, and the latter such internal conjunction, 
since that refers specifically to those who belong to the middle heaven, whereas this refers to those who
belong to the third heaven, and even they, during regeneration, are not free from the liability to error. 
For indeed there is no human being in any heaven who has not erred, 868; and the celestial state, or the 
state of the conjunction of truth with good is predicable of any heaven.

And hence, in proceeding, the sixth section may be seen to be of very great importance in its internal 
sense. For the law is universal that it is the internal life of every one which must bring the external into 
harmony and agreement with itself. How utterly vain, therefore, in the light of this great truth, is the 
attempt of those who imagine that a merely outward morality, which puts on the appearance of 
goodness, when selfishness lurks within, can stand the test of the final Judgement, which none can 
avoid.

But, in conclusion, the last section, which sums up the spiritual teaching of the whole of this chapter, is 
worthy of a most careful study, and especially so with regard to the statement that the husband shall 
bear the iniquity of his wife, when it happens that he must make her vows null and void. That is, there 
must either be the removal of evil through temptations and victories involving the work of repentance 
all through life, or the confirmation of evil, and consequent vastation as to good and truth; for bearing 
iniquity spiritually involves both these things, according to the quality of the life of him who either 
suffers himself to be regenerated, or prefers to remain in the unregenerated state. But it is the internal 
man, or the Lord operating in the internal man, Who fights and overcomes; when yet the man himself 
must act as from himself in accomplishing this; for only thus can man have conjunction with the Lord; 
and only thus can the internal man bring the external into harmony with itself.

SUMMARY OF THE SPIRITUAL SENSE

1. Concerning the removal of falsifications of truth with the man of the Spiritual Church by 

victory in temptation, vers. 1-12. 

2. That purification must follow, because the outward rejection of falsified truths must be 

succeeded by the separation of impure affections, and incipient falsities, as well as of whatever
impurities yet adhere externally to the acquired goods and truths of the church, vers. 13-24. 

3. Concerning the new quality by victory, and the clear distinction to be made between the 

Celestial and Spiritual, or between good and truth, vers. 25-31. 

4. That goods and truths of every kind and degree, in this new state, are fully ascribed to the 

Lord, vers. 32-54. 

THE CONTENTS OF EACH VERSE

1. And the LORD spoke to Moses, 

1. There is revelation from the Lord by Divine Truth 

saving, 

giving the perception, 

2. Avenge the children of Israel of the 
Midianites: afterward shall you be 
gathered to your people. 

2. That falsifications of truth are to be entirely 

removed with the man of the Spiritual Church, in 
order that the conjunction and agreement of the 
internal man with the external or of good with 
truths may be fully effected. 

3. And Moses spoke to the people, 

3. And consequently the internal operates upon the 

saying, Arm you men from among 
you for the war, that they may go 
against Midian, to execute the 
LORD'S vengeance on Midian. 

external giving enlightenment and perception, that 
a state of conflict must be endured with truths 
against falsities, so that the latter may be overcome
because Divine Good is eternally opposed to such 
falsifications; 

4. Of every tribe a thousand, 

4. And that this conflict must be by means of the 

throughout all the tribes of Israel, 
shall you send to the war. 

truths of faith complete and in orderly 
arrangement. 

5. So there were delivered, out of the 
thousands of Israel, a thousand of 
every tribe, twelve thousand armed 
for war. 

5. And this actually happens; for the Lord secretly 
arranges such truths in all their fullness, in order 
that the man of the church may be able to oppose 
falsities. 

412

6. And Moses sent them, a thousand of 
every tribe, to the war, them and 
Phinehas the son of Eleazar the 
priest, to the war, with the vessels of 
the sanctuary and the trumpets for 
the alarm in his hand. 

6. For there is a distinct classification of such truths 
through the leading principle of Divine Truth, by 
which truths, as it were, separate from good, are 
conjoined with good, and with truths derived from 
good in temptations, including the scien-tifics of 
inmost good, and of inmost truth by which 
revelation is made, according to the state, with full
power. 

7. And they warred against Midian, as 

7. And temptation takes place under Divine 

the LORD commanded Moses; and 
they slew every male. 

protection, in which falsified truths are resisted, 
and falsities themselves are destroyed. 

8. And they slew the kings of Midian 
with the rest of their slain; Evi, and 
Rekem, and Zur, and Hur, and Reba, 
the five kings of Midian: Balaam 
also, the son of Beor, they slew with 
the sword. 

9. And the children of Israel took 

captive the women of Midian and 
their little ones; and all their cattle, 
and all their flocks, and all their 
goods, they took for a prey. 

10. And all their cities in the places 
wherein they dwelt, and all their 
encampments, they burnt with fire. 

11. And they took all the spoil, and all 
the prey, both of man and of beast. 

8. Also the leading principles of such falsifications of
truth are overcome as well as falsified truths 
themselves, namely the lust of falsifying; cunning 
by which falsity is mixed with truths; that which 
confirms and fixes such falsifications; the natural 
affection which delights in them; and that which 
gives the appearance of consistency to them, this 
involving the whole of such falsifications; and in 
addition falsity from the evil which misinterprets 
the Word is also overcome. 

9. Moreover the spiritual man, in this temptation and 
victory, appropriates every affection of truth, all 
incipient truths and goods, all natural affections, 
all spiritual affections, and all the knowledges of 
good and truth, which had been perverted by 
falsifications, for truly spiritual uses. 

10. Every doctrine also, which had served for 

falsification, and every false arrangement of truths,
through this temptation and victory, comes into the
possession of the true church, those who are in evil
being deprived of such truths through their own 
selfish love, and those who are in good being 
sanctified by them through conjunction with 
genuine heavenly love. 

11. And thus the church is enriched with goods and 
truths in abundance, both as to the internal and 
external man. 

413

12. And they brought the captives, and 

the prey, and the spoil, to Moses, and
to Eleazar the priest, and to the 
congregation of the children of 
Israel, to the camp at the plains of 
Moab, which are by the Jordan at 
Jericho. 

12. And all these spiritual acquisitions of every quality
are now sincerely acknowledged to be from the 
Divine Truth and Divine Good, and also as 
belonging to the Spiritual Church in its totality, 
through orderly arrangement internally, and even 
to exist where some impure good remains, where 
the Word in its literal sense is acknowledged, and 
where are the knowledges of truth in the external 
man. 

13. And Moses, and Eleazar the priest, 

13. And there is consequently an influx of Divine 

and all the princes of the 
congregation, went forth to meet 
them without the camp. 

Truth and Divine Good and of all primary truths in
an accommodated form even in this impure state. 

14. And Moses was angry with the 

officers of the host, the captains of 
thousands, and the captains of 
hundreds, which came from the 
service of the war. 

14. For there is aversion on the part of the man of the 
church, in his impurity, to Divine Truth, as to the 
superior governing powers, as to intermediate 
powers, and as to ultimate powers which have 
endured temptation, 

15. And Moses said to them, Have you 

saved all the women alive? 

15. Because it is made clear from the light of Divine 
Truth that, as yet, the affections of falsity remain; 

16. Behold, these caused the children of 

16. And that through these affections the man of the 

Israel, through the counsel of 
Balaam, to commit trespass against 
the LORD in the matter of Peor, and 
so the plague was among the 
congregation of the LORD. 

church is drawn away by perversions of the Word, 
and false teaching to the commission of sin by 
falsifying the truth in a state of selfish love most 
external, so that thus remains begin to suffer 
destruction; 

17. Now therefore kill every male 

among the little ones, and kill every 
woman that has known man by lying
with him. 

17. And that consequently it is necessary that every 
incipient falsity should be separated, as well as 
every affection of falsifying the truth; 

18. But all the women children, that 

have not known man by lying with 
him, keep alive for yourselves. 

18. But that, at the same time, every affection of truth 
that has not been contaminated by falsity is to be 
preserved. 

19. And encamp you without the camp 
seven days: whoever has killed any 
person, and whoever has touched 
any slain, purify yourselves on the 
third day and on the seventh day, you
and your captives. 

19. Besides which it is also necessary that impure 
states shall be distinguished carefully from the 
goods and truths of the church until regeneration is
accomplished; for in order that evil and falsity 
may be removed, purification therefrom must be 
continual in the course of regeneration, and must 
be completed at its close both as to hereditary and 
acquired states. 

414

20. And as to every garment, and all that
is made of skin, and all work of 
goats' hair, and all things made of 
wood, you shall purify yourselves. 

21. And Eleazar the priest said to the 

men of war which went to the battle, 
This is the statute of the law which 
the LORD has commanded Moses: 

22. Howbeit the gold, and the silver, the 
brass, the iron, the tin, and the lead, 

23. Every thing that may abide the fire, 
you shall make to go through the 
fire, and it shall be clean; 
nevertheless it shall be purified with 
the water of separation: and all that 
abides not the fire you shall make to 
go through the water. 

20. Also purification must take place as to every 

interior truth and good of the natural man, and as 
to every exterior truth and good thereof. 

21. And this testimony of Divine Truth is confirmed 
by Divine Good with those who have been 
victorious in temptation; and assurance is given, 
that every outward form of the truth is the 
expression of its inward spirit, because Divine 
Good flows into Divine Truth, and Divine Truth is 
the form of Divine Good. 

22. Nevertheless every outward form of good and 

truth of the highest degree; of good and truth of 
the middle degree; and of truth and good of the 
lowest degree, 

23. Which is capable of being affected by pure love 
from the Lord, is essentially pure, and must 
therefore be made actually pure by the removal of 
evil and falsity which contaminates it, through the 
truth of the Word and through temptations; while 
the outward form which is not capable of being so 
affected (as is celestial good), must be purified 
through the removal of falsity by Divine Truth. 

24. And you shall wash your clothes on 
the seventh day, and you shall be 
clean, and afterward you shall come 
into the camp. 

24. And thus regeneration, and consequently 

purification, must be completed so that the 
heavenly life may be fully received. 

25. And the LORD spoke to Moses, 

25. And further, there is revelation from Divine Good 

saying, 

by Divine Truth giving the perception, 

26. Take the sum of the prey that was 

26. That the quality of good and truth acquired 

taken, both of man and of beast, you,
and Eleazar the priest, and the heads 
of the fathers' houses of the 
congregation: 

through victory in temptation is truly estimated by 
the Lord through Divine Truth and Divine Good, 
and the primary truths thence derived, even as to 
internals and as to externals. 

27. And divide the prey into two parts; 
between the men skilled in war, that 
went out to battle, and all the 
congregation: 

27. And that, as the result of regeneration, good and 

truth, or the celestial and spiritual principles, are in
equality, good established against evil by truths 
being the internal, and truth now conjoined with 
good being the external.

28. And levy a tribute to the LORD of the

28. For all who have engaged in the conflict by truths 

men of war that went out to battle: 
one soul of five hundred, both of the 
persons, and of the beeves, and of 
the asses, and of the flocks: 

interiorly, are to ascribe to the Lord all the good 
and truth they have received fully and completely 
as to celestial things internal and external, and as 
to spiritual things external and internal, 

29. Take it of their half, and give it to 
Eleazar the priest, for the LORD'S 
heave offering. 

30. And of the children of Israel's half, 
you shall take one drawn out of 
every fifty, of the persons, of the 
beeves, of the asses, and of the 
flocks, even of all the cattle, and give
them to the Levites, which keep the 
charge of. the tabernacle of the 
LORD. 

31. And Moses and Eleazar the priest 

did as the LORD commanded Moses. 

29. Since all good is from the Lord, and must be 

ascribed to Him as being the inmost principle of 
worship from Him and giving all the activity of 
life there; 

30. And all truth is from the Lord with the man of the 

Spiritual Church as distinguished from the 
Celestial, and must also be fully ascribed to Him 
as to the affections of truth internal and external, 
and as to truths themselves external and internal, 
yea as to every good of truth in worship from the 
holy principle of charity, which is the celestial 
principle of the Spiritual Church, and ministers to 
the genuine celestial principle, and thus to the 
Lord. 

31. And this effect actually takes place, when man is 
regenerated according to Divine Order by influx 
and correspondence. 

32. Now the prey, over and above the 
booty which the men of war took, 
was six hundred thousand and 
seventy thousand and five thousand 
sheep, 

32. But the goods and truths thus acquired by man 

during regeneration, exclusive of the remains of 
evil and falsity which adhere to every one, are as 
follows: charity in all fullness and holiness 
acquired by victory in temptation; 

33. And threescore and twelve thousand 

33. Natural good holy and pure by conjunction with 

beeves, 

the interiors; 

34. And threescore and one thousand 

34. Natural truth also similarly acquired in fullness; 

asses, 

35. And thirty and two thousand persons
in all, of the women that had not 
known man by lying with him. 

35. With fullness of conjunction with the interiors as 
to every natural affection of truth uncorrupted by 
falsity. 

36. And the half, which was the portion 
of them that went out to war, was in 
number three hundred thousand and 
thirty thousand and seven thousand 
and five hundred sheep: 

36. And the quality of the goods and truths belonging 
to those who successfully engage in temptations is,
of spiritual affections fullness and holiness both as
to good and as to truth internally and externally; 

416

37. And the LORD'S tribute of the sheep 
was six hundred and threescore and 
fifteen. 

37. And these are acknowledged to be from the Lord 
in the course of regeneration, wherein a new state 
of spiritual life is acquired. 

38. And the beeves were thirty and six 
thousand; of which the LORD'S 
tribute was threescore and twelve. 

39. And the asses were thirty thousand 
and five hundred; of which the 
LORD'S tribute was threescore and 
one. 

40. And the persons were sixteen 
thousand; of whom the LORD'S 
tribute was thirty and two persons. 

38. Of natural affections, there are fullness and 

perfection from victory in temptations, which are 
all acknowledged to be from the Lord holy and 
perfect; 

39. Of natural truths also fullness and holiness, and 

these entirely ascribed to the Lord in the new state;

40. And of pure affections for truth, conjunction with 
higher affections also ascribed to the Lord. 

41. And Moses gave the tribute, which

was the LORD'S heave offering, to 
Eleazar the priest, as the LORD 
commanded Moses. 

Lord through Divine Truth, because it is felt that 
all life and activity are from Him through good 
conjoined with truth in the man of the church. 

42. And of the children of Israel's half, 
which Moses divided off from the 
men that warred, 

43. (Now the congregation's half was 
three hundred thousand and thirty 
thousand, seven thousand and five 
hundred sheep, 

42. But of spiritual principles as distinct from celestial

according to Divine Truth, 

43. The quality of the spiritual affections is fullness 

and holiness as to good and as to truth; 

44. And thirty and six thousand beeves, 

44. Of natural affections fullness and perfection from 

victory in temptation; 

45. And thirty thousand and five 

45. Of natural truths also fullness and holiness; 

hundred asses, 

46. And sixteen thousand persons;) 

46. And of pure affections for truth, conjunction with 

47. Even of the children of Israel's half, 
Moses took one drawn out of every 
fifty, both of man and of beast, and 
gave them to the Levites, which kept
the charge of the tabernacle of the 
LORD; as the LORD commanded 
Moses. 

the higher affections. 

47. And all these different affections are fully ascribed
to the Lord according to Divine Order, both as to 
things internal and things external, through the 
principle of charity which is the celestial principle 
of the Spiritual Church, and ministers to the 
genuine celestial principle and thus to the Lord. 

417

48. And the officers which were over the

thousands off the host, the captains 
of thousands, and the captains of 
hundreds, came near to Moses: 

49. And they said to Moses, Your 

servants have taken the sum of the 
men of war which are under our 
charge, and there lacketh not one 
man of us. 

48. And thus all the leading principles of the church, 
according to their degrees, are harmonized with 
Divine Truth; 

49. And there is perception from this harmony, that the
quality of the church is full and perfect in every 
respect, nothing being wanting. 

50. And we have brought the LORD'S 

50. And through leading principles, there is full 

oblation, what every man has gotten,
of jewels of gold, ankle chains, and 
bracelets, signet-rings, earrings, and 
armlets, to make atonement for our 
souls before the LORD. 

acknowledgement of the Lord in holy worship as 
to every individual, or as to every particular 
affection, namely, precious truths conjoined with 
good, coherence in the lowest natural degree, 
conjunction with the spiritual, holy fear of God in 
successive order according to degrees, and thus the
full conjunction of the external with the internal 
man, and thus with the Lord. 

51. And Moses and Eleazar the priest 
took the gold of them, even all 
worked jewels. 

51. And thus all good is acknowledged to be from the 
Lord by Divine Truth and Divine Good as well as 
every precious truth conjoined with good. 

52. And all the gold of the heave 

52. And the quality of the good from the Lord 

offering that they offered up to the 
LORD, of the captains of thousands, 
and of the captains of hundreds, was 
sixteen thousand seven hundred and 
fifty shekels. 

53. (For the men of war had taken booty,

every man for himself.) 

54. And Moses and Eleazar the priest 
took the gold of the captains of 
thousands and of hundreds, and 
brought it into the tent of meeting, 
for a memorial for the children of 
Israel before the LORD. 

REFERENCES AND NOTES

involving perception, and acknowledged to be 
from Him, by the various powers in due 
subordination, is fullness and completeness of 
conjunction in every respect. 

53. Exclusive of the evil that still adheres to man, and 
remains with him, although quiescent, even when 
he is regenerated. 

54. And what is true of all celestial things ascribed to 
the Lord, is true also of all spiritual things in their 
order. All are ascribed to the Lord through Divine 
Truth and Divine Good, and remain with man to 
eternity from Him. 

1. This is evident because by Jehovah is denoted the Divine Being as to His love, 2001; by 

speaking is denoted influx, 2951; by Moses is represented Divine Truth, or the Word, 7010; 
and by saying is denoted perception, 1822. 

418

2. Avenging the children of Israel of the Midianites, denotes that falsifications of truth are to be 

entirely removed with the man of the Spiritual Church, 8223, 3654, 3242; and Moses being 
gathered to his people afterwards, denotes in order that the conjunction of the internal man 
with the external, and the agreement of the latter with the former may be fully effected, 7010, 
3255, 9459, 1259. 

3. Moses speaking to the people, saying, denotes the operation of the Internal upon the External, 
giving enlightenment and perception, 7010, 2951, 1259, 1822; "Arm you men from among 
you for the war," denotes that a state of conflict must be endured with truths against falsities, 
2686, 1007, 1664; "that they may go against Midian," denotes so that the latter may be 
overcome, 1064, 3242; and "to execute the Lord's vengeance on Midian," denotes because 
Divine Good is eternally opposed to such falsifications, 2001, 8223. 

4.

"Of every tribe a thousand, throughout all the tribes of Israel shall you send to the war," 
denotes that this conflict must be by means of the truths of faith complete and in orderly 
arrangement, 3858, 3242, 3654. 

5. There being delivered out of the thousands of Israel of every tribe twelve thousand armed for 

war, denotes that this actually happens; for the Lord secretly arranges such truths in all their 
fullness in order that the man of the church may be able to oppose falsities, 2575, 3858, 2686, 
l664.

6. Moses sending them a thousand of every tribe to the war, denotes that there is a distinct 

classification of such truths, through the leading principle of Divine Truth, 7010, 2575, 3858, 
1664; them and Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, denotes by which truths, as it were, 
separate from good, are conjoined with good, and with truths derived from good in 
temptations, chap 25:7, 1664; with the vessels of the sanctuary, denotes including the 
scientifics of inmost good, 6917, 3210; and the trumpets for the alarm in his hand, denotes 
inmost truth by which revelation is made according to the state with full power, 8815, chap 
10:5. 

7. Warring against Midian, as the Lord commanded Moses, and destroying every male, denotes 
that temptation takes place under Divine protection, in which falsified truths are resisted, and 
falsities themselves are destroyed, 1664, 3242, 2001, 5.486, 7010, 4727, 725, 24663. 

8. Slaying the kings of Midian with the rest of their slain, denotes that the leading principles of 

such falsifications of truth are overcome as well as falsified truths themselves, 4727, 1682, 
3242; Evi means desire, or lust, and therefore denotes the lust of falsifying, 8910; Rekem 
means streaked, or embroidered, or variegated, and therefore he denotes the cunning by which
falsity is mixed with truths, 3993, 3995; Zur means a rock, and therefore he denotes that which
confirms and fixes such falsifications, 2760 preface, 5096; Hur means liberty, whiteness, hole,
cavern, and therefore he denotes the natural affection which delights in them, 2870, 6963, 
5145, 2463, 8603; Reba means four-sided, and therefore denotes that which gives the 
appearance of consistency to them, 9717; the five kings of Midian denotes that these are the 
whole of such falsifications, 5708, 1682, 3242; and their slaying also Balaam the son of Beor 
with the sword, denotes that, in addition, falsity from the evil which misinterprets the Word is 
also overcome, 4727, chap 22:5, 27992. 

419

9. The children of Israel taking captive the women of Midian, denotes that the spiritual man, in 
this temptation and victory, appropriates every affection of truth, 3654, 1717-1719, 5946; and 
their little ones, denotes all incipient truths and goods, 5946; and taking all their cattle, and all 
their flocks, and all their goods for a prey, denotes the appropriation of all natural affections, 
all spiritual affections, and all knowledges of good and truth, which had been perverted by 
falsifications, for truly spiritual uses, 6126, 6134, 1694, 3242, 1851. 

10. Burning with fire all their cities in the places wherein they dwelt, and all their encampments, 

denotes that every doctrine also which had served for falsification, and every false 
arrangement of truths, through this temptation and victory, comes into the possession of the 
true church, those who are in evil being deprived of such truths through their own selfish love;
and those who are in good being sanctmed by them through genuine heavenly love, 934, 402, 
2625, 1293, 4236. 

11. Taking all the spoil and all the prey both of man and beast, denotes that thus the church is 

enriched with goods and truths in abundance, both as to the internal and external man, 3242, 
1851, 7872. 

12. Bringing the captives and the prey and the spoil to Moses and to Eleazar the priest, and to the 
congregation of the children of Israel to the camp at the plains of Moab, which are by the 
Jordan at Jericho, denotes that all these spiritual acquisitions of every quality are now 
sincerely acknowledged to be from Divine-Truth and Divine Good, and also as belonging to 
the Spiritual Church in its totality, through orderly arrangement internally, and even to exist 
where some impure good remains, where the Word in its literal sense is acknowledged, and 
where are the knowledges of truth in the external man, 1717-1719, 5946, 6126, 6134, it>94, 
3242, 1851, 683, 7010, 9946, 7843, 3654, 4236, 2468, 1585, 9325, 5659. 

13. Moses and Eleazar the priest, and all the princes of the congregation going forth to meet them 
without the camp, denotes that there is consequently an influx of Divine Truth and Divine 
Good and of all primary truths in an accommodated form even in this impure state, 7010, 
9946, 1482, 7843, 5337, 4247, 4236.

14. Moses being angry with the officers of the host, the captains of thousands, and the captains of 
hundreds, which came from the service of the war, denotes that there is aversion on the part of 
the man of the church in his impurity to Divine Truth, as to the superior governing powers, as 
to intermediate powers, and as to ultimate powers, which have endured temptation, 7010, 
5798, 6358-9, 1482, 8712, 8713, 1664. 

15. Moses saying to them, "Have you saved all the women alive?" denotes that it is made clear 
from Divine Truth that as yet the affections of falsity remain, 7010, 1822, 5407, 5.68.

16. "Behold, these caused the children of Israel through the counsel of Balaam to commit trespass 
against the Lord in the matter of Peor, and so the plague was among the congregation of the 
Lord," denotes that through these affections the man of the church is drawn away by 
perversions of the Word, and false teaching to the commission of sin by falsifying the truth in 
a state of selfish love most external, so that thus remains begin to suffer destruction, 568, 
3654, chap 22:5, 25:1-9. 

420

17. "Now therefore kill every male among the little ones," denotes that it is necessary that every 
incipient falsity should be separated, 4727, 5946, 568; and "kill every woman that has known 
man by lying with him," denotes as well as every affection of falsifying the truth, 3242. 

18. "But all the women children that have not known man by lying with him, keep alive for 
yourselves," denotes that at the same time every affection of truth that has not been 
contaminated with falsity is to be preserved, 3242, 5407. 

19. "And encamp you without the camp seven days," denotes that it is necessary that impure states
shall be distinguished carefully from the goods and truths of the church until regeneration is 
accomplished, 4236, 2044; and "whoever has killed any person, and whoever has touched any 
slain, purify yourselves on the third day, and on the seventh day, you and your captives," 
denotes that for evils and falsity to be removed, purification therefrom must be continual in the
course of regeneration, and must be completed at its close, both as to hereditary and acquired 
states, 4727, 10130, 390010, chap 19:12, 1007, 2686, 6126, 6134, 1694, 1851. Observe that the
Hebrew word for captives is here applied as being a part of the spoil taken from the enemy, 
and therefore as representing acquired states; while the Israelites, considered as men of war, 
are taken as representing hereditary states, because the spirit of warfare is not from the Lord 
but from the proprium of man, that is, from the life into which he is born. Hence we see how 
purification is necessary after states of temptation and victory, and before the full realization of
the state of heavenly order, which is denoted by coming into the camp, 4236. 

20. "And as to every garment and all that is made of skin, and all the work of goats' hair, and all 

things made of wood, you shall purify yourselves," denotes that purification must take place as
to every interior truth, and good of the natural man, and as to every exterior truth and good 
thereof, 9215, 4169, 3301, 643, chap 19:12. 

21. Eleazar the priest saying to the men of war which went to the battle, "This is the statute of the 
law which the Lord commanded Moses," denotes that this testimony of Divine Truth is 
confirmed by Divine Good with those who have been victorious in temptation; and that 
assurance is given that every outward form of the truth is the expression of its inward spirit, 
because Divine Good flows into Divine Truth, and Divine Truth is the form of Divine Good, 
9946, 1822, 2686, 1007, 1664, 1038, 7884, 2001, 5486, 7010. 

22. "Howbeit the gold, and the silver, the brass, the iron, the tin and the lead," denotes every 

outward form of good and truth of the highest degree; of good and truth of the middle degree; 
and of truth and good of the lowest degree, 425, 2967'.

23. "Everything that may abide the fire, you shall make to go through the fire, and it shall be 

clean," denotes which is capable of being affected by pure love from the Lord, is essentially 
pure, and must, therefore, be made actually pure, by the removal of evil and falsity which 
contaminate it through the truth of the Word and through temptations, 934, 10130, 7861, 4545;
"nevertheless, it shall be purified by the water of separation," denotes purification by the truth 
of the Word, chap 19:11-12; "and all that abides not the fire you shall make to go through the 
water," denotes that the outward form which is not capable of being so affected (as is celestial 
good) must be purified through the removal of falsity by Divine Truth, 934, 7861, 10130, chap
19:11-12. 

421

24. "And you shall wash your clothes on the seventh day, and you shall be clean, and afterward 

you shall come into the camp," denotes that thus regeneration, and consequently purification, 
must be completed, so that the heavenly life may be fully received, 3147, 9215, chap 19:19, 
1853, 4236. 

25. This is evident, because by Jehovah is denoted the Divine Being as to His love, 2001; by 

speaking is denoted influx, 2951; by Moses is represented Divine Truth, or the Word, 7010; 
and by saying is denoted perception, 1822. 

26. "Take the sum of the prey that was taken both of man and beast, you, and Eleazar the priest 

and the heads of the fathers' houses of the congregation," denotes that the quality of good and 
truth acquired through victory in temptation, is truly estimated by the Lord through Divine 
Truth and Divine Good, and the primary truths thence derived, even as to Internals and as to 
Externals, 10217, ver. 9, 7872, 7010, 9946, 7833, 7843. 

27. "And divide the prey into two parts between the men skilled in war that went out to battle, and 

all the congregation," or assembly, denotes that, as the result of regeneration, good and truth, 
or the celestial and spiritual principles are in equality, good established against evil by truths 
being the internal, and truth, now conjoined with good, being the external, 1832, 4342, 8292, 
747, 2686, 1007, 1664, 7843. 

28. "And levy a tribute to the Lord of the men of war that went out to battle," denotes that all who 
have engaged in the conflict by truths interiorly, are to ascribe to the Lord all the good and 
truth they have received fully and completely, 6394, 2001, ver. 3; one soul of five hundred, 
denotes fully and completely, 10253; and "of the persons, of the beeves, of the asses and of the
flocks," denotes as to celestial things internal and external, and as to spiritual things external 
and internal, 7120, 2180, 2781, 6126. 

29. "Take it of their half and give it to Eleazar the priest for the Lord's offering," denotes that all 
good is from the Lord, and must be ascribed to Him, as being the inmost principle of worship 
from Him, and as giving all the activity of life there, ver. 27, 10227, 9946, 2001, 5619. 

30. "And of the children of Israel's half you shall take one drawn out of every fifty," denotes that 
all truth is from the Lord with the man of the Spiritual Church as distinguished from the 
Celestial, and must be fully ascribed to Him, 3654, ver. 27, 2141; "of the persons, of the 
beeves, of the asses and of the flocks, even of all the cattle," denotes as to the affections of 
truth internal and external, and as to truths themselves external and internal, yea, as to every 
good of truths, 7120, 2180, 2781, 6126, 6134; "and give them to the Levites which keep the 
charge of the tabernacle of the Lord," denotes in worship from the holy principle of charity, 
which is the celestial principle of the Spiritual Church, and ministers to the genuine Celestial 
and thus to the Lord, 10227, 3858, 10017, 3382, 3210, 2001. 

31. Moses and Eleazar the priest doings as the Lord commanded Moses, denotes that this effect 
actually takes place, when man is regenerated according to Divine Order by influx and 
correspondence, 7010, 9946, 2618, 2001, 5,486.

32. The prey over and above the booty which the men of war took being six hundred thousand and

seventy thousand and five hundred sheep, denotes that the goods and truths thus acquired by 
man during regeneration, exclusive of the remains of evil and falsity which adhere to every 

422

one, are as follows: charity in all fullness and holiness acquired by victory in temptation, 3242,
1851, 6978, 8888, 8889, 10253, 4169. 

33. And three score and twelve thousand beeves, denotes natural good holy and pure by 

conjunction with the interiors, 728, 5194, 2180. 

34. Three score and one thousand asses, denotes natural truth also similarly acquired in fullness, 

8888, 2575. 

35. Thirty and two thousand persons in all of the women who had not known man by lying with 

him, denotes with fullness of conjunction with the interiors as to every natural affection of 
truth un-corrupted by falsity, 5335, 5194, 3242. 

36. The half which was the portion of them that went out to war being in number three hundred 

thousand and thirty thousand and seven thousand and five hundred sheen, denotes that the 
quality of the goods and truths belonging to those who successfully engage in temptations is of
spiritual affections, fullness, and holiness, both as to good and as to truth internally and 
externally, 10255, 4%2> 10253, 4169. 

37. The Lord's tribute of the sheep being six hundred and threescore and fifteen, denotes that these
are acknowledged to be from the. Lord in the course of regeneration, wherein a new state of 
spiritual life is acquired, 8888, 8400, 6394, 2001, ver. 3. 

38. The beeves being thirty and six thousand, of which the Lord's tribute was three score and 
twelve, denotes that of natural affections there are fullness and perfection from victory in 
temptations, which are all acknowledged to be from the Lord, holy and perfect, 2180, 5335, 
8888, 6394, 2001, 728, 5194. 

39. The asses being thirty thousand and five hundred, of which the Lord's tribute was threescore 
and one. denotes of natural truths also fullness and holiness, and these entirely ascribed to the 
Lord in the new state, 2781, 5335, 10253, 6394, 2001, 3306, 2044. 

40. The persons being sixteen thousand, of which the Lord's tribute was thirty and two persons, 
denotes of pure affections for truth, conjunction with higher affections, also ascribed to the 
Lord. 3242, 2044, 5194, 6394, 2001, 5335. 

41. Moses giving the tribute which was the Lord's heave offering to Eleazar the priest, as the Lord 
commanded Moses, denotes that, in short, all these are fully ascribed to the Lord, through 
Divine Truth, because it is felt that all life and activity are from Him through good conjoined 
with truth in the man of the church, 7010, 5194, 6394, 2001, 10097, 9946. The word "Eleazar"
means the help of God, and therefore denotes truth, while the priest denotes good, for which 
reason it is here said, "good conjoined with truth."

42. The children of Israel's half which was divided off from the men that warred, denotes spiritual 
principles as distinct from celestial according to Divine Truth, 3654, 10255, 7010, ver. 3. 

43. The congregation's half being three hundred thousand and thirty thousand, seven thousand and
five hundred sheep, denotes that the quality of the spiritual affections is fullness and holiness 
as to good, and as to truth, 7843, 10255, 482, 10253, 4160. 

423

44. Thirty and six thousand beeves, denotes of natural affections, fullness and perfection from 

victory in temptations, 5335, 8888, 2180. 

45. Thirty thousand and five hundred asses, denotes of natural truths also fullness and holiness, 

9487, 716, 2781. 

46. And sixteen thousand persons, denotes of pure affections for truth conjunction with the higher 

affections, 2044, 5194, 3242. 

47. Moses taking even of the children of Israel's half, one drawn out of every fifty, both of man 

and beast, and giving them to the Levites, which kept the charge of the tabernacle of the Lord, 
as the Lord commanded Moses, denotes that all these different affections are fully ascribed to 
the Lord, according to Divine Order, both as to things internal and things external, through the 
principle of charity, which is the celestial principle of the Spiritual Church, and ministers to 
the genuine celestial principle and thus to the Lord, 7010, 3654, 10255, 2141, 7872, 5619, 
3858, 3382, 3210, 5486. 

48. The officers which were over the thousands of the host, the captains of thousands, and the 

captains of hundreds coming near to Moses, denotes that thus all the leading principles of the 
church, according to their degrees, are harmonized with Divine Truth, 1482, 8712-3, 3572, 
7010. 

49. Their saying to Moses, "Your servants have taken the sum of the men of war which are under 
our charge, and there lacketh not one man of us," denotes that there is perception from this 
harmony that the quality of the church is full and perfect in every respect, nothing being 
wanting, 1822, 7010, 5164, 10217, ver. 5, 8474. 

50. "And we have brought the Lord's oblation what every man has gotten," denotes that through 

leading principles there is full acknowledgement of the Lord in worship as to every individual,
or as to every particular affection, 5619; "'jewels,' or 'vessels' of gold," denote precious truths 
conjoined with good, 3079, 425; "ankle chains," denote coherence in the lowest natural 
degree, 2162, 9852; "bracelets" denote conjunction with the spiritual degree, 3105, 5194; 
"signet-rings, earrings, and armlets, or necklaces," denote holy fear of God in successive order
according to degrees, 4874, 3103, 5320; and "to make atonement for our souls before the 
Lord," denotes the full conjunction of the external with the internal man, and thus with the 
Lord, 10042, 29735, 2001. 

51. Moses and Eleazar taking the gold of them, even all worked jewels, denotes that thus all good 
is acknowledged to be from the Lord by Divine Truth and Divine Good, as well as every 
precious truth conjoined with good, 7010, 9946, 425, 3079, 9737. 

52. All the gold of the heave offering that they offered up to the Lord, of the captains of thousands
and of the captains of hundreds being sixteen thousand seven hundred and fifty shekels, 
denotes that the quality of good from the Lord involving perception and acknowledgement to 
be from Him by the various powers in due subordination, is fullness and completeness of 
conjunction in every respect, 425, 10097, 5619, 8712-3, 5194, 2044, 2575, 716, 2141. 

53. The men of war having taken booty every one for himself, denotes that evil still adheres to 

man and remains with him, although quiescent, even when he is regenerated, 6978 on Nahum 
3:1-4, 868. 

424

54. Moses and Eleaznr the priest taking the gold of the captains of thousands and of hundreds and 
bringing it into the tent of meeting for a memorial for the children of Israel before the Lord, 
denotes that what is true of all celestial things ascribed to the Lord, is true also of spiritual 
things in their order. All are ascribed to the Lord through Divine Truth and Divine Good, and 
remain with man to eternity from Him, 7010, 9946, 425, 8712-3, 35403, 6888, 3654, 2001. 

DISCUSSION

It is proper in reflecting on the contents of the first section of this chapter, to consider the distinction 
between the apparent and the genuine truths of the Word, and why the Word contains such truths as the 
former, and is not limited to the statement of genuine truths, since it is the Word of the Lord, and ought 
to contain, therefore, no teaching from Him that is false. We have to affirm, then, that there is no 
teaching in the Word from the Lord that is false; and yet we have to acknowledge that the Lord did 
speak to Moses, instructing him to take vengeance on the Midianites, while yet it is contrary to the 
genuine truth, that any person, or any number of persons combined, should indulge in taking revenge at
all, as we know very well from Matt 5:38-48. And that the Lord here taught a genuine truth in 
opposition to an apparent truth is beyond doubt. For it is manifestly true that no one ought to return evil
for evil; and also that every one ought to overcome evil with good. For if I do evil to another because 
he has done evil to me, I am as bad as he is; but if I do good to him, because he has done evil to me, I 
am acting according to the genuine truth. Hence, then, it is decidedly wrong to resist evil by doing evil 
in return, while yet it is clearly necessary to resist evil with good, or from good, even if the good that is 
returned for the evil assumes the outward appearance of punishment or of revenge.

We now see, therefore, that when the Lord instructed Moses to take vengeance on the Midianites, the 
command assumed the outward form which it did in accommodation to the state of Moses and the 
Israelites, who were of such a character that they actually desired to take vengeance, or to do evil to 
others, who had done evil to them. This command of the Lord, therefore (that is, of the same Lord that 
spoke the Sermon on the Mount), in its first procedure from Him, was not a command to take 
vengeance at all, or to engage in war at all, but yet in its descent from Him. through the heavens, and 
through the mind of the angel or spirit who spoke from the Lord to Moses, it assumed the outward 
appearance, which is here recorded and forms a part of the literal sense of the Word. That is, it is an 
apparent truth and not a genuine truth; and such, indeed, are all the truths of the Word in which 
vengeance, anger, wrath, repentance, changes of mind, and other merely human weaknesses, are 
attributed to the Lord. The Word,.however, is Divine Truth in ultimate or lowest forms, and does not 
contain anything false, while yet both its apparent and its genuine truths, may easily be falsified by 
misinterpretations. For example, the Lord, when He was in the world, appeared, spoke of Himself, felt 
Himself to be, and was regarded by others, as a separate person from His Father; and these apparent 
truths were then unavoidable; and yet as a matter of fact, and thus, in the genuine sense, He was the 
Father Himself manifested in whom was the whole Divine Trinity, as He carefully taught His disciples 
(John 14:8-17, Matt 28:16-20, John 8:17-18, 58-59). And therefore those who assume that the apparent 
truths of the Word concerning the Lord are genuine truths, and so make Him a distinct person from the 
Father, in reality, misinterpret the Word, and thence misunderstand it. Hence, then, it is not necessary to
believe either that the Divine Being is revengeful, or advises vengeance; or that He is embodied in 
more persons than one. And thus, there are apparent truths in the Word as well as in creation, because it
is impossible that Divine realities can appear the same outwardly as they are inwardly, and also that 
interior forms of truth only are adapted to the apprehension of mankind in all circumstances.

425

A second point to be noticed in this section is that although Divine Good or Divine Truth cannot be 
tempted, but only truth Divine adjoined to Good Divine, 2814, as it exists from the Lord with the man 
of the church, this being represented by the twelve thousand men sent against Midian and accompanied
by Phinehas the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, yet it is still true that the Lord alone fights 
for man in temptations, while man must himself endure conflict and overcome as from himself. A third 
point is, that, in spiritual conflicts, the essential and governing principles of falsity are also to be 
overcome, as appears from ver. 8, which is very interesting in the internal sense, on account of the 
correspondence of the names. And a fourth is that in consequence of victory, falsified truths come into 
the possession of man as genuine truths, which are acknowledged to be from the Lord. All the points in 
this section, therefore, are very stimulating and encouraging. And, in addition, it may be observed that 
this victory is gained, while yet man is in a comparatively imperfect and impure state, as the spiritual 
teaching of ver. 12 clearly shows.

But the next section also reveals, in the internal sense, some interesting things. To begin with, consider 
the first effect of victory in temptation. There is a stronger influence from the Lord, and from the 
angels. For as nothing but evils and errors prevent these from being perfect and full at any time, so the 
conquest of them immediately causes greater influences; and this is represented by Moses and Eleazar 
and the princes going out to meet the successful warriors. Notice one result, however. The presence of 
heavenly light and life discloses the imperfection and aversion of the yet not fully regenerated man. For
the love of falsifying the truth still remains; and thus we learn how very gradual is man's progress in the
higher life. And here we pause to think, for a moment, of the actual historical facts. Moses commands 
the slaughter of every male among the little ones, and all the married women of the captive Midianites. 
How cruel were those wars of the Israelites! War is at all times a curse and not a blessing; and the very 
spirit of cruelty and revenge lurks in the minds both of the leaders and of the soldiers who engage in 
war, however apparently just may seem to be the reasons for the conflict. Hence, then, cruel and 
destructive warfare can never be justified. And if modern wars are in some respects not so bad, in this 
respect, as were those of ancient nations, yet it still remains absolutely true, that all wars have an evil 
origin; are contrary to the spirit of true religion; and inevitably foster and encourage and stimulate the 
worst of evil passions. No wonder, therefore, that the best conditions of mankind in the past are 
described as limes of mutual love and peace and prosperity, when no selfishness was predominant; and 
that the best conditions of the future will be the return of the golden age, when men "shall beat their 
swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruning hooks," when "nation shall not lift up sword 
against nation," and "neither shall they learn war any more" (Isaiah 2:4).

But now, on the other hand, turning to the interpretation, according to the correspondences, we realize 
how holy and pure is the Word in its spiritual sense. For the command given by Moses, in that sense, is 
of the greatest value, and ought to be strictly carried out by every member of the church. And the 
spiritual warrior should indeed separate from himself every incipient falsity, or evil, and every delight 
in falsifying the truth for selfish purposes, while yet he must preserve in himself every affection of 
truth, which is not contaminated with falsity; in addition to which it is necessary that impure states shall
be distinguished carefully from the goods and truths of the church until regeneration is accomplished, 
and man is altogether purified from evil.

But this is as to internal things; and we must notice now what relates to the purification in external 
things, which must follow the spiritual warfare which is so necessary a part of human regeneration. 
And here we clearly are taught that the two great purifying powers are the love of the Lord and the 
neighbour, which are represented by fire and the holy truths of the Word of the Lord, which are 
signified by water, and especially by the water of separation, or as the marginal reading has it, the water

426

of impurity, which means the truth which teaches that, apart from the acknowledgement that man of 
himself is nothing but evil, and that this acknowledgement must never be lost with the man of the 
church on earth, nor even with the angels, there is really no purification at all. And why is this so much 
insisted upon? It is because, if any man, or any angel, were persuaded that he ever had any good or any 
truth in himself, either hereditary, or acquired, independently of its continual influx from the Lord, and 
of its continual reception by himself, he could not possibly be preserved in a state of purity, since such 
a persuasion is the origin of all evil, and would, without doubt, cause him who cherished it to imagine 
himself a god, and induce him to claim dominion over his fellow creatures, and thus to destroy that 
Divine Order without which the universe cannot be preserved. For it is the very nature of selfish love to
attempt this and to accomplish it, were it possible.

And again we must notice also one other particular in this section, namely, that whereas everything 
which could abide the fire required to be purified with this water of separation; while that which could 
not abide the fire necessarily required purification by being washed in water, yet in every case of 
regeneration there must be the acknowledgement that man of himself is nothing but evil; although still 
there are some things, or some states of man, that not love but truth must make pure. For example, we 
know that a garment when soiled, or a wooden vessel, cannot be cleansed by passing through the fire, 
that is, by burning, and hence we may perceive that external intellectual powers, and affections, are not 
so susceptible of purification through the higher loves, and yet can be brought into correspondence with
those loves by the operation of the truth which is represented by water, because garments, and vessels 
made of wood, correspond to external truths and affections. And again, on the other hand, we know that
hot water is necessary in cleansing garments and wooden vessels, from which we learn, by 
correspondence, that spiritual heat or love in a modified and adapted form is essential in purification 
even here. For love is the life of all our powers, nor can it be conceived that spiritual purification is 
ever accomplished without the influence of love in some way. And hence, too, we have impressed upon
us this lesson, that by the mere knowledge and understanding of truths we may indeed polish and 
brighten up our external deportment; but that, certainly, some earnest love of the truth, as well, must 
contribute to the making of our lives inwardly pure on the natural plane.

Concerning the next section, it may be said that we are already familiar with the signification of 
numbering, and of making an offering to the Lord through the priests and through the Levites from 
some of our former studies; and so it is only necessary here to re-impress upon our minds the 
importance of considering the quality of our own lives, habitually, as well as after seasons of trial, and 
temptation. For we know very well how little we are disposed to do this, and how slow we are in 
sincerely realizing and acknowledging that it is the Lord Who really arranges all our states, and Who 
enables us to know a little of their quality. And as this subject is of considerable interest, the following 
extract is here given:

"So long as man believes that he does all things from himself, both good and evil, so long goods do not
affect him, and evils adhere to him; whereas, as soon as he acknowledges and believes that goods flow 
in from the Lord, and not from himself, and that evils are from hell, in this case goods affect him, and 
evils do not adhere to him; and also in proportion as goods affect him, in the same proportion evils are 
removed, thus he is purified and liberated from them. But so long as the state of man is such that he 
cannot perceive and be sensible of the influx of goods from the Lord, so long he does good works as 
from himself, nevertheless he ought to acknowledge and believe that they are from the Lord; for when 
this is the case, he is also liberated from evils; but to the intent that he may be liberated from evils, that 
acknowledgement must not be the confession of the mouth alone, but the confession of the heart itself.

427

"That a plague denotes the punishment of evil is manifest without explanation. There are three plagues, 
or three punishments, which follow those who attribute to themselves the truths of faith and goods of 
love, or who believe that they merit heaven by their works, for those who attribute to themselves those 
things, believe also that of themselves they merit heaven. These three punishments are: 1. That they 
cannot receive anything of the good of love and of the truth of faith. 2. That evils and falsities 
continually pursue them, 3. And that the truths and goods received from infancy perish. These three 
punishments are signified by the three plagues which were proposed to David by the prophet Gad on 
account of numbering the people, which were: 1. Seven years of famine. 2. A flight of three months 
before enemies. 3. And a pestilence of three days (2 Sam 24:13); for by a famine is signified the defect 
and scarcity of the goods and truths which are of faith and love.... But by flight before enemies, in the 
internal sense, is meant persecution by evils and falsities; for those who attribute to themselves goods 
and truths, are not able to fight against the evils and falsities which are from hell, 9978, which are 
enemies in the spiritual sense;... but by the pestilence is signified the vastation and consumption of 
goods and truths, which have been received from infancy, 7505. By David's choosing the pestilence, 
and by seventy thousand men dying of it, was signified that with the Israelitish and Jewish nation every
truth and good of faith and love was about to perish, which also came to pass, for they did not 
acknowledge the Lord from whom, nevertheless, are all goods and truths. Three days signified to the 
full, and the same was also signified by the seventy thousand men who died," 10219. Thus, therefore, 
we see the consequences of not "numbering our days," spiritually, in the right way (Ps 90:12).

And finally, with regard to the last section of this chapter, it is impossible to supply a very easy 
commentary, on account of the numerous details which might be profitably explained more at large, 
were there space, in accordance with the plan of this work. But let the interested reader carefully go 
over the series of the internal sense here, as given in the parallel column, and compare this with the 
explanation in giving the references, and he will quickly discern the order, beauty, and practical value 
of the internal sense as it refers to the various points involved, as, for example, to the distinction 
between celestial and spiritual principles; between the various degrees of life; and between the internal 
and external affections and powers, denoted by the persons, by the animals and by other things that are 
mentioned in the literal sense.

428

Numbers Chapter 32

SUMMARY OF THE SPIRITUAL SENSE

1. The perception of the natural man from the Lord or the perception of those who are in faith 

and good works in the external church, that various truths, which have been applied to selfish 
purposes, are to be rendered useful to the man of the church, vers. 1-4. 

2. They perceive also that the delights of the external man are to be kept distinct from those of 

the internal man, ver. 5. 

3. But Divine Truth teaches that the spiritual man cannot engage successfully in temptation 

without the co-operation of the natural man; that the separated natural man hinders and 
opposes the progress of the spiritual towards the heavenly life, either causing a long series of 
temptations, or condemnations and vastation, and that therefore a caution is necessary to the 
natural man who desires to enjoy his own peculiar delights, vers. 6-15. 

4. But the new natural man is willing to co-operate with the spiritual man in the subjugation of 

evil, while still desiring to live his own life distinctly; and this is agreeable to Divine Truth, to 
Divine Good, and to the primary truths of the church, vers. 16-32. 

5. And hence it actually happens that those who are in good works, and those who are in faith, in 
the external church come into the possession of the natural powers establishing themselves in 
doctrines of good and truth according te their requirements, vers. 33-38. 

6. And hence, too, it follows that the new will of good is firmly established in the inmost of the 
natural man; the general evil principle being expelled; the interior natural is enlightened and 
confirmed in Divine Truths; and even the sensual man shares in the purification, vers. 39-42. 

THE CONTENTS OF EACH VERSE

1. Now the children of Reuben and the 
children of Gad had a very great 
multitude of cattle: and when they 
saw the land of Jazer, and the land of
Gilead, that, behold, the place was a 
place for cattle; 

2. The children of Gad and the children
of Reuben came and spoke to Moses,
and to Eleazar the priest, and to the 
princes of the congregation, saying, 

1. But those who are in the external church as to faith
in the understanding and as to good works, are 
abundant also as to the natural affections, enjoying
a strong perception of natural truths, and great 
delight in natural affections. 

2. And secondly, such persons, being also influenced 
by Divine Truth and Divine Good, with which they
have connection as to understanding and will, and 
also by the primary truths of the church, have the 
perception, 

429

3. Ataroth, and Dibon, and Jazer, and 
Nimrah, and Heshbon, and Elealeh, 
and Sebam, and Nebo, and B eon, 

4. The land which the LORD smote 

before the congregation of Israel, is a
land for cattle, and your servants 
have cattle. 

5. And they said, If we have found 

grace in your sight, let this land be 
given to your servants for a 
possession; bring us not over Jordan.

6. And Moses said to the children of 
Gad and to the children of Reuben, 
Shall your brethren go to the war, 
and shall you sit here? 

3. That various doctrinals of truth in the external man
relating to natural, spiritual, and celestial things in 
their degrees—namely, to the affection for natural 
truth, the knowledges thereof, and the application 
thereof; the affection for spiritual truth, spiritual 
knowledges, and their application; with the 
affection of celestial truths, celestial knowledges 
and their application— 

4. Have been devoted to the merely natural life, and 
are now subdued by the Lord and rendered useful 
to the man of the church; and that the external man
is delighted with such things and possesses such 
things. 

5. And therefore, they further perceive that, possibly, 
it is according to Divine Good conjoined with 
Divine Truth, that the natural man should enjoy all
natural delights, and is to be distinguished from 
the spiritual man. 

6. But Divine Truth from the Lord insinuates into the 
minds of those who are in the good of life, and in 
faith, and thus in the external church, that the 
spiritual man cannot engage in temptation without 
the co-operation of the natural man, because the 
latter must be in harmony with the former, since 
charity should unite them; 

7. And wherefore discourage you the 
heart of the children of Israel from 
going over into the land which the 
LORD has given them? 

7. That therefore the separated natural man greatly 

hinders the earnest desire of the spiritual man, for 
the heavenly life which is given to him from the 
Lord; 

8. Thus did your fathers, when I sent 

them from Kadesh-barnea to see the 
land. 

8. And that it is even greatly opposed to the spiritual 
man during states of instruction in heavenly 
things. 

9. For when they went up to the valley 
of Eshcol, and saw the land, they 
discouraged the heart of the children 
of Israel, that they should not go into
the land which the LORD had given 
them. 

10. And the LORD'S anger was kindled in
that day, and he swore, saying, 

9. For although thus instructed in the letter of the 

Word, and in the general doctrine of charity, and 
thus enabled to understand the character of the 
heavenly life, yet the natural man has not faith 
springing from love, and is disposed to retard the 
progress of the man of the church toward the 
heavenly state. 

10. And therefore he is averted from the Lord in such 
a state, and evil and falsity are confirmed with 
him, with the perception, 

430

11. Surely none of the men that came up 
out of Egypt, from twenty years old 
and upward, shall see the land which
I swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to 
Jacob; because they have not wholly 
followed me: 

12. Save Caleb the son of Jephunneh the
Kenizzite, and Joshua the son of 
Nun: because they have wholly 
followed the LORD. 

11. That although he has been delivered from the 

absolute dominion of merely natural love, and has 
been instructed, yet in the exercise of his own 
liberty he rejects the heavenly life, which, from the
Lord, is provided not only for the celestial, but 
even for the spiritual and natural man, and this on 
account of wilful disobedience; 

12. But those who are in good from truth and thus 

have the perception of truth, as well as those who 
are in truth and engage in spiritual temptation, 
perseveringly acquire the heavenly life because 
they are obedient to the Lord. 

13. And the LORD'S anger was kindled 

13. And therefore the man of the Spiritual Church is 

against Israel, and he made them 
wander to and fro in the wilderness 
forty years, until all the generation, 
that had done evil in the sight of the 
LORD, was consumed. 

averted from the Lord, and endures a full course of
spiritual temptations, until he is purified from the 
evils of the merely natural life. 

14. And, behold, you are risen up in 
your fathers' stead, an increase of 
sinful men, to augment yet the fierce 
anger of the LORD toward Israel. 

14. But all those who make hereditary evil actual with 
themselves, in the same way avert themselves 
from the Lord, become a corrupted church, and are
vastated. 

15. For if you turn away from after him, 
he will yet again leave them in the 
wilderness; and you shall destroy all 
this people. 

15. And therefore a caution is necessary, lest man 

should turn away from the Lord, and thus either 
prolong the state of temptation, or confirm himself
in evil altogether. 

16. And they came near to him, and said,
We will build sheepfolds here for our
cattle, and cities for our little ones: 

16. Nevertheless, it is still true that the external church

is distinct from the internal, both as to the 
exercises of charity, and as to the formation of 
doctrine from the Word in which are preserved 
incipient good and truth; 

17. But we ourselves will be ready 

17. While yet the natural man is ready to co-operate 

armed to go before the children of 
Israel, until we have brought them to
their place: and our little ones shall 
dwell in the fenced cities because of 
the inhabitants of the land. 

with the spiritual against the powers of evil, until a
state of spiritual rest is obtained; but remains are 
stored up for future use, and are adequately 
defended by the Lord against the influx of evil 
from the hells, in the meantime. 

18. We will not return to our houses, 

18. Nor is the natural man, who co-operates with the 

until the children of Israel have 
inherited every man his inheritance. 

spiritual, content to be in tranquillity and in the 
enjoyment of his own peculiar delights, unless the 
spiritual man is victorious, and each enjoys the 
delight of his own life. 

431

19. For we will not inherit with them on 

the other side Jordan, and forward; 
because our inheritance is fallen to 
us on this side Jordan eastward. 

19. And the man of the external church cannot realize 
the heavenly state of the man of the internal which 
is separated from him even as is the literal sense of
the Word from the spiritual and celestial, because 
it is of Divine Providence that this should be so. 

20. And Moses said to them, If you will 

20. And these truths are confirmed by the Word, 

do this thing; if you will arm 
yourselves to go before the LORD to 
the war, 

21. And every armed man of you will 
pass over Jordan before the LORD, 
until he has driven out his enemies 
from before him, 

22. And the land be subdued before the 
LORD: then afterward you shall 
return, and be guiltless towards the 
LORD, and towards Israel: and this 
land shall be to you for a possession 
before the LORD. 

namely, that if the natural man acts truly, as from 
himself, and is willing to endure spiritual 
temptation, being protected by the truths of the 
Word, 

21. At the same time being elevated into the 

perception of spiritual realities by the Lord until 
evils are entirely subdued, 

22. So that the new heaven for the spiritual is 

adequately formed, then the natural man, in his 
own heaven, which is the ultimate, shall be in a 
state of innocence and truthfulness, and the 
external man shall enjoy his own peculiar life. 

23. But if you will not do so, behold, 

23. But where the external man does not so co-

you have sinned against the LORD: 
and be sure your sin will find you 
out. 

operate, there is aversion from the Lord through 
disobedience, and man will be confirmed in a state
of evil, and will endure its punishment. 

24. Build you cities for your little ones, 
and folds for your sheep; and do that 
which has proceeded out of your 
mouth. 

24. Truly the natural man must remain distinct from 

the spiritual, both as to the preservation of remains
and the reception of charity in appropriate forms 
of doctrine; for he must act entirely according to 
his own understanding of Divine Truth. 

25. And the children of Gad and the 

children of Reuben spoke to Moses, 
saying, Your servants will do as my 
lord commands. 

25. And so it really happens; for those who are in 
good works and in faith, and constitute the 
external church, both perceive and acknowledge 
that the teaching of the internal man is just. 

26. Our little ones, our wives our flocks, 
and all our cattle, shall be there in 
the cities of Gilead: 

26. And hence they have remains and the affection of 

truth internal, and charity and the good of 
innocence external, in the state of natural delight 
received from the Lord. 

27. But your servants will pass over, 
every man that is armed for war, 
before the LORD to battle, as my lord 
says. 

27. While yet they are fully able to co-operate, from 

the Lord, with those in the internal church, or with 
their own internal man in the subjugation of evil 
according to the law of the Lord. 

432

28. So Moses gave charge concerning 
them to Eleazar the priest, and to 
Joshua the son of Nun, and to the 
heads of the fathers' houses of the 
tribes of the children of Israel. 

29. And Moses said to them, If the 

children of Gad and the children of 
Reuben will pass with you over 
Jordan, every man that is armed to 
battle, before the LORD, and the land 
shall be subdued before you; then 
you shall give them the land of 
Gilead for a possession: 

30. But if they will not pass over with 

you armed, they shall have 
possessions among you in the land of
Canaan. 

31. And the children of Gad and the 
children of Reuben answered, 
saying, As the LORD has said to your 
servants, so will we do. 

28. And all this is confirmed by Divine Truth; by the 

good and truth of the interior man; and the primary
truths of the church which govern the external 
man. 

29. And it is further perceived from Divine Truth by 
the spiritual man, that the man of the external 
church who is in good works and in faith must co-
operate with the man of the internal church in 
contending against evil, and that evil must be 
destroyed; in which case the natural man will 
enjoy his own peculiar life. 

30. But if he is unwilling to co-operate with the 
spiritual man, he does not enjoy his own life 
distinctly and in freedom; but is in external 
worship without internal, or in merely selfish 
religion. 

31. Those, however, who are in good works and in 

faith are willing to obey the commandments of the 
Lord; 

32. We will pass over armed before the 
LORD into the land of Canaan, and 
the possession of our inheritance 
shall remain with us beyond Jordan. 

32. They are willing to cooperate with the spiritual 
man in the subjugation of evil; and yet they are 
persistent in having the enjoyment of their own 
peculiar life. 

33. And Moses gave to them, even to the
children of Gad, and to the children 
of Reuben, and to the half tribe of 
Manasseh the son of Joseph, the 
kingdom of Sihon king of the 
Amorites, and the kingdom of Og 
king of Bashan, the land, according 
to the cities thereof with their 
borders, even the cities of the land 
round about. 

33. And it is according to Divine Truth that the natural

man who is in good works and in faith, and who 
also acts from the new will of good, which is from 
the Celestial of the Spiritual, should enjoy all the 
delights of the natural man internal and external in 
harmony therewith. 

34. And the children of Gad built Dibon,

34. And those who are in good works form to 

and Ataroth, and Aroer; 

themselves doctrines concerning the knowledges 
of good in their varieties, namely, those having 
relation to the exterior natural as to truth, as to 
good, and as to innocence. 

433

35. And Atroth-shophan, and Jazer, and 

35. To the interior natural in the same way, 

Jogbehah: 

36. And Beth-nimrah, and Beth-haran: 

fenced cities, and folds for sheep. 

36. And to the inmost of the Natural in the same way, 
all involving Divine Truths in general which 
protect and preserve good. 

37. And the children of Reuben built 
Heshbon, and Elealeh, and 
Kiriathaim; 

37. Also those who are in faith form, in like manner, 
doctrines of truth to themselves, in their varieties 
externally; 

38. And Nebo, and Baal-meon, (their 

names being changed), and Sibmah: 
and gave other names to the cities 
which they builded. 

38. And in their varieties internally, their qualities 
being changed; for, by regeneration, outward 
forms of truth gain a new quality from the new life
of good or charity. 

39. And the children of Machir the son 
of Manasseh went to Gilead, and 
took it, and dispossessed the 
Amorites which were therein. 

39. Also those who are in truths from the new will of 
good, and who are in natural delight, expel from 
such natural delights the general evil principle. 

40. And Moses gave Gilead to Machir 
the son of Manasseh; and he dwelt 
therein. 

40. For Divine Truth from the Lord forms the new 

natural man as to doctrine; and therein he securely 
dwells internally; 

41. And Jair the son of Manasseh went 
and took the towns thereof, and 
called them Havvoth-jair. 

41. While the internal of the natural as to doctrine is 
also regenerated, and has a new quality from the 
truth which is from good there. 

42. And Nobah went and took Kenath, 

42. And lastly the sensual man shares in the 

and the villages thereof, and called it
Nobah, after his own name. 

purification, for he, too, is regenerated as to 
thought and affection, and receives a new heavenly
quality, the outward forms remaining perfect. 

REFERENCES AND NOTES

1. The children of Reuben and the children of Gad having a great multitude of cattle, denotes that
those who are in the external church as to faith in the understanding, and as to good works are 
abundant also in natural affections, 5912, 3863, 3934, 6126; and their seeing the land of Jazer, 
and the land of Gilead that it was a place for cattle, denotes the enjoyment of a strong 
perception of natural truths, and great delight in natural affections, 2150, chap 21:32, 26:29, 
2625. 

2. Their coming and speaking to Moses and to Eleazar the priest and to the princes of the 

congregation, saying, denotes that such persons being also influenced by Divine Truth and 
Divine Good with which they have communication as to the understanding and will, and also 
by the primary truths of the church, have the perception, 1853, 2951, 7010, 9946, 1482, 7843, 
1822.

3. Ataroth, and Dibon, and Jazer, and Nimrah, and Heshbon, and Elealeh, and Sebam, and Nebo, 
and Beon, denote various doctrinals of truth relating to natural, spiritual, and celestial things in
their degrees—namely, to the affection for natural truth, the knowledges thereof, and the 
application thereof; the affection for spiritual truth, the knowledges thereof, and the 
application thereof; with the affection of celestial truths, their knowledges and their 
application, because by Ataroth is meant crowns, and therefore it denotes the affection of 
natural truth, 981821; by Dibon is meant understanding, knowledge, building, and therefore it 
denotes the knowledges of natural truth, chap 21:25, 30; by Jazer is meant he that helps, and 
therefore it denotes doctrine, which aids in the interpretation of the Word, or, in other words, 
the application of knowledge to the ascension of God, or the burnt offering of God, and 
therefore it denotes the affection of spiritual truth, 2702; by Heshbon is meant he that hastens 
to understand—or build, and therefore it denotes the knowledge of spiritual truth, chap 21:25, 
30; by Elealch is meant the ascension of God, or the burnt offering of God, and therefore it 
denotes the application of spiritual truth in worship, 795, 10053; the meaning of Sebam, or 
Sibmah, is not known, and therefore we cannot know its correspondence from the mere 
expression, but we may infer from its position that it denotes the affection for celestial truth 
according to the series, 5114; by Nebo is meant one that speaks, prophesies, or fructifies, and 
therefore it denotes the same as Dibon and Heshbon on the highest plane, namely, celestial 
truth or knowledge, 2951, 2534, 913, chap 21:25, 30; and. by Beon, or Baal-meon, is meant 
the house or habitation of Baal, and therefore it denotes the ultimate, or application of celestial
truth, 2451. 

4. The land which the Lord smote before the congregation, or rather the assembly, of Israel being
a land for cattle, and the Israelites having cattle, denotes that these various affections and 
powers have been devoted to the merely natural life, and are now subdued by the Lord and 
rendered useful to the man of the church; and that the external man is delighted with such 
things and possesses such things, chap 21:25-26, 566, 6126, 1713. 

5. By their saying, is denoted that they further perceive, 1822; by "If we have found grace in 
your sight," is denoted that possibly it is according to Divine Good conjoined with Divine 
Truth, 2423, 2572; by "let this land be given to us for a possession," is denoted that the natural 
man should enjoy all natural delights, ver. 1, 566, 8899, 1713, 5942; and by "bring us not over 
Jordan," is denoted distinction from the spiritual man, 6183, 9011. 

6. Moses saying to the children of Gad and to the children of Reuben, denotes that Divine Truth 
from the Lord insinuates into the minds of those who are in the good of life and in faith, and 
thus are in the external church, 7010, 1822, 5912, 3863, 3934; and "Shall your brethren go to 
the war, and shall you sit here?" denotes that the spiritual man cannot engage in temptation 
without the co-operation of the natural man, because the latter must be in harmony with the 
former, since charity should unite them, 1222, 1664, 9422. 

7.

"And wherefore discourage you the heart of the children of Israel from going over into the 
land which the Lord has given them?" denotes that therefore the separated natural man greatly 
hinders the earnest desire of the spiritual man, for the heavenly life which is given to him by 
the Lord, 5912, 3863, 3934, 8782 on Isa 37:27, 7272, 3654, 901l, 2001, 8899. 

8.

"Thus did your fathers when I sent them from Kadesh-barnea to see the land," denotes that it is
even greatly opposed to the spiritual man during states of instruction in heavenly things, chap 

435

13:29-33, 2397, 2503, 2150, 3705, 8899. Note here that Kadesh-barnea means the holiness of 
an inconstant son, and also the holiness of the fountain of delight, and thus denotes, on the one
hand, the state represented by the rebellious spies, and on the other the state represented by 
those who did not rebel.

9.

"For when they went up into the valley of Eshcol," denotes although they were instructed in 
the letter of the Word, and in the general doctrine of charity, chap 13:23, 1543, 1723, 4715; 
"and saw the land," denotes that they were able to understand the character of the heavenly 
life, 2150, 8899; "they discouraged the heart of the children," denotes that the natural man has 
not faith springing from love, ver. 7; and "that they should not go into the land which the Lord 
had given them," denotes a disposition to retard the progress of the man of the church toward 
the heavenly state, 3335, 8899. 

10. "And the Lord's answer was kindled in that day and He swore, saying," denotes that therefore 

there is aversion from the Lord in such a state, evil and falsity being confirmed in him, with 
the perception 5798, 2842, 1822. 

11. "Surely none of the men that came up out of the land of Egypt," denotes although he has been 
delivered from the absolute dominion of merely natural love, 8866; "from twenty years old 
and upward," denotes a state of instruction and religious experience, 10225; "shall see the land
which I swore to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob," denotes that yet in the exercise of his liberty he 
rejects the heavenly life, which, from the Lord, is provided not only for the celestial, but also 
for the spiritual and natural man, 2150, 8899, 2842, 6098; and "because they have not wholly 
followed me," denotes and this on account of wilful disobedience, 3191. 

12. "Save Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite," denotes those who are in good from truth, 
and thus have the perception of truth, chap 13:6; the meaning of a Kenizzite is uncertain, but 
some think it means a hunter, in which case it will denote one who persuades, 1178, or it may 
mean simply a descendant of Kenaz, Judg 1:13, and then it will mean this possession, this 
purchase, and will therefore denote good acquired by means of truth, 7999; "and Joshua the 
son of Nun," denotes those who are in truth, and engage in spiritual temptation, perseveringly 
acquiring the heavenly life, chap 13:8; and "because they have wholly followed the Lord," 
denotes clearly, because they are obedient to the Lord, 3191, 2001. 

13. "And the Lord's anger was kindled against Israel," denotes that therefore the man of the 

Spiritual Church is averted from the Lord, 5798, 3654; "and he made them wander to and fro 
in the wilderness forty years," denotes the endurance of a full course of spiritual temptations, 
chap 14:33-34; and "until all the generation that had done evil in the sight of the Lord was 
consumed," denotes until he is purified from the evils of the merely natural life, 1145, 4839, 
10431. 

14. "And behold you are risen up in your fathers' stead, an increase of sinful men, to augment yet 
the fierce anger of the Lord toward Israel," denotes that all those who make hereditary evil 
actual with themselves, in the same way avert themselves from the Lord, become a corrupted 
church, and are vastated, 8876, 5076, 5798, 3654, 69975. 

15. "For if you turn away from after him, he will yet again leave them in the wilderness; and you 
shall destroy all this people," denotes that therefore a caution is necessary, lest man should 

436

turn away from the Lord, and thus either prolong the state of temptation, or confirm himself in
evil altogether, 10702, 3191, 2708, 10510. 

16. Their coming near to him and saying, denotes the perception of the external man as distinct 

from the internal, 3863, 3934, 3572, 7010, 1822; "We will build sheepfolds for our cattle and 
cities for our little ones here," denotes, both as to the exercises of charity, and as to the 
formation of doctrine from the Word, "in which are preserved incipient good and truth, 4390, 
20882, 402, 5946. 

17. "But we ourselves will be ready armed to go before the children of Israel," denotes that the 
natural man is ready to co-operate with the spiritual man against the powers of evil, 3863, 
3934, 2686, 3335, 3654; "until we have brought them to their place," denotes until a state of 
spiritual rest is obtained, 5947, 2451, 2625; and "our little ones shall dwell in the fenced cities 
because of the inhabitants of the land," denotes that remains are stored up for future use, and 
are adequately defended by the Lord against the influx of evil from the hells in the meantime, 
3183, 2451, 72973, 10640. 

18. "We will not return to our houses until the children of Israel have inherited every man his 

inheritance," denotes that the natural man who co-operates with the spiritual is not content to 
be in tranquillity, and in the enjoyment of his own peculiar delight, unless the spiritual man is 
victorious, and each enjoys the delight of his own life, 2288, 2233, 3654, 2658. The particular 
Hebrew word used in this verse for "inheritance," according to the last reference, has relation 
to truth rather than to good, and therefore to the External than to the Internal, so that it implies,
in the spiritual sense, that by victory in temptation the External becomes not simply 
submissive to the Internal, but completely harmonious with it, as the furniture of a house does 
when it is properly arranged by its owner according to his peculiar tastes.

19. "For we will not inherit with them on the other side Jordan and forward," denotes that the man 
of the external church cannot realize the heavenly state of the man of the internal, 3863, 3934, 
2658, 10584 on Jer 7:24; and "because our inheritance is fallen to us on this side of Jordan 
eastward," denotes which is separated from him even as is the literal sense of the Word from 
the spiritual and celestial, because it is of Divine Providence that this should be so, 2658, 
9927, 1585, 4300. 

20. Moses saying to them denotes that these truths are confirmed by the Word, 7010, 1822; and "if
you will do this thing; if you will arm yourselves to go before the Lord to the war," denotes 
that if the natural man acts truly, as from himself, and is willing to endure spiritual 
temptations, being protected by the truths of the Word, 4258, 1288, 5075, 2686, 3335, 2001, 
1664. 

21. "And every armed man of you will pass over Jordan before the Lord, until he has driven out 
his enemies from before him," denotes at the same time being elevated into the perception of 
spiritual realities by the Lord, until evils are entirely subdued, 2686, 1585, 2001, 10638, 9313, 
9306. 

22. "And the land be subdued before the Lord," denotes so that the new heaven for the Spiritual is 

adequately formed, 6858, 8054; "then afterwards you shall return and be guiltless before the 
Lord," denotes that then the natural man, in his own heaven, which is the ultimate, shall be in a
state of innocence and truthfulness, 3863, 3934, 2288, 9262, 9306, 2001, 3654, 8054; "and this

437

land shall be to you for a possession before the Lord," denotes that the external man shall 
enjoy his own peculiar life, 2028, 2029. 

23. "But if you will not do so, behold you have sinned against the Lord; and be sure your sin will 
find you out," denotes that where the external man does not so co-operate, there is aversion 
from the Lord through disobedience, and man will be confirmed in a state of evil, and will 
endure its punishment, 3863, 3934, 2686, 5076, 1857. 

24. "Build you cities for your little ones, and folds for your sheep; and do that which has 

proceeded out of your mouth," denotes that truly the natural man must remain distinct from 
the spiritual both as to the preservation of remains and the reception of charity in appropriate 
forms of doctrine; for he must act entirely according to his own understanding of Divine Truth,
4309, 20882, 402, 5946, 3313, 6987. 

25. The children of Gad and the children of Reuben speaking to Moses, saying, "Your servants 
will do as my lord commands," denotes that those who are in good works and in faith, and 
constitute the external church, both perceive and acknowledge that the teaching of the internal 
man is just, 3863, 3934, 2951, 7010, 1822, 2541, 4258, 2921, 5486. 

26. "Our little ones, our wives, our flocks, and all our cattle, shall be there in the cities of Gilead," 

denotes that hence they have remains, and the affections of truth internal and charity and the 
good of innocence external, in the state of natural delight received from the Lord, 5946, 20882,
6134, 402, 4117. 

27. "But your servants will pass over, every man that is armed for war, before the Lord to battle, 
as my lord says," denotes that yet they are fully able to co-operate, from the Lord, with those 
in the internal church, or with their own internal man, in the subjugation of evil, according to 
the law of the Lord, 2541, 4255, 2686, 1664, 2001, 2921, 1822, 7010. 

28. Moses giving charge concerning them to Eleazar the priest, and to Joshua the son of Nun, and 
to the heads of the fathers' houses of the tribes of the children of Israel, denotes that all this is 
confirmed by Divine Truth; by the good and truth of the interior man; and by the primary 
truths of the church which govern the external man, 7010, 3382, 9946, 8595, 3728, 7833, 
3858, 3654,

29. Moses saying to them, denotes perception from Divine Truth by the spiritual man, 7010, 1822,
3654; "If the children of Gad and the children of Reuben will pass with you over Jordan, every
man that is armed to battle, before the Lord, and the land be subdued before you," denotes that
the man of the external church who is in good works and in faith must co-operate with the man
of the internal church, in contending against evil; and that evil must be destroyed, 3934, 3863, 
4255, 2686, 1664, 554; and "then you shall give them the land of Gilead for a possession," 
denotes that in this case the natural man will enjoy his own peculiar life, 9946, 8595, 8899, 
4117. 2028, 2029. 

30. "But if they will not pass over with you armed, they shall have possessions among you in the 

land of Canaan," denotes that if the natural man is unwilling to co-operate with the spiritual 
man, he does not enjoy his own life distinctly and in freedom, but is in external worship 
without internal, or in merely selfish religion, 3863, 3934, ver. 29, 2028, 2029, 1063. 

438

31. The children of Gad and the children of Reuben answering and saying, "As the Lord has said 
to your servants so will we do," denotes that those who are in good works and in faith are 
willing to obey the commandments of the Lord, 3934, 3863, 2919, 2001, 1822, ver. 25. 

32. "We will pass over armed before the Lord into the land of Canaan, and the possession of our 
inheritance shall remain with us beyond Jordan," denotes that they are willing to co-operate 
with the spiritual man in the subjugation of evil, and yet they are persistent in having the 
enjoyment of their own peculiar life, vers. 19, 29. 

33. Moses giving them, even to the children of Gad and to the children of Reuben, and to the half 
tribe of Manasseh the son of Joseph, the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites, and the 
kingdom of Og king of Bashan, the land according to the cities thereof, with their borders even
the cities of the land round about, denotes that it is according to Divine Truth that the natural 
man who is in good works and in faith, and who also acts from the new will of good, which is 
from the Celestial of the Spiritual, should enjoy all the delights of the natural man internal and 
external in harmony therewith, 7010, 8899, 3863, 3934, 6275, 45924, chap 21:23, 33, 402, 
7643, 2973. 

34. The children of Gad building Dibon, and Ataroth and Aroer, denotes that those who are in 
good works form to themselves doctrines concerning the knowledges of good in their 
varieties, namely, those having relation to the exterior natural, as to truth, as to good, and as to 
innocence, because by the children of Gad are denoted those in good works, 3934; to build 
cities denotes to form doctrines, 1187; Dibon denotes the knowledges of natural truth, ver. 3; 
Ataroth denotes the affection of natural truth, ver. 3; and by Aroer is meant naked, bare, and 
therefore it denotes, in the best sense, innocence, or, more particularly, the doctrine relating 
thereto, 402, 165. 

35. And Atroth-shophan, and Jazer, and Jogbehah, denotes to the interior natural in the same way, 
because by Atroth-shophan is meant what is crowned, or covered or concealed, and therefore it
denotes the same as Ataroth more interiorly, ver. 3; Jazer denotes doctrine which aids in the 
interpretation of the Word, or in the application of knowledge to use, ver. 3; and by Jogbehah 
is meant what is lofty, it is said, but not with certainty; but if so it will denote doctrine relating 
to motives of life, still more interiorly, 2148. 

36. And Beth-nimrah, and Beth-haran: fenced cities and folds for sheep, denote to the inmost of 

the natural in the same way, where is the conjunction between the Natural and the Spiritual; all
involving Divine Truths in general, which protect and preserve good, because Beth-nimrah 
denotes the affection of spiritual truth, ver. 3; and by Beth-haran is meant the house of 
consecration, and therefore it denotes inmost devotion, chap 18:14, 8042; and fenced cities 
and folds for sheep denote Divine Truths in general which protect and preserve good, ver. 16. 

37. The children of Reuben building Heshbon, and Elealeh, and Kiriathaim, denotes that those 
who are in faith form, in like manner, doctrines of truth to themselves in their varieties 
externally, because the children of Reuben denote those who are in faith, 3863; to build cities 
denotes to form doctrines, 1187; Heshbon denotes the knowledges of spiritual truth, ver. 3; 
Elealeh denotes the application of spiritual truth in worship, ver. 3; and by Kiriathaim is meant
the two cities, and therefore it denotes the conjunction of truth and good in doctrine, 5194, 
402. 

439

38. And Nebo, and Baal-meon, and Sibmah, their names being changed, denotes, in their varieties 
internally, their qualities being changed, for by regeneration outward forms of truth gain a new
quality from the new life of good or charity, because Nebo denotes celestial truth or 
knowledge; Baal-meon denotes the application of this to life; and Sibmah denotes the affection
for celestial truth, ver. 3; while by their names being changed is denoted the new quality of 
outward forms acquired by regeneration, 145. 

39. The children of Machir the son of Manasseh going to Gilead, and taking it, and dispossessing 
the Amorites which were therein, denotes that those who are in truths from the new will of 
good, and who are in natural delights, expel from such natviral delights the general evil 
principle, chap 26:29, 1857. 

40. Moses giving Gilead to the son of Manasseh, and his dwelling therein, denotes that Divine 
Truth from the Lord forms the new-natural man, as to doctrine, and that therein he securely 
dwells internally, 7010, 8899, 4117, 489, chap 26:29. 

41. Jair the son of Manasseh going and taking the towns thereof, and calling them Havvoth-jair, or
the towns of Jair, denotes that the internal of the Natural as to doctrine is also regenerated, and 
has a new quality from the truth which is from good there, because Jair means one who is 
enlightened, and therefore denotes truth from good, 3195; the towns of Gilead denote the 
external of the Natural, 402, 4117; and calling them Havvoth-jair denotes a new quality, 145. 

42. Nobah going and taking Kenath and the villages, or daughters, thereof, and calling it Nobah 

after his own name, denotes that the sensual man shares in the purification, and is regenerated,
having also a new quality from truth which is from good there, because Nobah means barking 
like a dog, and therefore denotes those in truth from good in the lowest or sensual man, 9231; 
Kenath means possession, and therefore it denotes the sensual man regenerated, 2028, 2029; 
villages, or daughters, denote affections, 489; and a new name denotes a new quality, 145. 

DISCUSSION

In order clearly to understand the internal sense of this whole chapter, it will be useful to observe that 
the part of the promised land on the eastern side of the river Jordan denotes, generally speaking, the 
natural man as distinguished from the spiritual and celestial man, which are denoted by the part on the 
western side of that river. And that the natural man regenerated forms a part of the Lord's heavenly 
kingdom is plain from the following remarkable words: "God has spoken in His holiness; I will exult: I 
will divide Shechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth. Gilead is mine, and Manassch is mine; 
Ephraim also is the defence of mine head; Judah is my sceptre, or lawgiver, Moab is my washpot; upon
Edorn will I cast my shoe; Philistia, shout you because of me. Who will bring me to the strong city? 
Who has led me to Edom?" (Ps 60:6-9). For it is evident that each of the names here used, and called 
His possessions by God Himself, must contain a spiritual sense, Gilead and Manasseh as distinguished 
from Ephraim, and Judah plainly signifying what is external in the church, and in heaven, as compared 
with what is internal. The parts of the country, therefore, assigned to the tribes of Reuben, of Gad, and 
of Manasseh denote the natural man regenerated, or in the course of regeneration; and the conquest of 
these parts by the Israelites shows that the natural man is to be brought into subjection by the spiritual 
man as a preliminary step in man's heavenward progress. And considering that Reuben signifies faith in
the understanding, and Gad, good works, while Manasseh denotes the new will of good, according to 
the correspondences, we also see why those tribes came into the possession of the district that had 

440

formed the kingdoms of Sihon king of the Amorites and Og the king of Bashan, and the representation 
is that the merely natural man must be subdued, and become the possession of the spiritual man.

But now, our first two sections teach very plainly that, although the corrupted natural will and 
understanding are indeed to be destroyed as the Amorites were, yet the natural man itself is not to lose 
its identity, and its distinctness in the regenerated state. And, more than this, the new natural man is not 
only to remain distinct from the spiritual man, but, in the heavenly state, he is actually to be delighted 
with and to cultivate all his natural affections, appropriately denoted by the cattle, and all his natural 
intellectual powers, not even excluding what relates to the proper use of the outward senses, which are 
denoted by the various cities named. And, indeed, this is very important and practical spiritual 
instruction. For the regenerating man, in the beginning of his warfare, is very apt to imagine, as history 
shows, that the natural affections and powers are really to be crushed out of existence when a man 
devotes himself to the service of the Lord. But our chapter shows that this is not the truth; and, in fact, 
that there is no natural affection or power which cannot be consecrated for heavenly uses, or which 
cannot minister, in its proper place, to the development of the celestial and spiritual life.

Nor should we fail to notice, in our careful study of the subject before us in these sections, the 
wonderful adaptability of the names and thus of the correspondences of the various places mentioned to
the requirements of the internal sense. For we must remember that a single name wrongly applied 
would have broken the continuity of the series; nor would it have been possible for any person, without
ascertaining the meaning of the names, and thence their correspondences, to have discerned the 
particular spiritual import of each, and thence the properly connected spiritual series involved. And 
these remarks are applicable not only to the particulars of this chapter, but also to those of the following
chapter especially, as we shall see. Also, from these considerations we may be led, more and more to 
confirm ourselves in the truth that only the Lord Himself could have caused the Word to be written so 
as to contain, in every expression, Divine Wisdom so wonderfully clothed in human language.

The first verse of the third section shows that, in the progress of regeneration, yea, even when it is 
advanced, there is disagreement between the natural and spiritual man, because the former appears to 
be reluctant to engage in the spiritual warfare, and not to recognize that there should be co-operation, 
while the latter is disturbed by this appearance, not, in that state, discerning the cause of it. For 
although the external or natural man may desire, in an orderly way, to enjoy and cultivate his proper 
natural powers, he may not be unwilling to fight in the great battle of life, side by side with the spiritual
man, because he may be, in his own degree, a recipient of good from the Lord. And the lesson for us 
here, therefore, is that interior men, such as are or may be represented by Moses, should not misjudge 
exterior men, who are, in reality, equally conscientious with themselves. But proceeding according to 
the series, we learn, or are reminded on reflection, that the merely natural man greatly hinders the 
spiritual man in his eagerness to attain to the heavenly life, and is, in itself, opposed to the investigation
of heavenly principles by means of holy truths from the Word received with delight. And who has not 
at some time in his life felt in himself such opposition? For the natural man is instructed, indeed, 
according to his state in the genuine truths of the spiritual life, and also in the doctrine of charity, but 
from himself he has not faith springing from love, and fears to encounter his spiritual adversaries, so 
that he is averted from the Lord and is disposed to confirm himself in evil.

But the rest of this section, in its inner sense, impresses upon us some weighty truths in connection with
the Lord's work of redemption, which is represented by the deliverance of the Israelites from Egyptian 
bondage. For we here see that, notwithstanding that every one has been redeemed, by the preservation 
of the freedom of the human race to choose either the life of evil or the life of good, yet no person is 

441

compelled, and the consequences of an evil life or of a good life still remain the same. That is, a life of 
disobedience to the laws of Divine Order either retards the progress of man, in regeneration by a long 
course of temptation signified by the forty years' wandering, or it causes total vastation as to all true 
spiritual life, since we read that "when man is in temptation, he is in a vastation as to all things that 
pertain to his proprium, and those things which are corporeal, for whatever belongs to the proprium or 
is corporeal must die, and indeed by combats and temptations, before he is born again a new man, or 
before he becomes spiritual and celestial, therefore the forty days and nights denote the duration of 
vastation. The same meaning is here involved, the subject treated of being both the temptation of the 
man of the new church, called Noah, and the devastation of the antediluvians," 730. 

In the fourth section, again, there are also some interesting and practical truths in the spiritual sense. 
And the first is that the natural man is submissive to the spiritual, although it appears all through as if 
he might not continue to be so, because doubt is expressed by Moses even to the end. Now, this is just 
how it happens in the church. The man of the external church, who is a faithful servant of the Lord, 
may really be as conscientious and earnest in his determination to do his duty as the man of the internal
church, and yet the latter, equally conscientious and true, may not quite understand his brother in some 
things; and thus each ought to be considerate, and both have to learn that they have their specific uses 
in the kingdom of the Lord. Let us now, therefore, sec what the natural man requires. He must have 
doctrines of good, denoted by the sheepfolds, and doctrines of truth denoted by the cities, adapted to his
external affections, and to his interior delights grounded in innocence. For, considered as an individual, 
he is to remain a natural man in the ultimate heaven to eternity. And we see from the series that the 
spiritual man, on consideration, recognizes the truth of this. And, moreover, the spiritual man himself, 
and even the celestial man, each in his own heaven, has his corresponding natural man; and also, during
regeneration, passed through the preparatory states in which that natural man was led by the Lord. And 
this is worthy of notice just here, as we have pointed out, the Lord says, "Gilead is mine, and Manasseh
is mine." But this may be interpreted in its several senses. As applied to the Lord's glorification it 
means that He made His Human Divine even to the ultimate; the celestial man also was regenerated, 
and was first in the merely natural state, 286; the spiritual man had the same experience, 18; and, in 
short, every man is first, during his spiritual training and trial, introduced into the delights of the natural
life, in order that he may learn properly to use his natural powers. But as to this read 4117. 

But, all the same, the regenerating natural man knows, as we learn in the next place, that he must 
establish spiritual and celestial life in himself, and be connected therewith by influx and 
correspondence, in order that he may be a true natural man; and therefore he knows that he must fight 
the good fight of faith, so to speak, side by side with his brethren. And so he, too, puts on the whole 
armour of God, namely, the breastplate of righteousness; the shoes of iron and brass, which are the 
literal truth and good of the Word (Deut 33:25); the shield of faith; the helmet of salvation; and the 
sword of the Spirit, which is the inner truth of the Word, and does not rest from the warfare until the 
victory is gained, and his internal man is in peace, so that he also may go home to his place.

But, then, in the meantime, we must not forget the natural man is under the Lord's protection; for 
although, as of himself, he builds the sheepfolds and the cities, yet he knows that "Except the Lord 
build the house, they labour in vain that build it; except the Lord keeps the city, the watchman wakes 
but in vain" (Ps 127:1); and he has a clear perception also, "that the man of the external church cannot 
realize the heavenly state of the man of the internal, which is separated from him even as is the literal 
sense of the Word from the spiritual and celestial, because it is of the Divine Providence that this 
should be so" (ver. 19). For casting lots, in the best sense, signifies full submission to the will of the 
Lord. These things, therefore, are the essential truths of the fourth section.

442

In the fifth and sixth sections, however, we are spiritually instructed regarding two points. The first is 
that all the operations of Divine Providence do not in the least interfere with the freedom and reason of 
man; that those who freely act, according to good and truth and thus in harmony with Divine 
Providence are regenerated; and, consequently, that those who do not so act cannot be regenerated. For 
it is of the Lord's appointment that every person may be saved who so chooses; that if any one does not 
so choose he acts contrary to the Lord's will; and that yet the Divine Being controls all things and 
provides nothing but good for all mankind. For which reason it happens that even the wicked in the 
hells are not deprived of their life; that, by permission, they surfer terribly whenever they violate 
Divine laws on their own plane of life; and that with every one of them the fear of punishment finally 
overcomes the love of doing evil. But the other point above referred to is that the natural man is 
regenerated, and fully enjoys his own proper life to eternity, because, by the power of the Lord, he has 
finally overcome not only all evil and falsity in general, as represented by the Amorites with their king 
Sihon, but all evil and falsity essentially, that is, selfish love and its delusions, which are signified by 
the Amorites with their ruler, Og the king of Bashan. And herein we see that it is impossible that good 
and evil can continue to co-exist to eternity in any human being.

But, finally, in addition to this our last two sections emphatically teach, in their internal sense, that the 
heavenly life is a life of perfect order, in which, even on the natural plane, every voluntary faculty and 
every intellectual faculty has its appointed place and its appointed function, which state of perfection is 
fully represented, first by the division of the country on the eastern side of the river Jordan into three 
distinct districts, assigned respectively to the Gadites, the Reubenites, and the Manassites, who denote 
successively good works, faith, and charity; the Gadites, occupying the central district, in order to show
that good works, or the good of life, is the united expression in ultimates of charity on the one hand, 
and of faith on the other. And, secondly, the state of heavenly perfection is further represented by the 
mention of the various cities in the respective divisions of the country, the very meaning of the names 
in each case corresponding to certain spiritual principles in a series, and thus indicating, in a very 
remarkable manner, the great exactness with which each term is applied in the composition of the Holy 
Word, abundantly demonstrating, indeed, that it cannot be of any merely human origin, but must 
incontrovertibly be what it affirms itself to be, namely, the Word of the Lord, wonderfuly adapted, by 
the law of correspondence, to be alike an eternal source of instruction for angels and for men; and, 
more than that, an eternal means of conjunction between heaven and earth and between human beings 
and the Lord, not only generally but individually. For the Lord teaches every one by the Word cither 
directly or indirectly, since nothing but the truths of the Word can enable any one to become 
regenerated, and thus to enter into the kingdom of heaven.

Numbers Chapter 33

SUMMARY OF THE SPIRITUAL SENSE

1. The subject of whole chapter is the changes of state through which the man of the church 
passes in the course of regeneration, which are all inscribed on his memory, vers. 1-2. 

2. The first general state includes deliverance from evil, a state of instruction, and some 

preparatory states of temptation, vers. 1-15. 

3. The second general state involves more temptations, and a gradual advance towards a state of 

the good of truth or of charity, accompanied by successive states of instruction and a 
realization of more distinct states of natural delight in good and truth, vers. 16-36. 

4. And the third general state describes other states of temptation, during which there is a decline

to a state of adulterated good, vers. 37-49. 

5. But now revelation follows concerning deliverance from this temptation, and an advance into 
the heavenly state in which evils and errors are to be entirely abolished, or removed, because 
otherwise falsities would obscure the light of truth, weaken the life of charity, and pervert the 
life of love to the Lord, vers. 50-56. 

THE CONTENTS OF EACH VERSE

1. These are the journeys of the 

children of Israel, when they went 
forth out of the land of Egypt by 
their hosts under the hand of Moses 
and Aaron. 

1. These are the changes of state through which the 
man of the Spiritual Church passes, when he is 
delivered from the bondage of the merely natural 
man, by means of Divine Truths in their 
ordination and arrangement, in subordination to 
the power of Divine Truth and Divine Good: 

2. And Moses wrote their goings out 
according to their journeys by the 
commandment of the LORD: and 
these are their journeys according to
their goings out. 

2. And these states are all inscribed on the memory 
of the man of that church, in their succession 
according to the laws of Divine Order in 
proceeding from states of evil to states of 
instruction in truth and good, or in declining from 
truth and good to states of evil. 

444

3. And they journeyed from Rameses 
in the first month, on the fifteenth 
day of the first month; on the 
morrow after the passover the 
children of Israel went out with an 
high hand in the sight of all the 
Egyptians, 

3. But separation from falsity and evil which are 

destructive of the heavenly life, first takes place 
when faith in the Lord commences, and this in a 
new state of spiritual life involving deliverance 
from evil, purification, and conjunction with the 
Lord, the Divine power being manifested even 
before those who are in evil, 

4. While the Egyptians were burying 
all their firstborn, which the LORD 
had smitten among them: upon their
gods also the LORD executed 
judgements. 

4. For in the Judgement, the wicked freely reject all 
faith in the Lord, because they reject all charity 
and love, and are confirmed in the falsities of their
evil. 

5. And the children of Israel journeyed

from Rameses, and pitched in 
Succoth. 

5. But the good are delivered from the falsity of evil,
and are brought into a holy state of truth derived 
from good, 

6. And they journeyed from Succoth, 
and pitched in Etham, which is in 
the edge of the wilderness. 

6. This being succeeded by another state in which 

the power of truth is increased, because a state of 
temptation is impending, and consequent 
obscurity. 

7. And they journeyed from Etham, 
and turned back to Pi-hahiroth, 
which is before Baal-zephon: and 
they pitched before Migdol. 

8. And they journeyed from before 
Hahiroth, and passed through the 
midst of the sea into the wilderness: 
and they went three days' journey in
the wilderness of Etham, and 
pitched in Marah. 

9. And they journeyed from Marah, 

and came to Elim: and in Elim were 
twelve springs of water, and 
threescore and ten palm trees; and 
they pitched there. 

7. Hence there is a decline from good, because man 
is not yet prepared, and the way must be opened 
by the excitement of hidden evils, when truth 
operates from above and within, and evil from 
below and without. 

8. So that there is in this temptation a full 

manifestation of the power of Hell, succeeded by 
obscurity as to the life of truth, and followed by 
aversion therefrom. 

9. But now follows consolation, with enlightenment 
and affection, because there is abundance of truth,
and a full state of the holy good of truth. 

10.And they journeyed from Elim, and 

10.And yet again the state is changed, and evils are 

pitched by the Red Sea.

37.But the third period must involve further

arising from the corrupted natural man;

places: 

falsities external and internal are to be removed;

to be destroyed; 

53.And you shall take possession of the
land, and dwell therein: for to you 
have I given the land to possess it.

Journeying from Rameses and pitching in Succoth, denotes that the goods are delivered from 
the falsity of evil and are brought into a holy state of truth derived from good, because by 
Succoth is meant booths or tents, and therefore It denotes a holy state of truth from good, ver. 
3, 4392, 7972. 

Journeying from Succoth and pitching in the valley of Etham, which is in the edge of the 
wilderness, denotes succession to a state in which the power of truths is increased, because a 
state of temptation is impending, and consequent obscurity, 1457, ver. 5, 1616, 1723, 7643, 
2708. But Etham means their strength, and thus denotes the increase of the power of truth, 
3727 end.

Journeying from Etham, and turning back to Pi-hahiroth, which is before Baal-zephon: and 
pitching before Migdol, denotes that hence there is a decline from good, because man is not 
yet prepared, and the way must be opened by the excitement of hidden evils, when truth 
operates from above and within, and evil from below and without, because journeying from 
Etham denotes a decline from good, since man is not yet prepared for temptation, ver. 6; 
turning back denotes declension to evil, 2454; by Pi-hahiroth is meant the mouth of the 
caverns, or the opening of liberty, and thus it denotes the opening of the way for temptation by
the excitement of hidden evils, 8910, 2463, 9801, 2874; by Baal-zephon is meant the idol, or 
lord, of the north, also the lord of -what is hidden, and therefore it denotes the concealed 
operation of evil, 10642, 1605; and by Migdol is meant a tower, and therefore it denotes the 
operation of truth from above, 4599, 8129, 8130. 

Journeying from before Hahiroth and passing through the midst of the sea into the wilderness, 
denotes a full manifestation of the power of hell succeeded by obscurity as to the life of truth, 
1457, ver. 7, 8205, 2708; and going three days' journey in the wilderness of Etham and 
pitching in Marah, denotes a state of aversion as to truth, 3335, 8347, 2708, ver. 6, 1616, 8349,
8350. 

It is to be observed that what is called in this verse the wilderness of Etham, is called in 
Exodus xv. the wilderness of Shur; and a comparison of the signification of Shur, 8346, with 
that of Etham will show the reason of this, namely, that in this case it is the power of truth in 
temptations that is described, whereas in Exodus it is the weakness of truth which has not yet 
gained life on account of the power of falsity from evil, Shur meaning an enemy and a wall, 
and thus denoting evil and its falsity, 2851, 6419. 

9.

Journeying from Marah and coming to Elim denotes progress to a state of consolation; for by 
Elim is meant rams, and thus it denotes internal or spiritual good, with its innocence, ver. 8, 
10042; twelve springs of water denote abundance of truth, 8367-8; seventy palm-trees denote 
a full state of the holy good of truth, 8369; and pitching there evidently denotes the enjoyment 
of that state, 1616. 

451

10. Journeying from Elim and pitching by the Red Sea denotes that yet again the state is changed, 

evils from the hells being again operative, ver. 9, 8205. 

11. Journeying from the Red Sea, and pitching in the wilderness of Sin, denotes leading to the 

obscurity of truth, and discontent, because by Sin is meant bush, or clay, and therefore.it 
denotes a state of the obscurity of truth and of discontent, ver. 10, 2708, 273, 6669, 6832, 
8398. 

12. Journeying from the wilderness of Sin, and pitching in Dophkah, denotes stronger promptings 
from evil following, because this word is under a root which means to beat or to drive as 
applied to cattle, and thus it denotes stronger promptings from evil, 1457, ver. 11. 1616, 9081. 

13. Journeying from Dophkah and pitching in Alush denotes the increasing power of infernal false
persuasions, because by Alush is meant a lion's den, and therefore it denotes such persuasions,
ver. 12, 6367. 

14. Journeying from Alush and pitching in Rephidim, where was no water for the people to drink, 
denotes succession to a state of temporary peace and rest with a scarcity as to truths, because 
by Rephidim is meant beds or places of rest, and therefore it denotes a state of peace and rest, 
accompanied by an arrangement of truths to undergo temptations, 7353, 7354, 8561, 2702, 
3168. 

15. Journeying from Rephidim and pitching in the wilderness of Sinai, denotes that consequently 

Divine Revelation follows, giving instruction in truths, through a state of obscure good, this 
being the conclusion of the first general state of the man of the church, because Sinai probably
has the same meaning, generally, as Sin, 1457, ver. 14, 1616, ver. 11, 8753. 

16. Journeying from the wilderness of Sinai, and pitching in Kibroth-hattaavah, denotes that after 
states of instruction further states of temptation succeed, the first of which is from the lusts of 
the flesh, that is, from sensual and corporeal affections of various kinds, because Kibroth-
hattaavah means the graves of lust, ver. 15, 8452, chap 11:34. 

17. Journeying from Kibroth-hattaavah and pitching in Hazeroth, denotes that a state of external 
tranquillity follows, during which, nevertheless, the truth is profaned and falsified by being 
separated from good, or from things interior, and applied to selfish purposes, because by 
Hazeroth is meant a village, a court, or a porch, and therefore it denotes what is external, and 
there Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moses, 3270, 3271, chap. xii. throughout.

18. Journeying from Hazeroth and pitching in Rithmah, denotes that after this succeeds another 
state of obscurity arising from inferior perception as to truths, because by Rithmah is meant 
broom, which being a shrub growing in the wilderness, therefore denotes obscurity of 
perception as to truth, ver. 17, 2682. 

19. Journeying from Rithmah and pitching in Rimmon-perez, denotes passage to a state of simple 
obedience to good from truths, accompanied by fluctuations as the result of the obscurity, 
because by Rimmon is meant a pomegranate, and by perez is meant a breach, and therefore 
they denote, when taken together, obedience with fluctuations, ver. 18, 9552, 9163. It is said 
"obedience" because a pomegranate denotes good, and as a fruit, good in act, 1873, and 
"fluctuation" because breaches imply this spiritually.

452

20. Journeying from Rimmon-perez and pitching in Libnah, denotes that thence arises a more 

advanced state as to exterior truths, because by Libnah is meant whiteness, and thus it denotes 
truths, ver. 19, 3993s. 

21. Journeying from Libnah and pitching in Rissah, denotes succession to a state of peace and 
tranquillity, because by Rissah is meant watering, or distillation or dnv, and thus a state of 
tranquillity is indicated, ver. 20, 93. 

22. Journeying from Rissah and pitching in Kehelalhah, denotes then by a more perfect 

arrangement of truths under the good of truth, because by Kehelathah is meant assembly, or 
congregation, and therefore it denotes such arrangement, ver. 21, 6338. 

23. Journeying from Kehelathah, and pitching in mount Shepher, denotes resulting in a state of 
natural delight in good and truth, because by mount Shepher is meant pleasantness, beauty, 
and therefore it denotes what is delightful, ver. 22, 994, 553. 

24. Journeying from mount Shepher and pitching in Haradah, denotes which produces a state of 
holy fear and reverence, because by Haradah is meant fear or trembling, and thus it denotes 
this spiritually, ver. 23, 5459. 

25. Journeying from Haradah and pitching in Makheloth, denotes that this state is followed by a 
still closer drawing together of truths, because by Makheloth is meant congregations or 
assemblies, ver. 24, 6338. 

26. Journeying from Makheloth and pitching in Tahath, denotes that now follows a state of 

submission to the Divine Will, because by Tahath is meant under, and therefore it denotes 
submission, ver. 25, 1937. 

27. Journeying from Tahath and pitching in Terah, denotes greater freedom of life, a grateful 

sphere of good, and a wider extension of truths, because by Terah is meant to breathe, scent, 
blow, and therefore it denotes the things named, ver, 26, 97, 9229, 4628. 

28. Journeying from Terah and pitching in Mithkah, denotes another state of natural delight, 

because by Mithkah is meant sweetness, and therefore, like honey, it denotes natural delight, 
ver. 27, 5620. 

29. Journeying from Mithkah and pitching in Hashmorah, denotes succession to renewed activity 
of the understanding, because by Hashmonah is meant diligence, or enumeration, or embassy, 
or present, and thus it denotes the activity of the understanding, ver. 28, 8360, 10217, 4239, 
5619. 

30. Journeying from Hashmonah and pitching in Moseroth, denotes resulting in more definite 

instruction, and a strengthening of external and internal bonds, because by Moseroth is meant 
erudition, or discipline, or bonds, and therefore it denotes the things named, ver. 29, 38204, 
1937, 9096. 

31. Journeying from Moseroth and pitching in Bene-jaakan, denotes that now follows in order, 
first a state of instruction in interior truths, because by Bene-jaakan is meant the sons of 
Jaakan who possessed certain Beeroth, or wells, and thus the place called Bene-jaakan or 
Beeroth denotes instruction in truths, ver. 30, 489, 2702. 

453

32. Journeying from Bene-jaakan and pitching in Hor-haggidgad, denotes a succeeding state of 

good in act, or of good works, because by Hor-haggidgad is meant the mountain of felicity, or 
of a troop, and therefore if denotes good works, ver. 31, 795, 3934. 

33. Journeying from Hor-haggidgad and pitching in Jotbathah, denotes, thirdly, a state of interior 
happiness and delight, because by Jotbathah is meant seeming good or happy, since it is under 
a root with this meaning, and denotes happiness spiritually, ver. 32, 6392. 

34. Journeying from Jotbathah and pitching in Abronah, denotes fourthly, a further advance in 

interior good, because by Abronah is meant a mountain pass, and therefore it denotes an 
advance in interior states, ver. 33, 795, 5338. 

35. Journeying from Abronah and pitching in Ezion-geber, denotes fifthly, a state of strengthened 

exterior good and truth, because by Ezion-geber is meant the counsel of the strong man, and 
thus it denotes such a state, as appears from the fact that Ezion-geber was a part of Edom 
which denotes natural good with doctrine adjoined, ver. 34. 3322.

36. Journeying from Ezion-geber and pitching in the wilderness of Zin, the same being Kadesh, 

denotes lastly a full state of the good of truth, or of charity, the result of all previous trials, and 
the conclusion of the second period of preparation for heaven, 1457, ver. 35, 1616, 2708, chap 
27:14. 

37. Journeying from Kadesh, and pitching in mount Hor in the edge of the land of Edom, denotes 
that the third period must involve further temptations, and first therefore apparent removal 
from the good of truth to a state of desolation arising from the corrupted natural man, because 
by mount Hor is denoted a state of desolation as to good and truth, chap 20:22, 1675, ver. 36, 
7643, 3322. 

38. Aaron the priest going up to mount Hor and dying there, denotes through which corrupted 

natural good is rejected, chap 20:24-29; at the commandment of the Lord in the fortieth year 
after the children of Israel were come out of the land of Egypt, denotes when the state of 
temptation is completed, and the man of the church is entirely delivered from the 
predominance of natural love, 5486, 730, 3654, 8866; and in the fifth month, on the first day 
of the month, denotes when there is little remains of faith, 5291, 851, 7891. 

39. Aaron being a hundred and twenty and three years old, when he died in mount Hor, denotes 

that with those who are in heavenly good remains are full in all respects, 9946, 575. 

40. The Canaanite the king of Arad, which dwelt in the south in the land of Canaan, hearing of the
coming of the children of Israel, denotes that the rational faculty of the merely natural man, 
which rules with those who are in external worship without internal, and appears to be in the 
light of truth, is then subdued, chap 21:1-3. 

41. Journeying from mount Hor, and pitching in Zalmonah, denotes that there is a further 

departure from the good of truth, and hence greater obscurity, because by Zalmonah is meant 
a shade, and therefore it denotes a state of obscurity, vcr. 37, 2367. 

42. Journeying from Zalmonah and pitching in Punon, denotes that this is increased in the next 

stage of descent, because although the meaning of Punon is uncertain, the series, or context of 
the spiritual sense indicates this, vers. 37-41.

454

43. Journeying from Punon and pitching in Oboth denotes leading to a state of the merely natural 
life, because by Oboth is probably meant bottles, or wine-skins, and therefore it denotes an 
external state, ver. 42, chap 21:10. 

44. Journeying from Oboth and pitching in lye-abarim in the border of Moab, denotes thus 

involving a passing over to evil states, because by Iye-abarim is meant the heaps of Abarim, 
and thus a passing over to evil states; and Moab denotes a state of adulterated good, chap. xxi. 
ii, 7643. 

45. Journeying from Iyim, and pitching in Dibon-gad, denotes an approach to adulterated good, 

because Dibon-gad denotes the externa] rational faculty, in this place corrupted, ver. 44, chap 
21:30. 

46. Journeying from Dibon-gad and pitching in Almon-diblathaim, denotes that this is still more 
intensified, because this expression means the concealment of the two dried figs, and thus 
denotes the natural will and understanding corrupted, ver. 45, 8230, 217, 683. 

47. Journeying from Almon-diblathaim and pitching in the mountains of Abarim before Nebo, 

denotes until falsity seems to be triumphant, because by the mountains of Abarim are denoted 
evils interiorly giving a passage to evils exteriorly, 795, 8321, 8323; and by Nebo is meant one
that speaks, prophesies, or fructifies, and therefore it denotes celestial truth or knowledge, but 
here in the opposite sense because the series is declining, falsity, chap 32:3, xxi, 25-30.

48. Journeying from the mountains of Abarim, and pitching in the plains of Moab, by the Jordan at
Jericho, denotes that a confirmed state of adulterated good appears to be inevitable, 1457, ver. 
47, 1616, 2418, 2468, 1585, 8815. 

49. Pitching by Jordan from Beth-jeshimoth, even to Abel-shittim in the plains of Moab, denotes a
state most external involving desolation and mourning, 1616, 1585, 2418, 2468, because by 
Beth-jeshimoth is meant the house of the desert, and therefore it denotes a state of desolation, 
2708, and by Abel-shittim is meant the mourning of the cedars, and therefore it denotes a state
of mourning, as well as a state of claiming merit, 9472. 

50. The Lord speaking to Moses, in the plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho, saying, denotes 
revelation from Divine Good by Divine Truth in that state, 2001, 2951, 7010, ver. 48, 1822. 

51. "Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them," denotes perception to the man of the church,

2951, 3654, 1822; and "when you pass over Jordan into the land of Canaan," denotes 
deliverance from a state of temptation, 8321, 8323, 1585, 3705. 

52. "Then you shall drive out all the inhabitants of the land from before you," denotes that evils 
are to be entirely overcome, 10638; "destroy all their figured stones, and destroy all their 
molten images," denotes that falsities external and internal are to be removed, 8869; and 
"demolish all their high places" denotes that all states of the false worship of the Lord are to be
destroyed, 2722. 

53. "And you shall take possession of the land, and dwell therein; for to you have I given the land 
to possess it," denotes that good shall take the place of evil, and truth the place of falsity in the 
church, 2658, 3705, 1293, 8899. 

455

54. "And you shall inherit the land by lot according to your families," denotes that by Divine 

Providence every one shall come into the delight of his own good with all variety according to
the quality of good, 2658, 3705, 994213, 3239, 494, 7833; "to the more you shall give the 
more inheritance, and to the fewer you shall give the less inheritance," denotes that it is the 
Lord who imparts good to every one, according to the particular state of each, 8899, 6172, 
3417, 9373 end; "wherever the lot falls to any man that shall be his; according to the tribes of 
your fathers shall you inherit," denotes that the particular state of each is established under the 
general state in societies, or in the heavens, 6494, 3858, 2658. 

55. "But if you will not drive out the inhabitants of the land from before you; then shall those 

which you let remain of them be as pricks in your eyes, and as thorns in your sides, and they 
shall vex you in the land wherein you dwell," denotes that evil must necessarily be expelled 
when good rules, since otherwise falsities would obscure the light of truth, weaken the life of 
charity, and pervert the life of love to the Lord, 10638, 273, 3310, 2701, 9495, 9308. 3705, 
1293. 

56. "And it shall come to pass that as I thought to do to them so will I do to you," denotes that thus
the church would be destroyed, since evil must inevitably suffer the punishment of evil, which 
is vastation as to all good and truth, 4979, 696, 10638, 306. 

DISCUSSION

Since this chapter describes the journeyings of the children of Israel after they were delivered from 
Egyptian bondage, and it has been long well known that Egyptian bondage represents the bondage of 
sin, and also that the land of Canaan, to which they journeyed, represents the kingdom of the Lord in 
heaven and upon earth, it follows that these journeyings signify the changes of state which man passes 
through in the course of his regeneration. For no one can enter the kingdom of heaven who is not 
regenerated (John 3:5). And again, if the whole of the journeys have this representation in the Word of 
the Lord, then also it follows that each journey describes a particular state. And it now follows, 
therefore, that our chapter in its internal sense is a very interesting one, although, in its literal sense, it 
consists almost entirely of mere names. Let us then carefully consider it. And first, the introduction 
teaches us one or two things. The Israelites had two leaders, who were directed by the Lord, and 
spiritually they represent the Divine Wisdom, and the Divine Love by which men are really guarded in 
this wonderful journey of regeneration. But this Divine Wisdom is expressed in the Divine Word; and 
so we see that the Lord leads every man, and regenerates him by means of the Word. Secondly, the 
Israelites left Egypt by their hosts, or by their armies; and from this we have learned that regeneration 
is an orderly process, for an army is a very different thing from an undisciplined rabble, or crowd, 
without any organization.

But again we. are here told that Moses wrote out the journeys of this people by the commandment of 
the Lord. And remembering that in the spiritual sense to write in a book signifies to impress upon the 
memory, we learn that all the states through which man passes in regeneration are impressed upon his 
memory. We never, therefore, really lose anything from our memories, although we may appear to do 
so; and consequently we are told, by the Lord Himself, that of every idle word that man shall speak he 
shall give an account in the day of Judgement; and this day of Judgement is, of course, a part of man's 
experience in regeneration (Matt 11:36). And lastly, we have to observe, regarding this general 
introduction, that the writing was done at the commandment of the Lord. And we have also learned, in 
our previous studies, that commanding denotes influx, 5486. That is, in the most general sense the 

456

Lord, Who is the self-existent life, flows into man with that life so that it appears in him just as if it 
were his own, notwithstanding that it is received continually, or moment by moment. And this truth is 
so important that it may be considered as fundamental. For whether a person is regenerated or not 
depends upon his acknowledgement of this truth of influx. And it is thus: if a man, judging according to
the appearance, persuades himself that his life is his own, and continues and persists in that persuasion, 
he will never be regenerated and saved; but if, on the other hand, he acknowledges the Lord, and that 
he is a constant recipient of the Divine life, accommodated to his state, then also he will be regenerated,
provided he confesses his responsibility; acknowledges that of himself, or apart from the Lord, he is 
nothing but evil; shuns the evils and errors that he finds in himself; and lives according to the laws of 
Divine Order, given also by influx from the Lord in His Word. Hence then we now see that our chapter 
opens with a most appropriate introduction in the internal sense, and is indeed worth reflecting upon 
continually.

But there is one thing more involved in what is here said. The journeys according to their goings out 
involve, as the whole account shows, procedure from states of evil to states of truth and good, or from 
states of truth and good to states of evil, and thus are a description of fluctuating states.

The first section includes deliverance from evil, instruction, and certain temptations. But the first three 
verses are especially interesting. For Rameses in the best sense signifies "the inmost of the spiritual in 
the natural mind," 6104, and this agrees exactly with the correspondence of the meaning of the word, 
here, of course, as it is applied in the opposite sense. And again also, the first month, and the fifteenth 
day of the month, as denoting the beginning of faith, and a new state of life, are equally appropriate, as 
referring to the spiritual man immediately, after his deliverance from the bondage of sin. And thirdly, 
how appropriately, too, does the signification of the passover and the feast of unleavened bread 
describe the state of purification and of conjunction with the Lord which necessarily follows. And this, 
indeed, is one side of the picture. But there is also the other; and this requires some notice. To bury the 
dead, in the best sense, corresponds to resurrection to eternal life, and regeneration; for we read: "A 
burying place in the internal sense of the Word, signifies life or heaven, and in the opposite sense, death
or hell. The reason why it signifies life or heaven is because the angels, who are in the internal sense of 
the Word, have no idea of a burying place, because they have no idea of death, wherefore instead of a 
burying place they perceive nothing else than a continuation of life, consequently resurrection; for man 
rises again as to his spirit, and is buried as to his body (see no. 1854); and whereas burial signifies 
resurrection, it also signifies regeneration, for regeneration is man's first resurrection, inasmuch as he 
then dies as to the old man, and rises again as to the new. By regeneration a man from being dead 
becomes alive; hence comes the signification of a burying place in the internal sense," 2916. But in this
chapter burying the firstborn, on the part of the Egyptians, signifies, clearly, the rejection of faith and 
charity, or what is the same, the rejection of truth and goodness by the wicked in the course of the 
Judgement, according to the explanation just quoted, and according to the further explanation in the 
place referred to.

However, we are now to consider the successive journeys comprised in the first general state of man 
after deliverance from evil absolutely by the Lord's work of redemption. Now the first place arrived at 
was Succoth, which denotes a holy state of truth from good. And it is necessary to consider what this 
really means. It is not that state of truth from good, which distinguishes man when fully regenerated, 
and which is represented by the feast of tabernacles, nor is it a state of truth conjoined with good, such 
as is experienced as regeneration proceeds, but it is one of truth that naturally flows from the initiatory 
state of good, into which man is introduced at the beginning of regeneration, when, as yet, he has not 
been instructed in truths, except in the most general manner. But proceeding, the next advance was 

457

from Succoth to Etham, at the edge of the wilderness, and this denotes a secret state of deliverance and 
arrangement of truth and good to undergo temptations, 8103-4, Etham corresponding to the power of 
truth. Journeying from Etham, and turning back to Pi-hahiroth, before Baal-zephon, and pitching in 
Migdol, represents the third state of departure; and this was a decline from good because man is not yet
prepared, and temptations must be endured, 8129-30; also we see here from the explanation in ver. 7 
how true are the correspondences of the places named. Going through the Red Sea, and being 
protected, denotes a fourth state, in which the power of hell is manifested, 8205-6, 8234. Taking a three
days' journey in the wilderness, and pitching in Marah, signifies a fifth state, in which there is aversion 
from truth, and also a remedy, 8346-51; and we see here how that remedy is the influx and 
predominance of good. Journeying from Marah, coming to Elim, and encamping by the waters, denotes
a sixth state, which is a full state of the holy good of truth and a state of consolation, as all the 
particulars beautifully show, when spiritually understood, and much more when such a state is realized,
8367-70. Going from Elim and pitching by the Red Sea involves a seventh change when evils from the 
hells are operative, 8205. Thence passing into the wilderness of Sin denotes an eighth state, which is 
one of the obscurity of truth and discontent as the references clearly indicate, thus involving a state also
of falsity and evil, respectively signified in the opposite sense by a bush and clay, 8398. Journeying 
from Sin and pitching in Dophkah represents a ninth state, evidently signifying stronger promptings 
from evil, 9081. Thence going to Alush denotes a tenth state, which is one of the power of falsity from 
evil, as the correspondence of the term plainly implies, 6367. Next pitching in Rephidim denotes an 
eleventh state, namely, one in which, although there is temporary rest, yet there is a thirst for 
knowledge, and an arrangement interiorly for future states of temptation as well, 7354-4, 8561. And 
lastly, there is an advance from Rephidim to Sinai which is a twelfth state, and which involves a Divine
Revelation, a state of instruction, and at the same time a state of obscurity as to good relatively, 8753, 
8755-7. Thus ends the first general state; and we have now to consider the second as described in the 
next section.

And in beginning to do so it is obvious that a separate description of each state involved in the second 
and third general states would take up too much space, and even then would be a mere repetition; and 
therefore it is proposed only to point out some things in the description that may help us the better to 
comprehend the whole series. And, to begin with, it is clear that three general states are described in the
chapter, because from Rameses to mount Sinai evidently denotes the first, while the journey to Kadesh 
as evidently concludes a second, since the Law was delivered at the former place, and the unfaithful 
spies and their followers were condemned to thirty-eight years' wandering at the latter; nor is anything 
whatever recorded of what happened to the wanderers during that period. But they must have come to 
Kadesh a second time, after the long interval just named, since they journeyed from Kadesh and came 
to mount Hor, where Aaron died, in the fortieth year after leaving Egypt. And they passed through all 
the places named in the second section in going to Kadesh the first time (Kitto, Art. Wandering, p. 1083
a).

The next thing to be observed is that the second general state consists of two parts, the first describing 
temptations external and internal, vers. 16-18, and the second a succession of advancing states, vers. 
19-36. And thirdly, it may be noticed that in this second part, generally, is involved the acquirement of 
more and more interior states of good by means of truths, the first being one of simple obedience to 
good from truths, ver. 19; the second, one of natural delight in good and truth, ver. 23; the third an 
interior state of such delight, ver. 28; the fourth a strengthening of external and internal bonds, ver. 30. 
Then follows a series of states leading to one of strengthened exterior good and truth, ver. 35; and this 

458

culminates in a full state of the good of truth, or of charity, which is the result of all previous trials, ver. 
36. 

And passing on to the third section, we cannot fail, on examination, to see that, as the second describes,
in the internal sense, a gradual advance, this equally shows a gradual decline, all the terms being as 
truly correspondential, and each falling into its proper place with great exactness. For, in the first place,
we have to consider the remarkable fact that such a state of giving back should occur just on the 
borders of the promised land. The reason is, spiritually, that only a full course of regeneration involving
a full course of temptation, or vastation, whichever it may be, enables man to discover his own impure 
state. But still, the children of Israel, remember, as they spread themselves in the plain of Moab, are 
representative of the true church, or man of the church, not now internally bad, but internally good, 
recognizing, at the same time, the imperfection of the natural degree, and that this imperfection is to be 
removed.

And therefore we have to notice, just here, how Aaron dies upon mount Hor. It is really the death or 
cessation of the merely natural life, and consequently of merely representative worship that is 
described. And hence the picture is, as it were, double; for when the old natural man ceases, the new 
natural man becomes active. And thus the fortieth year, the fifth month, the first day of the month, and 
also the one hundred and twenty three years of Aaron's life all synchronize and harmonize; and he can 
be at once a symbol of the worst state and of the best, as the correspondence show. And then, again, it 
follows that what happens as to the affections, happens also to the rational powers, and this is why Arad
the king of the Canaanites also "hears of the coming of the children of Israel," that is the corrupted 
natural reason is dethroned. Also thirdly, some of these terms which follow to the end of the section 
might be commented upon, as illustration of the careful way in which names of places are applied in 
the Holy Word, but we mention only one. The Israelites, in this part of their journeys, came to Dibon-
gad, and this signifies the external rational faculty corrupted, even as king Arad does the internal, both, 
of course, belonging to the natural degree of the mind; and turning to chap 21:30 we see how this place 
has a singular signification under different circumstances. For there it forms a portion of a quotation 
from the Ancient Word, while here it has another application. And this indeed shows the operation of 
Divine Providence not only in regard to the giving of a Revelation adapted to certain times, but also in 
the affairs of nations and individuals, by which they have been led, without any force, and even without
their own knowledge, to conform to the Divine Will.

But in conclusion, it is only necessary to remark concerning the last section, that the land of Canaan, 
besides representing, in the Word, the perfect heavenly state, also represents the church corrupted, 
when wicked nations had possession of it, and also the life of an individual, in the inner recesses 
thereof, in which hidden evils and errors lurk, which require to be expelled before the perfect life can 
be fully realized. We are to learn the lessons, therefore, here set before us. As of ourselves, we must 
drive out our spiritual enemies, according to the commandment of the Lord here given; and as of 
ourselves, we are to recognize that the land is divided to us by lot, or in other words, is assigned to us 
by Divine Providence. And yet, at the same time, no man is compelled to be regenerated as here 
described, although the consequences of tampering with our evils is plainly set before us. In one word, 
therefore, simple as it may seem to make the statement, evils must either be overcome, by power given 
freely from the Lord to each individual, or assuredly they will overcome the individual and make him 
their slave for ever. But we need not throw away the high privilege of human beings. On the contrary, 
every one may freely exercise it.

THE CONTENTS OF EACH VERSE

1. And the LORD spoke to Moses, 

1. There is revelation from the Lord by Divine Truth 

saying, 

giving the perception, 

2. Command the children of Israel, and 
say to them, When you come into the
land of Canaan, (this is the land that 
shall fall to you for an inheritance, 
even the land of Canaan according to
the borders thereof), 

2. To the man of the Spiritual Church through influx 
and illustration, that in the fully regenerated state, 
which is one in which the external fully 
corresponds to the internal affections even as to 
every particular, 

3. Then your south quarter shall be 

3. Those who are in the light of truth, or in the 

from the wilderness of Zin along by 
the side of Edom, and your south 
border shall be from the end of the 
Salt Sea eastward: 

spiritual heaven, have extension from the obscurity
where truth ends and charity ceases; are 
distinguished from those in natural good with its 
adjoined truth; and are separated from the lusts of 
the unregenerate man. 

461

4. And your border shall turn about 
southward of the ascent of 
Akrabbim, and pass along to Zin: 
and the goings out thereof shall be 
southward of Kadesh-barnea; and it 
shall go forth to Hazar-addar, and 
pass along to Azmon: 

5. And the border shall turn about from 
Azmon to the brook of Egypt, and 
the goings out thereof shall be at the 
sea. 

6. And for the western border, you shall
have the great sea and the border 
thereof: this shall be your west 
border. 

7. And this shall be your north border: 
from the great sea you shall mark out
for you mount Hor: 

8. From mount Hor you shall mark out 
to the entering in of Hamath; and the
goings out of the border shall be at 
Zedad: 

9. And the border shall go forth to 

Ziphron, and the goings out thereof 
shall be at Hazar-enan: this shall be 
your north border. 

10. And you shall mark out your east 

border from Hazar-enan to Shepham:

11. And the border shall go down from 
Shepham to Riblah, on the east side 
of Ain; and the border shall go 
down, and shall reach to the side of 
the sea of Chinnereth eastward: 

4. Moreover, in this light of truth there is freedom 

from the falsities derived from lusts, which cause 
obscurity where truth ends and charity ceases, in a 
state of holy delight in the Word, which is the 
source of truth, and of love to the Lord, by which 
man is purified through the good of truth and the 
truth of good from all outward things which have 
served their use; and this extends even to ultimates
where good by truth is in fullness and power, 

5. And where truth from good, or the Word adapted 
to the natural man in all its abundance, is the 
medium of the heavenly life. 

6. And those who are in the obscure good which 

constitutes the ultimate heaven, as to its internal, 
have their extension to the abundance of truth in 
the literal sense of the Word, as to the will, as to 
the understanding, and as to the activity of both 
together. 

7. But those who are in obscurity as to truth, and 

constitute the external of the ultimate heaven, have
their limit also from the literal sense of the Word, 
and include a state of the love of truth. 

8. Thence a state of external zeal for good and truth, 

also a state of opposition to falsity; 

9. Thence a state of most external good, and finally a 
state of most external truth, where the limit is. 

10. But those who are in the life of celestial love, have
their limits also in the obscurity of good conjoined 
with truth where good ends and evil begins; 

11. Where a state of natural good is rendered fruitful 

by instruction from the Word; where the same is in
its greatest power, because in truth it has its 
receptacle; 

462

12. And the border shall go down to 

Jordan, and the goings out thereof 
shall be at the Salt Sea: this shall be 
your land according to the borders 
thereof round about. 

12. Where the external man is protected and governed 
by truth perceived from good, and grounded in 
good; and where the lusts of the merely natural 
man are quiescent, through vastation as to all 
falsities. And all these are the boundaries of the 
heavenly kingdom, according to the distinction 
between truth and falsity and good and evil. 

13. And Moses commanded the children
of Israel, saying, This is the land 
which you shall inherit by lot, which 
the LORD has commanded to give to 
the nine tribes, and to the half tribe: 

13. And there is continual influx of Divine Truth with 
the man of the Spiritual Church, giving perception 
that the heavenly life is provided for him by the 
Lord, and is given to all in whom there is fullness 
of the conjunction of Divine Good and Truth. 

14. For the tribe of the children of 

Reuben according to their fathers' 
houses, and the tribe of the children 
of Gad according to their fathers' 
houses, have received, and the half 
tribe of Manasseh have received, 
their inheritance: 

14. For every one who is in faith in the understanding;
who is obedient to the Word of the Lord; and who 
is established in the new will of good from the 
Lord, has his peculiar and distinctive life by 
Divine Providence, 

15. The two tribes and the half tribe 

15. Since such have full conjunction with the Lord, 

have received their inheritance 
beyond the Jordan at Jericho 
eastward, toward the sunrising. 

although they be of the external church and form 
the ultimate heaven; for they are distinguished 
from the internal church by the reception of the 
Word in its literal sense, and of the knowledges of 
good and truth there, while yet they are in natural 
good affections which are the gift of the Lord, and 
in the beginning of regeneration where the light of 
Divine Truth first shines. 

16. And the LORD spoke to Moses, 

16. Further there is revelation from the Lord by Divine

saying, 

Truth giving the perception, 

17. These are the names of the men 

17. That every one enjoys his heavenly life in 

which shall divide the land to you 
for inheritance: Eleazar the priest, 
and Joshua the son of Nun. 

externals according to his state as to good and 
truth internally, namely, as to celestial good acting 
by truth; as to truth from good opposing evil 
perpetually; 

18. And you shall take one prince of 
every tribe, to divide the land for 
inheritance. 

18. And as to the primary truths of the church in 

subordination to these. 

19. And these are the names of the men: 

of the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son 
of Jephunneh. 

19. And the quality of such primary truths is as 
follows: of celestial love, truth immediately 
proceeding from and manifesting good; 

463

20. And of the tribe of the children of 
Simeon, Shemuel the son of 
Ammihud. 

20. Of faith in the will, truth acting from a principle of

good; 

21. Of the tribe of Benjamin, Elidad the 

21. Of truth from good which is a medium, good 

son of Chislon. 

conjoined with truth acting from confidence in the 
Lord; 

22. And of the tribe of the children of 

Dan a prince, Bukki the son of Jogli. 

22. Of the affirmation of truth, truth acquired from 
states of trial and temptation, which is primary; 

23. Of the children of Joseph: of the 

23. Of the celestial-spiritual principle, that is, of the 

tribe of the children of Manasseh a 
prince, Hanniel the son of Ephod: 

new will of good, the grace of God acting by truth 
from good which is primary; 

24. And of the tribe of the children of 

24. And of the new understanding of truth, good 

Ephraim a prince, Kemuel the son of
Shiphtan. 

derived from truth exercising judgement which is 
primary; 

25. And of the tribe of the children of 

25. Of conjugial love, truth from God which protects, 

Zebulun a prince, Elizaphan the son 
of Parnach. 

and which is primary; 

26. And of the tribe of the children of 
Issachar a prince, Paltiel the son of 
Azzan. 

26. Of the conjoining principle of truth with good, and
good with truth, redemption by truth in its power 
from good which is primary. 

27. And of the tribe of the children of 
Asher a prince, Ahihud the son of 
Shelomi. 

28. And of the tribe of the children of 

Naphtali a prince, Pedahel the son of 
Ammihud. 

29. These are they whom the LORD 

commanded to divide the inheritance
to the children of Israel in the land of
Canaan. 

REFERENCES AND NOTES

27. Of natural delight, charity derived from a state of 

peace which is primary; 

28. And of resistance to evil, redemption by truth 
proceeding from good, which is primary. 

29. And all these are instrumental in the hands of the 
Lord in adapting the state of the external man to 
that of the internal in the heavenly kingdom. 

1. This is evident because by Jehovah is denoted the Divine Being as to His love, 2001; by 

speaking is denoted influx, 2951; by Moses is represented Divine Truth, or the Word, 7010; 
and by saying is denoted perception, 1822. 

2. Commanding the children of Israel, and saying to them, denotes instruction to the man of the 
Spiritual Church through influx and illustration, 5486, 10290; "When you be come into the 
land of Canaan," denotes admission to the fully regenerated state, 1853, 370S; and "this is the 
land that shall fall to you for an inheritance, even the land of Canaan according to the borders 

464

thereof," denotes that this state is one in which the external fully corresponds to the internal 
affections, even as to every particular, because by the Israelites are signified, as the inhabitants
of the land, what is internal, and therefore by the land itself is signified the external man, 
2268, 3705, 6494, 2658, 8063. 

"Then your south quarter shall be from the wilderness of Zin, along by the side of Edom, and 
your south border shall be from the end of the Salt Sea eastward," denotes that those who are 
in the light of truth, or in the spiritual heaven, have extension from the obscurity where truth 
ends, and charity ceases; are distinguished from those in natural good conjoined with truth; 
and are separated from the lusts of the unregenerate man, because the south signifies those 
who are in the light of truth in the spiritual heaven, 3195, 9684; the wilderness of Zin signifies 
the obscurity where truth ends and charity ceases, chap 20:1; and the Salt Sea eastward 
signifies the lusts of the unregenerate man, 1666. 

"And your border shall turn away southward of the ascent of Akrabbim, and pass along to 
Zin," denotes that in this light of truth there is freedom from the falsities of lusts, which cause 
obscurity where truth ends and charity ceases, because by Akrabbim are meant scorpions, 
which denote falsities from evil, thus from lusts, 10019, 8063, 3195, 5964, 4205, chap 20:1; 
"and the goings out thereof shall be southward of Kadesh-barnea," denotes in a state of holy 
delight in the Word, which is the source of truth, because by Kadesh-barnea is meant the 
holiness of the fountain of delight, 2503, 2702; "and it shall go forth to Hazar-addar," denotes 
by which man is purified through the good of truth and the truth of good from all outward 
things which have served their use because by Hazar-addar is meant the threshing-floor of 
Adclar, and therefore it denotes these things, 2401, 6537; "and pass along to Azmon," denotes 
that this extends even to ultimates, where good by truth is in fullness and power, because by 
Azmon is meant numerous, great, and strong, and thus it denotes the power of good and truth 
in ultimates, 6172, 4015. 

"And the border shall turn about from Azmon to the brook of Egypt, and the goings out 
thereof shall be at the sea," denotes where truth from good, or the Word, adapted to the natural 
man, in all its abundance is the medium of the heavenly life, 8063, 6226, 5196, 4271, 5079, 
2401, 3048''.

"And for the western border you shall have the great sea and the border thereof: this shall be 
your west border," denotes that those who are in the obscure good, which constitutes the 
ultimate heaven as to its internal, have their extension to the abundance of truth in the literal 
sense of the Word, as to the will, as to the understanding, and as to the activity of both 
together, 3708, 9755, 8063, 9866. 

"And this shall be your north border, from the great sea you shall mark out for you mount 
Hor," denotes that those who are in the obscurity of truth, and constitute the external of the 
ultimate heaven, have their limit also from the literal sense of the Word, and include a state of 
the love of truth, 3708, 9648, 30484, 1675. According to the last reference, mount Hor denotes 
falsities, and therefore the limit of those in the state of the obscurity of truth, is some love of 
truth, the falsity commencing where truth ends.

"And from mount Hor you shall mark out the entering in of Hamath," denotes thence a state of
external zeal for good and truth, because by Hamath is meant anger, heat, or a wall, and thus it
denotes such a state, 9144, 4164, 6419; "and the goings out of the border shall be Zedad," 

3.

4.

5.

6.

8.

465

denotes a state of opposition to falsity, because by Zedad is meant turned away from or an 
adversary, and therefore it denotes this, 279920, 9314. 

9.

"And the border shall go forth to Ziphron, and the goings out thereof shall be at Hazar-enan," 
denotes thence a state of most external good, and finally a state of most external truth where 
the limit is, because Ziphron is probably derived from Ziph, which means the mouth, and thus 
denotes the lowest kind of good, 8068; and by Hazar-enan is meant the village of fountains, 
and therefore it denotes the lowest kind of truth, 3270, 2702, 2401. 

10. "And you shall mark out your, east border from Hazar-enan to Shepham," denotes that those 
who are in the life of celestial love have their limits also in the obscurity of good conjoined 
with truth, where good ends and evil begins, because by Hazar-enan is meant the village of 
fountains, and therefore it denotes the obscurity of good conjoined with truth, 3270, 2702; and 
by Shepham is meant a bare region, and a conspicuous mountain, and therefore it denotes a 
state where good ends and evil begins, 5433, 7780, 795; besides which, the east border 
denotes the limit of celestial love, 3708, 8063. 

11. "And the border shall go down from Shepham to Riblah, on the east side of Ain," denotes 

where a state of natural good is rendered fruitful by instruction from the Word, because going 
down denotes a descent to external things, 3084; Shepham denotes a state of natural good, ver.
10; by Riblah is meant fertility, and therefore it denotes what is fruitful, 348; the east side 
denotes the limit of celestial good, ver. 10; and by Ain is meant a fountain, and therefore it 
denotes truths instructing from the Word, 2702; "and the border shall go down and reach to the
side of the sea of Chinnereth eastward," denotes where natural good is in its greatest power, 
because in truth it has its receptacle, since the side, or shoulder, denotes the greatest power, 
6393; and the sea of Chinnereth eastward, denotes truth as the receptacle of good, Chinnereth 
meaning shaped like a basin, and thence denoting a receptacle, 9755, 3708, 3079. 

12. "And the border shall go down to Jordan, and the goings out thereof shall be at the Salt Sea: 
this shall be your land according to the borders thereof round about," denotes where the 
external man is protected and governed by truth perceived from good, and grounded in good; 
and where the lusts of the merely natural man are quiescent through vastation as to all falsities.
And all these are the boundaries of the heavenly kingdom according to the distinction between
truth and falsity and between good and evil, 8063, 3084, 1585, 2401, 1666, 3705, 2973. 

13. Moses commanding the children of Israel saying, denotes that there is continual influx of 

Divine Truth with the man of the Spiritual Church giving perception, 7010, 5486, 3654, 1822; 
"this is the land which you shall inherit by lot," denotes that the heavenly life is provided for 
him by the Lord, 3705, 2658, 3239, 6494; and, "which the Lord has commanded to give to the 
nine tribes and to the half tribe," denotes that it is given to all in whom there is fullness of the 
conjunction of Divine Good and Truth, 2001, 5486, 8899, 2075, 5291, 3858. 

14. "For the tribe of the children of Reuben, according to their fathers' houses, and the tribe of the 

children of Gad according to their fathers' houses, have received, and the half tribe of 
Manasseh have received their inheritance," denotes that every one who is in faith in the 
understanding; who is obedient to the Word of the Lord; and who is established in the new will
of good from the Lord, has his peculiar and distinctive life by Divine Providence, chap 32:33-
42. 

466

15. "The two tribes and the half tribe have received their inheritance beyond the Jordan at Jericho 
eastward toward the sunrising," denotes since they have full conjunction with the Lord, 
although they be-of the external church, and form the ultimate heaven; for they are 
distinguished from the internal church by the reception of the Word in its literal sense, and of 
the knowledges of good and truth there, while yet they are in natural good affections, which 
are the gift of the Lord, and in the beginning of regeneration where the light of Divine Truth 
first shines, 5194, 3858, 5291, 2658, chap 32:33-42, 1585, 932510, 3708, 4300. 

16. This is evident, because by Jehovah is denoted the Divine Being as to His love, 2001; by 

speaking is denoted influx, 2951; by Moses is represented Divine Truth or the Word, 7010; 
and by saying is denoted perception, 1822. 

17. "These are the names of the men that shall divide the land to you for inheritance," denotes that 
every one enjoys his life in Externals according to his state as to good and truth internally, 145,
1007, 3705, 2658, ver. 2; and "Eleazar the priest and Joshua the son of Nun," denotes celestial 
good acting by truth; and truth from good opposing evil perpetually, 9946, 8595, because by 
Eleazar is meant God helpeth, and therefore he denotes truth, 2001, while as priest he denotes 
good; by Joshua is meant salvation, and therefore he denotes truth combating or truth 
opposing evil from a principle of good; and by Nun is meant what is durable and eternal, and 
therefore it denotes what is perpetual.

18. "And you shall take one prince of every tribe to divide the land for inheritance," denotes the 
primary truths of the church in subordination to Divine Good and Truth, 1482, 3858, 2658. 

19. "And these are the names of the men: of the tribe of Judah Caleb the son of Jephunneh," 
denotes that the quality of such primary truths is as follows: of celestial love, truth 
immediately proceeding from, and manifesting good, because by Judah is denoted celestial 
love, 3880; Caleb means as the heart, and thus he denotes good, 4112; and Jephunneh means 
one that beholds, and therefore he denotes truth manifesting good, 2150. 

20. "And of the tribe of Simeon, Shemuel the son of Ammihud," denotes of faith in the will, truth 
acting from a principle of good, because Simeon is named from hearing, and therefore he 
denotes faith in the will, 3869; by Shemuel is meant heard of God, and therefore he denotes 
also obedience, or truth in action, 2542; and by Ammihud is meant the people of praise or 
confession, and therefore, like Judah, he denotes the love of good, 3880, 1259. 

21. Of the tribe of Benjamin, Elidad the son of Chislon, denotes of truth from good, which is a 

medium, good conjoined with truth, acting from confidence in the Lord, because Benjamin is 
named from the right hand, and therefore he denotes truth from good, which is a medium, 
45853, 4592; by Elidad is meant beloved of God, and therefore he denotes good conjoined 
with truth, 2001; and by Chislon is meant strength and confidence, and therefore he denotes 
confidence in the Lord, 6343, 2982. 

22. "And of the tribe of the children of Dan a prince, Bukki the son of Jogli," denotes of the 
affirmation of truth, truth acquired from states of trial and temptation, which is primary, 
because Dan is named from judging, and denotes the affirmation of truth, 3923; by Bukki is 
meant the mouth of God, and this word is under a root meaning deprived of, empty, and 
therefore it denotes the truth that shows that man of himself is void of good, 6985, 6987, 17; 

467

and by Jogli is meant led in to captivity or affliction, and therefore he denotes states of trial 
and temptation, 9164, 1846, 1937. 

23. "Of the children of Joseph: of the tribe of the children of Manasseh, a prince, Hanniel the son 
of Ephod," denotes of the celestial-spiritual principle, that is of the new will, of good, the 
grace of God acting by truth from good, which is primary, because Joseph denotes the celestial
of the spiritual principle, 4286; Manasseh is named from forgetfulness, and denotes the new 
will of good, 5351; by Hanniel is meant the grace of God, and therefore he denotes this, 598; 
and by Ephod is meant the outermost garment of the priest, and therefore it denotes truth from 
good, 9824; while a prince denotes what is primary, 1482. 

24. "And of the tribe of the children of Ephraim a prince Kemuel the son of Shiphtan," denotes of 
the new understanding of truth good derived from truth exercising judgement, which is 
primary, because Ephraim is named from fruitfulness, and denotes the new understanding of 
truth, 5.354; by Kemucl is meant raised by God, and therefore he denotes good derived from 
truth, 4103, 2001; and by Shiphtan is meant one who judges, or decides a case, and therefore 
he denotes this, 2335, a prince, as before, denoting what is primary, 1482. 

25. "And of the tribe of the children of Zebulun a prince, Elizaphan the son of Parnach," denotes 

of conjugial love, truth from God which protects, because Zebulun was named from 
cohabiting, and he denotes the heavenly marriage, 3960; by Elizaphan is meant, my God hides
or protects, and therefore he denotes this, 6721, 6722; and the meaning of Parnach not 
appearing in the authorities consulted, its correspondence can only be inferred from the 
context of the internal sense as being some state of good, which is the origin of the truth 
specified.

26. "And of the tribe of the children of Issachar a prince, Paltiel the son of Azzan," denotes of the 
conjoining principle of truth with good, and good with truth, redemption by truth in its power 
from good which is primary, because Issachar was named from reward, and he denotes the 
conjoining principle named, 3956; by Paltiel is meant God is deliverance, and therefore he 
denotes redemption by truth, from God, 2954, 2001; and by Azzan is meant strong, powerful, 
and therefore he denotes the power of truth from good, 6343. 

27. "And of the tribe of the children of Asher a prince Ahihud the son of Shelomi," denotes of 
natural delight, charity derived from a state of peace, which is primary, because Asher was 
named from blessedness, and he denotes natural delight, 3038; by Ahihud is meant the brother
of praise, and therefore he denotes charity, 367, 3880; and by Shelomi is meant peaceful, and 
therefore he denotes a state of peace spiritually, 925. 

28. "And of the tribe of the children of Naphtali a prince, Pedahel the son of Ammihud," denotes 
of resistance to evil redemption by truth proceeding from good which is primary, because 
Naphtali is, named from struggling, and he denotes the resistance of the natural man, 3927; by
Pedahel is meant God has delivered, and therefore he denotes redemption by truth proceeding 
from good, 29554, 2001; and by Ammihud is meant the people of praise or confession, and 
therefore he denotes like Judah the love of good, 3880, 1259. 

29. These being they whom the Lord commanded to divide the inheritance to the children of Israel
in the land of Canaan, denotes that all these are instrumental in the hands of the Lord in 

468

adapting the state of the external man to that of the internal in the heavenly kingdom, 2001, 
5486, 2658, 3654, 3705. 

DISCUSSION

The great truth that underlies the whole of the contents of this chapter in the internal sense, is that there 
is an eternal and an exact distinction between good and evil or between heaven and hell. For this is 
evidently what is signified by marking out with such precision the borders of the land of Canaan, which
was to be given to the children of Israel. And therefore in order that we may understand and duly 
appreciate all the particulars, we must first know from the Word what this distinction is, since it is quite
certain, on reflection, that it never has been discovered, and never can be discovered, by any merely 
natural investigation. It is not meant, however, that men have not any common or general perception of 
this distinction; for most people have this more or less. For who does not perceive, for example, that it 
is wicked to steal, and good not to do so? But it is affirmed that even this is not born with any one, but 
is given to him afterwards, as he is instructed, and that then it comes from the Lord by influx, and is not
the result of instruction merely. Much more, then, we may depend upon it, is every more exact 
distinction from perception, which is given by the Lord, of the difference between good and evil, as 
man is more fully instructed by revelation, or by the Word. And, consequently, we find more especially 
in the Word of the New Testament, or in the Gospel, that the exact universal distinction between good 
and evil is given, where it is said that love to the Lord and love to the neighbour constitutes the whole 
of what is good, and, further, that all Divine Truths, which are called the Law and the Prophets, depend 
upon, or are derived from these loves (Matt 22:34-40; 19:16-22). But knowing, then, this universal 
principle of good, and thence of truth, we may also know the universal principle of evil, which is the 
exactly opposite state, namely, that it is the inordinate love of self and the world, or in one word, 
selfishness, and that thence is derived all kinds of falsities; and, indeed, this is so very plainly implied 
in the second reference given just above that it cannot for a moment be doubted.

Hence, therefore, we may now see further why it is that our first section states that the heavenly life is 
to be most accurately defined and distinguished when we come into it, this being denoted by the 
Israelites coming into the land of Canaan. But the next point is, that we want to know why the southern 
border of the land is the first to be defined, and not the eastern border, which, from its correspondence 
we might have expected to come first, since the east corresponds to celestial love, where heaven begins
from the Lord, and the south to spiritual truth, which distinguishes the second heaven, as the references 
show? The answer appears to be, that it is the function of the enlightened intellect, and not so much that
of the loving heart, to define.

But, thirdly, we must proceed to consider the limits of the southern border. Now, of course, the series, 
as given in the right-hand column, is derived from the correspondence of the various names; and yet, 
on reading it over, and considering its order, we see, at once, how true the description is. The spiritual 
man is distinguished by love to the neighbour, or charity, and the faith, or truth of charity, and the limit 
of these, therefore, is first described as being where charity ceases and faith ends, this being signified 
by the wilderness of Zin, because Zin means a buckler, and coldness, and the latter, therefore, expresses
the absence of charity, while the former denotes the ultimate truth which defends itself against falsity, 
or the falsity which opposes the truth. But, secondly, the spiritual man is distinguished from the natural 
man, or from those in the ultimate heaven, who have their own love of good and appropriate truths and 
are signified by Edom. And, thirdly, the Spiritual are protected from the lusts of the unregenerate man, 
which are represented by the Salt Sea of the east, the last term being applied in the opposite sense. 

469

These limits, however, have reference to good more than truth, whereas the following symbols indicate 
the limit of truths more than of good affections. For there is freedom from the falsities of lusts, these 
being denoted by Akrabbim, because this word means scorpions; and also there is the enjoyment of 
genuine truths from the Word, which, as we have seen, are signified by Kadesh-barnea, while at the 
same time, there are truths which are denoted by the threshing floor of Addar; and ultimate truths in 
their fullness and power represented by Azmon, this word meaning, numerous, great, and strong. And, 
lastly, as a boundary there are the knowledges or scientifics of truth so appropriately signified by the 
brook of Egypt, and its going out by the sea. Hence, then, in this first section there are some valuable 
lessons, which will easily suggest themselves to the earnest and thoughtful student, but we must now 
pass on to a brief consideration of the second.

It is very useful to have a good general idea of the signification of the four quarters in the spiritual 
sense, which are all determined from the east, and not from the south, because in the Word it is the 
Lord Who is, in the supreme sense, the East. For the proximate sphere proceeding from His Divine 
Love and Divine Wisdom, is the Sun of heaven, which is the first created thing, and the great source of 
spiritual heat and light, and also of natural heat and light to all in the universe; and therefore, in the 
spiritual world, the Sun always appears in the east, and the Lord Himself, from Whom it proceeds, is 
also called the East, and the Sun of heaven. Now, for this reason the east not only signifies the Lord, 
but also the highest degree of love from Him, which distinguishes the angels of the celestial heaven, 
and is called celestial love, which is the purest love to the Lord. And because this is so, therefore the 
quarter opposite the east, in the Word, and in the spiritual world, denotes good or love in obscurity, and 
is constantly signified by the west, where, in the natural world the sun sets. And, hence, it will be seen 
at once that the west denotes the obscure good which distinguishes the angels of the ultimate heaven, 
internally and externally, the west itself denoting, specifically, that good internally and the north, which
is opposite the south, denoting that good externally. But, it may now be asked, how then shall we 
distinguish the four kinds of good denoted by the four quarters accurately? The answer is, that, as the 
east and the south denote, respectively, the highest love to the Lord and the neighbour, which is called 
celestial, and the next lower degree of that love, which is called spiritual, so the west and the north 
denote, respectively, this same love to the Lord and the neighbour internal and external of the lowest 
degree, which is called natural, the internal being obedience springing from the love of natural good 
from the Lord, and the external being obedience springing from the love of natural truths from the 
Lord. Hence, then, it is clear that every one can love the Lord and the neighbour according to his 
degree; that the west corresponds to the obscure love of good from Him; and that the north corresponds
to the obscure love of truth; and also that, generally, to love the Lord and to love the neighbour, is to 
love the good and the true, of whatever degree they may be, and to do them from inclination (HH 16). 
We see now, therefore, exactly what is meant, in this second section, by the west, and consequently, by 
the western border, denoted by the sea, namely, the abundance of truth in the literal sense of the Word. 
And let it, therefore, be remembered, carefully, that every infringement of the holy truth of the Word, is
a passing over from good to evil, or a going beyond the prescribed limits of good and truth. It is 
necessary now to take up the third section.

And to begin with, we notice that here also the "great sea," representing the literal sense of the Word, is
that from which the border commences, and that mount Hor is mentioned immediately afterwards to 
denote some love of the truth, the falsity signified also by this mountain, arising where the truth ends; 
to which it may be added that this mountain was a part of Lebanon, which means white, or incense, 
thus indicating the truth from which is some worship of the Lord grateful and acceptable to Him, 
39935, 8862, 

470

And then we come to Hamath, as another part of the northern boundary, this word meaning anger, heat,
and a wall, which, as we have seen, denote an external zeal for truth, and also a defence against falsity. 
And we have also learned, that the other places forming a part of this border are equally appropriate 
correspondences. It is delightful, therefore, to know, and believe, from all these spiritual teachings, that 
there is really no human being, who, in the course of his earthly life, is not supplied with truths by 
which he may learn the distinction between good and evil, and have the opportunity of deciding freely 
what his eternal condition shall be, excepting those who die in infancy, or who are prevented by other 
causes, such as idiocy, etc., from so deciding, and whose salvation, therefore, is provided for.

But with regard to the fourth section, which describes the eastern border, the explanation already given,
combined with the series in the parallel columns, appears to be sufficient to show that what is said 
about it refers to the celestial man, and the celestial heaven specifically. At the same time, however, it is
not to be forgotten that the celestial man, as distinguished from others, requires to be regenerated, 
because his first experiences of life are merely natural, like those of others, because he has hereditary 
tendencies to evil like others, and because he is liable to make hereditary evil actual like others. Hence, 
therefore, we may observe that his "border" is so described in the spiritual sense, that it is in harmony 
with these facts. And another thing may also be observed here. Because heaven consists of two 
kingdoms, as well as of three heavens, therefore the terms celestial and spiritual are applied to heaven 
accordingly, and thus there are celestial and spiritual things also in the ultimate heaven, as well as in the
superior heavens, and thus also the borders of each heaven, considered by itself, are similar to those of 
the whole heavens. And hence these considerations will enable us the better to understand the internal 
sense of our chapter, and of the Word generally.

The fifth section is interesting, as being a confirmation of what is contained in chap. xxxii. with 
reference to the tribes of Reuben and Gad, and the half tribe of Manasseh; and what has just been said 
will, in some measure, account for the peculiar distinction made as to these tribes. And it is here to be 
remembered that they really denote spiritual principles in the natural man. But since it appears from the
history as if they did not receive their inheritance by lot, because it was assigned to them at their own 
request, yet we find on looking back, that they acknowledge that it was so, because they say, "Our 
inheritance is fallen to us on this side Jordan eastward." That is, spiritually, we have to acknowledge 
that those who constitute the ultimate heaven hold their position according to Divine Providence 
equally with those who constitute the superior heavens (chap 32:19). And it will be well to observe 
here, also, that Ephraim, who represents the new understanding of truth, really takes the place of 
Reuben on the western side of Jordan, and how the division of the tribe of Manasseh into two parts 
provides for the representation of the new will of good on both sides of the river. For every one who is 
regenerated must receive from the Lord the new understanding of truth and the new will of good. But 
see on this subject 6328, from which we learn that the new understanding of truth takes the place of the
corrupted understanding thereof, and that the new will of good takes the place of the defiled will of 
good, and also why Reuben and Simeon could still be representative, namely, because representatives 
do not regard the person but the thing represented.

It is now time, however, to say a little on the last section. And here it is quite evident that Divine 
Providence works by means; is opposed to the unregenerated will of man; and acts in harmony with the
regenerated will and understanding. And these three are what may be called essential principles 
concerning Divine Providence. Thus, then, Divine Good and Divine Truth from the Lord, represented 
by Eleazar and by Joshua, are the first means by which the Lord acts, and the primary truths of the 
Word denoted by the princes are the second. And therefore the Lord provides for every man nothing but
good, and if evil befalls a person, it is never from Divine Providence. But, secondly, Divine principles, 

471

which man receives from the Lord by regeneration, become a part of his life, and have a quality 
according to the state of the man, so that, as a matter of fact, the same Divine principles have a different
quality, so to speak, with different men, and also with the same man, in different states of his life. And 
this remark is made in order to show why the princes of the tribes are not always the same. Of course, 
we know very well why this is in the literal sense; but we are here considering the internal sense. Thus, 
for example, the names" of the princes in this chapter are not the same as those in chap. i., and 
consequently, this denotes, spiritually, that while the tribes have the same general signification, there is 
a variation with regard to the princes, this depending upon the subject in the internal sense, which has 
reference to different states of the church or of the individual. And, thirdly, we have to observe that the 
princes here properly represent internal things, or goodness and truth, which form the internal man, 
whereas the land itself that is to be divided, properly denotes external things, or goodness and truth, as 
they are manifested in the external man. And this now is why the spiritual sense of the section is that 
"every one enjoys his life in Externals, according to his state as to good and truth internally," when he 
comes into heaven. But we need not here repeat the internal sense as it is given in the series. It is 
enough only to observe that, as in all other cases the correspondence of each name is deduced from its 
meaning, and that this principle of interpretation never fails, where the meaning of a name can be 
ascertained. And, of course, the great lesson that we have all to learn from the study of this section is, 
habitually, to endeavour, while we are in this world, to bring our outward life as far as we possibly can 
into harmony with our internal life. And it is said, "as far as we possibly can," because during the state 
of probation in which we now are, we are in the state of our Externals, and cannot come into the 
realization of our internal life, until after our departure from this world, during the process of our 
Judgement. But that process, let us remember, may be lengthened, or shortened, according to our 
conduct from internal principles while we remain in this world (HH 491-2).

Numbers Chapter 35

SUMMARY OF THE SPIRITUAL SENSE

1. There is revelation from the Lord by Divine Truth, or the Word, that doctrine is to be provided 

in the external man for the support of charity there, vers. 1-5. 

2. Also these doctrines must include full provision for the protection of those who sin through 

error or ignorance without an evil intention; and they must be acquired by a full course of 
temptation, and be continually renewed with every one according to the state as to charity, 
vers. 6-8. 

3. And several particulars are given in the remainder of the chapter concerning evils and errors 
committed without fault, and particularly concerning the removal of evils and falsities in the 
Judgement, the prevailing state of good, and the necessity for purification, vers. 9-34. 

THE CONTENTS OF EACH VERSE

1. And the LORD spoke to Moses in the 
plains of Moab by the Jordan at 
Jericho, saying, 

2. Command the children of Israel, that
they give to the Levites of the 
inheritance of their possession cities 
to dwell in; and suburbs for the cities
round about them shall you give to 
the Levites. 

3. And the cities shall they have to 

dwell in; and their suburbs shall be 
for their cattle, and for their 
substance, and for all their beasts. 

1. There is revelation from the Lord by Divine Truth 
even when good is adulterated in a low state of 
spiritual life, when external things prevail, and 
when the knowledges of truth from the Word are 
limited. 

2. And this revelation is to the man of the Spiritual 
Church giving the perception, that doctrines and 
truths are to be provided in the external man for 
the reception of charity internally and externally 
there. 

3. For charity has its abode in truths; and the natural 
affections as to the good of innocence; as to 
delight in knowledge; and as to sensual things, are 
in heaven and in the church, to be supplied with 
appropriate nourishment. 

4. And the suburbs of the cities, which 
you shall give to the Levites, shall be
from the wall of the city and outward
a thousand cubits round about. 

4. And such nourishment is properly to be 

distinguished from what is of the internal of the 
natural degree, as well as being sufficient in every 
respect. 

473

5. And you shall measure without the 
city for the east side two thousand 
cubits, and for the south side two 
thousand cubits, and for the west 
side two thousand cubits, and for the 
north side two thousand cubits, the 
city being in the midst. This shall be 
to them the suburbs of the cities. 

5. And the quality of this provision for the external of
the natural man, is to be according to good and 
truth interior, and according to good and truth 
exterior; and it is to have conjunction with the 
internal truths which are the immediate receptacles
of charity. And thus the external of the natural man
is to minister to and serve the internal as to 
doctrines which are receptacles of charity, 

6. And the cities which you shall give 
to the Levites, they shall be the six 
cities of refuge, which you shall give
for the manslayer to flee thither: and 
beside them you shall give forty and 
two cities. 

7. All the cities which you shall give to 
the Levites shall be forty and eight 
cities: them shall you give with their 
suburbs. 

8. And concerning the cities which you 
shall give of the possession of the 
children of Israel, from the many 
you shall take many; and from the 
few you shall take few: every one 
according to his inheritance which 
he inheriteth shall give of his cities 
to the Levites. 

6. And also, in the doctrines and truths which are the 

receptacles of charity there must be a full 
provision against the consequences of evil 
committed unconsciously, when evil has been 
done to another without any evil intention; and 
besides this, the receptacles with the man of the 
church for charity are to be acquired and 
appropriated through victory in temptation, 
culminating in a state of holiness. 

7. And all the receptacles in the external man are to 
be in fullness as to good and truth, and are to be 
continually renewed from the internal or from 
charity, and this both as to the interiors of the 
natural and as to the exteriors thereof. 

8. Moreover, this provision in the external man for 
the reception and support of charity, is to be 
according to the state of the internal; for if the 
internal is abundant in charity, its external will be 
in agreement therewith as to truths, and therefore 
much charity is rich in truths, and little charity is 
poor in truths. For the man of the church must 
acknowledge that he has all truths from the Lord 
through charity and for the sake of charity. 

9. And the LORD spoke to Moses, 

9. Further, there is revelation from the Lord by 

saying, 

Divine Truth giving the perception, 

10. Speak to the children of Israel, and 

10. By influx into the will and by illustration in the 

say to them, When you pass over 
Jordan into the land of Canaan, 

understanding, that when the man of the church is 
in the heavenly state, 

11. Then you shall appoint you cities to 
be cities of refuge for you; that the 
manslayer which kills any person 
unwittingly may flee thither. 

11. He recognizes that the Lord provides for such a 

state protection from the consequences of evil 
committed without evil intention. 

474

12. And the cities shall be to you for 
refuge from the avenger; that the 
manslayer die not, until he stand 
before the congregation for 
judgement. 

12. For the truth teaches that the man who sins in 

ignorance is without fault, and must be protected 
until investigation is made by truths; 

13. And the cities which you shall give 
shall be for you six cities of refuge. 

13. And hence the protection of such persons is 

complete in every respect; 

14. You shall give three cities beyond 
Jordan, and three cities shall you 
give in the land of Canaan; they shall
be cities of refuge. 

15. For the children of Israel, and for the
stranger and for the sojourner among
them, shall these six cities be for 
refuge: that every one that kills any 
person unwittingly may flee thither. 

14. And this both as to the external and internal man 
distinctly according; to the truths of the Word 
having relation to each. For the truth always 
protects those who are in charity and yet in 
ignorance. 

15. And the man of the internal church, as well as the 

man of the external, and he who is being 
instructed, alike need this protection, since all are 
liable to err without having evil intention. 

16. But if he smote him with an 

instrument of iron, so that he died, 
he is a manslayer: the manslayer 
shall surely be put to death. 

16. But he who, by means of false doctrine, injures 
another deliberately from the love of evil surely 
brings upon himself a state of spiritual death 
which is vastation. 

17. And if he smote him with a stone in 

the hand, whereby a man may die, 
and he died, he is a manslayer: the 
manslayer shall surely be put to 
death. 

18. Or if he smote him with a weapon of
wood in the hand, whereby a man 
may die, and he died, he is a 
manslayer: the manslayer shall 
surely be put to death. 

19. The avenger of blood shall himself 

put the man-slayer to death: when he
meeteth him, he shall put him to 
death. 

17. Also he who by the power of falsity which is from 
its nature opposed to good, wilfully takes away 
spiritual life from another, is certainly guilty, and 
brings upon himself a state of vastation. 

18. Or again, he who wilfully and forcibly does injury 
to another by persuading that good is meritorious, 
because selfish love desires reward, is guilty and 
brings upon himself vastation. 

19. For evil punishes itself, and he who indulges 
therein brings upon himself the consequences 
thereof. 

20. And if he thrust him of hatred, or 

20. Or still again, he who from hatred of good and 

hurled at him, lying in wait, so that 
he died; 

truth ] does injury thereto either openly or by 
deceit; 

475

21. Or in enmity smote him with his 

hand, that he died: he that smote him
shall surely be put to death; he is a 
manslayer: the avenger of blood 
shall put the manslayer to death, 
when he meeteth him. 

21. Or in enmity exercises the power of falsity against 
them, brings upon himself his own vastation, 
because he who wilfully uses falsity as a means of 
doing evil is guilty, and brings upon himself his 
own punishment more intensely. 

22. But if he thrust him suddenly 

22. But on the other hand, when he who is interiorly in

without enmity, or hurled upon him 
any thing without lying in wait, 

23. Or with any stone, whereby a man 
may die, seeing him not, and cast it 
upon him, so that he died, and he 
was not his enemy, neither sought 
his harm: 

24. Then the congregation shall judge 

between the smiter and the avenger 
of blood according to these 
judgements: 

25. And the congregation shall deliver 

the manslayer out of the hand of the 
avenger, of blood, and the 
congregation shall restore him to his 
city of refuge, whither he was fled: 
and he shall dwell therein until the 
death of the high priest, which was 
anointed with the holy oil. 

good, does injury to another from mistaken zeal, 
either as to the will or understanding, and without 
deceit; 

23. Or by falsity which causes spiritual death, from 
ignorance or wilfulness, when yet there is no 
intention from evil or from injury, 

24. Then the truths of the church are decisive in a 
doubtful case, according to Divine Order. 

25. And he who is in good interiorly is delivered from 
the consequences of evil or error, and is protected 
by the doctrine of the church, which excuses and 
protects the innocence of ignorance until, in the 
Judgement, good is clearly manifested, evil is fully
rejected, and there is the conjunction of truth with 
good. 

26. But if the manslayer shall at any 

time go beyond the border of his city
of refuge, whither he flees; 

26. But if he, who from ignorance has violated charity,
afterwards deliberately passes beyond the limits of
the truth which defends him; 

27. And the avenger of blood find him 
without the border of his city of 
refuge, and the avenger of blood slay
the manslayer; he shall not be guilty 
of blood: 

27. And thus brings upon himself the consequences of 
actual evil, he must needs suffer; and guilt is not 
imputed to him who resists evil from good, and 
restrains it by punishment. 

28. Because he should have remained in 

28. For only the innocence of ignorance excuses 

his city of refuge until the death of 
the high priest: but after the death of 
the high priest the manslayer shall 
return into the land of his possession.

wrong doing, from the consequences of which the 
good are delivered by the Judgement; for then 
genuine good is manifested and evil is rejected, 
and the external man becomes the true expression 
of the internal. 

476

29. And these things shall be for a 
statute of judgement to you 
throughout your generations in all 
your dwellings. 

30. Whoever kills any person, the 

manslayer shall be slain at the mouth
of witnesses: but one witness shall 
not testify against any person that he 
die. 

29. And these laws of Divine Order in relation to the 
man of the church, are eternal in every change of 
state, and as to every state of good. 

30. For injury done to good must inevitably bring 
vastation through the combined testimony of 
various truths; but one truth is not sufficient to 
decide. 

31. Moreover you shall take no ransom 
for the life of a manslayer, which is 
guilty of death: but he shall surely be
put to death. 

31. But evil confirmed by falsity under all 

circumstances is incapable of redemption, because 
it is guilty, and vasta-tion is the result of this 
confirmation. 

32. And you shall take no ransom for 

32. Moreover, even he who has committed evil 

him that is fled to his city of refuge, 
that he should come again to dwell 
in the land, until the death of the 
priest. 

33. So you shall not pollute the land 
wherein you are: for blood, it 
polluteth the land: and no expiation 
can be made for the land for the 
blood that is shed therein, but by the 
blood of him that shed it. 

without an evil intention, cannot be in freedom and
full redemption so long as good is not conjoined 
with truth in him, or until, by the Judgement, he is 
delivered from falsity, and confirmed in the truth 
which agrees with his own good. 

33. For the heavenly state must not be polluted with 
falsity; and falsity always causes pollution; and 
there is no redemption for the man who has 
confirmed himself in evil and falsity; and he must 
needs therefore suffer vastation. 

34. And you shall not defile the land 
which you inhabit, in the midst of 
which I dwell: for I the LORD dwell 
in the midst of the children of Israel. 

34. And therefore falsity as well as evil is at all times, 
or in all states, to be rooted out, because it does not
agree with Divine Good; and Divine Good is the 
essential life of the man of the church. 

REFERENCES AND NOTES

1. The Lord speaking to Moses in the plains of Moab, by the Jordan at Jericho, saying, denotes 

that there is revelation from the Lord by Divine Truth, even when good is adulterated, in a low
state of spiritual life, when external things prevail, and when the knowledges of truth from the 
Word are limited, 2001, 2951, 7010, 2418, 2468, 1585, 932510, 1822.

"Command the children of Israel that they give to the Levites of the inheritance of their 
possession cities to dwell in; and suburbs, or pasture-lands, for the cities round about them 
shall you give to the Levites," denotes that this revelation is to the man of the Spiritual Church
giving the perception that doctrines and truths are to be provided in the external man for the 
reception of charity internally and externally there, 5486, 3654, 10227, 3877, 2658, 2029, 492,
1293, 7407, 6078, 2973.

"And the cities shall they have to dwell in," denotes that charity has its abode in truths, 402, 
3877, 1293, 2268; "and their suburbs shall be for their cattle, and for their substance, and for 
all their beasts," denotes that the natural affections as to the good of innocence; as to delight in
knowledge, and as to sensual things are in heaven and in the church, to be supplied with 
appropriate nourishment, 7407, 6078, 6134, 4105, 987. 

"And the suburbs, or pasture-lands, of the cities which you shall give to the Levites, shall be 
from the wall of the city and outward a thousand cubits round about," denotes that such 
nourishment is to be properly distinguished from what is of the Internal of the natural degree, 
as well as being sufficient in every respect, 7407, 6078, 402, 10227, 3877, 6419, 10185, 2973, 
648, 2575. 

"And you shall measure without the city for the east side two thousand cubits, and for the 
south side two thousand cubits, and for the west side two thousand cubits, and for the north 
side two thousand cubits," denotes that the quality of this provision for the External of the 
natural man is to be according to good and truth interior, and according to good and truth 
exterior, 648, 2973, 402, 3708, 5194, 2575; "the city being in the midst," denotes that it is to 
have conjunction with the internal truths which are the immediate receptacles of charity, 5194,
402, 200, 3877; and "this shall be to them the suburbs, or pasture-lands of the cities," denotes 
that thus the External of the natural man is to minister to and serve the Internal as to doctrinals
which are receptacles of charity, 7407, 6078, 402, 3877. 

"And the cities which you shall give to the Levites they shall be the six cities of refuge which 
you shall give for the manslayer to flee thither," denotes that in the doctrines and truths which 
are the receptacles of charity, there must be a full provision against the consequences of evil 
committed unconsciously, when evil has been done to another without any evil intention, 402, 
10227, 3877, 3239, 9011; and "beside them you shall give forty and two cities," denotes that 
the receptacles with the man of the church for charity are to be acquired and appropriated 
through victory in temptation, culminating in a state of holiness, 10227, 402, 3877, 730, 
97418. 

"All the cities which you shall give to the Levites shall be forty and eight cities: them shall you
give with their suburbs," denotes that all the receptacles in the external man are to be in 
fullness as to good and truth, and are to be continually renewed from the Internal, or from 
charity, and this both as to the interiors of the Natural and as to the exteriors thereof, 402, 
10227, 3877, 730, 2044, 7407, 6078. 

"And concerning the cities which you shall give of the possession of the children of Israel; 
from the many you shall take many; and from the few you shall take few: every one according 
to his inheritance which he inheriteth shall give of his cities to the Levites," denotes that this 
provision in the external man for the reception and the support of charity is to be according to 
the state of the internal; for if the internal man is abundant in charity its external will be in 
agreement therewith as to truths, and therefore much charity is rich in truths, and little charity 
is poor in truths. For the man of the church must acknowledge that he has all truths from the 
Lord through charity, and for the sake of charity, 402, 10227, 2029, 3654, 6654, 4518, 2658, 
3877.

9. This is evident because by Jehovah is denoted the Divine Being as to His love, 2001; by 

speaking is denoted influx, 2951; by Moses is represented Divine Truth, or the Word, 7010; 
and by saying is denoted perception, 1822. 

10. "Speak to the children of Israel and say to them, When you pass over Jordan into the land of 
Canaan," denotes by influx into the will and illustration in the understanding, that when the 
man of the church is in the heavenly state, 2951, 10290, 9014, 3705. 

11. "Then you shall appoint you cities to be cities of refuge for you; and the manslayer which kills
any person unwittingly may flee thither," denotes that he recognizes that the Lord provides for 
such a state protection from the consequences of evil committed without evil intention, 5288, 
402, 9011. 

12. "And the cities shall be to you for refuge from the avenger, that the manslayer die not until he 
stand before the congregation, or assembly, for judgement," denotes that the truth teaches that 
the man who sins in ignorance is without fault, and must be protected until investigation is 
made by truths, 402, 9011, 8223, 3136, 7843, 8972. 

13. "And the cities which you shall give shall be for you six cities of refuge," denotes that hence 

the protection of such persons is complete in every respect, 402, 10227, 3239, 9011. 

14. "You shall give three cities beyond Jordan, and three cities shall you give in the land of 
Canaan; they shall be cities of refuge," denotes both as to the external and internal man 
distinctively, according to the truths of the Word having relation to each. For the truth always 
protects those who are in charity and yet in ignorance, 2788, 1585, 3705. 402, 9011. 

15. "For the children of Israel, and for the stranger, and for the sojourner among them shall these 
six cities be for refuge: that every one who kills any person unwittingly may flee thither," 
denotes that the man of the internal church as well as the man of the external, and he who is 
being instructed, alike need this protection, since all are liable to err without having evil 
intention, 3654, 1097, 1463, 3239, 402, 9011. 

16. "But if he smote him with an instrument of iron, so that he died, he is a manslayer: the 

manslayer shall surely be put to death," denotes that he who by means of false doctrine injures 
another deliberately from the love of evil, surely brings upon himself a state of spiritual death, 
which is vastation, 4251, 9011, 9007, 9008. 

17. "And if he smote him with a stone in the hand whereby a man may die, and he died, he is a 
manslayer: the manslayer shall surely be put to death," denotes that he who by the power of 
falsity, which is from its nature opposed to good, wilfully takes away spiritual life from 
another, is certainly guilty, and brings upon himself a state of vastation, 4251, 9011, 878, 
7507. 

18. "Or if he smote him with a weapon of wood in the hand, whereby a man may die, and he died, 
he is a manslayer: the manslayer shall surely be put to death," denotes that he who wilfully and
forcibly does injury to another by persuading that good is meritorious, because selfish love 
desires reward, is guilty, and brings upon himself vastation, 4251, 9011, 878, 7507. 

479

19. "The avenger of blood shall himself put the manslayer to death: when he meeteth him he shall 
put him to death," denotes that evil punishes itself, and that he who indulges therein brings 
upon himself the consequences thereof, 696, 8223, 683. 

20. "And if he thrust him of hatred, or hurled at him lying in wait, so that he died," denotes that he
who from hatred of good and truth does injury thereto, either openly or by deceit, 4503, 683, 
9013. 

21. "Or in enmity smote him with his hand, that he died; he that smote him shall surely be put to 
death, he is a manslayer: the avenger of blood shall put the manslayer to death when he 
meeteth him," denotes or in enmity exercises the power of falsity against them, brings upon 
himself his own vastation, because he who wilfully uses falsity, as a means of doing evil, is 
guilty, and brings upon himself his own punishment more intensely, 4251, 878, 7507, 696, 
8223, 683. 

22. "But if he thrust him suddenly without enmity, or hurled at him anything without lying in 

wait," denotes that, on the other hand, when he who is interiorly in good, does injury to 
another from mistaken zeal, either as to the will or understanding, and without deceit, 4503, 
683, 9013. 

23. "Or with any stone whereby a man may die, seeing him not and cast it upon him, so that he 

died, and he was not his enemy neither sought his harm," denotes or by falsity, which causes 
spiritual death, from ignorance or wilfulness, when yet there is no intention from evil or from 
injury, 4251, 9011, 7507, 2150, 683, 2851. 

24. "Then the congregation, or assembly, shall judge between the smiter and the avenger of blood 
according to these judgements," denotes that then the truths of the church are decisive in a 
doubtful case, according to Divine Order, 7843, 8972. 

25. "And the congregation shall deliver the manslayer out of the hands of the avenger of blood," 
denotes that he who is in good interiorly is delivered from the consequences of evil or error, 
because the manslayer, in this case, denotes him who is in good interiorly, ver. 23, and the 
congregation, or assembly, denotes truth from good judging and delivering, 7843; also the 
avenger of blood denotes the consequences of evil and error, 696, 8223; "and the congregation
shall restore him to his city of refuge whither he was fled," denotes that such a person is 
protected by the doctrine of the church, which excuses and defends the innocence of 
ignorance, 402, 9011; and "he shall dwell therein until the death of the high priest which was 
anointed with the holy oil," denotes until, in the Judgement, good is clearly manifested, evil is 
fully rejected, and there is the conjunction of truth with good, 5975, 900, 9946, 9954°, 10010, 
10011. 

26. "But if the manslayer shall at any time go beyond the border of his city of refuge whither he 
flees," denotes that if he who, from ignorance, has violated charity, afterwards passes 
deliberately beyond the limits of the truth which defends him, ver. 25, 8063, 9011. 

27. "And the avenger of blood find him without the border of his city of refuge, and the avenger of
blood slay the manslayer, he shall not be guilty of blood," denotes that the person hitherto 
protected, brings upon himself the consequences of actual evil, and must needs suffer; and that
evil is not imputed to him who resists evil from good, and restrains it by punishment, 696, 
8223, 8063, 9011, 4727, 3400, 8598. 

480

28. "Because he should have remained in his city of refuge until the death of the high priest," 

denotes that only the innocence of ignorance excuses wrong doing, from the consequences of 
which the good are delivered in the Judgement, vers. 11, 25; and "after the death of the high 
priest the manslayer shall return into the land of his possession," denotes that then genuine 
good is manifested, and evil is rejected, and the external man becomes the true expression of 
the internal, ver. 25, 9946, 2288, 2029. 

29. "And these things shall be for a statute of judgement to you throughout your generations in all 
your dwellings," denotes that these laws of Divine Order in relation to the man of the church, 
are eternal in every change of state, and as to every state of good, 8357, 1041, 1293, 10160. 

30. "Whoever kills any person the manslayer shall be slain at the mouth of witnesses: but one 

witness shall not testify against any person that he die," denotes that injury done to good must 
inevitably bring vastation through the combined testimony of various truths; but that one truth 
is not sufficient to decide, 9011, 7507, 4727, 41977. 

31. "Moreover you shall take no ransom for the life of a man-slayer which is guilty of death: he 
shall surely be put to death," denotes that evil confirmed by falsity under all circumstances is 
incapable of redemption, because it is guilty, and vastation is the result of this confirmation, 
10042, 3400, 9011, 7507, 845. 

32. "And you shall take no ransom for him that is fled to his city of refuge, that he should come 
again to dwell in the land, until the death of the priest," denotes that even he who has 
committed evil without an evil intention, cannot be in freedom and full redemption so long as 
good is not conjoined with truth in him, or until by the Judgement he is delivered from falsity, 
and confirmed in the truth which agrees with his own good, 10042, 3400, 9011, 1293, 3705, 
ver. 25. 

33. "So you shall not pollute the land wherein you are: for blood it polluteth the land; and no 

expiation can be made for the land for the blood that is shed therein but by the blood of him 
that shed it," denotes that the heavenly state must not be polluted by falsity; that falsity always 
causes pollution; and that there is no redemption for the man who has confirmed himself in 
evil and falsity, and that he must needs therefore suffer vastation, 59549, 3705, 374, 9127, 
10042, 1010, 1011, 7507, 74744. 

34. "And you shall not defile the land which you inhabit, in the midst of which I dwell; for I the 
Lord dwell in the midst of the children of Israel," denotes that therefore falsity as well as evil 
is at all times or in all states to be rooted out, because it does not agree with Divine Good; and 
Divine Good is the essential life of the man of the church, 59549, 683, 3705, 1293, 200, 2001, 
3654. 

DISCUSSION

The first section of this chapter, in the internal sense, makes a distinction between the children of Israel 
generally and the Levites; and we are already familiar with that distinction. But, in addition to that, we 
are now taught that the external man in the Natural, represented by the Israelites, is to provide doctrine,
denoted by cities, for the reception of the good of charity, signified by the Levites, there. And why is 
this? It is because charity in the ultimate heaven, or in the external church, or in the natural degree of 

481

the individual mind, flows in from the Lord through the celestial and spiritual heavens into the ultimate 
heaven, or into the natural degree of the church generally and particularly, and is not something 
inherent in man by birth; and therefore, also, it is because this inflowing spiritual life in the Natural 
must have a receptacle in the natural mind, from the Word, since it cannot abide in the merely natural 
man the will of which is corrupt, and the intellect of which, or the thought from the will of which, is 
only evil continually, as we read in Gen 6:5. And this receptacle is truth or doctrine, and therefore we 
see how new really is the regenerated life of man.

But we are to take notice, however, that the doctrine represented by the cities is to be acquired by man 
as from himself; for it is said thaf the Israelites were to provide the cities and give them to the Levites. 
Again, the doctrine thus drawn from the Word by the spiritual-natural man is to be both interior and 
exterior, the former being signified by the cities and the latter by the suburbs. And, thirdly, the quality 
of doctrine, in Externals, is to be according to its quality in Internals, by conjunction therewith, and is 
to be sufficient, which is represented by the measurements, two especially having relation to such 
conjunction. And, moreover, it is to be with all variety adapted to the various kinds of good as denoted 
by the four quarters. Thus, then, we clearly learn that the new life of the natural man is to be entirely 
from the Lord, and yet in such a way that it is acquired, as it were, by the man himself.

And now, in the second section we read of the six cities of refuge to which those persons might flee 
who had slain any man without evil intention, this plainly teaching in the internal sense, that such are 
protected by true doctrine; for this takes account, not simply of the actions of men, but of their motives 
more especially, and thus it does not condemn any one who does wrong through ignorance or mistake, 
while yet nothing is more exact than the truth of the holy Word in condemning wilful sin. But, it may 
be asked, why were there only six such cities of refuge; and why only three on each side of the river, as
described in the beginning of the third section? It is because such protection by true doctrine is full and 
complete in every respect, both as to the internal and external man.

And here it may be well to observe that the number six varies in signification in the Word according to 
the subject, sometimes signifying combat against evil, as when it is said there should be six days of 
labour, and that the seventh should be a Sabbath, or a state of rest and peace, and at other times 
denoting completeness either as to falsity or truth, as in Rev 13:18, where it denotes totality as to the 
former, and in this chapter, where it signifies completeness as to protection by true doctrine. And these, 
indeed, will be perceived to be not inconsistencies, when it is considered that the six days of labour 
involve not only combat against evil and error simply, but also the completeness of a course of 
temptations, because six is a multiple of three, which, it is well known, signifies completeness in 
general, this, no doubt, arising from the fact that, according to the law of discrete degrees, in the third 
degree, or ultimate, the prior degrees, are in their fullness and power, that is, in all completeness (DLW 
217), And concerning the passage from Rev 13:18, see the explanation in 10217, and in AR 610. 

But, noting the great importance of the spiritual teaching in ver. 8, which closes the second section, we 
continue our comments on the third, and call attention to the appropriateness of the spiritual sense of 
ver. 15. For surely the man of the external church and those who are being instructed, respectively 
represented by the stranger and sojourner, are liable to do wrong without any evil intention, and indeed 
no man of the Spiritual Church, even in an advanced state, is free from this liability, and all such are 
protected by the true doctrine which is represented by the cities of refuge.

But we now have to deal with the cases in which murder it committed with deliberate evil intention; 
and, of course, the literal sense is plain enough. The internal sense, however, requires some 
consideration; for, clearly, no Christian ought to return evil for evil as is here described in this old law 

482

of Moses; and also when murderers are punished with death by the state for the crimes they commit, 
this is not to be done from vindictive motives at all, but for the protection of society, and, so far as it is 
possible, for the real good of the criminal himself. And, therefore, in a Christian community it could 
not be permitted that the nearest relative of a murdered person should personally take vengeance on the
murderer. We see, on this account, that some deep spiritual truths are involved in this law, concerning 
the avenger of blood. For it is evident that, even if any one should take the life of another wickedly 
from a deliberate intention, he ought not to be punished vindictively.

Now, we have learned from the previous explanation of vers. 16-21 what their spiritual teaching is. The
avenger of blood denotes the punishment of evil by itself, and is according to the law of retaliation by 
which evil returns upon him who commits evil, as is explained fully in the reference given in 
demonstrating ver. 19; and we read: "It frequently happens in the other life that the wicked, when they 
are desirous to occasion evil to the good, are grievously punished; and that the evil which they intend 
for others returns upon themselves. This appears at the time as if it were revenge from the good; but it 
is not revenge, neither is it from the good, but from the wicked, to whom, in such case, the opportunity 
is given from the law of order: yea, the good do not will evil to them; but still they cannot take away 
the evil of punishment, because, at such times, they are kept in the intention of good, just as a judge 
when he sees a malefactor punished, or as a father when he sees his son chastised by a master; the 
wicked, when they inflict punishment, do it from the lust of doing evil, but the good from the affection 
of doing good," 82233. But the various offences, committed from a spirit of evil and premeditation, 
signify certain states of a corrupted man, or of a corrupted church, in which injury is done to others by 
falsities of various kinds, which are represented respectively by iron, by stone, or by wood; and when 
such injuries are so inflicted, it is manifest that the evil returns upon those who thus do evil, because, in
this case, the very evils and falsities intended to injure or destroy the spiritual life of others, are 
confirmed in those who practise them; while, on the other hand; it is evident from the teaching in vers. 
22-25, spiritually interpreted, that, where false doctrines are taught, under the impression that they are 
truths, and from truly religious motives, the persons who teach them are not guilty. But here a certain 
question arises. Although the teachers of false doctrine are not guilty, yet, all the same, great injury may
be done to others, and indeed actually has been done to others, by such teaching. How, then, is it with 
those who receive such injury? The answer to this question is not given in our chapter, as a careful 
perusal of the series of the spiritual sense will show. The reason is because the subject is concerning 
those who teach false doctrine, and not concerning those who suffer from it, either spiritual injury, or 
spiritual death, and therefore it must be sought elsewhere. And first with regard to the reception of 
injury from false doctrine and its cure, we learn, from Mark 16:18 in its spiritual sense, that those who 
imbibe false doctrine, which is there called drinking a deadly thing, because drinking corresponds to 
the reception of truth or falsity in the understanding, 996015, and a deadly thing evidently denotes 
falsity, if they have a true faith in the Lord shall not be injured thereby. And, secondly, that spiritual 
death is not the result of receiving false doctrine merely, but of appropriating what is evil, signified by 
eating, is clear from Gen 2:17, as explained in 126-129.

But passing from this short digression, we are now to reflect on the remainder of the chapter; and it is 
interesting particularly to notice how emphatically it is declared that injury, done to others without evil 
intention, is excusable, and that such as inadvertently err in this respect are to be protected, as we read 
in vers. 22-25. And consider, also, the importance of the teaching of these verses in their internal sense, 
especially with regard to what is represented by the manslayer remaining in his city of refuge until the 
death of the high priest. For the high priest represents the "work of the salvation of those who are in the
Lord's celestial kingdom"; and as this kingdom includes, specifically, those who are in good in each of 

483

the three heavens, 10017, therefore, also, he denotes the inmost state as to good of every one, and his 
death denotes, in the best sense, a new state of life, 5975, which is the result of the Judgement that 
takes place after the death of the earthly body. That is to say, when this new state of life is manifested, 
there is no longer any need for the state of comparatively external restraint which is represented by the 
manslayer remaining in his city of refuge. And how delightful such a state of freedom will be to the 
spiritual man in our present state we can very hardly conceive; for then all conflicts will have ceased; 
and the external man will become the true expression of the internal, as we learn from ver. 28; for there 
the manslayer himself denotes the internal man, and the land of his possession the external.

Nor ought we to neglect the caution contained in vers. 26-28; and which we know very well is, as to its 
spiritual teaching, so often given in other parts of the Word. For how solemnly does the Lord impress 
this upon us when He says, even in speaking of His Coming, and thus of the Judgement, "Remember 
Lot's wife" (Luke 17:32) I And how significant is the same kind of caution given to Shimei by Solomon
in 1 Kings 2:36, which chapter also, in its internal sense, has relation to the same process! And there, 
truly, we see not only what awaits all such persons as are represented by Shimei, but also the 
impossibility of retaining, in the heavenly state, such imperfections as are represented by the enemies 
of David and Solomon. But on this subject it may be allowable to refer the reader to the Two Books of 
Kings Explained, pages 21-39.

Another interesting point in connection with the process of Judgement is contained in the internal sense
of ver. 30, which teaches that a combination of truths is necessary to condemn those who have 
confirmed themselves in evil. For it is said, even in the literal sense, that one witness shall not testify 
against any person that he die. But there is another aspect of this truth that deserves consideration. The 
whole of the inner meaning of this chapter has reference principally to doctrine; and doctrine 
specifically considered has relation to the understanding of man. But man is not man by virtue of his 
intellectual powers only, or even chiefly. For it is the will or the love that constitutes the man, and the 
understanding only so far as it agrees with the will or love, and is used by the will or love as a means of
self-improvement. Again, it is not even sufficient that a man should have an enlightened mind and a 
loving heart; for these are no use by themselves, but only become useful when they are expressed and 
embodied in a life of usefulness. And hence the collective man is only fully represented by good deeds 
according to an enlightened understanding and loving heart. And to make a perfect man, therefore, 
these must agree together and be in harmony, especially in heaven, where only we shall find perfect 
men, that is, regenerated men, or angels. And this is really the deeper truth involved in the Lord's words
that in the mouth of two or three witnesses, in a case of dispute, or of wrongdoing, every word is to be 
established (Matt 18:16). And can we not all see and feel that the grand object of our regeneration is to 
bring all these various powers of our complex life into a glorious and blissful state of pure feeling, 
correct thought, and delightful action? It is not surprising, therefore, that the remaining verses of our 
chapter involve the truth of ver. 30, first with regard to the evil, ver. 31, secondly, with respect to the 
regenerating man, ver. 32, and, thirdly, as to the regenerated man, vers. 33-34. We may conclude, 
therefore, with a few words on each of these cases. No ransom is to be taken for the murderer who is 
guilty of death. And here, plainly, deliberate wickedness is meant; for spiritually to be guilty of death is
to confirm evil by falsity, and not simply to sin through ignorance or mistake, as the references given 
emphatically show; and the confirmation of evil by falsity is effected by the consent of the will and the 
understanding together embodied in the actions of the life.

The second case is that in which a manslayer cannot, by paying any ransom, come into the possession 
of his property, before the death of the high priest; and this denotes the state of the man who is being 
regenerated, and has not, as yet, fully confirmed good by truth, for until this is done redemption, or 

484

expiation, or atonement, is not fully effected in him, and it can only be effected in the Judgement, when
the inmost good is manifested. It is true, indeed, that there is the consent of the understanding and the 
will, and at the same time the obedience of self-compulsion, 1937, but not yet full obedience from love,
and in the meantime, therefore, there is still some temptation, and here it is "he that endures to the end" 
that will be saved.

But the third case is that of the fully regenerated man, in which there is not to be pollution, as is 
represented by no blood-shedding being permitted; and also there is the consciousness that without the 
Lord, or apart from His continually inflowing life, man is disposed to confirm evil by falsity, but is 
withheld therefrom by the force of Divine Love now operating externally as well as internally, as is 
represented by the Lord dwelling in the midst of the land. So perfectly, therefore, we now see, does the 
Word, in its internal sense, describe every state of man, as to all his powers.

SUMMARY OF THE SPIRITUAL SENSE

1. The man of the external church perceives from Divine Good by Divine Truth, that those who 
are in the affection of truth without truths receive an inheritance in the heavenly kingdom, 
vers. 1-2. 

2. But he is in ignorance as to the truths relating to the conjunction of goodness with truth which 

is the heavenly marriage, and therefore seeks instruction, vers. 3-4. 

3.

In consequence of which he learns from Divine Truth, or the Word, that this conjunction is 
effected in freedom; and yet that every external affection is to be conjoined with its own 
internal, or with truths in harmony and agreement with itself, vers. 5-13. 

THE CONTENTS OF EACH VERSE

1. And the heads of the fathers' houses 
of the family of the children of 
Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of 
Manasseh, of the families of the sons
of Joseph, came near, and spoke 
before Moses, and before the 
princes, the heads of the fathers' 
houses of the children of Israel: 

1. But the natural man, as to his leading principles, 

yet in the beginning of regeneration, and 
who.derives his life successively from the new 
understanding and the new will, peculiar to the 
man of the Spiritual Church, who is in the celestial
of the spiritual life, or in charity from faith, is in 
uncertainty concerning truths, and depends upon 
his conjunction with the leading principles of the 
spiritual man, which are Divine Truth from the 
Lord and its subordinate truths, for enlightenment. 

2. And they said, The LORD 

2. And thence he has the perception that it is of the 

commanded my lord to give the land
for inheritance by lot to the children 
of Israel: and my lord was 
commanded by the LORD to give the 
inheritance of Zelophehad our 
brother to his daughters. 

Divine Providence operating by Divine Truth, that 
in heaven and in the church, the external man is 
brought into harmony with the internal; and also 
that where the external is in the fear of the Lord, 
although without truths, yet if he be in the 
affection of truth from good, truths are provided 
for him according to that affection. 

486

3. And if they be married to any of the 
sons of the other tribes of the 
children of Israel, then shall their 
inheritance be taken away from the 
inheritance of our fathers, and shall 
be added to the inheritance of the 
tribe whereunto they shall belong: so
shall it be taken away from the lot of
our inheritance. 

4. And when the jubilee of the children 
of Israel shall be, then shall their 
inheritance be added to the 
inheritance of the tribe where-to they
shall belong: so shall their 
inheritance be taken away from the 
inheritance of the tribe of our 
fathers. 

5. And Moses commanded the children
of Israel according to the word of the
LORD, saying, The tribe of the sons 
of Joseph speaks right. 

6. This is the thing which the LORD 
does command concerning the 
daughters of Zelophehad, saying, Let
them marry to whom they think best;
only to the family of the tribe of their
father shall they marry. 

3. But still it seems to him that the external affection 

without its truths may be conjoined in the 
heavenly marriage with an internal of a different 
general class in the Spiritual Church, and thus that 
it will be alienated, and not brought into harmony 
with its own internal, but will become the 
possession of another general class; 

4. So that in the heavenly marriage of congenial 

human souls, which is full, continual, and eternal 
with the man of the Spiritual Church, it appears as 
if the External of one general class might become 
the inheritance of an Internal in another, and thus 
be separated eternally from its own Internal. 

5. But revelation is made by Divine Truth from 

Divine Good that the reasoning of the external or 
natural man, having its origin from the spiritual, is 
true according to appearances, concerning the 
heavenly marriage and inheritance; 

6. But that Divine Good reveals the genuine truth, 
concerning the affection of truth in the external 
man, giving the perception that it must be 
conjoined to truth in perfect freedom, but that each
particular affection must be conjoined to the truth 
which is congenial to it, and at the same time is in 
harmony with the subdivisions, and the general 
class of affections to which it belongs. 

7. So shall no inheritance of the 

children of Israel remove from tribe 
to tribe: for the children of Israel 
shall cleave every one to the 
inheritance of the tribe of his fathers.

7. And that thus no particular external affection can 
be removed from its own subdivision or general 
class to another, because in every case the Internal 
of the man of the church conjoins to itself its own 
particular and perfectly corresponding External. 

8. And every daughter, that possesses 
an inheritance in any tribe of the 
children of Israel, shall be wife to 
one of the family of the tribe of her 
father, that the children of Israel may
possess every man the inheritance of 
his fathers. 

8. And every external affection, with its possessions 
or truths belonging to any general class in the 
Spiritual Church, is reciprocally conjoined to its 
corresponding external as to subdivision and 
general class, so that thus every Internal has 
possession, of its own External. 

487

9. So shall no inheritance remove from 
one tribe to another tribe; for the 
tribes of the children of Israel shall 
cleave every one to his own 
inheritance. 

10. Even as the LORD commanded 
Moses, so did the daughters of 
Zelophehad: 

11. For Mahlah, Tirzah, and Hoglah, and
Milcah, and Noah, the daughters of 
Zelophehad, were married to their 
father's brothers' sons. 

12. They were married into the families 
of the sons of Manasseh the son of 
Joseph, and their inheritance 
remained in the tribe of the family of
their father. 

13. These are the commandments and 

the judgements, which the LORD 
commanded by the hand of Moses to
the children of Israel in the plains of 
Moab by the Jordan at Jericho. 

REFERENCES AND NOTES

9. And, in this way, it is not possible, in heaven, that 
Externals can be removed from one subdivision or 
general class to another, since it is always the 
Internal that chooses for itself its own External. 

10. And this actually happens according to Divine 
Order with all external affections of truth 
grounded in the fear of the Lord conjoined with 
love. 

11. For such affection, though weak for the want of 

truths, may have a sincere delight therein; may be 
disposed strongly to confirm truth and abide in it; 
to be governed by it, and thus to be distinctly 
elevated above merely natural good; and therefore,
although relatively obscure, this affection is united
in the heavenly marriage with an internal of its 
own kind or to the truths of collateral internal 
good, with which it perfectly agrees. 

12. And thus it is conjoined eternally with the truths 
derived from the new will of good which is 
peculiar to the Celestial of the Spiritual Church; 
and the external truths thereof remain in that 
subdivision and general class to which they 
properly belong, on account of their origin. 

13. And all these are the laws of Divine Order internal
and external proceeding from Divine Good by 
Divine Truth, and being intended for the 
government of the man of the church, even when 
he is in a comparatively low state of adulterated 
good, and yet is obedient to the Word of the Lord 
and to the knowledges of truth derived therefrom. 

1. The heads of the fathers' houses of the family of the children of Gilead, the son of Machir, the 
son of Manasseh, of the families of the sons of Joseph, denotes the natural man as to his 
leading principles, yet in the beginning of regeneration, and who derives his life successively 
from the new understanding and the new will peculiar to the man of the Spiritual Church who 
is in the celestial of the spiritual life, or in charity from faith, 3728, 7833, 5912, 4117, chap 
26:29, 6237, 6238, 4286; and their coming near, and speaking before Moses, and before the 
princes the heads of the fathers' houses of the children of Israel, denotes uncertainty 
concerning truths and dependence upon conjunction with the leading principles of the spiritual
man, which are Divine Truth from the Lord and its subordinate truths, for enlightenment, 
3572, 2271, 7010, 1482, 3728, 7833, 3654.

2. Their saying denotes perception, 1822; "The Lord commanded my lord to give the land for 
inheritance by lot to the children of Israel," denotes that it is of the Divine Providence, 
operating by Divine Truth that, in heaven and in the church, the external man is brought into 
harmony with the internal, 2001, 5486, 7010, 8899, 3705, 3239, 6494; "and my lord was 
commanded by the Lord to give the inheritance of Zelophehad our brother to his daughters," 
denotes that where the external is in the fear of the Lord, although without truths, yet if he be 
in the affection of truth from good, truths are provided for him according to that affection, 
7010, 5486, 2001, 8899, 2658, chap 26:33, 1222.

"And if they be married to any of the sons of the other tribes of the children of Israel," denotes 
that still it seems to him that the external affection, without its truths, may be conjoined in the 
heavenly marriage with an internal of a different general class in the Spiritual Church, 2173, 
489, 3858, 3654; "then shall their inheritance be taken away from the inheritance of our 
fathers," denotes that the external affection will be alienated, 2658, 3947; "and shall be added 
to the inheritance of the tribe whereunto they shall belong," denotes that it will become the 
possession of another general class, 4692, 2658, 3858; and "so shall it be taken away from the 
lot of our inheritance," denotes that it will not be brought into harmony with its own internal 
degree, 3947, 2658. 

"And when the jubilee of the children of Israel shall be," denotes so that in' the heavenly 
marriage of congenial human souls, which is full, continual, and eternal with the man of the 
Spiritual Church, 8802, Lev 25:10; "then shall their inheritance be added to the tribe 
whereunto they belong," denotes that it appears as if the External of one general class might 
become the inheritance of an Internal in another, 2658, 3947, 3858, 155, 156; and "so shall 
their inheritance be taken away from the tribe of our fathers," denotes thus separation eternally
from its own Internal, 2658, 3947, 3858, 7833. 

5. Moses commanding the children of Israel, according to the word of the Lord, saying, "The 

tribe of the sons of Joseph speaks right," denotes that revelation is made by Divine Truth from 
Divine Good that the reasoning of the external or natural man, having its origin from the 
spiritual, is true according to appearances, concerning the heavenly marriage and inheritance, 
7010, 5486, 3654, 2001, 3858, 5912, 4286, 7740.

"This is the thing which the Lord has commanded concerning the daughters of Zeiophehad, 
saying," denotes that Divine Good reveals the genuine truth concerning the affection of truth 
in the external man, giving the perception, 2001, 5486, chap 26:33, 1822; "Let them marry to 
whom they think best," denotes that it must be conjoined to truth in perfect freedom, 10173; 
and "only to the family of the tribe of their father shall they marry," denotes that each 
"particular affection must be conjoined to the truth which is congenial to it, and at the same 
time is in harmony with the subdivisions, and the general class of affections to which it 
belongs, 7833, 10173. 

"So shall no inheritance of the children of Israel remove from tribe to tribe," denotes that thus 
no particular external affection can be removed from its own subdivision, or general class, to 
another, 2658, 3654, 2973, 3858; and "for the children of Israel shall cleave every one to the 
inheritance of the tribe of his fathers," denotes because in every case the Internal of the man of
the church conjoins to itself its own particular and perfectly corresponding External, 3654, 
3875, 2658, 3858, 7833, 37032.

"And every daughter that possesses an inheritance in any tribe of the children of Israel, shall 
be wife to one of the family of the tribe of her father," denotes that every external affection, 
with its possessions or truths, belonging to any general class in the Spiritual Church, is 
reciprocally conjoined to its corresponding internal, 489, 2658, 3858, 3654, 915, 7833; and 
"that the children of Israel may possess every man the inheritance of his fathers," denotes as to
subdivision and general class, so that thus every Internal has possession of its own External, 
3654, 2658, 7833, 37032. 

"So shall no inheritance remove from one tribe to another tribe," denotes that it is not possible,
in heaven, that Externals can be removed from one subdivision, or general class, to another, 
2658, 2973, 3858; "for the tribes of the children of Israel shall cleave every one to his own 
inheritance," denotes that it is always the Internal that chooses for itself its own External, 
3858, 3654, 3875, 2658. 

10. Even as the Lord commanded Moses, so the daughters of Zelophehad doing, denotes that this 

actually happens according to Divine Order with all external affections of truth grounded in 
the fear of the Lord conjoined with love, 2001, 5486, 7010, 489, chap 26:33. 

11. For Mahlah, Tirzah, and Hoglah, and Milcah, and Noah, the daughters of Zelophehad, being 
married to their father's brothers' sons, denotes that such affection, though weak for the want 
of truths, may have a sincere delight therein; may be disposed strongly to confirm truth, and 
abide in it; to be governed by it, and thus to be distinctly elevated above merely natural good; 
and therefore, although relatively obscure, this affection is united in the heavenly marriage 
with an internal of its own kind, or to the truths of collateral internal good with which it 
perfectly agrees, chap 26:33, 4434, 3803, 489. 

12. Their being married into the families of the sons of Manasseh the son of Joseph; and their 

inheritance remaining in the tribe of the family of their father, denotes that thus it is conjoined 
eternally with the truths derived from the new will of good, which is peculiar to the celestial of
the Spiritual Church; and that the external truths thereof remain in that subdivision and general
class to which they properly belong on account of their origin, 4434, 7833, 489, 6257. 6238, 
4286, 2658, 3858, 37032. 

13. These being the commandments and the judgements, which the Lord commanded by the hand 
of Moses to the children of Israel in the plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho, denotes that 
all these are the laws of Divine Order, internal and external, proceeding from Divine Good by 
Divine Truth, and being intended for the government of the man of the church, even when he 
is in a comparatively low state of adulterated good, and yet is obedient to the Word of the 
Lord, and to the knowledges of truth derived therefrom, 8972, 2001, 5486, 878, 7010, 3654, 
2418, 2468, 1585, 932510. 

DISCUSSION

We are already acquainted with signification of the first person named in this chapter; for he represents 
the natural man in the beginning of regeneration, and the origin of this natural man is given in chap. 
xxvii. I, while, elsewhere, he is described as being in "the good of the pleasure of the sensual things of 
the body," 4117. But we are not to understand Gilead to signify merely sensual pleasure; it is that kind 
of sensual pleasure which is associated with, is controlled by, and is derived from the newly formed 

490

religious life from the new understanding of truth and the new will of good respectively denoted by 
Machir and Manasseh. But it is a fact, all the same, that this new life necessarily has a mixed quality, 
because of the interference of the merely natural man, and therefore we cannot wonder if the ruling 
principle, or principles, here are in some obscurity, especially as to the subject of this chapter. And yet 
we see also, in our first section, that, nevertheless, there is subjection to the Word of the Lord, and 
perception thence that the new natural man who humbly fears the Lord and loves the truth, although at 
first he is ignorant, has his proper place in the church of the Lord, and in the kingdom of heaven. And it
will naturally occur to most of us that we must all pass through the states here described; that it is, in 
certain respects, a troublesome time; and that we shall be very glad when we are no longer Gileadites in
the strict sense of the term, even if it should turn out that we form a portion of the ultimate heaven. For 
we have the consolation of being instructed from this chapter, that we shall not only be provided with 
truths, but also enter into the heavenly marriage of good and truth; and, in fact, since abstract good and 
truth have no existence, that we shall each of us in his own heaven find his congenial eternal partner. 
This, however, is anticipating. For there is a difficulty in the way as our second section shows.

And this difficulty is certainly very definitely stated, so that, after all, this natural man is not quite so 
ignorant as we might think, even granting that appearances of truth such as there are in nature, in the 
Word, and in human experience, are apt to delude him somewhat. Being in the church, and having to 
some extent realized his possessions and privileges, he knows already that regeneration is like a 
marriage; that it is compared to a marriage in the Word of the Lord, and even that the church itself is 
called the bride, and that the Lord Himself is called the Husband (Rev 21:2). He knows also that the 
kingdom of heaven is like a certain king who made a marriage for his son (Matt 22:2); that some 
people are not willing to come to the marriage; and that of those who do come, some have not a 
wedding garment; and thus he clearly sees that the heavenly marriage is something real, although he 
may not know that it is the conjunction of truth with good, of faith with charity, or of wisdom with love
in himself. But when it is put before him he begins to realize it a little; for he sees that to have faith 
without rove, or love without faith, is not reasonable; and also that to have these and not to embody 
them in his life is inconsistent. He believes, therefore, firmly that there is to be conjunction with the 
Lord by love to Him, and also that when it takes place the possessions of the bride will belong to the 
bridegroom; for he will realize that his life is from the Lord, and that at last his internal man is to have 
possession of his external man. But what he fears is that his own tribe, through this marriage, will lose 
its inheritance, or part of it; that another tribe will gain that part, and that this will be wrong, or not 
according to the division by lot. That is, spiritually, it may be, that "the external affection, without its 
truths, may be conjoined, in the heavenly marriage, with an internal of a different general class in the 
Spiritual Church, and thus that it will be alienated and not brought into harmony with its own internal, 
but will become the possession of another general class"; or in other words, it may be that the external 
represented by the bride and her possessions will not be adapted to its new internal, so that in reality 
there will not be a proper heavenly marriage. And there is fear also that finally in the year of Jubilee, 
that is spiritually, in the Judgement, the possession of his fathers will be entirely lost; again, spiritually, 
there is fear that "in the heavenly marriage of congenial human souls, which is full, continual, and 
eternal with the man of the Spiritual Church, it appears as if the External of one general class might 
become the inheritance of an Internal in another, and thus be separated eternally from its own internal," 
or in other words, that the External will not be truly in harmony with the new Internal, and thus again 
that there will not be a proper heavenly marriage.

And here it may be remarked, before proceeding to the next section, that this picture, in both its literal 
and spiritual senses, suggests some thoughts on Christian marriages, as they actually are in the world at

491

the present day. Of course, in all such marriages the church and the state both assume that the marriage 
is genuine, and exactly according to the Lord's teaching in Matt 19:3-6, because the contracting parties 
themselves assume this. And therefore, according to the law, both spiritually and naturally, these 
marriages are for life, or during life in this world; and indeed if they are genuine they will be for 
eternity as well, for this is involved in the expression "What, therefore, God has joined together let not 
man put to pieces." But on the other hand, if any marriage is not genuine, still it must be maintained 
until the decease of one of the parties, because it was assumed by both spiritual and natural law to be 
genuine, and it is certainly representatively genuine on this account. But the fact is, in this case, that not
being genuine, it cannot be eternal, and is really just such an uncongenial union as is implied and 
represented in this section by marriages contracted between individuals of different tribes, the true 
marriages being signified by those contracted within the same tribe (HH 378). But what then, it may be 
asked, is to happen to such ill-matched pairs in the other life? The answer is, that each party, if 
regenerated, and thus prepared for heaven, will be certain to find his or her conjugial partner there; for 
we are taught that it is of Divine Providence that conjugial pairs should be born, and that finally they 
will be brought together in that world where perfection of character exists, and where there is no 
concealment of that character, so that there is no possibility of making a mistake, in a state where every
man is some specific form of love veiled by wisdom, and every woman is some specific form of 
wisdom veiled by love (CL 32).

Turning now to the third section, let us carefully consider it. In the first place we learn that, according 
to the Word of the Lord, the new natural man, denoted by the tribe of the sons of Joseph, had spoken 
the truth. That is, he had done so sincerely believing that the appearances of truth in which he was were
genuine. For if the affection for truth constituting the spiritual life of any particular woman could be 
conjoined with the truths earnestly loved by a particular man of an altogether uncongenial character; 
and if this uncongenial character could really possess and appropriate to himself a life so dissimilar to 
his own, so that it might form the will of which he was the understanding, even to eternity (HH 367), 
then it is clear that this internal life, or love of wisdom in the husband, would so take possession of that 
external affection, or life, in his wife, as to entirely overpower it, because it is a law of Divine Order in 
heaven that the external life of an individual should be conformed to his internal life, and not the 
reverse; and what is true of one individual is true also of married partners in heaven, since the husband 
is always the internal life of which the wife is always the external. But this is absurd, because in heaven
there is no preponderance of the understanding of the husband over the will of his wife, or the reverse 
(HH 369). Hence then we now see wherein the perception of a Gileadite, spiritually speaking, is right. 
For it is impossible that external affection such as is represented by the daughters of Zelophehad can 
form, in heaven, association by marriage, with an internal affection, in a tribe, or in an angelic society, 
not its own, 471. We cannot therefore wonder at the decision contained in vers. 6-7, either in the literal 
or in the spiritual sense, and if the references there given are consulted the truth of the latter sense will 
be more clearly seen. But it is not necessary to dwell upon the remaining part of the chapter, since what
has already been said illustrates the spiritual sense of it. And, therefore, we close this chapter and this 
book with the following interesting statement: "The manner in which marriages are formed in the 
heavens, I have also been allowed to see. Everywhere in heaven those who are of similar dispositions 
are consociated, and those are dissociated who are dissimilar; and hence every society of heaven 
consists of those who are similar; for they who are alike are drawn together not of themselves, but from
the Lord.... In the same manner married partners, whose minds are capable of being conjoined into one,
are drawn to each other; therefore at first sight they love each other, see that they are conjugial partners,
and enter into marriage from their inmost souls. Hence it is that all the marriages in the heavens are 

492

from the Lord alone. They also celebrate the marriage feast, which is attended by a numerous company;
these festivities differ in different societies" (HH 383).
