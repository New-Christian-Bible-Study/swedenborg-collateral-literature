Preface

The book of Amos is one of the books of the Word.  Not much has been written about
it in the New Church. Since I started working on this study of Amos, I have searched 
our library holdings with the hope I would turn up a hidden or forgotten study by 
some New Church scholar. Although there are sermons using a verse or part of a 
chapter of Amos as a text, I have found no detailed study of Amos or other books of 
the Minor Prophets. Why not? Is there a perception that the Writings lack a verse-
by-verse explanation of these Prophets?

So far, my research has uncovered several thorough New Church books on the Major 
Prophets, such as Isaiah, Daniel, and Ezekiel. The absence of similar books on the 
Minor Prophets motivated me to undertake a study guide approach to filling this 
void. I hope this first study guide will prove helpful to others and that additional 
study guides will follow this one. Ultimately, I want the Minor Prophets to be 
accessible and hope to contribute to their study and use in the church. Most of all, I’d
like this effort to be a challenge so that others will be encouraged to build on and 
improve this pilot project.

How To Use This Study Guide

1. A slow, unhurried reading of Amos is essential. Read each chapter before you 

look at the related section of the Study guide. Read the chapter again while you 
are using the study guide, and read it a third time when you are finished. This 
process will give you a powerful sense of the series of events and meanings in 
each chapter. It is important to feel comfortable with all the names, places, and 
announcements in Amos’ prophecy. When possible, some historical information 
will be included in the study guide to increase reading comprehension and 
enhance application.
The book of Amos is not an easy work to read and understand. Unlike some of 
the prophets—Jonah or Hosea—Amos doesn’t tell a story that is easy to 
remember. He brings prophecies against neighbors of Israel, mentioning names 
and places one can only recognize with the help of maps and reference books. 
One has to wade through many historical facts to catch a glimpse of the message 
in Amos, so it is important to balance history with solid research of the spiritual 
sense. Researching can require a table full of books and hours of comparing and 
contrasting meanings that can be drawn from the internal sense. This study 
guide intends to help the researcher by including a full set of quotes so that he or
she may spend less time juggling books and more time reflecting on the issues 
the internal sense presents. My hope is that the reader will concentrate on the 
process of applying doctrine to life.

2. As you read Amos, there are several resources you will want to use with this 

study guide.  The first is a book of the Writings called Summaries of the Internal 

6

Sense of the Prophets and Psalms.1 This work includes a verse-by-verse overview 
of each of the nine chapters of Amos.  The overview gives a general statement 
about the internal sense. Our research will move us toward the particulars of the 
internal sense.

3. Another important reference tool is Searle’s General Index to Swedenborg’s 

Scripture Quotations. This reference shows where in the Writings a verse(s) of 
the Word is either explained specifically or used to illustrate a doctrinal point 
that we can add to our study. There is also another use of this work.  As we study,
each researcher will be led by the Lord’s Providence in myriad of ways and 
according to specific needs or states. Knowing how to use this book will help us 
look up related passages in the Word that will add to our knowledge of the three-
fold Word. 

4. You will soon discover that not every verse, word, name, etc. is directly quoted 
and explained in the Writings. However, there are often references to the same 
name, place, or thing in the explanation of a different verse of the Word. The 
hope is that reflection on these other references and their associated doctrine 
will help us see possible applications to our study of Amos. We will need to use 
“derived doctrine.” Please don’t run away from this maligned term. If we use it 
properly, admitting openly that it is derived, we bring no harm to the internal 
sense. Think about it for a minute. The Writings give us a verse-by-verse 
explanation of Genesis, Exodus, and Revelation. Do we stay away from the other 
books of the Word because the Lord didn’t reveal them in the Writings in the 
same way He did Genesis, Exodus, and Revelation? I think not. We must look for, 
find, and wisely use “derived doctrine” with a humble acknowledgment that we 
have tried to apply doctrine with a degree of human prudence. 

5. Keep a notebook handy during your study times. Write out insights, questions, 
and any summaries you find helpful in organizing your thoughts about each 
chapter. The goal of this study guide is not to give a detailed summary of the 
internal sense but to start the researcher’s quest for deeper insights.
6. There is a wonderful explanation of Amos, chapter 8, in the Dole Bible Study 
Notes, Volume 4. There you will see an example of historical and spiritual 
information corroborating one another. It is well worth your time to read and 
reflect on this explanation. You might also enjoy looking at the Sower Notes, 
Volume III, Chapter 58.

7. At the end of each chapter in the study guide, you will find a study review. The 
review includes a summary of each section to help you reinforce and build on 
your understanding of several of the key points.

8. Begin each study unit with a devotional prayer asking the Lord to guide and 

direct your thoughts. Certainly beginning in this sphere has the power to inspire 
and open our minds with a higher spiritual priority that will keep us in the 
company of the Lord’s angels. As the Writings teach, we must seek to love truth 
for truth’s sake. Such an approach will free each reader from preconceived ideas 
that might limit his or her ability to “see” the intent and message of the Lord’s 
Word.

Introduction

Before we begin our study, it will be helpful to learn some background information 
about the books of the prophets and their approximate dates.

MAJOR AND MINOR PROPHETS

Let’s begin with a brief description of what the terms “Major Prophets” and “Minor 
Prophets” mean. In the Old Testament, there are 16 books referred to as the books of
the Prophets. Biblical scholars have divided the 16 books into two categories.  
Augustine was the first person to use the  terms “Major” and “Minor” to indicate the 
size of the books, not their relative importance.  The Minor Prophets contain fewer 
chapters than those of the Major Prophets.

Scholars do not agree on the timeline of the prophets.  I found at least ten different 
timelines. None of them agree completely on dates.  If I were to simplify the research
information I would say there are essentially two timelines that seem to have the 
acceptance among the scholars.  So I offer both for your consideration.

WHO WAS THIS MAN CALLED AMOS?

Amos was a shepherd in a region called Tekoa, about six miles south of Bethlehem. 
Commentaries describe the area as somewhat rugged, rocky, and with sparse 
grazing fields. Shepherds in that region had to make extensive trips to feed their 
flocks.

In the book of Amos, we find two uses Amos performed: he kept sheep (Amos 1:1), 
and he cultivated sycamore trees (Amos 7:14). One translation says that he was a 
“pincher” of the sycamore tree blossom. This means he was a pruner. The sycamore 
tree in that region produced a low quality fig. Its taste was not as exquisite as that of 
other fig trees, so it was called a poor man’s fig tree. When overwhelmed by hunger, 
the poor availed themselves of the sycamore tree’s abundance.

Unlike the “sons of the Prophets” or the priests, Amos had no training or preparation
prior to his call to bear a message from the Lord to the ten Northern Tribes of Israel. 
Amos appeared to the people, spoke the message, and then departed, never to be 
heard of again. It is interesting to note that his name is not mentioned anywhere else
in the Word except for Luke 3:25 and most biblical scholars think that this verse 
actually refers to Amoz, the father of the prophet Isaiah.

Amos’ name means “burden bearer.” That seems quite appropriate for the task at 
hand. When we study Amos, our burden is to think from essence and not person. 
Rather then getting caught up in Amos himself, we need to get caught up in what his 
prophecies represent. How can we find ourselves in his text? Where does each 
lesson challenge us as members of the New Church? 

We can learn more about who Amos was in the Word by considering his two uses—
shepherd and pruner of sycamore trees. In Arcana Coelestia (AC) 343, we are told 
that a shepherd represents a person who exercises charity. Someone who leads and 
teaches is called a shepherd, and those who are led and taught are called a flock. 
This shepherd tended sycamore trees, the “poor man’s fig trees.” A sycamore tree 
denotes external truth, and a fig tree represents external good (AC 7553).

Putting the two uses of Amos together may help us understand why he was chosen 
to go to the Northern Tribes. They had fallen on spiritually hard times. The people as
a flock, and their priests as shepherds, were in a wilderness state, and their external 

9

lives were about as tasteless as the figs on the sycamore tree. Genuine obedience to 
the Lord was at a low point. The Lord always seeks to improve, or lift, the quality of 
His children. He sought to help the people shun evils as sins so they might do the 
work of repentance. Until the external part of a person is willing to be put in order, 
the person resists the ways of the Lord. Because the Israelites in the Northern Tribes
were in this state, hard prophecies had to be spoken to them. The Lord chose Amos 
to reveal serious spiritual disorders.

Fear, predictions of doom, and hard sayings about spiritual disorder are not topics 
people enjoy. We prefer happier themes. But when the Word says the Lord “roars 
from Mount Zion,” we need to remember the “roaring” speaks of His zeal and love, 
not anger. The Lord doesn’t get angry. He holds up a mirror so that His people may 
see what they are doing to themselves. He wants us all to shun evils as sins to keep 
from losing our souls. “For what will it profit a man, if he gains the whole world and 
forfeits his life?” (Matt. 16:26)

WHAT ARE SOME OF THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE PROPHETS?

To learn more about prophets, read AC 2534. Essentially, the Writings teach us four 
things about the prophets in the Word.

1. They delivered the words of the Lord and not their own.
2. The messages they gave to the people often came to them in dreams or 

visions.

3. Often, the prophets had no idea what the prophecies meant.
4. The prophets had to memorize or write down their prophecies in order to 

pass them on.

Biblical scholars think that Amos wrote his prophecies down.

WHAT CONDITIONS IN THE NORTHERN TRIBES MADE AMOS’ PROPHECY 
NECESSARY?

The Oxford Annotated Bible prefaces the book of Amos with a useful summary, 
excerpted here:

During the long and peaceful reign of Jeroboam II (786-746 BC) Israel attained a 
height of territorial expansion and national prosperity never again reached.  The 
military security and economical affluence which characterized this age were taken 
by many Israelites as signs of the Lord’s special favor toward them which they felt 
they deserved because of their extravagant support of the official shrines.

Amos...was called by God...to the difficult mission of preaching harsh words in a 
smooth season. He denounced Israel, as well as her neighbors, for reliance upon 
military might, and for grave injustice in social dealings, abhorrent immorality, and 
shallow, meaningless piety.

This description highlights the main problems in the Northern Tribes:

10

1. They were experiencing a “smooth season”—things were going well for 

everyone, and people felt a comfortable spiritual laziness.

2. They gloried in their territorial growth and wealth.
3. They thought they were a favored people, that life owed them this prosperity.
4. Their military security allowed them to trust more in their own power and 

less in the Lord’s protection.

5. They committed serious injustices in their social interactions with one 

another.

6. Their behavior was immoral.
7. Their worship became shallow and meaningless.
8. They saw their financial support of the shrines as merit worthy of special 

status with the Lord.

All of these problems show us why the Lord needed to “roar out of Zion.” The 
Northern Tribes had failed to pursue eternal values. Instead, they longed for the 
things that thieves, rust, and moths could take from them. We can also see why many
of Israel’s neighbors received warnings in the prophecy of Amos. The Lord wanted 
Israel to see in others what was so deeply involved in their hearts.

Israel thrilled at hearing the prophecy against others but resented the prophecy 
when the Divine light exposed their own dark motives.  The Oxford summary 
continues:

Amos’ forceful, uncompromising preaching brought him in conflict with the religious
authorities of his day...A priest named Amaziah (complained and accused Amos of 
treason and) sought to have him expelled...from the royal sanctuary at Bethel and 
(Amos was) commanded not to prophesy there again....

With this information in mind, let’s begin the study of Amos. Remember to use a 
notebook. Write out impressions, questions, and insights for your own reflection or 
to share in the group with whom you are studying.

Chapter One

AMOS 1:1-2

“The words of Amos, who was among the sheep breeders of Tekoa, which he saw 
concerning Israel in the days of Uzziah king of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam the 
son of Joash, king of Israel, two years before the earthquake. And he said:

The Lord roars from Zion,
and utters His voice from Jerusalem;
The pastures of the shepherds mourn,
and the top of Carmel withers.”

Passages From the Writings

Prophets and Psalms (P&P)



“The Lord concerning the Word and doctrine thence...” (verses 1, 2)

Arcana Coelestia (AC) 3995[3]



“For this reason spotted is expressed in the original language by a 

•
word that also means lambs (as in Isa xl. 10, 11); and speckled by a word that
also means a herdsman (as in 2 Kings iii. 4; Amos i. 1).”

Apocalypse Revealed (AR) 612



“...therefore by Zion...is meant the church everywhere...It is called Mount Zion 
because by a mountain is signified love...That by Mount Zion is signified 
heaven and the church where the Lord alone is worshiped, may appear...” 
Amos 1:2 is cited along with other references.

Apocalypse Explained (AE) 601[15]



“In Amos (i.2)...roaring from Zion signifies grievous distress, and the voice 
from Jerusalem lamentation; the mourning of the habitation of the 
shepherds, and the drying up of the head of Carmel, signifies because of the 
vastation of all the goods and truths of the church; the habitation of the 
shepherds signifying all the goods of the church; the head of Carmel signifies 
the truths of the church, because in Carmel there were vineyards, and wine 
signifies the truths of the church.”

12

AE 601[16]



“...the roaring like that of a lion…signifies grief and lamentation over the 
vastation of Divine truth in the church by the falsities of evil.”

AE 850[15]



“In Amos...(i.2) to roar and the roaring of a lion, when predicated of Jehovah, 
signify an ardent zeal for protecting heaven and the church, and for saving 
those who are therein by the Divine truth and its power, which is done by 
destroying the evils and falsities that rise up out of hell...”

Derived Doctrine

Tekoa



 We are not given the correspondence of this town. We do know that it lay 6 
miles south of Bethlehem.  Bethlehem represents “the Word in its spiritual 
sense; the Lord willed to be born there because He is the Word.” (AE 700[9])
•
The word Bethlehem means “house (place) of bread” or food. Might 
Tekoa’s southerly distance from Bethlehem represent the way that the 
children of Israel, in their minds, were moving away from relying on the Word
as the house of bread?
“South represents intelligence, which is acquired by knowledges of spiritual 
and celestial truths.” (AC 1458) Is this geographic representation there to 
remind us that the Lord is going to return the church to intelligence about 
spiritual and celestial truths?



The Lord’s Concerns



“Israel in the days of Uzziah, one of the good kings of Judah...signifies the 
Lord’s royalty, or some aspect of His kingdom.” (AC 1409[4]) “Royalty of the 
Lord signifies heaven and the church.” (AR 664) These quotations indicate the
range of the Lord’s concern for His heavenly kingdom and the church. He is 
concerned about everyone in His kingdom, not just the ancient Israelites.

The Reigns of Joash and Jeroboam



Jeroboam the son of Joash: The Writings do not provide the specific 
significations of these two kings. However, when we look at the history of 
their reigns, we can see a spiritual decline from moderate “piety” and 
acknowledgment of the Lord by Joash to brazen disorder under Jeroboam’s 
leadership. During their reigns, the quality of worship declined: worship of 
“strange gods” and use of temple prostitutes were permitted in the temple. 
Spiritually wise and prudent kings and priests would never have allowed 

13

these practices to enter the temple of the Lord. The kings and priest became 
“people pleasers” instead of pursuing spiritual wisdom. The consequent co-
mingling of holy and unholy things was abhorrent to the Lord and a 
degradation of all that gave Israel its distinctiveness and representation.
 Although the people looked and acted happy with their lives during this time, 
the Lord saw within their hearts the seed of spiritual death, and He needed to
expose its deadliness.

The Earthquake

 The end of the church (or its perversion) is described in the Word by 
concussions, overturning, and sinking of the earth. Consequently, 
earthquakes signify changes of the state of the church. (AR 33, 711.)

Two Years



In the internal sense, a “year” does not refer to a year of time. “...angels, who 
are in the internal sense of the Word, cannot have an idea of any 
year...therefore instead of a year they have an idea of what is full in respect to 
states of the church, and what is eternal in respect to states of heaven...” (AC 
2906[10]) Our verse sets its time as “two years before the earthquake.” Why? 
When the Word refers to “two” of anything, it is often a reference to the will 
and the understanding.  Considering the meaning of an earthquake (see 
above), could “two years” represent the state of the will and understanding in
the process of being falsified or emptied out?

Putting It All Together

1. Amos represents the Lord.  The Lord is our Shepherd, and He is most 

concerned with His flock. We learn from the Writings that our knowledge of 
the Word is “speckled” with falsity. When we allow that speckled quality to 
grow out of control instead of shunning it as sin, falsification of the Word 
enters our hearts and minds.

2. The roaring of the Lord from Zion and the uttering of His voice from 

Jerusalem teach us several things about Him in this context:

 He has grievous distress for His church and people.
 He laments.
 He mourns.
 He has an ardent zeal for protecting heaven and the church.
 He warns of coming vastations.
 He points to the drying up of our “Mount Carmel” and the effects this 

will have on our “vineyards.” (AE 601[15])

14

3. The book of Amos is not about anger, revenge, and a loss of the Lord’s 

patience. Instead, it is a love story, a story of the Lord’s great love and concern
for both heaven and earth. This is a book of promise: The Lord will triumph 
over hell’s quest to dominate us and destroy the gift of salvation. This victory 
is not an occasional interest of the Lord’s; He has an “ardent zeal” to protect 
us and the angelic heavens. The book of Amos also talks about the coming of 
the New Church.

Read and Review

Please go back and read Amos 1:1-2.

Next, review the passages from the Writings, beginning with what we read from 
P&P: “The Lord concerning the Word and doctrine...”

will follow?
Look back at “Putting it all Together.” Can you see ways to apply these ideas 
to our church and lives?
Is there a specific challenge to our church in what you learned in this 
section? What makes it simple or difficult to apply this information to the 
New Church?
Can we compare our outlook and experiences with those of the children of 
Israel at that time? Have we, like Israel, become overly content or 
comfortable with the way things are in matters of life? Why or why not?
Do we, like Joash and Jeroboam, close our eyes to co-mingling ideas of 
idolatry and unfaithfulness (in all forms)? Is this something that happens to 
groups, or only to individuals?
In what ways can we think about listening attentively to the “roaring of the 
Lord from Zion?”
Do we hear the “roar of the Lord” as care, concern and an ardent desire to 
save and protect His people? What might keep us from hearing it this way? 
How can we change our hearing?
The book of Amos is a love story: will we hold this idea throughout the 9 
chapters? It will be a theme we need to revisit often. Think about ways to 
hold this idea in your mind as you continue your study of Amos.

AMOS 1:3-5

“Thus says the Lord:

For three transgressions of Damascus, and for four,
I will not turn away its punishment,
Because they have threshed Gilead with implements of iron.

15

 
 
But I will send a fire into the house of Hazael, 
Which shall devour the palaces of Ben-Hadad.
I will also break the gate bar of Damascus,
And cut off the inhabitant from the valley of Aven,
And the one who holds the scepter from Beth Eden.
The people of Syria shall go captive to Kir,
Says the Lord.”

Passages From the Writings

P&P



“...concerning those who pervert the knowledges from the Word which serve 
for doctrine, who thus turn aside also the good of these knowledges; that 
they shall perish, vers. 3-5.”

AE 532[12]



“The third and fourth generation signifies all who are in falsities from evil... 
three in the contrary sense signifying falsities, and four evils.... Like things are
signified by three and four transgressions in Amos 1:3, 6, 9, 11, & 2:1, 4, 6).”  

AC 9496



“As the staves by which the ark was carried signified power, so also did the 
staves or bars by which they fastened the gates of cities, as is evident 
from...Amos 1:5.”

Derived Doctrine

Damascus



 Damascus, the capital of Syria, is one of the oldest continuously inhabited 
cities of the world.  Damascus was once a city where the “...remains of 
worship as practiced in the ancient church (existed) and from whence came 
Eber or the Hebrew nation.” (AC 1769)
Sadly, Damascus degenerated from a city of strength for the people of the 
ancient church to a place of perversion and became a chronic enemy of Israel.
The Writings remind us of what the Lord said about the enemies of the 
household: the members of a household can represent “...the affection of 
falsity opposed to good; and...in [a] man who is in temptation [his] evils and 
falsities are within or are his, [so] they are said to be of his household....”  (AC 
4843[4])

16

Transgressions



“In the Word, evils are now called ‘sins,’ now ‘iniquities,’ and now 
‘transgressions’... Those called ‘transgressions’ which take place contrary to 
the truths of faith...” (AC 6563)

Gilead

 They threshed Gilead with the implements of iron.
 Gilead has a series of representations:

o “...the first good, that of the bodily senses and their pleasures.” (AC 

4117[3])

o “A state of good in remote conjunction” (AC 4129)
o “...the sensuous good by which a man is first initiated when being 

regenerated.”  (AC 4255[4])

o “...the good of the church, which is charity, and the good and truth of 

faith.” (AE 328[17])

o “...reasoning from the literal sense of the Word in confirmation of 

falsities.” (AE 654[44])

 Gilead represents that first state of enthusiasm in people for the things of the 
church, a time when they give some thought to ways of using or applying the 
truths. In this state, people believe that they know all that is necessary, but 
they may easily be misled because they are not yet able to distinguish 
between friendship and charity; shunning evils as sins and the as-of-self; zeal
and anger; and other important distinctions that spiritual maturity would 
teach them.  All of this leaves “Gilead” vulnerable to the “threshing” of 
Damascus.

Implements of Iron

 The “implements of iron” refer historically to a barbaric Syrian custom of 

using machines with sharp, iron blades to thresh the bodies of their enemies 
following a battle. It mattered little to them whether their helpless victims 
were dead or alive during the threshing.
“Iron signifies truth in ultimates, which is called sensual truth; which, when it
is separated from the rational and spiritual truth, is converted into a 
falsehood.” (AR 847)



Fire Sent into the House of Hazael

 Hazael became a ruler of Damascus through a strange series of events.  Ben-
Hadad was stricken with an illness. He sent Hazael to Elisha to ask what the 
outcome of his illness might be.  Elisha, seeking ways to bring haughty, 
irreligious Israel to its knees, secretly anointed Hazael king. Hazael returned 

17

and murdered Ben-Hadad, embarking on a long reign of terror and invasions 
within the divided tribes of Israel and Judah.

 Fire represents some kind of love. It is either a good love or a destructive self-

love.

Devouring the Palaces of King Ben-Hadad

 Note this quote from AC 9434. “The Lord appears to the evil as a ‘devouring 

or consuming fire’…” A king denotes ruling truths. Fire in the palace, in an evil
sense represents “the punishment of the profanation of what is sacred and 
holy.” (AR 748)  “Palace (Amos iv. 3) signifies the Word, consequently, the 
truth of doctrine which is from good.” (AC 4926)

Breaking the Gate Bar of Damascus

 A gate signifies the passage to the rational mind. (AC 2943)
 A gate of a city signifies doctrine by which there is an entrance into the 

church. (AC 2943)

 A gate signifies introductory knowledges of what is good and true, out of the 

literal sense of the Word.  (AR 899, 901, 904)

 Could the breaking of the gate of Damascus represent the Lord’s exposing, 
opening (unlocking), or defeat of the false principles within the rational 
mind?

Aven

 Aven represents “...the things of falsity and the reasonings therefrom of those 
in worship, which, regarded in itself, is interior idolatry, or extreme self-love.”
(AC 273)

 The valley of Aven: “A valley is lower than mountains; so it signifies what is 

lower or external in worship...it signifies falsities and reasonings which falsify
worship, and at length profane it.” (AC 1292)

The One who Holds the Scepter from Beth Eden





“...scepter signifies divine truth as to government....” (AE 431)
“Beth” means “house.”
“Eden” means “love.” The two words together mean “a house of love.” What 
kind of “house of love” is being cut off?

The People of Syria shall go Captive to Kir

 What help do we get from correspondences?


Syria signifies the church as to knowledges of truth and good. (AE 195)

18

 Kir “...denotes those who possess the knowledges of good and truth, but 

pervert them.” (AC 9340)

 Combining the meanings of these two verses can give us a hint that the Lord 

is going to remove the perversion of good and truth.  This verse describes the 
captivity of those who pervert the truth, and the previous verse shows the 
Lord removing the “scepter” from the house of self love, a place where 
perversion of good and truth would take place.

Putting It All Together

1. As you read the first and second chapters of Amos, you will notice how many 
times the “three transgressions...and four...” occur. That phrase is in Amos 1:3, 
6, 9, and 11, and Amos 2:1, 4, and 6. It occurs seven times. Please consider 
why the Lord would repeat this phrase to six nations around Israel. The final 
“three transgressions...and four” is spoken to Israel. Why seven times? Why 
does it end with Israel?

2. Damascus in a sense reminds us of our connection with innocent remains. 
Gilead represents a sense of discovery, a time when we feel alive with the 
beauty of the senses. We love to touch or feel things to know them. How often
do we want to take “things” in our hands, or smell the wonders of the world? 
The use of the five senses opens our mental world. These gifts at the 
beginning are filled with innocence. From remains, we have a kind of 
“mediate conjunction” with the Lord. Idealism abounds and being good is a 
way of getting approval and recognition. 
But at what point does the good beginning become the enemy of the 
household within? When do the sensuous, bodily pleasures become the 
“instruments of iron” that thresh our Gilead states? Probably, it happens 
when we learn to cover up our evil intentions with what appears reasonable 
and right, or when we put an emphasis on being right for the wrong reasons.
3. Damascus, in its prime, had a full amount of truth, but it perverted that into 
falsity. We are taught that the “three transgressions...and...four” represent 
turning truth to falsity, and “four” represents turning the natural and spiritual
understanding and will into evil. The literal sense gives the impression that it 
is the Lord who will not turn away punishment, but it is really unrepentant 
self-love that brings on the punishment and misery.

4. This truth is drawn from the correspondences of the fire in the house of 

Hazael, the devouring of the palaces, the gate bar of Damascus, the valley of 
Aven, the scepter of Beth Eden, and the people being carried off to Kir.  Every 
one of these references deals with the results of perverting the Word.
5. Appearances mislead the rational mind.  The sensual seems so much more 

alive and adaptable to human needs. In this way, what was so promising and 
vital at first becomes the enslaver. Appearances turn the mind, which could 
have drawn doctrine from the Word for good, to rationalizations, lies, and 
cover-ups, and the wayward proprium becomes the “implement of iron.”

Can you think of some current perversions of the Word in the world around 
you?  Are there times when we attempt to change or correct things of the 
church and doctrine for personal convenience?  When this occurs, do we do 
so with a thorough study of the Word, or are we influenced by “modern” 
consensus?
Can we identify with the “Gilead” state of misguided sensual enthusiasm 
turning us away from the Lord? When does this happen?  What can we do to
turn ourselves back to Him?
Are there things which you do that you know are wrong, but you seem 
unable to over throw them? Do you feel carried off to captivity?
Can you believe and find solace in the Lord’s promise to break the “gate bar”
so that the rational mind can find freedom again? How can you see this 
working in your life, or in the life of a church?

5. How do you understand the fire entering in and devouring the palaces? Can

you think of any examples of the things this represents?
Is it of any spiritual significance that Damascus is known to be the oldest 
continuously inhabited city in the world? Do we hear “remains” in this 
teaching? 

AMOS 1:6-8

“Thus says the Lord:

For three transgressions of Gaza, and for four,
I will not turn away its punishment,
Because they took captive the whole of captivity
To deliver them up to Edom.
But I will send in a fire upon the wall of Gaza, 
Which shall devour its palaces.
I will cut off the inhabitant from Ashdod,
And the one who holds the scepter from Ashkelon;
I will turn my hand against Ekron,
And the remnant of the Philistines shall perish, 
Says the Lord God.”

Passages From the Writings

P&P



“Concerning those who apply the Word to a heretical falsity, that they 

•
shall perish, vers. 6-8.”

AE 532[12]

 Remember that this passage teaches that the phrase “for three 

transgressions...and for four...” refers to falsities and evils interfering with the 
natural and spiritual understanding and will.

AC 1197

 The Philistines were part of the Ancient Church. In AC 1197, we are given a 

broad sweep of the Philistines’ history with a glimpse of their sad, perplexing 
heresy and its effect on Israel: “...they (the Philistines) sold the sons of Judah 
and the sons of Jerusalem signifies that they had no love and no faith...which 
was removed far from their borders.”  Heresy removes love and faith far from 
their borders. Amos 1:8 is cited in AC 1197.

Derived Doctrine

Gaza 



“That by Gaza are signified the things that have been revealed concerning 
charity....” (AC 1207 and AC 1210)

Captivity



“Captivity signifies being seduced, and so led away from truths and goods.” 
(AR 591)

 Question: could the phrase “they took captive the whole captivity” represent 

a complete seduction of truths and goods?

To be Delivered up to Edom

 Edom, in the good sense, signifies the Lord’s human essence; also, strength, 
power, or good of the natural principle. In the opposite sense, “the natural 
man originating in self-love, which despises and rejects all truth, whence 
comes the devastation...” (AC 3322[8]).

21

Fire upon the Walls of Gaza and the Devouring of its Palaces

 Gaza signifies “things revealed concerning charity.” (AC 1207) We can see that
if the heart of charity is seduced and self-love rules, there will be a fire of 
destruction from within that will wreck or destroy the walls of our defense. 
Self-love defends no one. It is a choice of the heart that takes for itself and 
gives nothing back. Charity that has been “burnt out” destroys or devours 
one’s palaces.

Cutting off the Inhabitant from Ashdod

 Ashdod was the site where the Philistines kept Dagon, their god. “Their 
religious principle was...represented by their idol called Dagon...[who] 
according to their description, was formed like a man from the head to the 
navel, and like a fish from the navel downwards; its being like a man…
represented the understanding derived from truths; and like a fish…
represented the natural destitute of the good of love....” (AE 817[10])

Ashkelon

 Ashkelon was one of the five cities of the Philistines and the only one on the 
seacoast.  Ashkelon bragged that Joshua or David could not take its city. The 
Lord said in these verses that its scepter (divine truth that governs) would be
cut off.

Ekron

 When the Philistines captured the ark of the covenant, they carried it to 
Ekron. While that city had the ark, they experienced painful physical 
problems that caused them to get rid of the ark as fast as they could. The city 
of Ekron and the Philistine god Dagon represent “the god of all falsities.” (AE 
740[10])

 The god of all falsities could not stand or prevail against the Lord. Isn’t that a 

powerful truth? 

Ahaziah

 Ahaziah, a son of Ahab and king of Israel (circa 850-849), became ill.  Rather 
than calling on the God of Israel for help with his illness, he preferred to go to 
Ekron so that he could consult Beelzebul.  In AE 740[10], Beelzebul is called 
the “...god of flies...the falsities of the sensual man...thus falsities of every 
kind.”

22

Heresies 

 Heresies are ever attendant upon the true church, and the ground of heresies 
is fixation upon some particular article of faith. (AC 362-363.) In AC 10402, 
we read that heresies arise from “...the literal sense of the Word being 
separated from its internal sense.”

The Remnant of the Philistines shall perish

 The Lord’s truth will defeat all heresy even when that heresy prides itself on 

its seductive power.

Putting It All Together

1. These verses tell us about the workings of heresy.  Heresies are ever 

attendant upon the true church. What a necessary teaching for us to consider.
We of the New Church need our watchmen upon the walls of the Holy City 
New Jerusalem to be alert. They need to warn us of the approach of heresy.  
Heresy is seductive.  It is self-love creating and justifying what it wills. 
Perhaps it comes to us as a “popular” article of faith, but if it has been drawn 
out and separated from the internal sense, it is a heresy.  Noticing the defense
of that heresy is crucial.  Heresies are defensive. They are sensitive. They 
perceive anyone as their enemy who speaks against them and will pursue 
such an enemy with a fervor that imitates religious zeal. The Writings tell us 
that heretical zeal is really anger directed against the Lord.

2. The god Dagon refers to an understanding that appears human but is actually

a natural idea that is destitute of the good of love (charity).

3. The god of flies (those things that thrive on decaying and foul sources) is a 

god some seek out instead of the One and only God of Heaven and earth. Why 
would anyone choose decay over what is wholesome? Why would anyone 
choose darkness over light? Insanity is the only possible explanation for the 
creation of a god that was half man and half fish.
This portion of the prophecy tells us that the Lord will remove the scepter 
from the hand of him who brags about his power to resist Joshua and David. 
The Lord will remove and defeat heresy because it is devoid and destitute of 
true charity.

If we find a beginning or well-entrenched heresy within ourselves, how can 
we remove its roots from our love?

3. Heresies are ever intent upon destroying the Lord’s church.  Do you see this 

as a truism, or a problem that needs our careful and thoughtful attention? 
The enemies in certain parables did their harm while people slept. Falling 
asleep mentally is a lifetime nemesis, and we need the Word to wake us up. 
Do we seek to be roused, or do we find it bothersome?

4. What forms of the god Dagon or Beelzebub exist today? The god Dagon 

represents the understanding derived from human truths and Beelzebub 
the natural destitute of the good of love.

5. Why do so many surrounding nations of Israel represent former remnants 
of the Ancient Church?  Why do they provide so much trouble for “their 
relatives”?

AMOS 1:9-10

“Thus says the Lord:

For three transgressions of Tyre, and for four,
I will not turn away its punishment,
Because they delivered up the whole captivity to Edom,
And did not remember the covenant of brotherhood.
But I will send fire upon the wall of Tyre,
Which shall devour its palaces.”

Passages From the Writings

P&P



“...concerning those who pervert the knowledges of good and truth, and 
thereby do violence to the external sense of the Word, vers. 9, 10.”

AC 367



“...both faith and charity are the offspring of the church. Faith is called a 
man...and charity is called a brother...the union of faith and charity is called 
the covenant of the brethren.” (Amos 1:9)

Derived Doctrine

Tyre (in a positive sense)




“...signifies those who possess spiritual and celestial riches.” (AC 425[2])
“...represents those who possess the knowledges of things celestial and 
spiritual.” (AC 1154)

24




“...interior knowledges...” (AC 1201)
Since the Lord is speaking to Tyre in a corrective manner in these verses in 
Amos, we must assume that all of the above have an opposite representation.

Edom



In the good sense, Edom represents the Lord’s human essence (love); also, 
the strength, power, or good of the natural principle. “In the opposite sense, 
the natural man originating in self love, which despises and rejects all truth, 
whence comes the devastation...” (AC 3322)

 AE 746[19] teaches that the universal heaven is in the good of charity toward 
the neighbor. The universal hell is in anger, enmity, and hatred against the 
neighbor. We need the covenant of brotherhood to keep our worship and 
study of the Word in a conjunctive state with the Lord’s Divine Human.

Delivering up the Whole Captivity to Edom

 When hatred, enmity, and revenge possess the mind, one can use the literal 
sense of the Word to justify almost anything wanted.  A person in this state 
can make slavery, stealing, lying, incest, and many other disjunctive concepts 
appear to be sanctioned by the literal sense. Such an approach will deliver up 
the captives to Edom.

Fire upon the Wall of Tyre and the Palaces Devoured





“He who loves himself, hates all who do not render him service....” (AC 
760[2])
“They who are so delighted with hatreds...are not content with destroying the
body, but also wish to destroy the soul.” (AC 815)

 Palaces represent the understanding in which truths are in a beautiful form. 
Truth is not able to remain beautiful when it is twisted and abused in the 
literal sense by self-love.

Putting It All Together

1. The integrity of the literal sense has to be protected. It would appear that we 
have public pressure for scholars to make newer translations of the Word 
more readable. To do this, some translators who are not familiar with the 
spiritual sense have focused on using simplistic words to the exclusion of 
important series of words. If they substitute simpler words without a full 
study of the original texts, what harm or damage is done to the Word? How 
much simplifying of the Word can be done without altering the internal 
sense? Some, little, or much? 

2. Are new translations of the Word easier for you to read? Do you find your 

remains fight to hold on to the King James translation, or whatever 

25

translation you read as a child? What do you like or dislike about different 
translations? Are there changes you find upsetting or refreshing?  The Word 
needs to remain as close to the original Hebrew as possible in a translation. 
How do we get help guarding the literal sense of the Word? What might a 
New Church translator be able to offer this effort?

3. Those who delight in hatred are not content with destroying the body, but 
also wish to destroy the soul.  The hells will use every possible excuse to 
discredit the literal sense of the Word and the teachings of the Writings. They 
hope to work toward the destruction of the soul of Divine Revelation.

2.

“reasonable” with quotations inappropriately drawn from the literal sense? 
Have you ever heard this happen? What was the result?
Since many of us are not “translators,” how do we protect our minds from 
being carried off as captives with errors of doctrine that may result from 
inaccurate translations?  Does the Lord protect those who follow the 
persuasive leaders of the church so that their palaces are not devoured?

3. What other avenues of thought can we follow using these passages?  
4.

The Lord has written the Word in such a way that it promises to reach the 
states of all people. Do we give up too easily and expect the Word to give us 
all the answers without our having to work for insights?  If the Word was so 
plain that it left no doubt about its meaning, who could stand if the Lord’s 
teachings were willfully disobeyed?
This section seems to tell us that we need to develop an attitude that says, “I
may not understand this passage now, but I will prayerfully ask for the 
Lord’s help so that when it is time for me to see and understand, I will be 
ready to be led by the Lord’s Word.”
Faith is called a “man,” and charity is called a “brother.” Together, they are 
the offspring of the church. How strong and healthy would you say the 
church’s “offspring” are today? How do we benefit from that strength? What 
can we do to support and increase it?

And cast off all pity;
His anger tore perpetually, 
And he kept his wrath forever.
But I will send a fire upon Teman, 
Which shall devour the palaces of Bozrah.”

Passages From the Writings

P&P



“...concerning those who pervert the literal sense of the Word through falsity, 
whereby doctrine perishes, vers. 11, 12.”

AC 4171[3]



“Edom did pursue his brother with a sword....his anger did tear perpetually....”
(Amos 1:11)  “...if a person who has lived in a life of good suffers himself to be 
so persuaded, and then becomes careless regarding life, and even treats it 
with contempt, he is said to be torn; for torn is predicated of good into which 
falsity is insinuated, and thereby the good becomes no longer living.” 

Derived Doctrine

Edom

 This is the third time in this chapter that we have had the mention of Edom: 

(1) Gaza delivered up to Edom captives - the whole captivity, which 
represents the enslavement of Charity; (2) Tyre delivered up the whole 
captivity to Edom, which represents the enslavement of knowledges, celestial
and spiritual; and (3) now, Edom is pursuing his brother with a sword, 
casting off pity, and showing perpetual anger, a wrath forever.

 Who is the brother? Remember Edom’s lineage goes back to Esau.  Is the 



brother mentioned in the lineage of Jacob’s seed?
“Brother delivering up brother to death, signifies that the false shall destroy 
good; specifically, that faith shall alone destroy charity.” (AE 315)

Sword





In the Word, a “sword” signifies (a) the truth of faith combating; (b) the 
vastation of truth; (c) in an opposite sense, the false combating; and (d) the 
punishment of the false. (AC 2799)
“Mention is very often made in the Word of ‘sword’...by them nothing else is 
signified but truth fighting against falsities and destroying them....the 
dispersion of falsities by the Word from the Lord....”  (AR 52)

27

Pity or Compassion

 Pity or compassion “...signifies the inflow of charity from the Lord.” (AC 6737)

It also signifies “...the influx of the Lord into those who are ignorant of truths 
and yet desire them.” (AC 9182[7])

Anger

 Anger represents “...a departure from charity.” (AC 1010)

Wrath

 Wrath represents “...a turning away from truth which was confirmed.” (AC 



6359)
It also refers to “...the fury of lusts, and their endeavor to inflict violence.” (AC 
8284)

Teman

 Teman “...signifies the Lord’s Divine Human as to celestial love.” (AC 2714)

“...the change in the church brought about by the evils and falsities from 
which they perished.” (AE 400[10])

Bozrah

 Bozrah has respect to the divine truth, and Edom, to the divine good of the 

Word.” (AE 922)

Putting It All Together

1. Self-love, out of order, can enslave charity. And self-love wants to enslave the 
knowledge of good and truth. What can you expect from self-love but that it 
will “tear” at all that is from the Lord? Self-love will pursue the Word so as to 
reject it, despise it, and hate it. Hell maintains anger and wrath toward 
anything (brother) that seeks to remove it or oppose its values.

2. Hell seeks to persuade whomever it can to become careless in regard to life. If
we treat life with contempt, it will tear the spiritual fabric and vitality of life. 
Inappropriate anger will eat away at the charity that is needed to love the 
Lord and neighbor.

3. The Lord is willing to show pity and patience to those who are in ignorance. 
But Hell attempts to tell us that the Lord is angry with us and that we are 
beyond help from the Word of the Lord.  What passages from the literal sense
would they use to back up this argument?  What passages could we use to 
refute this argument?

28

4. We need to take on the challenge to “think clearly” regarding the Lord. The 
Writings put it this way: “Of how great importance it is to have a just idea of 
God may appear from the consideration, that the idea of God forms the 
inmost of thought with all who have any religion.” (Divine Love and Wisdom 
[DLW] 13) So, our doctrinal knowledge must grow and improve with our 
changing states. We need to comfort ourselves with the solid belief that the 
Lord loves us and will never leave us.  His arms are not too short, and He 
never sleeps.  Such a faith stands us in good stead when hell tries to inject its 
poisonous lies. The Writings assure us that the Lord anticipates the tricks and
motives of hell and gives us the strength to resist and win. The sword of the 
Lord will win the battle for us.

Questions to Stimulate Reflection

1.

Inappropriate, or unhealthy, anger and wrath will attempt to tear things 
apart. Have you experienced this?  There must be a period in all of our lives 
when hell has pulled some passage up from the literal sense and mocked it, 
and without checking things, we carelessly accepted hell’s criticism.  Think 
of a time when this happened to you. How did you fight back so as to 
overcome this spiritual tearing?  Are some past or present “torn” issues still 
bothersome?

3.

2. What helps you remain positive about the things of faith and charity? When 
Hell tries to tell us how worthless or pitiful we are, how do we turn that 
message off?
Tiredness, frustration, worry, or obsession over something in our lives can 
cause us to err in our thinking. When we are vulnerable, hell urges us to quit
trying. Hell wants falsity to reign. If falsity is given any credence, it will try to
pervert the Word. Hell wants doctrine to perish. Why do you think this is 
true?
The Lord urges us to be strong and courageous. The Word teaches us, “The 
Lord is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear? The Lord is the 
strength of my life; of whom shall I be afraid?” (Psalm 27:1) How can we use
this verse to its fullest potential?

That they might enlarge their territory.
But I will kindle a fire in the wall of Rabbah,
And it shall devour its palaces,
Amid shouting in the day of battle, 
And a tempest in the day of the whirlwind.
Their king shall go into captivity,
He and his princes together.

Ripping Open the Women with Child in Gilead.  

 That striking a pregnant woman a blow “...signifies the injuring of the good 
which is from truth, is evident from the signification of to strike, as being to 
injure; and from the signification of a pregnant woman, as being the 
formation of good from truth...because the regeneration of man, which is the 
generation of the spiritual life in him, is meant in the internal sense of the 
Word by the generation of his natural life which is from his parents. For when
a man is born anew, he is then first conceived, afterward carried as in the 
womb, and finally born.” (AC 9042)

 As we learned earlier, Gilead signifies “...the first good, that of the bodily 

senses and their pleasures.” (AC 4117[3])

 Gilead also represents “The good of the church, which is charity, and the good



and truth of faith.” (AE 328)
“...the woman with child (are) those who receive truths, and she who is 
bringing forth those who do them.” (AE 721[10])

That They Might Enlarge Their Territory





I found only one reference to the word “territory” in the Concordance and 
almost didn’t use it because it was in the Spiritual Diary.  However, it may be a
good reference for our study.  See what you think.
“It has been shown how it befell those from the Christian world.  The leaders, 
who endeavored to destroy the kingdom of the Lord and heaven, were 
principally of those who were in faith alone....at length, all such...were cast 
down and dispersed....[they] delight in the sufferings of others, and devised 
unheard of contrivances for torturing others, by inflicting pain on body and 
mind, and holding the thought continually upon the pain, and sending those 
who also infused desperation: likewise, those who inflicted weariness of life 
and the continual desire of liberation from the pain...which two [classes] 
inflict such suffering and torture as cannot be described....[they were] outside
their own territory. For these were in the disposition of ruling and leading 
others, but did not attend to their own affairs.” (SD 5758[2]; 5759; 
5759[1&2])

 Those who oppose the Lord and His kingdom want to enlarge the scope of 

their control [territory]. Hell delights in planning the theft of the kingdom the
Lord wants to give freely to His children.

Kindling a Fire in the Wall of Rabbah 

 Historically, Rabbah was the capital city of the Ammonites. When the 

Ammonite kingdom ended, Rabbah was destroyed and was not rebuilt until 
259 BC, when it was renamed Philadelphia.

 Rabbah “signifies affections of truth in the natural man.” (AE 435[7])
 Rabbath of the Ammonites “...signifies the falsifications of truth.” (AE 163[8])

Wall

 A wall “signifies truth in the ultimates.” (AR 132)


In a quotation explaining the walls of the Holy City New Jerusalem, we are 
taught that “by its walls nothing else is meant but the Word in the literal 
sense, from which doctrine is derived, for that sense defends the spiritual 
sense, which lies concealed within it, just as a wall defends a city and its 
inhabitants....” (AR 898)

 The fire in the wall...shows the destructive quality of self-love and how it 

removes a protective quality from the inhabitants of the city.

The Devouring of the Palaces

 The beautiful structure of the understanding is likened to a palace when the 
mind takes the truths of the Word and applies them to life. Self-love causes 

31

the structure of the palace to fall into disrepair, leaving what was once regal 
and beautiful in shambles.

Amid Shouting in the Day of Battle

 To shout or to cry “...is said of every affection that breaks out from the heart...”



(AR 885)
“As a cry also is an act, which corresponds to a living confession or 
acknowledgment from faith....when confession and acknowledgment from 
faith are treated of.” (AC 5323)

 Crying in a good sense has respect to truths, but in a bad sense to falsity.  (AC 

2240, 2243)

 The “day of the battle” refers to a state when people believe themselves to be 
“...attacking from the understanding of truth from the Word...”  The negative 
sense of “battle” refers to falsities fighting the truth of the New Church.” (AR 
431, 704)

Whirlwind



In two references, the Writings comment on the meaning of a “whirlwind,” 
strong winds and tempests springing up. “It has at different times been 
granted me to perceive these tempests and also the east wind by which the 
evil were dispersed and cast into the hells....” (AE 419[22])

Their King and Princes Going into Captivity



“A king denotes truth itself, and prince a principal truth.” (AR 548)

Putting It All Together

From the very beginning of these passages, we are given a clear picture of what state
this is speaking to:  “Those who falsify the truths of the literal sense of the Word, that
in the day of combat they do not resist, but corrupt the truth of doctrine...” (P&P)

In Psalms 78:9, we read, “The children of Ephraim being armed, and carrying bows, 
turned back in the day of battle.” Instead of fighting with honor, they turned and fled.
Notice once again the problem of Ephraim. They were “armed,” but their weapons 
never got used in the battle. Loyalty, fidelity, courage, and dedication to the Lord and 
His Word were present in potential, but they were not used. As a result, the falsifiers 
were victorious, and they rip the potential of spiritual birth from the fledgling 
religious idea planted in the mind.

Tired, impatient feelings give the hells the foothold they want so they may advance 
their cause and spoil the land that could and should be preserved for the Lord. We 
need to see and hear the prophecy of Amos so that we will not turn in the day of 

32

battle. We need to be armed with the bow and aim our arrows at the center of falsity 
so that truth can be victorious and keep its place of great esteem.

A new day, a new tempest of an east wind can blow away the stagnant air of hell. 
East is representative of the Lord Himself and His love. An “east wind…in a genuine 
sense, denotes love to the Lord, and love towards the neighbor…” (AC 5215)

Our battle cry? “The sword of the Lord, and of Gideon.” (Judges 7:24)

With the daily reporting of news, we are exposed to a wide scope of tragic and 
frightful events. Each grievous, uncharitable act seems to outdo the prior. Gradually, 
we can become so jaded that nothing shocks us anymore. The result is that we 
accept these things as normal events in the lives of people. Perhaps we need to 
review a teaching in AC 1740[2]:  “The more horror there is contracted for evils and 
falsities, the more love there is insinuated by the Lord for goods and truths: also, the 
more horror there is of evils and falsities, the less dare evil Spirits approach, because
they cannot endure aversion and horror for the evils and falsities in which their life 
consists; sometimes they are seized with terror at the first approach of it.”

Questions to Stimulate Reflection

1.

Can you feel any sympathy with those who have little care or concern 
about the literal sense of the Word?  Does a mental warning go off when 
you hear someone ignore a teaching by saying, “This was an issue back 
then, but it is not appropriate or applicable for our times.”?

2. How can we stay sharp with our warfare against the lethargy of spiritual 

cowardliness?

3. Hell waits for us to become bored, tired, and impatient with life.  Then the 
evil spirits infuse weariness with suffering and despair that cannot be 
described.  This is not just a morbid idea. Millions of dollars are spent each
year for medications to help people cope. Without judging individual 
cases, it is clear that we fight mental and physical suffering and despair 
every day. We have powerful examples of how fragile our minds are in the 
presence of troubles. We need the Lord’s help to comfort our hearts and 
mind. What insights can be brought to this issue in our discussion time?
4. What about that teaching about having a horror for evil?  Do you believe 

this teaching, or is it ivory tower fluff?

5. We are not finished yet with the pronouncements against Israel’s 

neighbors. Have you looked at a map yet to see where they once lived?  
Might the fact that Amos addresses them from north to south be 
significant? In what way? 

33

6. How do you choose which issues to fight for and which issues to let slide 
by for the time being? We certainly don’t like appearing negative and 
angry. Those who seem overly concerned with issues are told to “lighten 
up” or “get a life.” People tell us to “relax” and not let things bother us. 
What do these words of admonition do to, and for, our willingness to stand
up for the right?

Chapter Two

AMOS 2:1-3

“Thus says the Lord:

For three transgressions of Moab, and for four,
I will not turn away its punishment,
Because he burned the bones of the king of Edom to lime.
But I will send in a fire upon Moab,
And it shall devour the palaces of Kerioth;
Moab shall die with tumult,
With shouting and trumpet sound.
And I will cut off the judge from its midst, 
And slay all its princes with him,
Says the Lord.”

Passages From the Writings

P&P



“Concerning those who adulterate the good of the literal sense of the Word, 
that they corrupt the good and truth of the church, vers. 1-3....”

AE 315[10]



“In Amos...(ii.3) Moab in the Word, means those who adulterate the goods of 
the church; the judge who will be cut off and the princes who will be slain, 
signify the good which is adulterated, and the truths which are thereby 
falsified, judge meaning good, and prince truth.”

AE 532[12]



“...the third and fourth generation does not mean the third and fourth 
generation, but that which these numbers signify. Like things are signified by 
three and four transgressions in Amos (i. 3,6,9,11,13, ii. 1, 4, 6). From this it 
can be seen how great arcana lay hidden in the Word merely in numbers, 
which no one can know without the internal spiritual sense.”

35

Derived Doctrine

Moab Burned the Bones



“...[burnings] are predicated of evil lusts, especially of those which are derived
from self-love.” (AC 1297) 

 Burning “...signifies damnation and punishment of evils arising from earthly 

and corporeal loves.” (AE 1173)

 Burning “...signifies injury or extinction of the good of love.” (AC 9055)
 The nearest I could come to “burning bones” was this quotation about 
“boiling bones.” In AC 3812[8], we read that harming bones “...signifies 
violence offered to truths.”

 Also, there is a reference to spreading out the bones of kings as “...signifying 

infernal things that control in idolatrous worshipers.” (AC 2441[9])

 Bones correspond to external truths, the natural, corporeal truths as facts in 
fixed forms on which all higher truths may rest for support. If these external 
or natural facts fail to exist, spiritual facts will have no basis on which to rest 
or grow.

The King of Edom



“Edom and Moab, in many passages are named together, because they signify 
those who are principled in good; but the difference is, that Edom denotes 
the good of the natural principle, to which are adjoined the doctrinals of 
truth; whereas Moab denotes natural good, such as has place with those, with
whom such doctrinals are not conjoined. The former and the latter appear 
alike in their external form, but not in their internal.” (AC 3322) Once again, 
we have to note that Edom and Moab in this lesson are not representative of 
good but of evil.

Lime

 Lime represents those who are studious in exploring justification by faith. 
Faith, to them, is the all of religion, and religion is nothing else but faith. In 
the spiritual world, these people live in huts constructed of reeds and rushes 
“plastered over with lime...” (AR 442)

 Those who indulge in the lusts of the flesh and those who satisfy the desires 
of the spirit are compared to: beasts and angels; shriveled grapes and dried 
grapes (wild grapes), and juicy and delicious grapes; and “...limestone and 
silver....” (True Christian Religion [TCR] 328)

 AE 391[14] likens the destruction of the church to the stones of an altar 

falling down and being scattered because the chalk (lime) is not capable of 
holding the truths together. Therefore, lime signifies “...falsities which do not 
cohere.”

36

Sending Fire upon Moab

 Please note that there is no mention of “fire on the walls of Moab” as in the 
previous pronouncements. This fire comes upon Moab itself. Is it because 
Moab represents natural good with which doctrinal things are not conjoined?

Kerioth



Is this city also known as Ar? Many scholars think so, and they believe this is 
the city Amos was referring to in Amos 2:2. The Writings have no reference to
Kerioth, but they do mention Ar. The city of Ar, as it is mentioned in Numbers 
21:15 and Deuteronomy 2:18, “...signifies those who are in general natural 
good.” (AC 2468[4])  “Ar (Isa.15:1) signifies the doctrine of those in truths 
from the natural man.” (AE 652[21])

Moab Dying with Tumult

 Tumult “...signifies the dismay of those in the church when visited by a Last 

Judgment and their evils are disclosed.” (AE 659[22])

 Panic (tumult) “...signifies the last state of the old church, involving a great 

change; and combat against the love of evil.” (AE 650[12])

 Tumult “...signifies the disputations and reasoning of those beneath heaven 

who are natural and sensuous.” (AE 706[23])

Shouting and Trumpet Sound



“...shouting, as being the quality of the interiors of that nation...as being the 
hanging of the combat between falsity and truth, and no decision.” (AC 
10456)

 Trumpet “...signifies to announce that the intellectual of the church has been 

laid waste.” (AC 4592[10])

Cutting off the Judge from the Midst



In general, a wise judge is one who fairly and evenly seeks to adjudicate what 
is right and just for all people, regardless of their station or position. A judge 
needs to uphold civil, moral, and spiritual laws. Like end, cause, and effect, 
the spiritual needs to flow into the moral and the moral into the civil.  
Because of Moab’s representation, we can assume that the Moabites did not 
base their natural justice on anything spiritual. Therefore, Moab was to be 
remanded and its central position of selfish, unwise, and biased judgments 
exposed.

37

Slaying all the Princes with the Judge

 As cited previously, a prince signifies a principle or leading truth. When 

judgment is faulty, its leading principles will be faulty. Therefore, both have to
die when faced with the real spiritual principles of the Lord.

Putting It All Together

1. When the Word is adulterated and the good of the Word is corrupted, nothing
of spiritual quality holds together. Like the lime not holding together the 
stones of the altar, our spiritual life and our judgments are scattered. When 
the natural man rules and twists everything to favor his proprium, his 
decisions will not look to being of use to the Lord and the neighbor. Self-love 
will do only that which gives it praise. Self-love will do good to those whom it 
can use later. The Moab faith will try to hang between falsity and truth in a 
state of no decision. This is done so that it will appear liberal, nonjudgmental,
and politically correct; it will seek to seem accepting of all lifestyles when 
there is an opportunity to receive honor, gain, and reputation as the reward.
2. The Lord did not find the lukewarm pleasing. He stated that He would have 
preferred hot or cold. The lukewarm were to be spewed from His mouth.  
(Rev. 3:16)

3. These verses remind us not to choose what seems convenient to us or to 
place the Word in unchaste conditions and decisions. The “bones” of our 
belief system must have integrity so that our framework will support the 
spiritual things we draw from the Word. The natural part of us will seek to 
compromise, burn, or boil the bones of our spiritual soul. At times, the 
natural mind feels that the act of compromise is most prudent. Is that true, or
is it an appearance? With these verses, we need to reflect on how easy it is for
us to have our bones burnt or turned into lime. If we do, the Word tells us 
that we will find ourselves unable to hold spiritual things together. The Lord 
calls us to face the hellish temptation to adulterate the Word by saying these 
words:
“Forever, O Lord, thy Word is settled in the heavens.” (Psalm 119:89)

Questions to Stimulate Reflection

1. There are times when we know what we should do, and we don’t do it. There 
are times when we know what we are doing is wrong, and yet we continue to 
do it.  How can we break through these spiritual lapses?

38

2. The Writings talk about the power of good intentions. Each time we reinforce 
these good intentions, an inner good is strengthened that will eventually help
us defeat the things we intend to overcome.  Do you remember the old adage 
that says the road to hell is paved with good intentions? See AC 9334[2], 
Divine Providence (DP) 152[2]. Even though we sometimes slip, the fact that 
we dislike our mistakes, feel embarrassed about them, and intend to resist 
them is a positive step.  For more thought on the power of intention, please 
read Conjugial Love (CL) 453. Suppose there are two men who look exactly 
alike and enjoy the same foods and entertainment. One intends not to laugh 
at an inappropriate comment, and the other man intends to laugh. Which 
man’s actions are excused by the Lord and His angels, even if both men laugh?
What do you think?

3. The theme of Chapter 1 and the beginning of Chapter 2 focused on the care 
and importance we must give to the Word.  What can we do in our notes to 
keep a focus on this series as given to us by the Lord?  Are we able to see first 
things said tying into last things said?

4. Do the abuses of the Word, as illustrated by each nation, sound more and 

more direful as we move toward the prophecy regarding Israel?

5. There is an interesting point to consider when thinking about Kerioth: One of 
the Lord’s disciples came from that city. Which one? He was a person who 
cared for the meager finances the disciples had. He worried about the 
wasteful use of perfume used to wash the Lord’s feet. Judas claimed that they 
could have sold the perfume and used the money for more practical things.   
Judas Iscariot was a man from Kerioth. Is this just a coincidence?

AMOS 2:4-5

“Thus says the Lord:

For three transgressions of Judah, and for four,
I will not turn away its punishment,
Because they have despised the law of the Lord,
And have not kept His commandments.
Their lies lead them astray,
Lies which their fathers followed.
But I will send a fire upon Judah,
And is shall devour the palaces of Jerusalem.”

Passages From the Writings

P&P



“Concerning those who destroy the celestial things of the Word; that they 
destroy both its celestial and its spiritual things, vers. 4, 5.”

39

Derived Doctrine

Representation of Judah



“From these and many other passages...it may be seen what is signified in the 
Word by Judah; and that it is not the Jewish nation, because this was very far 
from being a celestial church, or the Lord’s celestial kingdom; being the worst
of all nations in regard to love to the Lord and charity toward the neighbor, 
and also in regard to faith; and this from the days of their first fathers, the 
sons of Jacob, down to the present time. (That such persons were 
nevertheless capable of representing the celestial and spiritual things of the 
Lord’s kingdom... [is] because in representations the person is not reflected 
upon, but only the thing that is represented.)...But when they did not remain 
in the ritual ordained by Jehovah or the Lord, but turned away from them to 
idolatries, they then no longer represented celestial and spiritual things, but 
the opposite, that is, infernal and diabolical things....” (AC 3881[10])

Judah Despised the Law of the Lord



In various passages of the Writings, we are taught that to despise means to 
look with contempt. It means “...that the rational lightly esteemed the 
truth...adjoined to good.” (AC 1911) In another passage, it says that despising 
“...signifies that the good of life considered its priority of no account.” (AC 
3336)

 Putting these quotes next to the word “Lord” seems to indicate they held the 

Lord as of little esteem and His priorities as of no account. (AC 3882)
 How sad it is to read that Judah turned its heart away from its intended 

representation.

Failing to Keep the Commandments



In the Doctrine of Life 64 and 65, we are given a picture of the cycle of failure 
regarding the Commandments. Teachers and parents teach the 
commandments to their children, but within their own hearts, they think that
they are unable to keep them and therefore find a way to excuse themselves 
by saying the Commandments are “humanly” impossible to keep. The 
children pick up this attitude, and when they become adults, they carry the 
same sphere. Thus, they pass on the cycle of failure. The only way to break 
this cycle, we are taught, is to care more about pleasing the Lord than 
pleasing and impressing people. If this last statement is not clear, please read 
Doctrine of Life 64 for yourself.

Lies

 The lies they told themselves and the lies they learned from their fathers:

40

o The belief that they were the favored people.
o The belief that nothing would remove them from that favored 

position.

o The belief that they deserved prosperity and success for external 

gestures with little substance behind them.

o The stiff-necked resistance to the leading of the Lord’s Providence.
o The necessity to have a king like other nations.
o The belief in everyone doing what was right in his or her own eyes.

 What really brought on the lies was the people’s failure to value the 

conjunction of truth to good and to make the good of life a priority. They did 
not make themselves accountable for what the Lord would value.

The Fire on Judah and the Palaces of Jerusalem Devoured

 We can probably feel the tension this prophecy must have brought to the 
nation of Israel.  Conceivably, they nodded their heads in approval when 
Amos told them of the doom of their lifelong enemies. But now Amos dared 
to speak of the demise of Judah and the holy city Jerusalem. With angry 
voices, they must have hurled jeers and threats at this shepherd prophet. 
Their self-assurance and prosperity, their significant military might, and their
victories of conquest made all that Amos said seem preposterous and 
insulting.

 All of these possible reactions can illustrate how the fire of self-love came on 
Judah and how shabby the mental palaces of Jerusalem had become. Her 
understanding was not conjoining itself with love, and worship of the Lord 
was all lies and death.

Putting It All Together 

1. The celestial things of the Word most deeply involve the Lord. How we feel in 
our hearts about Him is important. Are we open and honest with Him, or do 
we pay lip service? Do we quote what we learned from the understanding 
without involving the will? The Lord would prefer an active love seeking 
truths, mirroring the conjugial principles. Are we telling ourselves lies? Do 
we perpetuate the lies of the past? Do we teach the commandments (in our 
actions) as if they are impossible to keep, and then excuse ourselves as being 
only human and therefore not expected to keep them?  Can we accept the 
challenge to break this cycle of failure so that we can follow the laws of the 
Lord to the best of our ability?  Many questions are posed in these verses, and
they are worth considering.
Just as Judah failed to live up to its representative role, could we as a New 
Church organization lose sight of our important representative role?  What 
do we represent?  How can we support that representation?

2.

3. Again, let us reflect on the attitudes that hurt Judah:

a. They lightly esteemed the conjoining of truth to good.

41

b. They held the good of life, as a priority, of little importance.

Questions to Stimulate Reflection

1. Reflecting on the mistakes of Judah would probably help each of us avoid 
duplicating their attitudes and lies. Think of an example from your own 
experience when someone made a decision that was influenced by one of 
these lies or attitudes.  How did it change their decision?  What was the 
effect?

2. How effective is it to look at the mistakes of others to make improvements on 
our life? What makes this technique effective or ineffective? How can it be 
used wisely? How can it be abused? How is charity a part of this technique?

3. Do we come down harder on the mistakes of others because we see their 
mistakes from our understanding? Truth is hard, but when we look at our 
mistakes, we tend to look at them from the will. The will tends to offer 
excuses from affections. “I did this because…” The understanding, on the 
other hand, judges from a more legalistic stand point. What’s your view of 
this? What do these two approaches have to offer? What happens when you 
separate them, or use them together?

4. How effective is it for an organization to look at the mistakes of other 

organizations to improve its own life?  When is this useful, and when is it not 
useful? How is charity a part of this technique?

AMOS 2:6-8

“Thus says the Lord:

For three transgressions of Israel, and for four,
I will not turn away its punishment,
Because they sell the righteous for silver,
And the poor for a pair of sandals.
They pant after the dust of the earth which is on the head of the poor,
And pervert the way of the humble.
A man and his father go in to the same girl,
To defile My holy name.
They lie down by every altar on clothes taken in pledge,
And drink the wine of the condemned in the house of their god.”

Israel





“Israel denotes those who are in divine truths from the Lord.” (AR 96 and 
350)
Israel “...also denotes the internal spiritual church, for that church is a church 
by virtue of spiritual good. Spiritual good is truth that has become good; for 
truth becomes good when the man lives according to it, for it then passes into
the will, and from the will into act, and becomes of the life; and when it 
becomes of the life it is no longer called truth but good.” (AC 5595)  

Selling the Righteous for Silver

 To sell “and to be sold signifies to alienate truths, and to be alienated from 

them, and to accept falses for truths, and to be captivated thereby.” (AE 840)

 Righteousness “...is predicated of what is good.” (AR 173)
 A principled person is someone who is in the Lord.


Silver represents “...truth acquired from the proprium.” (AC 9039) It can also 
mean “scientific truth.” (AC 6112) Further, we are told that silver “...signifies 
truth, and in the opposite sense, the false.” (AC 1551)

43

Selling the Poor for a Pair of Sandals



 The poor signifies “...one who is not in truths, also those who are ignorant of 
good and truth, but desirous of instruction.” (Heaven and Hell [HH] 420)
Sandal or shoe “...signifies the lowest natural truths by which one lives 
(walks).” (AC 4677[9])
“The shoe is what clothes the sole of the foot and the heel signifies the 
ultimate natural...thus the corporeal itself.” (AC 1748)



Panting After the Dust of the Earth



Is panting or breathing fast a form of excitement, anticipation, or shortness of
breath? Is panting a way of gasping for air? Let’s look at gasping for breath 
because I can only find one reference for that and nothing for panting. 
“Gasping for breath signifies sorrow because of falsities that extinguish 
spiritual life.” (AE 315[17]) In this context, it would appear that Israel did not
worry about the extinguishing of spiritual life and had no regrets.

Eating Dust



“...eating dust...signifies that their sensuous part became such that it could not
live from anything but that which is of the body and of the earth...it became 
infernal.” (AC 242)

 To understand the dust on the “head” of the poor, we need to look for help 

from the doctrines. Dust represents what is “damned” or “infernal.” (AR 788) 
It also corresponds to the lowest things of the sensual principle of man. (AE 
1145)

 We can look up “head” and see that it means the dominion of evil in general, 

and self-love in particular. (AC 250) The head also can represent self-
exaltation (AC 1307) or the insanity from unmitigated falsities, especially the 
denial of the Divine Human. (AR 568) So, how do we understand what is 
being taught here? It appears that this prophecy is intended to show the 
baseness of their attitudes toward the Lord and the neighbor. The “dust on 
their head” represents the lowest of motives lived out in their daily activities. 
Me, myself, and I are the greatest. All others are of little importance in 
comparison to self.

Perverting the Way of the Humble

 When there is no love for the spiritual things of the church, as represented by 
Israel, it follows that the way of the humble (those wishing to rid themselves 
of pride and self-love) would be deceived and not helped. This would be like a
doctor, with the knowledge and medication to cure or help the sick, callously 
withholding medication from those who need it the most.

A Man and His Father being Intimate with the Same Girl



“...it is common in the Word to call things of the church conceptions, births, 
offspring, infants, little ones, sons, daughters, young men, and so on.” (AC 
339)

 A girl “...signifies fresh goods and their affections and the derivative 

gladness…” (AC 2348)

 Using our information about the correspondences, we can deduce that a 
father and his son going in to the same girl signifies that they made their 
rational good unchaste. There was a willingness to spoil and make light of 
holy things. They were not chaste in thoughts and deeds. All delights of 
conjugial love, even in the ultimates, are only present when there is a love 
and respect of chastity. “To lie with signifies to pervert and adulterate what is 
true and good.” (AC 3399)

Defiling the Lord’s Holy Name

 The possibilities of doing this are myriad. It happens when we allow the hells 
to convince us that they are stronger than the Lord; when we feel that living 
the life of religion is impossible; when we feel the Lord requires too much of 
us; when we feel or say we don’t care what the Word says about something 
we want to do. We defile the Lord’s name when we calling truth falsity and 
falsity truth. Perhaps these few suggestions will help you to think of other 
examples.

Lying Down by Every Altar on Clothes Taken in Pledge

 According to the literal meaning of this, apparently the church (priests) was 
extracting money from the people. The greater the importance of the cases 
they heard and rendered decisions on, the greater would be their payment. 
Justice was not always the end. Reward and wealth tainted their decisions. 
Payment might come in the form of ornate and expensive garments. But the 
heinous thing about the tribute money was that the priests collected it in the 
name of the Lord. They approved and sanctioned it by rabbinical laws, so 
they were blatant with their demands for payment for services rendered.
 Lying down beside every altar speaks of their disrespect of worship. It does 
not say kneeling, standing, or being watchfully attentive. Lying down seems 
to connote carelessness. They did this beside every altar. It sounds as if they 
served whatever god or idol was called for. This is eclectic religion at its 
worst.

 On the spiritual side, the clothes of a priest speak of the office, or use, being 

served. It is the office that should be respected, not the individual wearing the
clothes of the pledge.

45

Drinking the Wine of the Condemned

 This was given to us as representing truth falsified and profaned. Instead of 
passing through the gate of Holy Supper or the door of conjunction, the 
people chose to pass through the gate of disjunction and separation from the 
Lord.

Putting It All Together

1. From these verses, we get a clear message. Seek first the kingdom of heaven 
and all else will follow. Let that truth become good. Truth becomes good 
when we live according to its leading. Let a truth pass into the will and from 
the will into act. When this happens, truth becomes part of our life.

3.

2. We need to welcome truth and not alienate it, to see caring for the spiritually 
poor in us as a necessary process. We need truth to ward off ignorance, to 
protect the feet of natural day-to-day functions and to desire something more
than the sensual, corporeal demands or “panting for the dust of the earth.”
In the same degree as the world glorifies the sensual and makes the unchaste 
appear “normal,” we need to keep our minds focused on love truly conjugial.
4. We never know who watches us and sees us as role models. Are we humble? 
Are we caught up in the clothes of a pledge? Do we look tired and bored with 
our worship? Do we withhold a concept of truth from those who need and 
want direction? Do we make conquering the insanity of “unmitigated falsities,
especially the denial of the Divine Human” a priority? The Divine Human is to
be drawn from a genuine appreciation of the Word.

5. Are we so accommodating with our thinking that we can lie next to “every 

altar...”?
Some pride themselves on saying things like: “We all worship the same thing, 
so it doesn’t matter what church we belong to.” Can we really trust this 
saying?
This section contains a significant challenge for us to reflect on. Can we do it?

AMOS 2:9-11

“Yet it was I who destroyed the Amorite before them,
Whose height was like the height of the cedars,
And he was as strong as the oaks;
Yet I destroyed his fruit above
And his root beneath.
Also it was I who brought you up from the land of Egypt,
And led you forty years through the wilderness,
To possess the land of the Amorite.
I raised up some of your young men as Nazarites.
Is it not so, O you children of Israel?
Says the Lord.”

Passages From The Writings

P&P



“That the Lord had thoroughly removed the falsities of evil, when the church 
was instituted among them, and they were instructed, vers. 9-11....”

AC 6306[4]

 And in Amos...(ii. 9, 10) “...here the ‘Amorite’ denotes evil, for the evil of the 

love of self is described by the ‘height of the cedars and the sturdiness of the 
oak.’ That the ‘Amorite’ is evil in general, is because the whole land of Canaan 
was called ‘the land of the Amorite;’ for it is said, ‘I lead you in the wilderness,
to possess the land of the Amorite.”

AC 1857

 This passage includes the same statement regarding the Amorite and that 

“the whole land of Canaan denotes evil in general.”

AC 9489[3]

 Height “...signifies the evil of the love of self, thus self-exaltation of mind; as 

in...Amos ii. 9.”

AC 348



“...works of faith devoid of charity are works of no faith, being in themselves 
dead, for they are solely of the external man....That (in this state) both fruit 
and the root perish, is thus declared in...Amos ii. 9.”

47

AE 633[7]



“The vastation of the church and also full temptation are signified by the 
tarrying of the sons of Israel forty years in the wilderness, which is spoken of 
in…Amos ii.10.”  

Derived Doctrine

Reminding Israel

 Why does the Lord have to remind Israel so often what He did for them? Are 
their memories so poor that they can’t keep their facts straight? Could it have 
been that their oral tradition left out the part about the Lord’s deliverance 
and highlighted human effort? Or had they gotten so used to His miracles 
they took them for granted? 

 There is an interesting quote in the Arcana that says: “...Divine remembrance 
(or reminiscence) is salvation; and by non-remembrance, or forgetting is 
signified damnation.” (AC 8620) The Lord’s effort to remind Israel what He 
did for them was not divine impatience or irritation but the action of His love 
to keep them in a state of remembrance or a state of salvation. The story of 
salvation gives hope and consolation to those who find themselves in a state 
of despair and temptation. If the Lord had wanted to damn them, He would 
have allowed them to forget.

Preparing Israel

 The passages under study tell us of the preparation the Lord provided for the 
children of Israel. The Lord thoroughly removed the falsities of evil and gave 
them instruction. What does this mean? Can we get a small glimpse of what 
the Lord did for them?

 The following passages may help us see some ways:

o AC 677: “Before man can be regenerated, he must be instructed in all 
those things which can serve as means; in goods...in truths...and in 
things confirmatory...Before a man has been instructed in such things, 
he cannot be regenerated.”

o AC 3155: “...instruction precedes, with good, concerning truth; and 

with truth, concerning good.”

o AC 4538[3]: “When the Lord makes a man new, He first instructs him 

in the truths of faith…”

o AC 6879, 6881, and 6883 give us three specific kinds of instructions 

Israel received through Moses:

 The first instruction: Moses is told that God (I AM WHO I AM)

Himself is to be worshiped.

 The second instruction: Divine truth, which is from the Lord, 

must be received.

48

 The third instruction: The sons of Israel represented those of 
the spiritual church, for whom that instruction was intended.

 The great Passover, the parting of the Red Sea, the tumbling of the walls of 
Jericho up to the present lesson of the Amorite’s fruit and roots being 
destroyed were all forms of instruction that told the children of Israel that 
pride, conceit, and self-love would not survive in the Lord’s presence.

Cedars and Oaks

 Cedar trees “...signify rational or intellectual truth.” (AC 119)
 Oak trees “...signify exterior conceit of those who boast from knowledges.” AE 

410.

 The Lord, by citing this, to Israel was saying: Remember Israel, resist the way 
of the Amorite. Remember Israel, the Amorites thought they were strong 
oaks, and yet their fruit and roots died. The Amorites were not the mental 
giants they thought they were.

“It was I who brought you up from the Land of Egypt…”

 Egypt in the opposite sense “signifies memory-knowledge which from itself 
enters into heavenly mysteries, thus perverting, denying, and profaning 
divine truths.” (AC 4735[15])

 The Writings describe this as a period in their lives when the Israelites went 
through full temptations and a period of vastations in the wilderness. Look at 
the meaning of “forty” in this context: “By their journeying and wanderings in
the wilderness forty years, all the state of the combating church is described-
how of itself it yields, but conquers from the Lord.” (AC 2708[6]) 

 Temptation “...is a combat between good and evil, therefore each strives for 

the domination, that is, whether the spiritual man shall rule over the 
natural...or the contrary....” (New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine [NJHD] 
199)

 Vastation has many descriptions in the Writings. Words such as “devastate,” 
“desolate,” “despair,” “laid to waste,” or “emptying out” may appear in these 
quotations. Essentially, the word “vastation” indicates that a process of 
preparation must occur within the will and understanding so that spiritual 
ignorance and falsity are removed, or emptied out,  to make way for an 
internal worship of the Lord that will be as free of profanation as possible.

The Wilderness

 When we hear the word “wilderness,” what image comes to mind? Some 

people picture a desert with miles and miles of sandy dunes. A wilderness is 
more than that. It is an untamed wild habitat, with no smooth roads or paths. 
Cracks and crevices abound. Scraggy trees, thistles, and briar bushes grow 
wherever they can find enough soil to outdo some other rival weed.

49

 For a lamb, danger would abound in a wilderness. There would be predators 
lurking in wait for the frail or unsuspecting prey. Truly, a wilderness is a place
where the survival of the fittest is a way of life. A spiritual wilderness lacks 
order and discipline.
So the question, “do you remember the full temptations and period of 
vastations you went through in the wilderness?” is there to signify “the 
obscurity of faith, for a wilderness is uninhabited and uncultivated.” (AC 
6904)



I Raised up Young Men as Nazarites

 The Nazarites put themselves under a vow to abstain from wine, from cutting

their hair, and from having contact with anything unclean or dead.

 Probably, the Nazarite we think most about is Samson.


“...the Nazarites in the Israelitish church represented the Lord as to the Word 
in ultimates, which is the sense of its letter. For Nazarite in the Hebrew 
language is hair, or lock of hair; hence Samson, who was a Nazarite from the 
womb, had power in his hairs.... By reason that hairs signified that holiness of
the Word it is said of the Nazarite that: ‘they should not shave the hair of his 
head....’ Num. vi. 1-21...” (AR 47)
“As the Nazarite represented the celestial man, who is regenerated through 
the good of love, and not through the truth of faith like the spiritual man, and 
who consequently is not regenerated as to the intellectual part, but as to the 
will part...therefore the Nazarite was forbidden to eat anything which came 
forth from the vine, thus was not to drink wine....” (AC 5113[16])
“...there is spiritual death when there is a lack of truth.... As death signified 
damnation, the people of the representative church were forbidden to touch 
the dead, and if they touched they were unclean, and were to be cleansed....” 
(Num. vi. 6-12 was referenced regarding why a Nazarite was not to touch the 
dead.) (AC 6119 [4])





PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER

1. The Lord reminded Israel of what He had done in preparation for their 

calling. This point reminds one of a parable in Matthew 21:33-43. In that 
parable, we are told of all the owner did prior to turning the vineyard over to 
husbandmen and going into a far country. He planted the vineyard, hedged it, 
dug a winepress, and built a tower. When he sought his share of the crop, they
maltreated his servants, and when he sent his son, they killed him. The Lord 
is the owner, and mankind is the husbandmen in this parable.

2. The Lord prepared His people. He fought for and delivered them. He 

instructed them in the truths of faith and gave them Divine Truths. He gave 
them shelter in the wilderness state. He gave them the ultimate sense of the 
literal sense — the holiness of the Word so they might find their way out of 
spiritual deadness.

50

3. He always lifted up a strong leader, a prophet, or a Nazarite so they could see 

the power of the Lord in the ultimates.

4. When their pride finished its foolish surge and their downfall occurred, the 

Lord wanted the Israelites to see where and how they walked away from the 
preparatory work done for them. They killed the servants, and they killed the 
son. They wanted the vineyard for themselves. They lied to themselves that 
they had done all the work and that it was unfair that the Lord should expect 
any returns while He was off in another country.

5. Would the prophets’ words about the drying up of the Amorite fruit and the 
death of the oak tree root awaken their sense of spiritual reality? It would 
only work for the person willing to look within the spiritual sense of the 
prophecy.

Questions To Stimulate Reflection

1. Would it be worth our time to reflect on all that the Lord has done for us? 
Why? Although we can’t speak of all things, are there some specific or 
significant events that stand out as most important?

2. We probably have witnessed someone in a position of importance losing their
job and the respect of their followers. Something comes out regarding a 
clandestine disorder that embarrasses them publicly, and they seek the 
shelter of seclusion in shame. What are we reminded of by such events?
3. Have we ever had hell tempt us to think that we are “the captain of our ship 
and the master of our fate?” The hells say things like: “I was the one who 
faced the heat of the sun to pull out the weeds. Where was the Lord? I was the
one who carried the water to nourish the seedlings and vines. I was the one 
who picked the grapes and crushed them in the wine press. I was the one 
who went up in the tower to watch for the approach of the enemy or the wild 
animals that would have eaten the vines. Where was the Lord all this time?” 
Such thinking assumes that self-intelligence did it alone. Why might we listen 
to the hells? What makes us vulnerable to this temptation? What helps us to 
ignore them?

4. The power of the literal sense comes to our attention again in this section. Yet
there are times when our lack of understanding of the Word may give us the 
false impression that it is “bald” or empty of meaning and relevance for our 
life and times. Can we think about certain passages we had assumed meant 
nothing, and then think of a time when we experienced an opening of our 
spiritual eyes? What we thought was obscure eventually helped us through 
some trying time.

51

5.

I am still considering the series of things the Nazarites were told to forgo. 
How do they apply in our lives, literally and representatively?
Avoidance of the products of the vineyard?

 Not shaving or cutting hair?
 Avoidance of touching dead things?

What spiritual significance are we able to apply to ourselves regarding these 
prohibitions?

6. Vastations. This word has the sound of something one would like to avoid, 

but we know there has to be an emptying out of falsity, ignorance, self-love, 
etc. Our prayer life may have to be that we not run away. Trusting in the 
Lord’s Providence tells us what?  No temptation will come until we are able to
resist and no evil will befall us unless some good may come from it. Hell tests 
us on this. It throws a host of situations before us, and asks: “How come this 
person had to go through this horrible thing? She was innocent and 
blameless. How could God permit such horrible things to occur if He is so 
merciful?” We have doctrinal answers, but for some these answers may seem 
insufficient. How do you deal with these questions and answers?

AMOS 2:12-16

“But you gave the Nazarites wine to drink,
And commanded the prophets saying,
Do not prophesy!
Behold, I am weighed down.
As a cart full of sheaves is weighed down.
Therefore flight shall perish from the swift,
The strong shall not strengthen his power,
Nor shall the mighty deliver himself,
He shall not stand who handles the bow,
The swift of foot shall not escape,
Nor shall he who rides a horse deliver himself.
The most courageous men of might
Shall flee naked in the day,
Says the Lord.”

Passages From the Writings

P&P



“That nevertheless that church has perverted all things; and that hence it has 
become like one who is in the possession of the truth and yet is without 
truth; and thus at the time of judgment it perishes, vers. 12-16.”

52

AC 10303[4]



“...truths with man have been disposed into series according to the angelic 
societies with the regenerate.... The series into which truths have been 
disposed with the good, and the series into which falsities have been 
disposed with the evil, are signified in the Word by sheaves and bundles (as 
in...Amos ii. 13...).”

AE 357[22]



“In Amos: He that holdeth the bow shall not stand, nor shall the swift of foot 
deliver himself, nor shall he that rideth upon the horse cause his soul to 
escape, but he that is stout in his heart among the mighty shall flee naked in 
that day (ii. 15,16). This describes self-intelligence, and thus confidence from 
an ability to reason from falsities against truths; ‘he that holdeth the bow 
shall not stand, nor shall the swift of foot cause himself to escape’, signifies 
that one who knows how to reason readily and skillfully from the doctrine 
and from the memory that belongs to the natural man, cannot provide for his 
salvation, nor stand in the day of judgment; the like is signified by ‘he that 
rideth upon the horse shall not cause his soul to escape; he that is stout in his 
heart shall flee [naked] in that day’ signifies that he who trusts in himself 
because of an ability to reason from falsities shall then be deprived of all 
truth; the ‘stout in heart’ meaning him who trusts in himself on that account, 
and ‘naked’ signifying deprived of all truth.” 

AE 783[3]



“...those who are in falsities are called in the Word powerful, vigorous, mighty, 
strong, heroes, rulers, terrible, dreadful, and wasters, as can be seen from 
various passages, as from the following.... Amos ii. 14, 16....”

AE 355[26]

 A passage in AE 355[26], which explains Amos 2:15-16, has almost identical 

wording as AE 357[22].

Doctrine of the Lord 4

day,’ and ‘in that time;’ in which...is meant the Lord’s advent. In...Amos ii. 16...”

Derived Doctrine

Giving the Nazarites Wine to Drink



If you recall, the reason the Nazarites were prohibited from eating or 
drinking anything from the vine was because of a Divine representation. The 
Nazarites were to be regenerated “...through the good of love...and not 
regenerated as to the intellectual part…” (AC 5113[16]) The Nazarites 
represented the will and not the understanding. The Israelites got them to 
drink wine, which tells us they got them to emphasize or involve themselves 
in the intellect and not the affectional. This was a reversal of their uses. The 
rational is more argumentative, debating, legalistic, analytical, and forensic, 
and it is different from the involuntary, affectional, and spontaneous uses. 
With a regenerating involuntary, there is a worship and love of the Lord that 
flows from the heart (will) spontaneously.   

They Commanded the Prophets not to Prophesy

 When a person allows his or her integrity to be compromised, that person’s 
credibility will be called into question. When the Nazarites drank the wine, 
they severed their representation with the Lord and lost standing among the 
people. Their words of prophecy sounded empty and not worth hearing. The 
prophets were speaking, but they were not touching the hearts of the people. 
We might say they started talking about things they didn’t know much about. 
Their true calling was in the realm of the will, and they lost themselves in the 
realm of the understanding.

The Lord Weighed Down by Them

 When the joy of serving the Lord is lost, everything seems meaningless, slow, 
tedious, and bothersome. The work of regeneration seems hard and unfair. 
Our sense of the Lord becomes buried in a sense of obligation that suffocates 
the mind and “weighs us down.” Although this verse says the Lord is weighed 
down, it is just the opposite. The obliged, duty-bound worshiper is the one 
with the weighing-down problem.

Cart

 The “new cart” the Philistines used to send the ark of covenant back to Israel 
signified “...doctrine untouched and unpolluted by the falsities of their evil...” 
Whereas, a cart “...signifies the doctrine of natural truth...” (AE 700[23])
 Therefore, a weighted-down cart full of sheaves represents the series of 

falsities that were disposed in the doctrine of natural truths of the evil. We 
need to recall the two choices: One is to have the series of truths disposed so 
as to keep us in contact with angelic societies, and the other is to have a 

54

series of natural truths in contact with the evil. Israel had chosen the second 
series. 

Flight Shall Perish from the Swift

 There is an interesting number in the Arcana where flight is explained this 
way: “No faith, and faith without love, are also compared by the Lord to 
winter where He foretells the consummation of the age, in Mark: - Pray ye 
that your flight be not in the winter, for those be days of affliction (xiii. 18, 
19). Flight means the last time, and also that of every man when he dies....” 
(AC 34)

 The swift are those who prided themselves with their mental agility. They 
were fascinated with their intellectual ability to adapt to changing popular 
opinions. The ones who seem to have all the swift answers will not escape 
Divine accountability.  The speed of their rationalizations will not change the 
direction of their “departing flight.”

The Strong, the Mighty, the Powerful, etc.

 Please read again AE 783[3] where we are taught that these terms, when used

in the Word, represent those who are in falsities.

He Who Handles the Bow

 When we use the term “archer,” there are at least four quotations worth 









noting to add to our consideration of this verse:
“The man of the spiritual church was formerly called a ‘shooter of the bow,’ 
because he defended himself by truths, and disputed about truths; differently
from the man of the celestial church, who is secure by means of good, and 
does not dispute about truths...” (AC 2709)
“...the shooter of the bow...[describes the church desolated in respect to 
truths]...false doctrinals.” (AE 411[19])
•
against evils and falsities...[but when a church is being vastated, a 
bow]...signifies that there would be no longer any truth in the doctrine nor 
any understanding of truth, and thus no combat or resistance against 
falsity....”  (AE 357)
•
“That a ‘bow’ here denotes the doctrine of truth, is evident from its 
signification. Wherever wars are treated of in the Word, and wherever they 
are mentioned, no other wars are signified than spiritual ones....” (AC 2686)

“...a bow signifies doctrine combating, or doctrine by which one fights 

Swift of Foot



“The ‘foot’ signifies what is lower, and thus more obscure, in the Lord’s 
kingdom.” We, as humans, are quite prone to make evaluations of what is 

55

most important in life. How often are we right? “To the man whose mind and 
heart are set (the doctrine of charity and faith) appear as unimportant, and 
perchance as of no advantage to him; yet to the angels...these same things are 
precious...” (AC 2540) This number also says that what is important to men is 
often unimportant to the angels. So the swift of foot shall not escape because 
their wisdom is not able to keep up with the Lord’s.

The Rider of a Horse Shall Not Deliver Himself



“By horse is signified the understanding of the Word...horses in the opposite 
sense…signify the understanding of the Word and of truth falsified by 
reasoning, and likewise destroyed; as also one’s own intelligence...”  (AR 298) 
This series of numbers in AR deals with the “riders of horses.” The spiritual 
meaning of the four horsemen described in Revelation is to show the effect 
our heart and mind can have on the Word, as illustrated in the colors of the 
horses: white, red, pale or black.

Fleeing Naked in That Day

 To get a glimpse of this meaning, let’s turn to Genesis and the story of Adam 
and Eve recognizing their nakedness. “By knowing that they where naked is 
signified their knowing and acknowledging themselves to be no longer in 
innocence as before, but in evil...for where there is no innocence, nakedness 
is a scandal and disgrace.... For this reason nakedness is used in the Word as a
type of disgrace and evil, and is predicated of a perverted church...” (AC 213)
In this passage of Amos, it appears that they didn’t know they were naked. 
The Lord had to tell them how void of innocence and truth they were. Their 
nakedness was a disgrace.



Putting It All Together

1. The Israelitish church perverted all of its divine gifts. They possessed the 

truth, and it was sufficient unto the day, but they didn’t use it. In the day of 
judgment, what they thought were their greatest attributes turned out to be 
useless acquisitions.

2. Their self-intelligence and ability to reason from falsities against truth hurt 
the Israelites. The doctrines they had to fight against evil (the archers) 
couldn’t stand (or couldn’t shoot straight).

3. Because they were devoid of truth, the Israelites had nothing to clothe their 
minds. Vulnerable, exposed, they couldn’t hold their heads up. They were a 
scandal and disgrace to those spiritual things they were to represent, and 
they perverted the church.

4. Cutting off the message of the prophets, telling them to not prophesy, and 

switching the uses of the will and understanding brought a spiritual insanity 
that obfuscated truth and reality.

Questions To Stimulate Reflection

 Have you noticed how the Word gives us examples of the will and 

understanding trying to usurp one another?  Let’s look at just two examples 
for now: Cain’s slaying of Abel and Jacob supplanting Esau. In the Jacob and 
Esau story, the Writings mention how often, from the beginning of mankind, 
people have argued which is the most important: good or truth? See AC 3289. 
Why do we persist with this debate? The Writings make it abundantly clear 
that both are needed for a balanced spiritual life. So what is the problem? 
Why do we need to argue this point over and over again?

 How often do we question the ways of the Lord and imagine that we know a 
better way of making the choices of life? People still get angry with the Lord. 
We continue to live with the illusion that it is our prudence that gets us by. 
We have to be quick on our feet to sort things out. In the Word, the answers 
we seek to some troubling issues are not always clear. We imagine it all would
be simpler if the Word were more direct in its applications. Why do you think 
people feel this way?  What causes this anger or frustration?  How do we 
resolve it?

 Taking our flight in winter. This has been a helpful teaching for me. It reminds
me to come out of a coldness or indifference to spiritual things so that the 
spring and summer states are in my heart. What about you? Is there a useful 
state in the snow and cold of a spiritual winter? What brings us back to 
spring and summer?

 The idea of mental nakedness reminds us of the need to choose things that 

are important to angels and overcome the temptation to choose our 
unimportant things. In hindsight, one has to admit that unimportant things 
appear to be wrapped in interesting packages, and spiritual things appear to 
be in plain wrappings. Hell tries to remove our states of innocence by offering
us seemingly attractive options. When their deception works and we finally 
see what shallowness we chose, they mock us for our poor choices and 
vulnerability. We need to pray for a discernment that will help us learn from 
our mistakes so we can move with spiritual haste to the state of innocence of 
wisdom. If ever we lapse into a state of spiritual “nakedness,” there is a ray of 
hope offered to us in this lesson: With the Lord’s help, we need not suffer too 
long in the disgrace and embarrassment of spiritual nakedness.

Chapter Three

AMOS 3:1-2

“Hear this word that the Lord has spoken against you, O children of Israel, against the 
whole family which I brought up from the land of Egypt, saying:

You only have I known of all the families of the earth;
Therefore I will punish you for all of your iniquities.”

Passages From the Writings

P&P



“That the church was established only with the Israelitish nation, wherefore 
evils and falsities will be examined there, vers. 1, 2....”

Scripture Confirmations

 Verse 2 is quoted verbatim in a Posthumous Theological Work called 

Scripture Confirmations, but no explanation is given.

Derived Doctrine

Our work on these verses will require more application than we have done so far. 
There is one reference in the whole of the Writings, and it gives a summary of the 
two verses with little regarding specific representations. But this is a wonderful 
experience, so let’s enjoy it.

“Hear this Word that the Lord has Spoken…”





In AC 3869[2-8], we are given a series of meanings for hearing. It signifies 
obedience, the understanding, to know the things contained in the Word, and 
to have faith in the will.
“By hearing is signified both to perceive and to obey; because one attends 
that he may perceive and obey; that both these are signified by hearing is 
evident from common discourse, in which one speaks of hearing and of 
hearkening to anyone; the latter signifying to obey, and the former to 
perceive.” (AR 87)

The Lord Speaking to Anyone



“The Lord speaks with every man, for whatever a man wills and thinks that is 
good and true, is from the Lord...With those who suffer themselves to be led 

58

away by evil spirits, the Lord speaks as if absent, or from afar, so that it can 
scarcely be said that He is speaking; but with those who are being led by the 
Lord, He speaks as more nearly present....”  (AC 904)

The Lord Speaking Against Anyone

 When the Lord speaks the truth and we find it threatening, or when the Lord 
speaks a “hard truth,” there is an appearance that the Lord is against us. But 
this is only an appearance. The Lord’s love for mankind is consistently soft, 
caring, concerned, and zealous to protect. Truth seems harsh and unbending, 
as it should be, when our actions are being turned to disorders and our 
minds are not open to receive spiritual sustenance from heaven. The first act 
of charity is to shun evils as sins, and if we are not doing that work of charity, 
the Lord must speak against us.

“O children of Israel, against the whole family”



 We need to consider the order of the wording in this portion of our text. 
Children represent innocence. They represent the birth of truths of the 
church. Children, when rebellious, represent a form of corruption in the 
understanding of the church. Might one or more of these representations 
have some application?
Israel represents the spiritual good. Could the call of the Lord to the children 
of Israel represent the Lord appealing to the remains of the spiritual good in 
Israel? If any productive hearing or obedience is to occur, the listener’s 
remains must be revitalized.
“...families, when said of the sons of Israel, by whom is represented the 
spiritual church, as being the goods of truth...families denote the things which
descend from good through truth, and are the goods of truth.” (AC 7916)
 The whole family: The Concordance suggests looking up the word “integrity” 
for “whole.” “For the sake of making anyone blessed and happy, the Lord wills
a total submission; that is, that he should not be partly his own, and partly 
the Lord’s....the whole heart, the whole soul, the whole mind, and all the 
forces, being recipients, must be the Lord’s, consequently there must be a 
total submission.” (AC 6138[2-3])



Being Brought up out of the Land of Egypt



“The reason why Egypt signifies not only intelligence but also insanity in 
spiritual things, is because the Ancient Church, which extended through 
many kingdoms...was also in Egypt, at which time the Egyptians excelled all 
others in cultivating the science of correspondences between spiritual things 
and natural, as appears from their hieroglyphics. But when that science was 
turned by them into magic, and became idolatrous, then their intelligence in 
things spiritual became insanity....” (AR 503)

59

 The Lord reminded Israel that He had called them out of that Egyptian 

spiritual insanity.

“You only have I known of all the families of the earth”





“...knowing, when said of the Lord...is because the Lord knows each and all 
things from eternity....” (AC 6853)
In Exodus 5:2, it is said, “I know not Jehovah...” Such a statement signifies 
“...not to care [about the Lord], for he who does not care, says that he does not
know.” (AC 7097) This is not the case with the Lord. He knows Israel 
completely.

 The Lord’s statement that He knows only Israel is a statement of divine 
foresight and of divine caring for all people that goes beyond human 
comprehension. However, this is not what the Jewish nation understood from
these words. They believed that prophecies, such as this, meant they were a 
favored nation or chosen people. The Writings tell us anyone who believes 
this errs. “...the Israelitish and Jewish nation were not chosen, and still less 
that it will be chosen; and also that there was not anything of the church with 
it, nor could be, but only the representative of a church; and that the reason 
why it has been preserved even to this day, has been for the sake of the Word 
of the Old Testament (n. 3479).” (AC 7051[4])
So the Lord’s knowing them was really His forming and choosing of them as a
representative church, and any punishment for their iniquities was so that 
they could “...be in a holy external...and could have holy rituals by which the 
heavenly things of the Lord’s kingdom...[could be] represented....” (AC 
3479[2])



 Eventually, the evils of Israel would be overshadowed with the prophecy of 

the Messiah. As a nation, Israel was plundered, and her able-bodied were sent
to captivity. The Old Testament prophecies needed to be preserved because 
they offered hope and consolation to the world.  Regardless of what 
happened to Israel, the story of the Lord’s coming and His redemption was to 
be kept alive within the representative rituals and teachings of Israel. The 
Lord knew what He wanted preserved in the church. He knew His church, 
and it was to be the means by which the story of Hell’s defeat would be 
preserved and fulfilled with His coming.

Putting It All Together

1. The church was established only with the Israelitish nation.
Wherefore evils and falsities will have to be examined there.
Israel and its scribes, as troublesome as they were, meticulously copied every
jot and tittle of the Word. They preserved the Word with a loyalty that is 
impressive. By the means of their labor, the books of the Word, with 
amazingly few errors, were passed on through the generations to us. The 
Lord’s watchful, knowing, and corrective Providence kept the Word so that 

60

the New Testament and the Writings might rest upon a firm foundation of the
Old Testament. For this to be so, the Lord knew only Israel and their evils and
falsities had to be examined there.
As we think about this, it is even more amazing to think about the 
“wholeness” of the Word. Here is a book written for those in the past, and yet 
it had to be written so as to help those of us in the present. But that is not all. 
The Word had to feed not only the past and the present, but it had to be the 
source of inspiration for the angels to study to eternity and be so profound 
that the angels will never exhaust the myriad of truths in a single word or 
placement of a comma. Every detail contains meaning: The curvatures in the 
letters, the Hebrew letters with little horns turning upwards, the vowel 
sounds adding a roughness or aspiration to the meaning of the Word. So 
much more could be said about what the angels find in the Word. No human 
could ever accomplish this astounding feat of writing. Such an awesome 
preparation of the Word so that our discovery of truth will always be new and
exciting reminds us of a passage in Genesis:
“And Jacob awaked out of his sleep, and he said, Surely the Lord is in this 
place; and I knew it not.” (Gen. 28:16)

2. Some of this amazement carries over into the way the Lord called 

Swedenborg to be His servant to bring the Writings into the world so as to 
fulfill the promise of the Second Coming. The Lord is ever watchful of His 
New Church. We are to be guardians of these Divine works. How are we 
doing? Do we think of ourselves as the chosen ones? Are we willing to be 
encouraged or chastised by the Lord? Do we come with a wholeness of 
family? The whole heart, the whole soul, the whole mind, and all the forces? 
Total submission to the Lord’s church?
In part, the above reflects creative derived doctrine at work. What appeared 
void of direct teachings opened avenues of thought and application. What do 
you think of the use of derived doctrine? How does it contribute to our study?

Questions to Stimulate Reflection

1. Please write out any questions that have occurred to you during this section 

and share them with the group during the discussion time.

2. Here is a question I hesitate to offer because it requires knowing the 

differences in the branches of the New Church organizations, and I don’t want
to send you off with a research project to answer this question.  What are the 
varying views of the Writings in each branch of the New Church? Remember 
the four are:

a. General Convention.

61

b. Conference.
c. General Church.
d. The Lord’s New Church.

Each branch has a different viewpoint of the Writings. I have often wondered 
how Divine Providence is working with these divergent points of view.
3. How does the role of the New Church compare with that of the Israelitish 
church?  What can we learn from their successes and failures?  Are there 
temptations and strengths inherent in this role that are visible in both the 
Israelitish church and the New Church?

4. How much did Israel understand their spiritual role as a church?  How much 

do we know? How do we learn more?

5. How do the differences between a spiritual church and a human organization 

play a part in understanding the spiritual role of a church?

Amos 3:3-6

“Can two walk together, unless they are agreed?
Will a lion roar in the forest, when he has no prey?
Will a young lion cry out of his den, if he has caught nothing? 
Will a bird fall into a snare on the earth, where there is no trap for it?
Will a snare spring up from the earth, if it has caught nothing at all?
If a trumpet is blown in a city, will not the people be afraid?
If there is calamity in a city, will not the Lord have done it?”

Passages From the Writings

P&P



“...that a church and no church cannot exist together, neither truths and 
falsities together without [the latter] being seized [by the former], vers. 3-6...”

AC 9348[5] and earlier sections



“That such things do not come to pass when a man does not love himself and 
the world above all things, is described in Amos...iii. 4,5.

 What things do not come to pass? Earlier in this number, we are told about 

the signification of a snare: “...a snare when said of evils, as being allurement 
and deception. That evils allure and deceive, is because all evils spring from 
the loves of self and of the world...and the loves of self and the world are born
with a man, and he feels the delight of his life from the moment of his 
birth...these loves, like the unseen currents of a river, continually draw the 
thought and the will of man away from the Lord to self, and away from 
heaven....” 
In this context, the things that do not come to pass are the negative aspects of
the correspondences. When we read lion, roaring, prey, den, etc., we are not 



62

to focus on allurement and deceptions nor the love of self and the world. 
Instead, we are to focus on the positive correspondences.

AC 592



“...it is predicated of Jehovah or the Lord that He punishes, that He tempts, 
that He does evil, that He destroys or kills, and that He curses. As for 
example...In Amos: - Shall evil befall a city, and Jehovah hath not done it? (iii. 
6).” And further in this number we read: “...it is man who brings evil upon 
himself, and ruins and destroys himself—although it is not man, but evil 
spirits who excite and lead him...”

De Verbo, Section XII, number 284



“...the Divine operation does not fall into a man who is empty and void, as for 
example one who does not know that the Lord is pure love and pure mercy, 
good itself, and truth itself, and that love itself and good itself are such in 
their essence that they cannot do evil to anyone, neither be angry nor 
revengeful....that there is no evil in the city which Jehovah hath not done, as in
Amos (iii. 6)...”

Derived Doctrine

Please note that the Lord asks seven questions in these verses.

Question One: “Can two walk together, unless they are agreed?”

Two



“That two signifies conjunction is because all things in general and in 
particular in the spiritual world, and consequently in the natural world, have 
reference to two things, namely, good and truth-to good as what acts and 
flows in and to truth as what suffers (submits) and receives...nothing is 
produced unless the two make a one by a certain image of marriage...” (AC 
5194)

To Walk

In many passages of the Writings, to walk represents to live. Check the following for 
examples: AC 1794, 6276, 8420, 9212[8], and 10087[3].

 The answer to this question seems evident when we consider that a will and 
understanding working together produce results, or walk toward an agreed 
upon goal. Good acts and truth receives. Are they agreed? There is no 
indication that they are pulling against one another; therefore, they must be 
in some degree of agreement.

63

Question Two: “Will a lion roar in the forest, when he has no prey?”

Lion



“That a lion denotes the good of celestial love and the derivative truth, in its 
power, and also that in the opposite sense it denotes the evil of the love of self
in its power, is evident from passages in the Word where a lion is mentioned.”
(AC 6367)

Roaring



“...the signification of ‘as a lion roareth’ as being on account of the desolation 
of Divine truth in the church; for a lion signifies Divine truth in its power...and
to roar signifies the result of distress because of the desolation of truth....but 
in the contrary sense to roar or the roaring of a lion signifies an ardent desire 
to destroy and devastate the church, which is done by destroying Divine truth
by means of the falsities of evil...because when a lion is hungry and seeks its 
prey, and also when it is enraged with anger against its enemy, it is its habit to
roar.” (AE 601[1-4])

Forest



Prey

“...to cut down wood in a forest denotes to act from a false religiosity 
(extremism), and to destroy such things as are of the church; for the church is
called a forest, a garden, and a paradise - a forest from knowledges, a garden 
from intelligence and a paradise from wisdom...and as a forest denotes the 
church as to knowledges, thus as to external things, it also denotes a 
religiosity.” (AC 9011[5])

 This is one of those words we need to consider carefully. The Concordance 
alternates between prey, spoil, booty, rapine and despoil. Let a couple of 
examples show the problem. Potts translates AC 576[3] in the following way: 
“Prey in mine house (Mal. iii.10) =  remains in the internal man, which are 
compared to prey because they are as it were furtively insinuated among so 
many evils and falsities.”

 That same number in the standard edition, also translated by Potts, has 

“booty” in place of the word prey (along with some other word changes such 
as “stealthily” in place of “furtively”).
In AC 6442, we have a usage of spoil, rapine, and prey: “...spoil denotes those 
who have been rescued and delivered...rapine, spoil, and prey, denote the 
rescuing and deliverance of the good by the Lord.”
In AC 6443, “...from the signification of dividing the prey, as being to give a 
possession in the heavenly kingdom; for by prey are signified those who have 





64

been rescued and delivered by the Lord; hence by dividing the prey is 
signified distribution, namely, among those in heaven....”

 AC 6368 has a powerful message about the Lord’s deliverance: “...man of 

himself is in hell, for his will and thought from his own is nothing but evil and
its falsity, by which he has been so bound to hell that he cannot be torn away 
without violence. This tearing away and deliverance is what is called the 
prey; and because this is done from the Lord’s Divine good, it is said that 
from the Lord through what is celestial is the deliverance of many from hell.”

Do we have a possible answer to question two? The Lord’s roaring is to indicate how
zealously He wants to pull His people from the extreme destruction of the 
knowledges of the church (religiosity). He, as a lion, wants to awaken within His 
people the remains hidden in the internal man. This portion of the prophecy is not 
about doom but hopefulness. The lion in the forest will roar to announce that rescue 
and deliverance are available for the faithful. His celestial has the power to deliver 
many from hell.

Question Three: “Will a young lion cry out of his den, if he has caught nothing?”

A Young Lion



“...the signification of a lion and an old lion, as being the good of love and the 
derivative truth in their power.... A young lion denotes one who is in power 
through truth from good, and an old lion one who is in power through good.” 
(AC 6369)

Cry Out of the Lion’s Den



“...that a cry in the Word, is said in reference to every affection that breaks 
forth from the heart, wherefore it is a voice of lamentation, of imploring, of 
supplication from grief, of entreaty, of indignation, of confession, yea of 
exultation.” AR 885.

We now have somewhat of a paradox to clear up. We do not have a direct 
representation of the word “den.” We have “den of thieves or robbers.”  We have 
representations of caves, but almost nothing for a lion’s den. The only reference 
given is the one where they put Daniel in the lion’s den. In P&P (explaining Daniel 
6:10-17, regarding those who proposed worship of themselves instead of the Lord), 
we read that “...when this decree was opposed by those who belong to the Lord’s 
church, it was enacted that they should undergo the punishment [pronounced] by 
the inquisition, which is the lion’s den, into which Daniel was cast.”

In the references to “cave” and “lair,” we are taught that they signify the evil of self-
love robbing the individual or church of its power and truth. But with several of the 
references above (AC 6368 and AC 6369), we have the correspondence of old 
(mature) lion and young lion in a most positive usage.  This third question is 
probably a continuation of Question Two. The old (mature) lion is to teach us about 

65

the Lord’s power through love, and the young lion is to teach us about His power 
through truth from good.  Therefore we can’t use den, cave, and lair in the opposite 
sense of self-love robbing the individual and church.  The Lord robs no one. His goal 
is to set us free.

We can, however, see the Lord’s Divine Good and Truth “catching” us and delivering 
us from the grip of hell. His power of truth from good can snatch us or tear us away 
from the grip hell imagines it has over us.  Therefore, the young lion crying out of his
den sounds, to me, like a celebration and announcement to all that His efforts were 
not in vain, and He is not without His catch. A cry of exultation!

Question Four: “Will a bird fall into a snare on the earth, where there is no trap for 
it?”

The literal sense seems to ask us to answer a “dumb” question. If there is no trap on 
the earth, the bird can’t fall into the snare. Is that really what this question is trying 
to illustrate? Let’s look at the correspondences.

Bird

 A bird in general signifies rational things and also the intellectual things of 

the inward man. See AC 40.

Snare

 A snare signifies mental delusions. “...to be deluded and misled by one’s own 
evil and falsity....” (AC 10641) Being caught in a snare represents “...to be 
caught by their own evil, and thus brought into the evil of the penalty.” (AC 
7653)  It also “...denotes allurement and deception through the delights of the
loves of self and of the world...and this through reasonings from the fallacies 
of the senses which favor these delights....” (AC 9348)

A Snare on Earth

 AC 1066 has some very helpful teachings that seem to offer insights into the 
question under consideration.  In the Word, “earth” and “land” have several 
meanings. “In the universal sense it denotes the place or region where the 
church is, or where it has been...it (also) signifies what is not the church, for 
every such word has contrary or opposite meanings.... But when the church is
referred to the term earth is used to predicate “...all the doctrines both true 
and false that were of the churches.” (AC 1066)

The answer then to the Lord’s question is:

If a person’s mind pays attention to the rational things of the church…



If a person’s mind feeds the inward things...

66






If a person’s mind does not delude itself and is not misled by its own evil and 
falsity...
If a person’s mind is not allured through the delights of self and the world...
If a person’s mind is not fooled with the fallacies of the senses...

...then the bird will not fall into the snare on the earth. The church will exist and will 
seize or expel the “no church” condition of the mind.

Question Five: “Will a snare spring up from the earth, if it has caught nothing at all?”

This is a continuation of the question started above. The mind that is given to the 
Lord doesn’t let allow itself to be snared by negative doubts.  Hell would love to 
prove its point that all the things of the church are useless and ineffective. Hell often 
seeks to win its battle against the Lord with labels. The church is “narrow-minded.” 
The church is “behind the times” and doesn’t offer help with current issues. If one 
opposes the disorder of homosexuality, the opposer is labeled “homophobic.” If an 
issue is addressed from scripture, it is pointed out that other prohibitions 
mentioned in scripture are not adhered to. “Be consistent, and don’t choose what 
you want to expose as disorders. Don’t preach to me!” 

The snare of earth would love to spring up and expose the mind of the church. The 
“no church” mind hates the very existence of the Lord’s Church.

What I hear in this question is a profound statement from the Lord: The “no 
churches” think they are clever and able reasoners. Their traps, their trick questions,
their lies, their plot to destroy all evidence of the Lord’s truth are like an empty 
snare on earth with nothing in it.

Question Six: “If a trumpet is blown in a city, will not the people be afraid?”

Blowing or Sounding a Trumpet





In AR 391 and 397, we are told that this represents to “...call together upon 
solemn occasions...to explore and discover the quality of those who are in 
faith alone...”
In AE 502[1] and [2], we read that it “signifies the flowing down of Divine 
truth out of heaven. When this flowing down is strong, it produces one effect 
with the good and another with the evil. With the good it illustrates the 
understanding, joins them more closely with heaven, and thence gladdens 
and vivifies their minds; but with the evil it disturbs the understanding, 
separates them from heaven, joins them more closely with hell, induces 
terror in their minds, and finally brings spiritual death.”

City

 The word “city” has a wonderful range of meanings. A city represents the 

doctrine of the church and religion. (AR 402) Or, it can represent everything 

67

doctrinal or heretical in a person. (AC 402)  AE 223[20] says that “city” can 
signify the false doctrine of those who reject the Lord.

Our question seems to be addressed to all of us but most directly to those who reject
the Lord. They will be called together on a solemn occasion. They will be examined. 
Those who have loved the Lord will find it a joyful occasion. Those who have 
rejected the Lord will find it a time of terror and a sense of “spiritual death.”

Question Seven: “If there is calamity in a city, will not the Lord have done it?”

Tranquility, Serenity, Moderation



 We are well acquainted with the teachings that say the Lord does no harm to 
anyone. It is an appearance that He is vengeful and hard on us. There is a 
beautiful teaching in AE 419 that explains what the Lord seeks for His 
children. The Word talks about tranquility and serenity:
“...the separations of the good from the evil and the casting out of the evil in 
the spiritual world are effected by various degrees of moderation and 
intensity of the Divine proceeding from the Lord as a sun. When this flows in 
moderately the good are separated from the evil...when the Divine from the 
Lord flows in moderately there is everywhere tranquility and serenity....”
I also like the teaching in this number that the Lord does this moderately. But 
those who rejected the Lord see Him as the one who brings calamity.



Perspectives



In TCR 69, we are given a powerful example of what the good and evil will 
see. “The man who lifts his mind to God and acknowledges that all the truth 
of wisdom is from God...is like one who stands upon a lofty tower and sees 
beneath him a populous city and all that is being done in its streets. But the 
man who confirms in himself the belief that all truth of wisdom is from the 
natural light in himself, is like one who remains in a cavern beneath that 
tower and looks through holes at the same city, seeing nothing but the wall of 
a single house in that city, and how its bricks are joined.”

Putting It All Together

1. We must begin with the quote from P&P: “...that a church and no church 

cannot exist together, neither truths and falsities together without [the latter]
being seized [by the former].”

2. The seven questions illustrate this point. The mind that is based on the Lord 

and His Word will not be empty and void.

3. The Lord will protect; He will seize the believers from the grip of hell. His 

roar of victory will resound throughout the heavens. Rescue and deliverance 
will thrill all in the heavens so that they in turn may inspire all on earth.

68

4. The worldly, the despisers of the Lord and His Word, will not snare the minds 
of those who believe in the Lord. Those who seek to snare the doctrines of 
the church are the ones who will be deluded and misled.
The “no church” and the “falsity” will be seized by the Lord. Why? Because 
falsity cannot stand in the presence of the Lord’s truth. Unreality cannot exist 
in the presence of the Lord’s Reality.

5. Picture Amos speaking this message today. In all probability, he would still be

told to get out of town and go back to his sheep.

QUESTIONS TO STIMULATE REFLECTION

1. Did you see a progression in the seven questions and their meanings?
2. What is the significance of the statement of the Lord’s victory over the “no 
church” state? How does its significance to personal states compare to its 
significance for religious organizations?

3. Do we take the outcome of the Lord’s work for granted? How does the New 
Church differ from traditional Christianity in its expectations of the Lord’s 
work? What is the difference between trustful confidence and self-assured 
disinterest?

4. How about the Lord’s promise of tranquility and serenity, stemming from the 
moderate influx of the Divine? What do we think of the word “moderate”? 
Does it have a positive and negative sense? Which sense seems to be used in 
this passage?

5. What about the two views of the city? How does a “peephole” view of the city 

limit the viewer? What might the bricks of the wall represent in this 
metaphor? How do we get a view from the tower and see generals leading to 
particulars?

AMOS 3:7-8

“Surely the Lord God does nothing,
Unless He reveals His secret to His servants the prophets.
A lion has roared!
Who will not fear?
The Lord God has spoken!
Who can but prophesy?”

69

PASSAGES FROM THE WRITINGS

P&P



“...that the Lord will most surely reveal this, vers. 7, 8...”

AR 3



“By servants, in the spiritual sense are meant those who are in truths; and 
because truths are from good, by servants are meant those who are in truths 
from good, thus also, those who are in wisdom from love.... Now as truths are 
serviceable to good by teaching it...by servant, in the Word, is meant what is 
serviceable, or he or that which serves; in this sense not only the prophets 
are called the servants of God, but also the Lord as to His Human....” Amos 3:7 
is cited as an example. 

AE 409[6]



“Since the Lord in respect to Divine truth is called in the Word ‘a servant’ 
from serving, so those who are in Divine truth from the Lord and thereby 
serve others are there called ‘servants,’ as the prophets are....” Amos 3:7 is 
cited. 

AE 601[8]



“‘The Lord Jehovah will not do a word unless He hath revealed His secret to 
His servants the prophets’ signifies that the Lord opens the interior things of 
the Word and of doctrine to those who are in truths from good; ‘to reveal a 
secret’ signifies to enlighten and to open the interior things of the Word; ‘His 
servants the prophets’ signify those who are in truths of doctrine and who 
receive; ‘ the lion hath roared, who will not fear?’ signifies a powerful 
revelation and manifestation of Divine truth; ‘the Lord Jehovah hath spoken, 
who will not prophesy?’ signifies reception and manifestation. The Lord is 
called ‘Lord Jehovah’ when good is treated of.” Amos 3:7, 8 are cited.

“...Jehovah is compared to a ‘roaring lion,’ because a ‘lion’ signifies power to 
lead forth from hell or from evils, and to ‘roar’ signifies defense against evils 
and falsities....” Amos 3:8 is cited. 

DERIVED DOCTRINE

This section of the Word is clearly explained in the Writings, and there is no need to 
look for correspondences beyond what we are given. Let’s go directly to our 
summary section.

PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER

1. The Lord laments when anyone purposely chooses to flee from His 

protection. The Lord laments when the hells attack a church. In other words, 
the Lord is not a passive observer of His children or His church.

2. He has given us the Word. He came so that He might fight and conquer the 
hells. All of this was not done without the Lord revealing it to His servants 
and prophets. His truth is serviceable and practical. These revelations and 
manifestations of Divine truth are “powerful” as told to us in AE 601[8].
The lion roaring is a spiritual roaring that puts fear into the heart of the hells. 
They surely know in their lucid moments that they cannot stand in the 
presence of the Lord. But sadly, their insanity causes them to imagine they 
can defeat the Lord.
We, as readers of this prophecy, must take heart that we are cared for and 
loved by the Lord. He laments for each of us if anything of hell assaults us, 
and His truths, as servants, work to give us the wisdom of good to overcome 
and withstand the poison of falsity.

3. These two verses are a continuation of the previous seven questions. They 

highlight the good news of the Lord’s victory and help us to understand what 
is said in the P&P summary: “...the Lord will most surely reveal this....”

QUESTIONS TO STIMULATE REFLECTION

1. Have you noticed how often the prophecy of Amos portrays the Lord as a 

roaring Lion? Isn’t this a powerful image to add to our picture of the Lord?  
What other images of the Lord do we find in His Word?

2. The prophecy of Amos is more a statement of affirmativeness and that one of 
doom and gloom. In the spiritual sense, it is an announcement of the coming 
of the New Jerusalem. What parts of the prophecy so far seem to announce 
the coming of the New Jerusalem?

3. What explanation or understanding comes to you when the Writings say the 
Lord roars when He sees His church being taken away from Him by the 
devils? Can Hell really take the Lord’s church away from Him?

4. How much are we aware of all that the Lord does for us?  How often does He 
act on our behalf?  Does He let us help Him?  If so, how? How much is done 
for us, and how much do we do as if from ourselves?

5. How many secrets do you think the Lord has given us? I’m not thinking of a 
specific number as much as a sense of appreciation for all that we have been 
given. Do we value them enough? What do we do to cherish this gift each day?

AMOS 3:9-10

“Proclaim in the palaces at Ashdod,
And in the palaces in the land of Egypt, and say:
‘Assemble on the mountains of Samaria;|
See great tumults in her midst, 
And the oppressed within her.
For they do not know to do right,’
Says the Lord,
‘Who store up violence and robbery in their palaces.’”

PASSAGES FROM THE WRITINGS

P&P



“...for thence it appears in what manner the church is being laid waste, vers. 9,
10...”

Note: This is the only direct reference we have to these two verses. Once again, our 
ability to understand these verses falls on our ability to use derived doctrine.

72

DERIVED DOCTRINE

Palaces

 Remember that “palaces,” in the positive sense, signify the understanding in 
which the truths of doctrine from good are arranged in beautiful forms. (AC 
4926)
So what follows is a call to learn by reflecting on specific contrasts. What does
one see in the spiritual palaces of Ashdod and Egypt? Is this what Israel was 
to reflect on so that they might learn or see the contrasts necessary to 
repent?



Palaces of Ashdod

 Ashdod was the city and site of the Philistine god, Dagon. What most 

important message should be proclaimed in the palaces of Ashdod? AE 
817[10] indicates that Dagon represents an understanding that is destitute of
the good of love. This is not what the Lord wants His spiritual palaces to 
reflect!

Palaces of Egypt

 And what was to be said in the palaces in the land of Egypt? Egypt 



represented the perversion and profaning of divine truths. (AC 4735[15]) 
Land, on the other hand, signifies “...the church...also what is not the church....”
(AC 1066)
It seems to make sense that the Lord wanted them to look at the perverted 
palaces of Egypt so they would see these were not the things of His 
representative church. He was challenging them to clean up the spiritual 
palace of the mind and to restore it to the beauty and order befitting the Lord 
God of Israel.

The Call to Assemble on the Mountains of Samaria

 The word assemble is used to represent arranging things in order. Take for 

instance this quote: “Assemble yourselves. That this signifies that they should
set themselves in order...for in the spiritual sense ‘to be assembled’ has no 
other meaning, because truths and goods cannot be assembled unless they 
are also set in order.” (AC 6338)

 Let’s look at some representations of Samaria:

o signifies the spiritual church or the same perverted. (AC 1368[3])
o signifies the church which is in the affection of falsities or in affection 

of truth. (AC 2466[4])

o signifies those who are in external worship. (AC 10050[2])

73





In all likelihood, the last quote comes closest to what is represented here. The
AC 10050 reference is cited for our Amos 3:12 verse.
So, the Lord was calling for the reordering of external worship so that goods 
and truths might lead them to repentance.

Great Tumults in her Midst

 When external order is called for, internal disorder aligns itself to resist. It 
will not give up easily. It will cause great tumult and anxiety in the midst of 
the assembling order. Disorder will fight to maintain its existence and control.
The Lord is telling the Israelites they have work and warfare to wage.

Ignorance of the Difference between Right and Wrong

 This makes sense. If the Israelites have impaired their external order, if that 
disorder entered worship, if truth did not matter, and if their prophets were 
told not to give prophecies, it seems logical to assume that they would lose 
the ability to discriminate between the things of the world and heaven.

Storing Violence and Robbery in Their Palaces

 When the ability to discriminate between right and wrong is lost, there will 
be serious damage or violence to truth and justice. People will warp moral 
virtues to fit the justifications needed to perpetrate thefts and lies. In the case
of the Israelites in Amos, the worst aspect of this robbery and violence was 
that they made it appear legal and sanctioned by the church and the Word. 
Their palaces were shabby, artificial, and dysfunctional.

PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER

1. The sacrament of Holy Supper offers a time for reflection. It is a time to look 
specifically at our lives and find an area of disorder that is blocks the light of 
heaven. When that specific disorder is seen, we need to make ourselves guilty
of it. We are to confess that sin, as something for which we alone are 
responsible. Then we are to supplicate the Lord for His help in removing that 
disorder. When we do this work of repentance, there is a last step in the 
pursuit of our goal: A new life. We must live the change to make 
improvement.
TCR 700[3] likens this most important sacrament to a river “containing 
scarcely visible grains of gold in great abundance; but when its holiness has 
been revealed, it is like the gold collected from the sand, melted into a mass, 
and wrought into beautiful forms.”
We are to be sifters. We are to separate out the falsity of sand so that we can 
find the gold. That collected gold then needs to be put into some form that 
will honor the Lord.

74

2. Consequently, we are to look at contrasts. We are to desire spiritual palaces 

that contain the gifts of a spiritual life, palaces that will show us the 
difference between right and wrong. We need to find the discriminating 
prudence that comes from the Word.

3. The church of Israel stands forth here as a symbol of waste and dishonor. 

Implied in this contrast are some questions: “What is the health and vitality 
of your church like? Is your palace a place where violence and robbery are 
stored? Or is it place where order is found and a tumult is going on in the 
midst, so that evil is banished from a sanctuary dedicated to the worship of 
the Lord God Jesus Christ?

QUESTIONS TO STIMULATE REFLECTION

1. How successful are you at preparing for Holy Supper? Are you able to reflect 
on some specific thing you need help in overcoming so that Holy Supper is 
entered into worthily?

2. Do you slip into the general or vague request: “You know me, Lord. Remove 
whatever is most necessary.”? It appears from the Word that we need to be 
specific, own up to our mistakes, and not blame others for our conduct. Why 
do you think it is important to follow these steps?  Why is it important to be 
specific?

3. How fair do we have to be to discriminate in matters of right and wrong? I’ve 
heard it said that the Lord wants us to make decisions.  If we see that we have
erred, He wants us to be willing to change. The mistake is to stubbornly hold 
to a wrong decision and refuse to change. What makes change hard in this 
context?

4. What is your view of this thing called self-esteem? Do we place this idea in its 

proper order of importance?  What are some ways to keep a healthy 
perspective on self-esteem?                                      

AMOS 3:11

“Therefore thus says the Lord God:
An adversary shall be around the land;
He shall sap your strength from you,
And your palaces shall be plundered.”

Passages From the Writings

P&P



“...wherefore the truths of the church perish by falsities, ver. 11...”

AC 2973[5&6]



“...when man does not suffer the Lord to dispose the things round about to 
correspondence, then he recedes from heaven in the measure in which he 
does not suffer it. That the soul of man is in the midst...and that the body is 
round about...is well known; for it is the body that encompasses and invests 
his soul or his spirit.... It is now plain what ‘round about’ means.” Amos 3:11 
is cited as one of the references. 

DERIVED DOCTRINE

An Adversary

 Like most correspondences, the word “adversary” has a good and bad sense. 
In the positive sense, the Lord is an adversary to hell and all of its workings. 
The Lord opposes its influence on our lives. The Lord also is our adversary 
when we insist on doing things that are harmful to our souls. That sense is 
involved in Matthew 5:25, where we read, “Agree with thine adversary 
quickly, whiles thou art in the way with him.”  In other words, when we are 
out of order, it is in our best spiritual interest to patch up our differences with
the Lord as quickly as possible because we are wrong. The Lord has the truth 
and the facts about our transgressions. If we were to be taken to a “judge,” the
facts, the evidence, would clearly show us as guilty, and our adversary not 
only completely fair, but accurate. Save yourself the grief of the “hearing” or 
ruling of the judge, and agree to a settlement with the Lord.

 An adversary also may signify every evil and falsity that seeks to thwart our 

work of repentance. Hell seeks to intimidate, threaten, embarrass, flatter, and 
mock us into quitting the work of repentance. It claims to have evidence to 
prove our unworthy state and tries to tell us to give up. The Lord appears to 
be the adversary but to the degree we “suffer” ourselves to allow the Lord to 
dispose things round about, we become the winners over the hells.               

Around the Land...

 This word “land” has appeared often in our study. It represents “the 

church...also what is not the church....” (AC 1066) The seeming flip-flop here 
is not an inconsistency of doctrine. It represents the choice we make. We will 
dispose things so that the Lord can enter the soul and fill us with the things of

76

the church, or we can dispose of the order of the Lord and become that which
is not the church.

The Adversary Will Sap Strength and Plunder the Palaces



If we turn our backs on the Lord, we lose vitality and we lose the spiritual 
palaces storing good and truth. If we join forces with the hells, they will 
surely plunder us. Hell has no love for individuals. Their hatred burns to 
destroy the souls of people. Either way, it is a lose-lose situation, whereas 
agreeing quickly with the Lord is a win-win choice.

PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER

1. The Lord alerts us to the fact that hell, our adversary, is all around the church.

Hell’s goal is simple. It wants to separate us from the Lord. How it 
accomplishes that goal is dependent on each person. Hell has a bag of 
thousands of dirty tricks. It will try them all. It wants to sap our strength. It 
wants to cause us to despair. It wants us to fight with one another.

2. To be alerted by the Lord to the plan of hell is a wise beginning. What we 

need to do is to “suffer” (allow) ourselves to be led by the Lord. The Lord has 
a plan that will conquer anything hell has to offer. Reading His Word, praying 
for His help, and seeking to be of use to Him and the neighbor are all ways to 
thwart the adversary.

READ AND REVIEW

Read Amos 3:11.
Read the summary from P&P.

QUESTIONS TO STIMULATE REFLECTION

1. Our unit of study covered one verse. That one verse had no direct teachings 

for us to consider. We sought the help of derived doctrine. Did that study help 
us see the meaning? Was anything left out that needs clarification?

2. Do we agree with the Lord because we are scared of hell, or do we agree with 
Him from a “holy fear?” I’m sure many of you know the difference. If not, 
check out DP 136-139.

3. How can we best “suffer” ourselves to let the Lord dispose the things of order 
“round about” us? The “suffer” means “allow.” What does it mean when we 
“allow” the Lord, who is Omniscient, Omnipresent, and Omnipotent, to do 
something for us?

AMOS 3:12

“Thus says the Lord:
As a shepherd takes from the mouth of a lion
Two legs or a piece of an ear, 
So shall the children of Israel be taken out
Who dwell in Samaria-
In the corner of a bed and on the edge of a couch!”

PASSAGES FROM THE WRITINGS

P&P



“...and the goods and truths of the Word will be taken away from them, ver. 
12...”

AC 3869[10&11]



“...‘to snatch the two legs’ denotes the will of good; and the ‘piece of an ear,’ 
the will of truth. That a ‘piece of an ear’ denotes this can as before said be 
seen solely from the correspondences in the other life, and the derivative 
significatives, according to which the internal sense of the Word, and also the 
rituals in the Israelitish and Jewish Church.... the obedience of faith is 
understood by ‘ears’ and obeying by ‘hearing’...”

AC 6188[2]



“That a ‘bed’ denotes what is natural, is because the natural is beneath the 
rational, and serves it as a bed; for the rational as it were lies down upon the 
natural; and because the natural is thus spread out underneath, it is called a 
‘bed’ as...in Amos iii.12....‘in the corner of a bed’ denotes in the lowest of the 
natural; and ‘on the end of a couch’ denotes in what is sensuous. For by the 
people Israel whose metropolis was Samaria, was represented the Lord’s 
spiritual kingdom.”

AC 10050[1&2]



“...the signification of ‘legs’...the exterior things that belong to the natural 
man.... The like is signified by ‘legs’ in Amos....by ‘the lion’ are here signified 
those who lay waste the church; by ‘legs,’ the external of the church, which 
also is of the natural man; by ‘a piece of an ear,’ its perception; by ‘them that 
dwell in Samaria,’ those who are in external worship; ‘the corner of a bed and 
the extremity of a couch’ denote the lowest natural, which is the external 
sensuous, and its truth and good.”

78

AR 137



“Doctrine is also signified by ‘bed’ in Amos.... ‘In the corner of a bed,’ and ‘in 
the extremity of a couch,’ means what is more remote from the truths and 
goods of doctrine. ‘Bed’ and ‘couch’ and ‘bed chamber’ have a similar 
signification....”

AE 163[3]



“‘Bed’ signifies the natural man, because the natural man underlies the 
spiritual, thus the spiritual lies on it and on the things that are in it as on its 
own bed.... In Amos...‘Lion’ signifies the church, here those therein that 
destroy goods and truths; ‘legs and a bit of an ear’ are the goods that are in 
the natural man, and something of perception of truth therefrom; ‘the sons of 
Israel that dwell in Samaria’ are those of the church; ‘on the corner of the bed,
and on the end of the couch,’ are those in a little natural light from the 
spiritual, and in some truths therefrom.”

DERIVED DOCTRINE

Shepherd



“...is one who exercises the good of charity.... He leads and teaches...those who 
are led and taught are called the ‘flock.’” (AC 343)

Mouth



“By ‘mouth’ is signified doctrine, preaching and discourse...reasonings from 
falsities of doctrine....” (AR 574) This reference from AR also presents the 
meaning of “his mouth being as the mouth of a lion.” A lion in the good sense 
is representative of the Divine truth of the Word.

PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER

1. The summary of this verse has many threads to follow. I will attempt to 

follow one. You may be drawn to one of the other choices.

2. The children of Israel had made their bed, and they were lying in it. They 

chose the lowest quality of spiritual life. Their doctrine, their preaching, and 
their discourses were superficial and not very nourishing for the soul. The 
“beds” upon which their rational would rest kept them in a sensual squalor 
that was not befitting a church that was to represent the Lord and His Word 
to the world.

3. They were satisfied with squeezing religion in the corner and on the edge of 
the bed. Compare this attitude with the Advent lessons, when there was “no 
room in the inn” for the Lord to be born. They were so busy with their own 

79

agendas that they ignored the Lord’s plans for the church and failed to see the
reality of their states.

4. Cramped and not restful, their souls had little (inferior) spiritual light. They 
hung on the edge of the bed (doctrine). The good of love and the good of 
wisdom, like two legs of a lamb, were in the mouth of the lion. The Lord as 
the Shepherd rescued what little good was left. He always preserves a 
remnant of a dying church so as to build a new one to serve as protector or 
repository for the living Word of the Lord.

5. The piece of the ear preserved is compellingly symbolic of the little obedience
of faith the Israelites had left in them. A tattered, chewed on remnant of 
obedience. People only hear as well as they listen. Israel had ears that were 
heavy, and they were not listening well.

QUESTIONS TO STIMULATE REFLECTION

1.

I wonder, as we go further into this study, how those who heard Amos 
understood this prophecy. The deeper levels of the correspondences have to 
be reviewed and remembered over and over. The Israelites were so wrapped 
up in their lies and superficiality that I don’t think they cared enough to pay 
attention. What do you think about this?

2. The image of the lion with the legs in its mouth and the piece of the ear being 
rescued is easy to keep in the mind’s eye. How can we best use this teaching 
for ourselves?

3. What about the bed as a resting place for the rational? Do we see this in a 

practical example? Is the crowded corner and sleeping on the edge of the bed 
something we can illustrate too? Do these things speak of our limited time of 
reading, reflecting on, and discussing doctrine each day? Our daily schedules 
seem to crowd out the spiritual and we know about this, but can we change 
our lifestyles?

4. We need to see these questions as a positive strengthening of spiritual 

priorities that are intended to improve the quality of our life, and not just 
negative weights laid on our busy, and somewhat confusing, time 
management decisions. What helps us see them as positive? Do we see 
positive outcomes when we address such questions?

AMOS 3:13-15

“Hear and testify against the house of Jacob, 
Says the Lord God of hosts,
That in the day I punish Israel for their transgressions,

80

I will also visit destruction on the altars of Bethel; 
And the horns of the altar shall be cut off
And fall to the ground.
I will destroy the winter house along with the summer house;
The houses of ivory shall perish,
And the great houses shall have an end,
Says the Lord.”

In the previous verse, we read “...the goods and the truths of the Word will be

with all things pertaining to the church, vers. 13-15.”

AC 921[4]



“...‘altars’ denote idolatrous worship. In Amos iii. 14...‘altars’ denote 
representative worship became idolatrous.”

AC 2832[10]



“In Amos...the ‘horns of the altar were to be cut off,’ was because truth from 
good was no longer represented there; ‘Bethel’ is the Divine Good, and is 
therefore called the ‘king’s sanctuary,’ and the ‘house of the kingdom’....”

AC 10182[8]



“In Amos...by ‘the altars of Bethel,’ and by its ‘horns,’ are signified evils and 
falsities destroying the good and truth of the church, of which it is said that 
they ‘shall be cut off.’”

Doctrine of the Lord 4

 The Doctrine of the Lord 4 has a reference to Amos 3:14. There are many 

passages cited whereby the word ‘that day,’ ‘in that day,’ and ‘in that time’...is 
meant the Lord’s advent.”

AR 270



“A horn...by it is everywhere (in the Word) signified power; therefore when a 
‘horn’ is predicated of the Lord, it signifies omnipotence....that ‘a horn’ 
signifies power...may appear from the following passages...” Amos 3:14 is 
cited.



In AR 392, Amos 3:14 is cited as one of representative examples of where 
there was worship “from evil and from the falsities of evil.”

AE 316[20]



“In Amos...‘The altars of Bethel’ signify worship from evil, and ‘the horns of 
the altar’ signify the falsities of that evil; and that these are to be destroyed is 
signified by ‘the horns shall be cut off and fall to the earth.’”

AE 391[29]



“In Amos...‘To visit the transgressions of Israel upon him’ signifies their last 
state, in the spiritual sense their state after death, when they are to be 
judged; it is said ‘to visit,’ instead of to judge, because visitation always 
proceeds judgment; ‘the altars of Bethel’ signify the worship from evil; ‘the 
horns of the altar’ signify worship from falsities, thus these signify all things 
of worship; and that these are to be destroyed is signified by ‘the horns shall 
be hewn down and fall to the earth.’ It is said, ‘I will visit upon the altars of 
Bethel,’ because Jeroboam separated the Israelites from the Jews, and erected
two altars, one in Bethel and the other in Dan...”

 This quote goes on for quite a bit more. One of the interesting points made in 
it is that these two altars represented a division and separation of worship 
from charity, and brought people to the state where “the mouth speaks apart 
from the understanding and the will, that is apart from the mind...they say 
men ought to believe even though they do not understand...(thus) they put 
aside deeds or goods of charity.”

AC 1453[2&4]

are called rational, ‘house of ivory’ here meaning those that have relation to 
truth, and ‘great house’ those that have relation to good.”



“By ‘horns’ is signified power...here the power of speaking, teaching, and 
writing, thus of reasoning and arguing.”

DERIVED DOCTRINE

This section of our study has a tremendous amount of information regarding Amos’ 
prophecy. There is so much that I will not seek to find any more because it might 
overwhelm us in the summation of these verses. I will proceed now to the summary 
section.

PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER

1. When things go wrong, we often look for the cause. In this series, it would 

appear that it is important for us to start with the possible cause of 
things...King Jeroboam.  AE 391[29] tells us that the Lord needed to visit 
(bring judgment) upon Israel because “Jeroboam separated the Israelites 
from the Jews, and erected two altars, one in Bethel and the other in Dan.” His
motives brought about serious effects:
Bethel had represented a house of God and a gate to heaven. Bethel took on 
an opposite representation.
Their mouths (worship) separated the understanding and will. Doctrine was 
presented with a requirement to believe, even though they had no 
understanding of what it all meant. Therefore, their hearts left the worship, 
and closeness to the Lord was absent.
The horns of the altar signified power: the power of speaking, teaching, and 
writing, and thus reasoning and arguing. When the will and understanding 
were separated, these sources of power gradually diminished, and like a 
flickering light, they were about to go out.
Worship had no checks and balances. The people, like blind men, followed the
teachings of their priesthood as long as it pleased them to do so. Therefore, 
falsity and idolatry entered the house of the Lord, profaning the very vessels 
of representation.
Every form of a spiritual house suffered. The winter house, the summer 
house, the ivory house and the great houses. The sensual, the rational and 
their relationship to the truth and good, were gone or destroyed.
No one cared. Their ruling love as represented by Jeroboam separated and 
perverted all of the arrangements and ordering of the tribes the Lord had 
seen to. The Lord’s ordering was so powerful Balaam could not pronounce a 
curse on Israel...only a blessing.

83

2. The Lord said that He would punish Israel for their transgressions. The 
punishment was not from anger but love. His love appears hard to the 
wicked, but it is full of mercy. The Lord had to cut off the “horns” of their 
altars. Their power of speaking lies, their power of teaching profanation and 
idolatry, their writing of foolishness, and their specious reasoning and 
arguments had to be cut off.  

3. The house of God—the gate of heaven—was not available to the people, and 
the Lord needed to restore communication with the church. There could be 
no compromises or easing back into things. Like a cancer, their self-serving 
lies had to be removed completely before the contamination tainted all vital 
forms of spiritual love.

QUESTIONS TO STIMULATE REFLECTION

1. Have you formed your summary of these verses? It is important that we do 

this so that our ability to connect the series increases as we move on.

2. There are many other historical reasons why the nations divided. Bringing 

that into this section may be useful. What points might be added to 
strengthen this study?

3. The different houses show a fascinating progression. I wanted to check the 
signification of each a little deeper. Winter. Summer. Ivory. Great houses. 
Anyone willing to go further? What does each one mean?  What might the 
progression mean?

4. What can we as New Church members take from this so we may protect 

ourselves from or avert the failings presented in this text?

AMOS 4:1-3

“Hear this word, you cows of Bashan, who are on the mountain of Samaria,
Who oppress the poor,
Who crush the needy,
Who say to your husbands, ‘Bring wine, let us drink!’
The Lord God has sworn by His holiness:
Behold, the days shall come upon you
When He will take you away with fishhooks,
And your posterity with fishhooks.
You will go out through broken walls, 
Each one straight ahead of her,
And you will be cast into Harmon,
Says the Lord.”

PASSAGES FROM THE WRITINGS

P&P



“Concerning those who pervert the doctrine of the church, that they will also 
fall into falsities in outermost things, vers. 1-3...”

AC 5198[3]



“...that by ‘kine’ are signified truths of the natural may be seen from the 
passages in which they are mentioned....” Amos 4:1 is cited.

AC 2842[6]



“In Amos...Jehovah swearing by His...‘great name’...by His ‘holiness’...signifies 
the confirmation there is in Jehovah or the Lord. A confirmation by Jehovah 
can be given only from Himself.” Amos 4:2 is cited.

AC 7192

 Note: When the Lord said, “I am Jehovah”...this signifies confirmation from the
Divine which is irrevocable...for nothing can be confirmed by Jehovah...except 
by Himself: it cannot be confirmed by heaven, because this is far beneath 
Him, still less by anything in the world; but in order that there may be Divine 
confirmation which is eternal and irrevocable, it must be by the Divine Itself.”

85

AR 439

Note: The New King James translation says, “He will take you away with fishhooks.” 
In the Writings, this verse is worded “...they shall take you away with stings.”



“By ‘stings’ are signified falsities from evil, doing hurt....” Amos 4:2 is cited.

AR 474

 This number contains an explanation of the Lord swearing by His holiness. 
“...the Divine truth testifies...from itself and by itself.” Amos 4:2 and 6:8 are 
cited.

AE 513[14]



“In Amos...‘they shall draw you out with hooks, and your posterity with fish-
hooks’...signifies leading away and alienating from truths by means of acute 
reasonings from falsities and fallacies; it is said of those who abound in 
knowledges because they have the Word and the prophets; such are here 
meant by ‘the kine of Bashan in the mountain of Samaria.’”

Note: In a prior number to the quote above, there is an interesting quote about the 
meaning of “hooks.” “...if the spiritual is not dominant...both thoughts and affections 
are wondering, and thus man is destitute of the intelligence that should lead and 
rule...then every falsity and every evil has power to draw them over to their side, and
thus wholly destroy them, is signified by ‘Let him draw out all with the 
hook’....”(Habakkuk 1:15). 

AE 560[4]



“...falsities are signified by ‘sharp instruments’ in Amos: Behold the days will 
come upon you in which they will draw you out with barbs, and your 
posterity with fishhooks (iv. 2). ‘To draw out with barbs’ signifies to lead 
away from truths by knowledges (scientifica) from the Word and from the 
world falsely applied; and ‘to draw out with fishhooks’ signifies to lead away 
from truths by the fallacies of the senses, from which the sensual man 
reasons.”

AE 608[2]



In Amos iv. 2, it is said that the Lord “hath sworn by His holiness.” AE 
608[2]explains that this signifies “...confirmation, asseveration and simple 
verity, or that it is true....”

86

AC 4926[6]



“In Amos: They shall draw out your posterity with fish-hooks. Ye shall go 
forth through the breaches, every one straight before her; and ye shall throw 
down the palace (iv. 2, 3); ‘to go forth through the breaches’ denotes falsities 
from reasonings; the ‘palace’ is the Word, consequently the truth of doctrine 
which is from good. And as by ‘breaches’ is signified the falsity which comes 
into existence by the separation of good and truth...” 

DERIVED DOCTRINE

Bashan



“...by ‘Bashan’ the external of the church, thus the natural, was signified, for 
Bashan was outside the land of Canaan where the church was.” (AE 163[8])

Oppressing the Poor and Crushing the Needy

 Oppressing the poor and crushing the needy is reasonably straightforward in 
its meaning. This represents a withholding or destruction of truths so that 
the spiritually poor, internally and externally, have no care or sustenance. 
Crushing is a restriction or holding down of the conatus or endeavor to grow 
spiritually.

Asking Husbands to Bring Wine and Let Us Drink



Since this verse is not explained, we must make an attempt to get some 
application. Were the wives (affections) seeking a rational wisdom from their 
husbands? When there is a request to drink wine, it signifies a wish to 
investigate what belongs to faith. (AC 1071) Is this what they were 
requesting? Was the reference to the wives, “cows of Bashan,” a derogatory 
term?

Going out Through Broken Walls, Each Straight Ahead of Her

 The breach in the wall represents “falsity from reasonings” and the 

“separation of good and truth.” (AC 4926)

 The word “straight” usually has a positive representation of leveling, 
smoothing out the rough places, preparation to receive the Lord (AE 
405[36]), turning the evil of ignorance into good (AC 3527[3]). There has to 
be a significance here that indicates Providence is going to bring good out of 
their disorder.

 Could the Lord be saying that all of their games of pretense and misuse of the 

Word will be plainly laid out before them? Their participation in the 
breaching of the Word made the Lord’s truth rough, uneven, and treacherous 

87

for anyone to use. The time was at hand for a change. The Lord in His 
Providence saw the spiritual need to bring the Word back to His level, even, 
and smooth state so that people could be brought out of the evil of ignorance 
to receive the Lord.

Being Cast into Harmon

 We have no reference in the Writings to a place called Harmon. The 

Interpreter’s Dictionary of the Bible has a short article on Harmon that has 
some interesting historical comments and conjecture that might shed some 
light on our study:
“The name Harmon appears (in Amos) and then nowhere else in the Bible, 
and no place by this name is known.” The article suggests various names or 
meanings for the word Harmon:



The Palace

o •
o Beyond the mountains of Armenia
o The mountains of Romman
o Behind the wall of Samaria
o Naked
o Devoted to destruction 

PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER

1. Our references from the Writings tell us that the “kine” represent those who 
abound in knowledges because they had the Word and the prophets. Instead 
of using that abundance wisely for the advancement of their spiritual uses, 
they turned the abundance to further their own interests.

2. They alienated themselves from truth with their “acute reasonings.” Their 

logic was “wondering.” They used truth as they saw fit. The consequences of 
this approach drew them over to the side of evil and destroyed truth. They 
got “hooked” on the painful barbs, or fish-hooks, of the sensual man’s short-
sighted reasoning.

3. Such a careless disregard for the Word leaves the spiritually poor oppressed, 

and it crushes a healthy sense of one’s needy state.
Doctrine intended to offer protection is like a formidable wall; when it is not 
maintained, it develops breaches in it. Pulled out by the ‘hooks” of wandering,
the residents of the city are carried off to that uncertain place of Harmon. 
They become estranged from their beloved place. They are taken outside 
Samaria’s walls. They are “spiritually naked” and seem “devoted to 
destruction.”

QUESTIONS TO STIMULATE REFLECTION

1. Do any of the prophecies in this section seem appropriate for things we are 
experiencing now? In our present day idiom, we describe being obsessed or 
addicted as being “hooked.” Our affections want something so badly we can 
hardly concentrate on other things. Our thoughts return again and again to 
the thing we want. If it is a selfish “hook,” will doctrine pull the hook out? Will
the walls of doctrine hold firm? Do breaches begin to show up? Can they be 
mended?

2. Have we ever gotten hooked on some “wandering” sensual reasoning that 

3.

carried us off to an unknown place? The unknown doesn’t give us a clue as to 
where we are, and we don’t know how to get back to the safe city and the 
protective walls of the church. What can you do when you are lost in this 
way?  How can you help someone else who is lost?
In the section titled “Passages From the Writings,” look at the quote from AC 
7192. How do you understand this teaching? “...confirmation from the Divine 
which is irrevocable...” And then it ends with this: “in order that there may be 
Divine confirmation which is eternal and irrevocable, it must be by the Divine
itself.” How might we apply this to life?

4. Can you think of situations in which “acute reasonings” have led you or 

someone you know astray?  Why are these reasoning so dangerous?  What 
makes us vulnerable to them?  How can we guard against them?  How might 
these reasonings be similar to the mental processes we call “mind games”?

AMOS 4:4-6

“Come to Bethel and transgress, 
At Gilgal multiply transgression;
Bring your sacrifices every morning,
Your tithes every three days.
Offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving with leaven,
Proclaim and announce the freewill offerings;
For this you love,
You children of Israel! 
Says the Lord God.
Also I gave you cleanness of teeth in all your cities.
And lack of bread in all your places;
Yet you have not returned to Me,
Says the Lord.”

PASSAGES FROM THE WRITINGS

P&P



“...that they arrange a worship in externals according to the statutes, which 
will be similar [to real worship], yet only in the outermost things, vers. 4-6... ”

AC 1453[3&4]



“...‘Bethel’ signifies knowledges....That the ark of Jehovah was in Bethel, and 
that the sons of Israel came thither and inquired of Jehovah...also that the 
king of Assyria sent one of the priests whom he brought from Samaria, and he
dwelt in Bethel, and taught them how they should fear Jehovah.... After 
Jeroboam had profaned Bethel...it had an opposite representation....” Amos 
3:14, 15; 4:5-7 are cited.

AC 2165 [5&6]



“...‘bread’ is the Lord, it belongs to the celestial things which are of love.... 
therefore they who are not in love and charity have not the Lord with them, 
and thus are not gifted with the good and happy things that in the internal 
sense are signified by ‘bread.’...In the Prophets also the celestial things of love 
are signified by ‘bread’....”  Amos 4:6 and 8:11 are cited as examples. 

AC 9052[3]



“In Amos ...‘emptiness of teeth’ denotes scarcity of truth; and ‘lack of bread,’ 
scarcity of good....‘the teeth’ in the opposite sense, signify the falsity, which 
destroys truth...”  Amos 4:6 is cited.

AE 556[12]



“In Amos...‘Emptiness of teeth in the cities’ stands for a scarcity of truth in 
doctrines in the life.”  Amos 4:6 is cited. 

AE 556[20]



“Because the teeth correspond to the ultimates of man’s intellectual life, 
which are called sensual, and these when separated from the truths of the 
interior understanding, which are called spiritual, are in the falsities of 
evil...so ‘teeth in the Word signify also ultimate truths....” Amos 4:6 is cited. 

90

DERIVED DOCTRINE

Transgress

 There are a myriad of ways transgressions are acted out against the Lord: 

Disobedience, being treacherous, being obstinate, breaking the 
Commandments, or implementing a form of cunning and deceit that mimics 
innocence and truth. Each of these actions is a choice of evil that is contrary 
to the Lord’s good and truth. “To see and understand that a thing is evil, and 
still do it, makes a person guilty.” (AC 9069)

Gilgal



“...signifies the doctrine of natural truth, which is serviceable for introduction 
into the church....” (AE 700[14])

At Gilgal Multiply Transgressions



In the positive sense, multiply “...signifies the fruitfulness of the rational man 
when it submits itself to the sovereign control of the interior man when 
adjoined to good...unless the rational submits itself...it either suffocates, or 
rejects, or perverts the things that flow in; and this is still more the case when
they flow into the sensuous knowledges of the memory.” (AC 1940[1&3])

Sacrifice Every Morning

 The Writings remind us that sacrifice means to offer up, or part with, 

something that blocks or hinders the soul. Sacrificing such obstacles aids our 
efforts to submit our interior person to the control of the Lord. The minute 
directions of what and how to sacrifice were not recorded so vicarious 
atonement might be achieved, but to represent the care needed when a 
“sacrifice” is offered to the Lord so that our thoughts and affections might be 
worthily set before Him each day. What are we to give up? We are to give up 
the proprium that would turn its back on the Lord and set itself up as the 
object of worship.
If our sacrifices are to be accepted by the Lord, there needs to be the 
‘morning’ state of illustration; a state of new clarity; a state of brightness and 
new beginnings.  These are the goals to be sought each day so we may move 
from ignorance to enlightenment. See AC 5097.



Tithes Every Three Days

 We are taught in various places that “tithes” represent remains and that 
“three” denotes what is holy. See AC 902 and also the following quote:  

91

“[Tithes are]...the goods and truths which are stored up by the Lord in man’s 
interiors, and which goods are called ‘remains’....” (AC 3740)

Offering a Sacrifice of Thanksgiving with Leaven



In AC 9287, we read about keeping a feast of thanksgiving and unleavened 
things. The latter represents “purification from falsities” and that this was a 
state of worship from a glad mind on account of “liberation from damnation.”

 Leavening things, on the other hand, represent evil and falsity rendering 

spiritual things impure and profane. See AC 2342. Leavening causes things to 
ferment or to bring one to the state of combat.

Announcing Freewill Offerings

 What kind of offerings? Meat? First Fruits? Heave offerings? Gifts? This 

prophecy doesn’t specify. The emphasis seems to fall on the word freewill. 
Offering represents some form of worship. What seems to be at issue here is 
the spirit of the giving or worshiping. Is it being offered as an obligation, or is 
it a willing or spontaneous act of worship? There is a passage in TCR 430 
where payment of tribute and taxes seem to capture the spirit of the 
difference between freewill and duty bound offerings:

o “Those who are spiritual pay these with one disposition of heart, and 
those who are merely natural with another. The spiritual pay them 
from good will, because they are collected for the preservation of their
country, and for its protection and the protection of the church, also 
for the administration of government officials....Those, therefore, to 
whom their country and also the church are the neighbor, pay their 
taxes willingly and cheerfully....But those to whom their country and 
the church are not the neighbor pay them unwillingly and with 
resistance; and at every opportunity defraud and withhold; for to such
their own household and their own flesh are the neighbor.”

 Freewill offerings would spring from the heart as a form of love and 

appreciation for all of the Lord’s benefits. The duty-bound would go through 
the motions to appear appreciative, but within their hearts they would resist 
and resent the inconvenience of the ritual, not feeling that the Lord and the 
church are the neighbor to be loved.

Clean Teeth

 Note what the Writings say about “cleanness of teeth.” Please note this does 

not mean their teeth were toothbrush clean. The Writings, in AC 9052[2] and 
AE 556[12] teach us that this means “emptiness of teeth” or to be missing 
teeth, so we must see this as being representative of the scarcity of truth and 
scarcity of doctrine.

92

PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER

1. Having gone through most of the correspondences in these verses, we must 
now go back and begin with what we were taught in P&P: “...they arrange a 
worship in externals according to the statutes, which will be similar to real 
worship, yet only in the outermost things...”
Jeroboam profaned Bethel and brought about an opposite representation of 
spiritual knowledges. What example past or present might illustrate this for 
us?

2. When the Word says that they transgressed Bethel, it means that they 

transgressed the knowledges of the Word. When the Word says that they 
multiplied the transgressions of Gilgal, it means that they twisted the 
introductory natural truths so badly that they misled those hearing them, and
the lies prevented them from offering the kind of sacrifices, each day, that 
would have given them the insights necessary to amend their lives.

3. The multiplicity of falsity prevented the remains from serving the inner man. 
Instead of offering an unleavened sacrifice of thanksgiving (purification from 
falsities and a celebration of liberation from damnation), they were offering 
the sacrifice of leaven that represents evil and falsity rendering spiritual 
things impure and profane.

4. Giving to the Lord, and the temple, was for show. Those donating lavishly 

looked at their gifts as earning meritorious mercy from the Lord. Their use of 
the sacrifices was not for the Lord out of grateful hearts. Sadly, it only served 
their need for peer recognition. This seems to explain why the Lord said to 
them, “For this you love, you children of Israel.”

5. The “great emptiness” message comes through the unfolding of these verses. 
The lack of teeth prevented them from eating and chewing foods that would 
have been better for them; the lack of bread in all of their palaces told them of
the Lord’s absence; and yet, they seemed to have no awareness of these 
deficiencies because they failed to correct them and return to the Lord.
6. Worship requirements were being met to fill the laws, and it appeared that 

they were just like the “real thing,” but they were worshiping with emptiness 
of teeth and no bread.

READ AND REVIEW

Read Amos 4:4-6.
Read the summary from P&P.

QUESTIONS TO STIMULATE REFLECTION

1. These verses introduce the idea of bringing sacrifices every morning and 

tithes every three days. What might this mean to us? In what ways do you do 
some or all of this?

93

2.

Is the use of leavening always bad? Don’t we need to be brought to the point 
of combat so we may remove impurities? How does this teaching fit with 
what the Writings tell us about the nature of temptation?

3. Freewill offerings. There are times we question the wisdom of expenditures 

made for the church. To demonstrate our disfavor with a person or policy, we 
might withhold some of our future support as a sign of protest. Is this ever 
appropriate?  Why, or why not? Have we ever justified it by saying that we 
will spend that money on our needs because we are also the neighbor? 
Should we feel guilty for not being more generous or cheerful about offering 
our gifts to the church?

4. Think about chewing food without teeth. Some have little confidence in their 
thinking skills, so they fail to think for themselves. They rely on the thinking 
or opinions of others. If we were to offer an analogy, we might say they have 
no teeth and are satisfied with prepared foods that resemble “baby food” 
instead of chewing things over for themselves. What are some reasons why 
this happens?  Why is it dangerous?
How would we characterize our generation, or the current time? Are we 
toothless, with a scarcity of truth and a scarcity of doctrine?  Is this a choice?
Is there also a lack of bread in our midst? Remember, that means a scarcity of 
the Lord’s love.

5. How aware might we be of the times the Lord called us out of our 

transgressions and we failed to hear or come out of them? Is our conscience 
tuned in to the Lord, or is it overwhelmed with the noise of other values?

AMOS 4:7-8

“I also withheld rain from you,
When there were still three months to the harvest.
I made it rain on one city,
I withheld rain from another city.
One part was rained upon,
And where it did not rain the part withered.
So two or three cities wandered to another city to drink water,
But they were not satisfied;
Yet you have not returned to Me,
Says the Lord.”



“...that some truths will remain, when the rest have become falsities, whence 
the truths have no power, vers. 7, 8...”

94

AC 382[2]



“In Amos...where by the ‘part of the field on which it rained’ is signified the 
doctrine of faith from charity; and by the ‘part’ or ‘piece’ ‘of the field on which
it did not rain,’ the doctrine of faith without charity.” Amos 4:7-8 is cited.

AR 496



“That ‘rain’ signifies the Divine truth from heaven, appears from these 
passages...” Amos 4:7-8 is cited.

AE 644 [9&10]



“...the Lord...always flows in both with the evil and with the good...but the 
cause is with the man of the church, that he does not receive any influx of 
Divine truth, for the man who does not receive closes up with himself the 
interiors of his mind...‘to command the clouds that they rain no rain’ signifies 
that no influx of Divine truth from heaven is received....rain...is the source of 
spiritual intelligence...‘no rain’ signifies that no such intelligence is 
given...because of the evils and falsities that refuse to receive and that reject 
it.” Amos 4:7-8 is cited as one example.

AE 532[8]



“In Amos...This treats of the lack of truth at the end of the church, when those 
who desire truth from spiritual affection will not find any truth in the 
doctrines, wherever they may search, and therefore it is said, ‘two three cities
wandered unto one city to drink waters, yet they were not satisfied;’ ‘two 
three cities’ signifying those who are in the affection of truth from good, ‘city’ 
signifying the truth of doctrine; ‘to draw waters’ signifies to learn truths; ‘to 
wander’ signifies to search; and ‘not to be satisfied’ signifies not to find truth 
which in itself is truth; it is said ‘two three cities,’ because ‘two three’ signifies
those who are in good and in truth therefrom.”  Amos 4:8 is cited.

DERIVED DOCTRINE

Harvest



“...‘harvest’ signifies the last state of the church preceding the Last Judgment, 
when the Lord explores every one and separates...” (AE 908)

 Almost all of AE 911[1-18] is a repetition that “harvest” signifies the last state
of the church. In AR 645, “harvest” signifies the church with respect to divine 
truth because corn is harvested and corn is used to make ‘bread’ and bread 
signifies the good of the church.

95

Almost everything we need to look toward a summary was given to us, so we will 
not include more derived doctrine here.

PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER

1. When falsity is the mainstay of a church, it belittles the power of truth. Think 
of it this way: If everyone in the world were insane, their insanity would 
appear to be sanity. The sane person trying to teach or live out the truth 
would be viewed as a “lunatic,” and his actions would be drawn into question 
and found unacceptable. Could this be analogous to what the faithful remnant
in Israel experienced?

2. The Lord who loves all lets His rain fall upon the just and the unjust evenly. It 
is not the Lord who withholds the rain. Some will not allow His rain to fall 
into their city. They close off their minds to the Divine truth. Spiritually, they 
wither. They choose to resist the Lord’s “rain” and consequently fail to 
quench their parched souls with the living water that only the Lord can give.
3. For a few in Israel, there was a vague sense that something was missing from 
their lives. They searched and found water in another city, but that water 
could not satisfy their thirst. Why? Could it have been that they sought water 
from others and not the Lord? Is it an example of what the Word teaches us, 
that we can’t borrow truth from someone else? Is it like the example of David 
not being able to wear Saul’s armor? 

4. Lastly, we have the wistful refrain “yet you have not returned to Me...” There 
was a spiritual thirst, but a collective “amnesia” as to where that thirst could 
be quenched. The Israelites were so caught up in the rush of external 
prosperity and peace that they did not know how withered they were. What 
would it take to snap them out of their spiritual lethargy?

READ AND REVIEW

Read Amos 4:7-8.
Read the summary from P&P.

QUESTIONS TO STIMULATE REFLECTION

1. Are there any questions here? The spiritual sense clearly outlines that the 

2.

Israelite cities had no rain because they rejected the Lord.
I wonder about those who went to another city for water. Does it seem 
“unfair” that they ended up not being satisfied? Don’t they get some credit for
looking in some other city? Could this search for water in another city 
represent lazy thinking and the willingness to borrow from the minds of 
others without consulting the Lord’s Word?  How might it compare to the 
people we mentioned in the last lesson who did not want to chew their food 
(think for themselves)?
The Lord will not leave anyone thirsty if they truly seek His living water. What
might have kept the Lord from “raining on their city”? Were they 

96

representative of those who make moral judgments in the “light” of popular 
opinions?

3. Can you remember a situation where your concept of what was right, sane, 
and reasonable was made to look unreasonable, insane, and wrong? How 
does one deal with that experience?

4. Think about all of the activities or lifestyles that at one time were viewed as 

disorderly and are now tolerated. Things that Swedenborg called 
“unspeakable evils” are now called “viable alternative lifestyles.”  Were 
people wrong in the past? Were we narrow-minded?  Have we found new 
truths in the Word to change our understanding on these issues?  Or have we 
drawn unsatisfactory water from other cities that won’t sate the thirst?

AMOS 4:9

“I blasted you with the blight and mildew.
When your gardens increased,
Your vineyards,
Your fig trees,
And your olive trees,
The locust devoured them;
Yet you have not returned to Me,
Says the Lord.”

PASSAGES FROM THE WRITINGS

which are destroyed by such insects...” Amos 4:9 is cited.



“In Amos...‘Gardens’ signify all things of the church that constitute

worm’ means the falsity that destroys....” Amos 4:9 is cited. 

AE 638[20]



“In Amos...‘Gardens’ signify such things as belong to spiritual

intelligence; ‘blasting and mildew’ signify evil and falsity in what is most 
external, or from the corporeal-sensual...the ‘palmer-worm’ signifies falsity 
destroying good.” Amos 4:9 is cited.

 That “...a ‘vineyard’ signifies the spiritual church is evident from the passages 

in the Word...” Amos 4:9 is cited. 

DERIVED DOCTRINE

The Insect

Note: The locust, the caterpillar, the worm, and the palmer-worm are the various 
names we find used in the translations for the insect that devoured the vineyard, the 
fig tree, and the olive trees.

 AE 543[8] says ‘locust’ and the ‘caterpillar’ have the same 



signification...‘locust’ signifies the falsity of the sensual man, and the 
‘caterpillar’ its evil....”
“The falsity of evil, which is in the good that is from our own, is compared to 
‘a worm’ because the case with them is similar; for falsity also gnaws and 
thus torments.” (AC 8481) “...the palmer-worm means the falsity that 
destroys...” (AE 403[8])

Blasting

 Webster’s Dictionary defines this word as breathing; a violent gust of wind; 

or a sudden stream or discharge of air.  AC 8286 says that when predicated of 
the Lord, “...‘blowing with the nostrils’ or ‘breathing,’ is signified to be angry....”

98

It would seem that this is the sense of understanding we should follow with “I
blasted you with blight and mildew.”

Blight

 Turning to Webster’s Dictionary again, we read that a blight is “A disease or 

injury to a plant that results in a withering, cessation of growth, and death of 
parts, as leaves, without rotting.”   

Mildew



“...a thin, whitish growth produced on organic matter, and on plants by 
fungi...”

 As we know from experience, that thin layer of white is one form of fungi; 

another is the blackish layer of fungi. Both forms of fungi do harm to plants.

I’m sure there is some spiritual correspondence for this. Could the following 
application have some merit for us to consider?

A lie is a lie whether it is a “white lie” or a “black lie,” and eventually, it will put some 
kind of blight on our moral character and injure our first efforts to do good. 
Withering, cessation of growth, and the death of many a good intention are 
experiences we all have felt and regretted. 

PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER

1. P&P says that “...all things of the church have been falsified.”
2. Therefore, it follows that the representations in this story of the things of the 
church (vineyards, fig trees, and olive trees) should be shown undergoing 
some affliction. When the things of the church are falsified, the garden with 
all spiritual intelligence is a victim. The loss of celestial, spiritual, and natural 
good shows the demise of their love. When obedience is lost, the person in 
the church doesn’t hear, see, or submit to the urges of the Word. Spiritual 
insights are warped and made meaningless. The heart that is absent from the 
Lord turns cold and is inclined to follow the urges of self, the sensual or 
corporeal interests. To people in that state, such as the children of Israel in 
this story, it appears that the Lord is angry and blasting. Blight and mildew 
attack the growth (or lack thereof), and the locust, caterpillar, worm, or 
palmer-worm destroy the spiritual garden.

3. “Yet you have not returned to Me.” Notice that this is the second time in this 
chapter that the same phrase is given to the Israelites, and it will be used 
again in verse 10. Like a patient and loving parent, the Lord wants them to 
see the consequences of their actions. The Lord wants to face them with 
reality. What will it take for them to see what they are doing to themselves? 
What more could the Lord have done for them? And yet, instead of having a 

99

vineyard that produced sweet grapes, they produced sour grapes not fit for 
much of anything.

4. What we can anticipate, from the historical perspective, is that the people of 
the church eventually will turn, and project on the Lord anger and disregard 
for their condition. They will act as if this spiritual blight came on them 
suddenly with no warning. They will see and remember the great “blast” as a 
manifestation of His sudden anger and impatience with human beings.  With 
anguished voices, they will cry out: “Why, O Lord have you visited us with 
such direful punishment?”

QUESTIONS TO STIMULATE REFLECTION

1. Does this verse prepare us to think about our gardens, vineyards, fig trees, 

and olive trees? How can we assess the state of our gardens, etc.?

2. The blight, the mildew, and the worms that attack and seek to destroy the 

church: Can you put a face on them? Is there some form of “spiritual spray” to
protect the tree of life?

3. The Writings liken the worm to the proprium. It is a worm that is within and 
gnaws its way out and thus torments. Fruit trees have to be sprayed when the
blossom appears, to rid the blossom of the worm. Otherwise, the fruit will be 
eaten from within. Is there a message here for us?

4. What is your impression of the Lord’s words, “And yet you have not returned 

to Me...”?

5. The external church, the internal spiritual church, and the internal celestial 

church: Are you able to differentiate the meanings of these terms? How about
effect, cause, and end? That is a reverse order of what should be for the 
church. We are taught that all order flows from End to Cause to Effect. Could 
it significant that philosophical “proofs of God” often reversed the method of 
finding God?  They each start their effort by looking from the effects to cause 
to end.

AMOS 4:10-11

“I sent among you a plague after the manner of Egypt;
Your young men I killed with a sword,
Along with your captive horses;
I made the stench of your camps come up into your nostrils;
Yet you have not returned to Me, 
Says the Lord.
I overthrew some of you,

100

As God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah,
And you were like a firebrand plucked from the burning;
Yet you have not returned to Me,
Says the Lord.”

 AC 6952 also explains that “...‘smoking firebrands’ denote wrath.”

PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER

1. With so much given to us regarding these verses, where should we start tying
together a workable theme? My attention was drawn to the words “memory 
knowledges.”
The memory of each person is unique and has wonderful and necessary facts 
stored up for our usage now and later.  The five senses gather impressions, 
note contrasts, give us the ability to cognitively follow certain logical cause-
and-effect relationships. The Writings talk about the scientifics and truths in 
a person’s memory cohering into “bundles” or forms of information that are 
arranged according to the person’s loves. (See AC 5881.) Briefly, the memory 
is like a gateway by which the Lord may work the wonderful miracles of 
elevating the mind into the light of continuous and discrete degrees. So much 
more may be said about the potential of the things in one’s memory.

2. But the internal sense indicates that something is not right with the “memory
knowledges” referred to in this story. There are words like “pestilence,” 
“killed with the sword,” “captivity,” “stench,” “overthrown,” “Sodom and 
Gomorrah,” and “firebrand” that tell us that these memory knowledges are 
not interested in being useful or of service to the Lord.  Instead, these 
memory knowledges are intent on the “...overthrowing of God.” (AC 2220[2])
3. Continuous and discrete degrees require a “conatus” that seeks conjunction 
with the Lord. In The Doctrine of the Lord 102, we read: “...with one in whom 
there is nothing reciprocal [conjunction] is not possible....”  Real conjunction 
must involve reciprocation, return, and mutuality.

4. Our text tells us that Israel involved its memory knowledges in the things of 

sensual scientifics and corporeal knowledges. In other words, they were only 
interested in what served immediate use in the world or for their bodily 
enjoyment. AC 4618 teaches us that the corporeal memory serves only the 
temporal, and like the temporal, it perishes at death.
Sadly, the scientific and corporeal caused a stench or stinking in the “camp.” 
Their intelligence was slain, and their thoughts were like an abomination 
“exhaling from hell.”

5. The reference to the Israelites being a firebrand denotes what kind of wrath 
against God they had within their hearts. The Lord tried to pluck them out of 
the burning hatred, but “Yet you have not returned to Me.” The “stick” 
represented the “power” or usefulness of natural good being destroyed 
because their ends were for themselves and not the neighbor.

QUESTIONS TO STIMULATE REFLECTION

1. What part of AC 10458 did you find most helpful in explaining the meaning of

these verses?

2. What is a corporeal memory knowledge? Can you think of anything specific 
to describe one of these? Can a corporeal memory knowledge be turned into 
a useful thing? What about the scientific memory knowledges?

3. Why would the Lord have these forms of memory knowledges die off when 

we die?

4. Have you ever had a discussion with someone who was totally committed to 
the corporeal memory knowledges? What is the feeling? How did you do with
the discussion?

5. The “stink” of the camp is a graphic form of imagery, and I think we can relate

to what is being suggested. Hell is full of unclean thoughts, intentions, 
festering, etc. Is the Lord trying to scare us into shunning these things, or is 
this a good form of “tough love?” How does imagery like this help us?

6. Again, we have that poignant phrase: “Yet you have not returned to Me.” Like 
many of the wonderful stories I have heard about the innocent participatory 
enthusiasm of children, my heart wants to respond, “Yes Lord, I have heard 
You, and I will return!” Amen, which means: So may it ever be. What is it 
inside of us that responds to the Lord this way?  How can we foster this 
response in ourselves?

AMOS 4:12-13

“Therefore thus will I do to you, O Israel;
Because I will do this to you,
Prepare to meet your God, O Israel!
For behold,
He who forms mountains, 
And creates the wind,
Who declares to man what his thought is,
And makes the morning darkness,
Who treads the high places of the earth-
The Lord God of hosts is His name.”

DERIVED DOCTRINE

“Therefore will I do to you...” and “because I will do this to you...”

 The Writings have an interesting comment on such phrases as these when 
predicated of the Lord: “...‘doing’ or ‘do to you’ [when]...predicated of God...
[refers to His] providence...for whatever is of the Divine Providence is certain 
to be the event....” (AC 5284)

Prepare to Meet your God

 We have no direct teachings on the meaning of this exhortation. John the 

Baptist told the people to “Prepare ye the way of the Lord...” which signifies 
“...to prepare one’s self for goods to enter...” (AC 3142)  “In the precise degree 
in which man prepares his understanding by means of truths from the Word 
does he adapt his understanding to receive faith from God, and precisely as 
he prepares his will by means of works of charity does he fit his will for the 
reception of love from God.... One prepares himself to receive God and to be 
conjoined with Him by living in accordance with the Divine order...” (TCR 
110[5])

Making the Morning Darkness

 Churches go through various states. “Its first state is...of innocence, 

consequently of love to the Lord, which state is called ‘morning;’ the second 
state is a state of light; the third is a state of light in obscurity, which is its 
‘evening;’ and the fourth is a state of no love and hence of no light, which is its
‘night.’ (AC 10134[9])

105

The Lord God “…treads the high places of the earth....”



In AC 85, there is an explanation of “being uplifted over the lofty things of the 
earth.” (Isa 58:13,14) This represents “...the quality of the celestial man...he 
acts not according to his own desire, but according to the good pleasure of 
the Lord, which is his ‘desire.’”

 Could this represent the truth that the Lord is above the highest thoughts 
human beings can conceive? The lofty ideas and concepts of earth will not 
influence the workings of Providence. The Lord will not be swayed by human 
prudence. He acts according to the Divine laws of His order, and that is above 
the “lofty things of earth.”

 The Lord told us about this in Isaiah 55:8-9: “For My thoughts are not your 

thoughts, neither are your ways My ways...For as the heavens are higher than 
the earth, so are My ways higher than your ways and My thoughts than your 
thoughts.”

PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER

1. P&P tells us that these closing verses are an exhortation that the Israelites 

should turn to the Lord.

2. The Lord reminds all that His Providence will act. All that His order has 

planned will take place. Good and truth will prevail. Therefore, preparation 
needs to be a priority for all of the Lord’s people.
In the precise degree the understanding and will prepare for the Lord, to that 
degree will He enter in and conjoin Himself with us.  “Prepare to meet thy 
God” is not a “hell-fire and damnation” sermon. It is a well-reasoned 
reminder that we need to put first things first.

3. Making the morning into darkness seems as if it were an act of the Lord. It is 
a statement about our changing states. Have we moved from the morning 
state of innocence to no love, no light, and therefore darkness?               

READ AND REVIEW

QUESTIONS TO STIMULATE REFLECTION

1. The Lord knows what our thoughts are before we speak them. Why then does
He let us come to Him with specific requests for help? Why do we have to 
perform self-examination? Wouldn’t it be better for the Lord to tell us what 
we need to overcome and then go inside of our affections and “disconnect” all
related and contributing factors?

2. Do we have an effective “prophet” to call us back to the Lord? Might it be a 

regular study of the Word? Church services? Doctrinal classes? We need some

106

objective source against which to compare our progress, or lack thereof, and 
from which we can learn about pertinent issues. What do you think would 
bring about the best results for you?

3. The “earth” of the human mind made remarkable advances, but the Lord is 

beyond the comprehension of people and angels.  In spite of this, we tend to 
“limit” the Lord by doubting His Providence. Therefore, these verses pose the 
question: how can we imitate the celestial man so that we too may “...act not 
according to [our] own desire, but according to the good pleasure of the 
Lord....”?

4. The answer seems to be: Take charge of our spiritual life. Be alert. Be 

responsible for our choices and actions. Check out our intentions. In all 
things, pull the reigns on the sensual and corporeal priorities so the Lord’s 
good pleasure may do the leading.

5. Preparation is a “sweeping” out of the house, opening the blinds of the house 
so the hells are exposed and the light of heaven welcomed. Can we do this 
without the usual rationalizations? Like little children, will we try to deflect 
responsibilities by making odious comparisons? “So and so does this....” “If 
that ‘pillar of the church’ does such and such and I don’t, then I don’t have to 
worry about my regeneration right now.” “Do you know what so and so did? 
Wasn’t that stupid?” Such ridicule dulls the voice of the conscience and 
insulates us from hearing the “Former” of the mountains and the creator of 
our “spirit” telling us the things we need to hear and know.   How much do we
try to excuse with the statement “To err is human.”?

AMOS 5:1-3

“Hear this word which I take up against you, a lamentation, O house of Israel:

The virgin of Israel has fallen;
She will rise no more.
She lies forsaken on her land;
There is no one to raise her up.

For thus says the Lord God:

The city that goes out by a thousand
Shall have a hundred left,
And that which goes out by a hundred
Shall have ten left to the house of Israel.”

“A lamentation over the church, that it was successively laid to waste, vers. 1-
3...”

AR 620



“‘For they are virgins’ signifies because they have loved truths because they 
are truths, thus from spiritual affection; the reason why these are meant by 
‘virgins’ is because ‘a virgin’ signifies the church as a bride, who desires to be 
conjoined with the Lord, and to become a wife; and the church which desires 
to be conjoined with the Lord, loves truths because they are truths, for by 
truths, when one lives according to them, conjunction is effected. Hence it is 
that Israel, Zion, and Jerusalem, in the Word are called ‘virgins’ and 
‘daughters’; for by ‘Israel,’ ‘Zion,’ and ‘Jerusalem,’ is signified the church.”  
Amos 5:2 is cited.

AE 836[13]



“Because the church is a church from the spiritual affection of truth, which is 
the love of truth for the sake of truth, the following expressions are

references cited.

DERIVED DOCTRINE

“I take up against you, a lamentation....”







In addition to the word lamentation, we might consider looking up “lament,” 
“mourn,” “weep,” and “wail.” The reasons for lamenting vary.
In an AR 767 reference, those who had been in positions of authority weep 
and wail in embarrassment over the loss of wealth and being cast down from 
positions of dominion.
In AE 695[24], we have a picture of angels and men of the church lamenting 
and howling because of the vastation of all good and truth.

 AE 659[4] tells of a wailing because knowledges did not “...take form as 

effects, conclusions, and confirmations from the truths of the spiritual man...”
 The Lord wants lamentation to come upon the church so it might grieve over 

any wrong it has done.  Asking for forgiveness prepares the way for 
repentance, reformation, and regeneration. These three “r’s” restore spiritual 
vitality to a growing church.

“The virgin of Israel has fallen...”

 This signifies that Israel gave up its regard for the Lord’s truth. Truth became 

a tool to prove or justify whatever they wanted.

“She will rise no more.” 

 The word “rise” in the affirmative sense is beautifully explained in the 



Arcana: When the “...words of the sense of the letter are wonderfully changed,
when it ascends from a man who is reading the Word to the sphere in which 
the angels are, that is, to heaven....” one is said to “rise.” (AC 2333[2])
In the opposite sense, “rising no more” indicates how the Word remained in 
the literal sense and was not being “wonderfully changed” for the Israelites. 
The Word for them was not ascending in their heart and mind to where 
angels were.

109

“She lies forsaken on her land...”

 The correspondences of the words “forsaken” and “land” are important for 



our understanding. In AE 768[24], we read that “forsaken” signifies 
estrangement from the Lord. This “...signifies they have rejected Divine good 
and Divine truth.... [and] turn themselves backward from the Lord....”
“‘Land’ in the internal sense signifies...the external man of the 
church...signifies the region where the church is...the church itself.... [and] 
that which is their essential, namely, love to the Lord and charity toward the 
neighbor, for on this they all hang....” (AC 2571)

“There is no one to raise her up.”



So long as the church ignores the Word, communication or conjunction with 
the Lord is impossible, and it appears that no one can “raise her up.” But if the
church returns to the Word with a desire to find genuine truths, the Lord will 
raise her up again. This verse then is the Lord reminding the Israelites that 
they cannot count on any human prudence to rescue them. Only those who 
listen to Him will find the way out of their ignorance, as is so aptly described 
in the gospel of John: “And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness 
comprehended it not....” (John 1:5)   “And this is the condemnation, that light 
is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because 
their deeds were evil.” (John 3:19)

Thousand, Hundred, Ten



“The city that goes out by a thousand shall have a hundred left, and that 
which goes out by a hundred shall have ten left....”

 AC 576[2] tells us that this verse is “...speaking of remains...that very little 

would be left...or remains of remains...”

 Each of these numbers, thousand and hundred, are multiples of ten. How we 

are to apply these numbers doctrinally is not quite clear to me, but the 
teachings in the Arcana about the reduction or loss of “remains” down to the 
“remain of remains” gives me some insight to follow.

 The Israelitish people at one time had an abundance of truth adjoined to 

good, but over time, they squandered these assets away until the Lord needed
to act on behalf of His people. He preserved their remains. “...for unless 
remains were preserved by the Lord in every one, he must needs perish 
eternally...if there were not always some with whom the church, or true faith, 
remained, the human race...a city, nay, sometimes a whole race would 
perish...sometimes a whole kingdom, is saved for the sake of a few.” (AC 468)
 That a “thousand” signifies “...an infinite abundance of rational truth adjoined 
to good, is evident from the signification of a ‘thousand’ as being much and 
countless; here infinite, or an infinite abundance, because predicated of the 
Lord....” (AC 2575)

110



In a nutshell we are given an overview of the Lord’s Providence mercifully 
working with what “little” He is given when in blindness we turn away from 
the “countless” the “infinite abundance” He offers to all.

PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER

1. Pride, an out-of-control love of self, needs to come to its senses. “Lamenting” 
is an essentially healthy emotion. Saying to the Lord that we are sorry for not 
letting His knowledges “...take form as effects, conclusions, and 
confirmations...” is so much better than lamenting over the loss of wealth or 
power over others. When the heart is hardened to the gentle leading of 
Providence, we close, lose, or wall out all that the Lord could do for us.
2. Like a virgin, our innocence falls, and it feels unable to get up. Innocence, 
seeing our confusion and indifference (stiff neck, heavy ears, troublesome 
nature), senses that we are unaware of the gravity of the situation. With no 
spiritual plan to follow, innocence feels there is no real hope for the future. “Is
there anyone who will restore my dignity?”

3. “Rising”: We need that positive sense that reading the Word of the Lord can, 

and does, carry us into that sphere where angels are.  The words we read will 
be “...wonderfully changed...” for us. These words will put away any 
estrangement that might have crept into our hearts and minds.

4. The “remains” the Lord has watched over from our infancy and stored up in 
the internal will be called forth when needed, and we can go out by the 
“thousands,” drawing on the infinite abundance of the Lord.
We need to put the image of thousands going in and out of the city as our 
goal. Just saying the words “remain of remains” draws the soul into the 
decision-making process.
“See, I have set before you this day life and good, death and evil....therefore 
choose life, that you and your descendants may live, loving the Lord your God,
obeying His voice, and cleaving to Him....” (Deuteronomy 30:15-20)

QUESTIONS TO STIMULATE REFLECTION

1. There is a part of us that wants the Word to be happy, bright, cheerful and 
free of anything that inspires guilt. There are elements of these themes 
throughout the wonderful stories of the Word, and yet there are those 
“heavy” themes of separation or estrangement. The Rev. Cairns Henderson 
wrote a series of article in New Church Life about the “hard sayings” of the 
Lord. Ever read them?
The punishment of evil and the loss of opportunities is a repetitive theme. 

111

How do you keep a balanced perspective of these states so that you find 
comfort when it is needed and be made uncomfortable when you have gotten 
lethargically comfortable?

2. Have you ever done a doctrinal study on the correspondence of numbers? 
Why are there times when the meanings of the numbers are explained by 
multiplication, division, or addition?

AMOS 5:4-9

“For thus says the Lord to the house of Israel:
Seek Me and live;
But do not seek Bethel,
Nor enter Gilgal, 
Nor pass over to Beersheba;
For Gilgal shall surely go into captivity,
And Bethel shall come to nothing.
Seek the Lord and live,
Lest he break out like fire in the house of Joseph,
And devour it, 
With no one to quench it in Bethel-
You who turn justice to wormwood,
And lay righteousness to rest in the earth!
He made the Pleiades and Orion;
He turns the shadow of death into morning
And makes the day dark as night;
|He calls for the waters of the sea
And pours them out on the face of the earth;
The Lord is His name.
He rains ruin upon the strong,
So that fury comes upon the fortress.

there is nothing but evils and falsities.”

DERIVED DOCTRINE

NOTE THE PROGRESSION OF A SERIES THAT TELLS US WHAT IS NOT “SEEKING 
THE LORD AND LIVING.”

“Seek Me and live...”



Seeking the Lord involves an effort of the will, from the love of truth, for the 
sake of truth. Seeking the Lord is not a gathering of facts merely to know 
them, but it means drawing them into ourselves so that we may live by them.

 The Writings give us a symbol to reflect on: “Drawers of waters.” AC 3058 
teaches that “To ‘draw waters’ is to be instructed, to understand, and to be 

113

wise.” This number then warns us that there will be some who “...continually 
desire to know truths, but for no other end than to know them, while caring 
nothing for the use.” Seeking means loving truth so spiritual uses may be 
offered to the Lord, to the neighbor, and to ourselves. Such “drawers of water”
bring constructive amendment to the will, and their lives are lived to the 
fullest measure.

“...do not seek Bethel....”

 The word Bethel means “House of God.” In the best sense, the Writings teach 

that Bethel represents the knowledge of celestial things. See AC 3720.
 Worship for the Israelites had fallen into a routine. They believed just 

entering the house of God was enough. The Lord said no, it isn’t. Quoting 
celestial things is not enough. They carried the water, but they did nothing 
with it to quench their spiritually parched souls.

 The words of the prophet must have seemed inappropriate to his listeners. 
They looked up at the temple. There it stood, beautifully and esthetically 
awesome. “What is this man talking about? We have given of our wealth to 
make this the most special ‘House of God.’”

“Nor enter Gilgal...”

 Gilgal represents “...the doctrine of natural truth, which is serviceable for 

introduction into the church.” (AE 700[14]) Natural truth apart from a love 
for the Lord would not help carry the Israelites into spiritual life. The facts of 
spiritual law needed to be added to their knowledge of natural law.

“Nor pass over to Beersheba...”

 Please note that in AC 2723[1&2], we were told that in the good sense, 

“Beersheba” represents the adjunction of human reason to the doctrine of 
faith so that human comprehension might be assisted.

 The word ADJUNCTION is not the same as CONJUNCTION.  According to 

Webster’s Dictionary, adjunction means “...something added to another thing, 
but not essentially a part of it....” By contrast, conjunction is the entering into 
and blending or marriage occurring where the two become as a one.

 Therefore, we are told in the Arcana that the Israelites took what could have 
been a helpful adjunction and turned it to the “opposite.” They did not seek to
adjoin their human reason with the doctrine of faith. The loss? Human 
comprehension of the Lord’s Word dimmed like a fading or flickering light.

What were the results of the Israelitish failure to seek the Lord?

1. “...Gilgal shall surely go into captivity...” Natural truths that could have been 

introductory truths will become enslaved.

114

2. “...Bethel shall come to nothing...” The “house of God” ornate, beautiful, and 

impressive, will mean little to the spiritually ignorant.

3. “Seek the Lord and live...” Here is the solution, cries the prophet. Listen and 

obey the Lord.

4. “...fire in the house of Joseph...and [he] will devour it....” If you fail to repent, 
the truths of doctrine will perish. I believe the “he” here refers to the enemy 
of truth, not to the Lord.

5. “With no one to quench it in Bethel...” Human prudence, the priesthood, the 
gods, whatever they had great hope or faith in could not take away the great 
thirst for spiritual waters. Not wealth, not armies, not expanded territories, 
nothing will work! Only the Lord can give you what you so desperately need 
and don’t know it.

6. “You who turn justice to wormwood...”

a. The word “wormwood” is used in the Word to convey a sense of 

b.

c.

bitterness and sorrow. The Writings teach that “wormwood” in food 
renders the food and drink “abominable.” How so? Is it just the taste, 
or is there a more subtle but deadly reason?
In some countries, “wormwood” is used in the making of absinthe. It is
a green alcoholic liquor containing oils of wormwood and anise and 
other aromatics. If over-used, this disguised, sweet-tasting, alcoholic 
drink will eventually cause a serious nervous derangement. The 
culprit? “Wormwood!”
Justice in Israel’s society was being lost. Like the drink of absinthe, 
their morals, reasoning, caring, and sense of fairness were becoming 
deranged. The justice of the day, as explained by the priests, was like 
the cleverly mixed abominable “wormwood.” Ambition, greed, and 
laziness covered their bitter taste of injustice with sweet anise and 
other aromatics.

7. “And lay righteousness to rest in the earth.”

a. Simply put, this means that righteousness was put to sleep in the 

minds of people. The end justifying the means was acceptable as long 
as it gave them what they wanted.

8. “He made the Pleiades and Orion...”

a. Pleiades is a group, or cluster, of bright stars. There are seven stars in 
this constellation. The ancients had some elaborate myths about all of 
the stars in the heavens. One of these stars of Pleiades, according to 
tradition, became hidden or banished when it mistakenly fell in love 
with a human. (Isn’t it interesting what lengths human self-love will go
to even in myths?)

b. Orion is also a constellation of stars which, for the ancients, formed a 
gigantic warrior with a belt and sword. Orion was a man of great 
strength who at his death was transferred to the heavens.  Did Israel 
find the story of these myths appealing? Or did the myths represent 
the foolishness of those who trusted in their own strength instead of 
the Lord? Did Israel consult the stars for answers? Did they seek their 
“powers” by offering gifts or sacrifices? The source I checked, 

115

Interpreter’s Bible Dictionary, indicated historians think they probably
did.

c. The point here is that the Lord reminded them that it was He who 

made these stars, and that which the Lord creates is not greater than 
its Creator.

e.

d. Before leaving this portion of the text, let’s look at two wonderful 
quotes in the Writings regarding stars and Pleiades and Orion.
“...I can, from all experience, and thence testimony from heaven, 
declare with certainty, that it is impossible to derive a single genuine 
theological truth from any other source than from the Lord alone; nay, 
that to derive it from any other source is as impossible, as it is to sail 
from England or Holland to the Pleiades, or to ride on horseback from 
Germany to Orion in the sky.”  (Brief Exposition 98)
“...truths are all like stars, which by their light make the faith manifest 
and give it form. Man acquires this faith from the Word by means of 
his natural light, in which light it is knowledge, thought, and 
persuasion; but the Lord causes it, in those who believe in Him, to 
become conviction, trust, and confidence; thus faith becomes 
spiritual-natural, and by means of charity becomes living.” (TCR 
137[5])

f.

9. “He turns the shadow of death into morning and makes the day dark as 

night...”
a.

“‘Spiritual thick-darkness,’ ‘the shadow of death,’ and ‘darkness,’ are 
nothing else but the states of those in hell, who are in the falsities of 
evil.... The Word in many places treats [of the above words to mean 
those] whose eyes the Lord will open; and by them are meant the 
Gentiles...Christians...they know the Lord indeed, but do not approach 
Him, and they have the Word, but yet do not search for the truths 
therein.” (AR 110)

b. There is hope and deliverance for those who are blind from ignorance 
and are lost but a stern warning to those who insist on turning the 
Word to their own ends.

10. “He calls for the waters of the sea and pours them out on the face of the 

earth...”

a. There is a lesson in AC 2162[7] that explains Revelation 10:1-2. In that
text, a strong angel is seen with a little book open in his hand. He has 
his right foot upon the water of the sea and his left foot upon the earth.
We are taught that the “‘sea’ denotes natural truths, the ‘earth’ denotes
natural goods....”

b. The Lord is offering relief from the parched and thirsty condition of 
poor spiritual leadership. He will bridge the gap. He promises to 
restore a wholesome communication if they return to the knowledge 
and love of the Lord alone. Their spiritual thirst can only be quenched 
with “living waters” and not the cleverly mixed delusions the drink of 
“wormwood” was giving them.

11. “The Lord is His name.”

116

12. “He rains ruin upon the strong so that fury comes upon the fortress.”

What a powerful finish to the above conditions:

1. Seek Me and live. 
2. Don’t look to the physical temple you built.
3. Don’t count on your natural-introductory truths
4. Don’t destroy the adjunction of the doctrine of faith and human reason.
5.

If you do, you will destroy all the things of the church, and you will perish 
through the evils and falsities of the drink of “wormwood” hell has prepared. 
It will give you a deranged sense of justice and righteousness.
I will remove the shadows of death. I will turn your nights into mornings.

6.
7. Remember, it is not the myths of Pleiades or Orion that will help you.
8. Don’t waste your time courting their favor or power. There is only one Source 

of help:

9. The Lord is His name.

PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER

I feel we just did that. Maybe you want to add your own summary to the above. 
Please do so, and share that summary with one of your study partners.

READ AND REVIEW

Read Amos 5:4-9.
Read the summary from P&P.

QUESTIONS TO STIMULATE REFLECTION

1. Do you feel the sense of mercy here from the Lord? He is showing the 

Israelites the series of causes and effects their actions brought about, but He 
doesn’t leave them without a solution. He shows them the way out of the 
confusion: “Seek Me and Live.”

2. What excuses do you think will be offered up when people have their 

spiritual eyes open in the World of Spirits and they see all that the Lord did 
for them when they had imagined they fought evils alone? Do you think the 
excuse of ignorance will offer up an “airtight alibi”?

3. As clear a picture as the Writings give us about the prophecy of Amos, I still 
feel some sympathy for the plight of the “laymen” Israelites. Some of them 
could not read nor write. They could not go to the Word and reflect on the 
words the way we can. But then I remember that none of this would have 
happened if they had stayed committed to the ways of the Lord. The Lord 
provides for all states and conditions and makes sure His Word is sufficient 
for the day.
How far have we strayed, and what false faith have we built up that seeks to 

117

4.

offer substitutes for the real things of faith?  How does the Lord provide for 
people like the Israelites who could not read the Word for themselves?
I found the information about “wormwood” quite interesting and valuable. 
What about you? Are we still in subtle ways drinking hell’s artificially 
sweetened, but bitter and sorrowful, hoax? What are some ways to detect 
“wormwood” before we drink it?

5. Have you noticed the number of ads on television encouraging people to seek
the advice of “psychics”?  Is this harmful to those who use their counsel? 
What about the man who claims he can contact family members or friends in 
the spiritual world? He has a best-selling book telling about his most 
celebrated contacts. Someone said, “He has told me things that only I had 
knowledge about.” A great following of “readers” and clairvoyants seem to be 
pulling people away from “Seek Me and live.” What do you think about this?

AMOS 5:10-13

They hate the one who rebukes in the gate,
And they abhor the one who speaks uprightly.
Therefore, because you tread down the poor
And take grain taxes from him,
Though you have built houses of hewn stone,
Yet you shall not dwell in them;
You have planted pleasant vineyards,
But you shall not drink wine from them.
For I know your manifold transgressions
And your mighty sins:
Afflicting the just and taking bribes;
Diverting the poor from justice at the gate.
Therefore the prudent keep silent at that time,
For it is an evil time.

“...spiritual wealth, which is the knowledges of good and truth....when 
devastated one profits nothing and receives nothing, even though he listens

“Because ‘gates’ signify introductory truths, therefore it was among the 
statutes:- ‘That the elders should sit at the gates and judge’...” Amos 5:12 is 
one of the examples cited.

DERIVED DOCTRINE

“They hate the one who rebukes in the gate, and they abhor the one who speaks 
uprightly.”

 We can see from some of the above quotes that the “gate” and those who sat 
there were the elders of the city. By divine statutes, they were to be there for 
the people. They were to judge and lead the people according to the precepts 

119

of the Word.  But those who sought to deceive did all they could to discredit 
the truthful or faithful elders so their opinions would not interfere with their 
plans to cheat or defraud others.

 Apparently, it became difficult, and unpleasant, for the elders to speak from 

principle. Those in the city hated the “messengers” because a righteous elder 
made the thieves feel exposed or uncomfortable as they went about their 
nefarious business.

Treading Down the Poor and Taking Grain Taxes from Them

 There is an interesting quote in AR 489 that tells us that where the literal 
sense states there will be those who will seek to trample the holy city for 
forty-two months, it represents their attempt to “...disperse every truth of the 
Word, even so that nothing would remain.”
“...seeds, barley, wheat, and the like denote interior truths and goods...” (AC 
7112)



 The Concordance suggests that it is useful to use “tribute” when looking up 
the word “taxes.” A quote from AC 6659 seems to serve our present study 
well: “...princes of tributes...signifies falsities that would compel to serve....”
 Those who hated the elders at the gate wanted to “trample” every truth of the
Word so that nothing would remain, and they worked to destroy interior 
truths and goods so that they could “tax” or compel falsity to serve their 
interests and gain from the “poor” because of their ignorance of the Word.

Houses of “hewn stone”

 We need to note the difference between a “stone” and a “hewn stone.” A stone
that is “unhewn” represents the wholeness of the Lord’s truth. A “hewn” 
stone represents “...an intelligent person who falls into perversities, and calls 
or makes to be true things that are false...‘hewn stone’ denotes what is 
fabricated.” (AC 1296)
“If thou wilt make Me an altar of stone, thou shalt not build it of hewn stone; 
for if thou lift up thy tool upon it thou hast polluted it.” (Exodus 20:25)



 The Lord wanted them to see that they had built “houses” in their minds that 
seemed attractive and lofty but were actually misshapen distortions of their 
memory knowledges. In other words, they lived in mental houses where 
perversities fabricated lies and distortions.

“Yet you shall not dwell in them....”

 What they thought was so secure and stable would not last or survive in the 

presence of the Lord’s clear and eternal truth.

120

Planting Vineyards of Desire, But Not Drinking Wine from Them

 When Noah drank of the wine from his vineyard, we are taught that this 
represented “...he desired to investigate the things of faith, and this by 
reasonings....” (AC 1071)

 From this explanation, may we assume that the Lord was telling them that 
their desire to investigate the things of faith was from a “hellish” desire and 
that their reasoning therefore would never have them taste of the true 
wisdom of the Word?

Manifold transgressions; mighty sins; afflicting the just; taking bribes; diverting the 
poor from justice at the gate

 Transgressions are evils done against the truths of faith. See AC 9156.

Sin is different than evil. Evil is somewhat passive. It is a thought or a 
temptation. Sin is the giving in to that thought and a giving in to the 
temptation. When we sin, we make some evil our own. There is a wonderful 
passage in the Writings that presents a challenge to reflect on: “In order for 
anyone to know what evil is, and consequently what sin is, let him merely 
study to know what love of self and of the world is...” (AC 4997) Evil and sin 
bring about disjunction from the Lord and the heavens.

 A just person is one who lives according to divine laws. (AR 815) Those who 
sought to live according to divine laws were scorned and afflicted by those in 
power.

 Taking bribes: In AC 8711, we have an explanation of what is meant by those 
“...‘hating gain,’ as being aversion to persuasions from falsity and evil.... By 
‘gain’ in general is signified all the falsity from evil that perverts the 
judgments of the mind...and withdraws from truth and good....”  This is the 
case with those who have the world as their end.

 Diverting the poor from the gate: A gate is representative of the entrance into 
the mind. It also represents teachings or doctrines which introduce the truths
of faith. See AC 2943 and AC 3721 for more insights into the meaning of a 
gate.

 Essentially, those who were “poor” in matters of faith were being ignored and

purposely kept ignorant of the introductory ”riches” of the Word.

The Prudent Keeping Silent, the Evil Time.





“By means of His Divine providence the Lord leads the affections of a man’s 
life’s love, and at the same time leads his thoughts, from which human 
prudence is derived.” (DP 200)
It seems to make sense if the people were intent in shutting out the Word of 
the Lord that “prudence” would keep silent at that time. Human prudence 
would take over and try to present its ideas as more important and vital for 
life. Such a state of mind would make for “an evil time.”

121

PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER

1. The key to these verses seems to be the problem of self-intelligence. When it 
takes control of one’s mind, it does not wish to hear any of the judgments 
from the “elders” of the city gate. Instead, self-intelligence will make the 
spiritual principals unwelcome and hated. Self-intelligence will trample down
and discredit the spiritual laws, and will build up its own secular altar with 
“hewn stones” that fit its concepts and feel comfortable worshiping the love 
of self and the world. 

2. The Writings translate “pleasant vineyard” as “vineyard of desire.” Self-

intelligence is a vineyard of desire, and those who grow their grapes of desire
would become spiritually drunk with the intoxicating disorder that would 
destroy freedom and rationality. The Lord urges His children not to drink this
wine.

3. Another condition that hurts the spiritual potential is acceptance of bribes. 
Accepting a bribe is a release of internal restraints so as to be “bought off,” a 
willingness to pervert the judgment of the mind and to have the mind 
withdrawn from good and truth. When we allow this to happen, the “elders at
the gate” cannot lead us. Providence cannot lead our affections and thoughts. 
Prudence loses its willingness to follow the internal dictates of the Lord’s 
truth.

READ AND REVIEW

Read Amos 5:10-13.
Read the summary from P&P.

QUESTIONS TO STIMULATE REFLECTION

1. We learn from the three-fold Word. We have to read, reflect, and make 

applications. A good portion of this process uses the intelligence. How do we 
keep self-intelligence in a healthy state?

2. The human mind can arrange “selected” teachings from the Word in such a 
way as to prove whatever we want.  What can we do to prevent such a 
“hewing” of the stones so that we don’t fabricate falsity?
Is there a way that you keep the “poor” from coming to the gates of the city?  
Is there a way you keep the “poor” coming every day to the gates so that 
introductory truths refresh the heart, the mind, and the soul? Do you do this 
to yourself? To others?

3.

4. Have you ever felt this way? In matters of daily discrimination, you feel 

uncertain about your stance on current issues and hesitate to speak up. But 
as you read the Word, and see its internal sense, you feel more confident to 
express your insights on the things taught in the lesson.  Why do you think 
this happens?

122

5. How do you explain the difference between evil and sin? Does it make sense 
that we are not held accountable for the inherited tendencies toward evil, but
we are accountable for sins we confirm through our loves?

6. What do you think of the difference in translations regarding the vineyard? Is 
there a significant difference between “pleasant vineyards” and “vineyards of 
desire”?

AMOS 5:14-15

Seek good and not evil,
That you may live;
So the Lord God of hosts will be with you,
As you have spoken
Hate evil, love good;
Establish justice in the gate.
It may be that the Lord God of hosts
Will be gracious to the remnant of Joseph.

PASSAGES FROM THE WRITINGS

P&P



•

“...[an exhortation] that they should turn themselves, vers. 14, 15...”

AE 573[7 &8] 



“The tribes were called ‘hosts’ because the twelve tribes taken together 
represented all the truths and goods of the church, and each tribe some 
universal essential of the church.... From this it can be seen that the truths 
and goods of heaven and the church are meant in the Word by ‘hosts’...” Amos 
5:14 and 16 are cited in the numerous references in the Word.

AC 2943



“...in Amos...That a ‘gate’ also signifies the way of access to the rational mind, 
and that this mind is compared to a city...” Amos 5:15 is the cited passage. 
Also it is important to note that this number encourages us to read more 
about the ‘gates’ of a city in AC 2851.

DERIVED DOCTRINE

“Seek good and not evil...”



Seeking requires an effort to find something. The Lord identifies what that 
“something” is. He asks the Israelites to find “good.” Good has a whole host of 

123

meanings, and here are just a few: Love, Will, Affection, Esse, the First, the 
End, the Substance. In other words, the Lord was directing them to seek Him 
in the things of the affections. If His Love became important again, they would
have the “substance” out of which “form” (wisdom) might bring use back into 
their worship of the Lord.

“That you might live...”

 AC 39 has a wonderful way of describing whether a person is “alive” or 
“dead.” When the Lord is permitted to “illuminate” the internal man, the 
person is alive. When the person seeks to be resuscitated (regenerated), he or
she is living. When people imagine that they live from themselves, they are 
dead. The Lord calls all to live but not all choose to “live.”

“...the Lord God of hosts will be with you...”



In the simplest of terms, the Lord is promising the children of Israel that He 
will give them the “truths and goods of heaven and the church...” (AE 573[7])

“Hate evil, love good...”

 Abhor evil, and it loses its power. Evil cannot stand having its life rejected. 
Evil thrives when we give it recognition it does not deserve. Therefore, the 
Lord tells us to hate evil.

 We might find this teaching hard to share in our age. Hell has been working 
hard to color all of its disorders with respectability. Profanity is now called 
“adult language,” so children grow up thinking that when they reach 
adulthood, they should use profanity. Profanity is seen as a way to express 
emotions. Telling our age to hate profanity (and many other evils we could 
cite) would meet with some strong resistance.

 There seems to be a message here: When we hate evil, we then can come to 

the point where we love good.

“Establish justice in the gate.”

 The mind is a gate. “Something” sits at the gate. If the gate keeper is of the 
Lord’s appointment, we will call, or invite, into the mind the things of 
spiritual importance. If the gate keeper is of hell’s appointment, it will invite 
in the things of hell. The Lord calls for a gate keeper of justice. 

The “Lord God of hosts will be gracious to the remnant of Joseph.”



Joseph represents the Lord. He also represents “...the celestial of the spiritual 
from the natural....the celestial is good from the Divine, and the spiritual is 
truth from that good, and thus is the truth of the good from His Divine 

124

Human.” (AC 5307) Putting this more simply, we might say that the Lord was 
promising to return the Israelites to the “remnant” remains that would help 
them love the wisdom of the written Word so that they might regain the 
glimpse of the Divine Human they had lost. God for them had become 
“invisible,” and it was hard for them to love what they could not see or 
conceptualize. They had to come back to seeing God again. Isn’t this a 
powerful promise to reflect on?

 Don’t we, with the revelation of the Writings, have a wonderful way of seeing 
the Divine Human?  The Lord has truly been gracious to the remnant of 
Joseph.

PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER

1. When each of us enters into the World of Spirits, we will pass through three 
states if we have chosen Heaven within our hearts. In the first state, there is 
an unfolding of the externals so our internals will shine forth. In the case of 
those who have hardened themselves against the Lord, there is often a denial 
of what was loved. There is an attempt by some to complain that they did not 
have a fair chance to find heaven. They blame parents, poor educational 
opportunities, etc. The Lord shows them a summary of their life and calmly 
points out the numerous opportunities they had to choose heaven, but they 
refused to accept the opportunity. They again deny this was so. They see their
life again. This may go on for twenty or thirty years. Finally, they can’t deny it 
any longer, and they dive head-long into their hell.

2. As we read these verses, this insight from Heaven and Hell may add a sense of
the Lord’s patience with those who deny His merciful offers. “Seek good and 
not evil. That you may live.” The Lord offered them the chance to once again 
use the “host” of truths and goods of heaven and the church. The Writings in 
P&P plainly teach that the Lord exhorting them to turn themselves around.
3. This passage says to the Israelites, “Hate evil, love good, and put justice back 
at the entrance of your minds so love of the Word may manifest itself in the 
spiritual truths as presented in the literal sense.” The great “reward” was that 
they would “see” the Lord in the Divine Human. They would no longer have 
an invisible God in their concepts, but the remnant of Joseph would 
graciously turn them about.

READ AND REVIEW

Read the summary from P&P.

QUESTIONS TO STIMULATE REFLECTION

1. The stated goal of the New Church is that it will have a faith in the visible God 
within whom is the invisible. (TCR 339) “For what is invisible does not fall

invisible God.” (TCR 786) How are you doing with this important work of 
bringing the invisible into the visible?

2. Do we have a conscious sense of how often opportunities present themselves 
to help us “turn” ourselves? Or will we be like those who have to see the 
whole of our life played over and over before we admit the Lord tried often to
turn us? How can we become more alert to those opportunities when they 
occur?

3. Why does the Word “seem” to reverse the call to repentance?

“Seek good and not evil...  
Hate evil, love good...”      

4. Do you remember a course, a sermon, an article, or a book that helped you 

the most with the doctrine of the Divine Human? Would you be comfortable 
telling someone what the phrase seeing “the Lord in the Divine Human” 
means?

5. What question(s) came to you while you were reading these two verses?

AMOS 5:16-20

Therefore the Lord God of hosts, the Lord, says this:

There shall be wailing in all streets,
And they shall say in all the highways,
Alas! Alas!
They shall call the farmer to mourning,
And skillful lamenters to wailing.
In all vineyards there shall be wailing,
For I will pass through you,
Says the Lord.

Woe to you who desire the day of the Lord!
For what good is the day of the Lord to you?
It will be darkness, and not light.
It will be as though a man fled from a lion,
And a bear met him!
Or as though he went into the house,
Leaned his hand on the wall, 
And a serpent bit him!
Is not the day of the Lord darkness, and not light?
Is it not very dark, with no brightness in it?

“‘By ‘streets,’ in the Word, almost the same is signified as by ‘ways,’ because 
streets are ways in a city; but still by ‘streets’ are signified the truths or

examples cited is Amos 5:16.

AE 652[18]



“In Amos...‘Lamentations shall be in all the streets, and they shall say in the 
open places, Alas, alas!’ signifies grief because truth and good are everywhere
laid waste; ‘and they shall call the husbandman to mourning’ signifies the 
grief of the men of the church on this account, ‘husbandman’ signifying the 
man of the church, because a ‘field’ signifies the church in respect to the 
implantation of truth.”

AC 9139[5]



“In Amos:- ‘In all vineyards shall be wailing; I will pass through thee. Woe 
unto you that desire the day of Jehovah! What to you is the day of Jehovah? It 
is of darkness and not of light (v. 17, 18); this is said of the last time of the 
church, when there is no longer any good and truth of faith, which time is ‘the
day of Jehovah, a day of darkness and not of light;’ whence it is said, ‘in all

and by ‘a bear’ are signified fallacies, which also destroy, but not in so great a 
degree....” Amos 5:18, 19 are cited.



“‘The day of Jehovah’ means the coming of the Lord, who is the Messiah 
whom they expected; and as they believed that He would deliver them from 
the enemies of the land, and would exalt them in glory above all the nations, 
they desired Him. But as the Lord came into the world not for the sake of any 
kingdom on earth but for the sake of a kingdom in heaven, and as the Jewish 
nation was in the falsities of evil, and these were at that time manifested, it is 
said, ‘Woe unto you, that desire the day of Jehovah. What to you is the day of 
Jehovah? It is a day of darkness and not of light,’ ‘darkness and not light’ 
meaning the falsities in which they were; ‘as one who fleeth from a lion 
meeteth a bear’ signifies fear because of the domination of falsity when 
truths are sought from the sense of the letter of the Word, which they cannot 
but falsify; for one is said ‘to flee from a lion and to meet a bear’ when he is 
interiorly in falsity from evil, and is led to investigate truths from the sense of 
the letter of the Word, which he then, because of the interior domination of 
falsity from evil, cannot but pervert; ‘who cometh to a house and leaneth with
his hand upon a wall and a serpent biteth him’ signifies that when such a man
in seeking goods consults the Word in the sense of the letter he does not see 
that evils pervert it; ‘the bite of a serpent’ signifying falsification, here the 
falsification that arises from the interior domination of falsity from evil.”  
Amos 5:18, 19 are cited.

“...thus ‘to be darkened’ is to be in falsity; and as the devastation of those who 
have been of the church and have known truths, but have lived a life of evil, is

truth was.” Amos 5:18-20 is one of the examples cited to illustrate this 
teaching.

AR 413



“...by ‘being darkened’ is signified not to be seen or known by reason of evils 
from falsities and falsities from evils. Evils from falsities are with those who 
assume the falsities of religion, and confirm them till they appear as truths, 
and when they live according to them they do evils from falsities, or the evils 
of falsity. But those have falsities from evils, who do not regard evils as sins; 
and still more those who, by reasonings from the natural man, and more still 

128

from the Word, confirm with themselves that evils are not sins.” Amos 5:18, 
20 are among the passages from the Word cited.

judge a church because there is no longer “any good of love or truth of faith, 
but the evil of falsity and the falsity of evil, that day is called ‘a day of 
darkness and of thick darkness.’”

DERIVED DOCTRINE

We are given such a full and complete explanation that there seems to be no need to 
offer additional references. However, if you think of some references that might add 
to the study, it would be appreciated if you would add them during the discussion 
period.

PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER

Before making a summary, let’s look at key words that lead us to a summary:

1. The domination of falsity: The Israelites were interiorly in falsity from evil. 

The interior domination of falsity from evil cannot but pervert.

2. The streets and highways wailing is representative of the devastation of good 

and truth. Where once there had been truth, there was now falsity.

3. Where there had been hope and longing for the Messiah, they were now told 

their reasons for hope and longing where all wrong.

Any summary we make cannot match what we have in AE 781[16] and AR 413. We 
are taught that Israel did not have a clue about what the Lord was going to do for the
world and to eternity. They focused on belief in falsified traditional thinking that 
they were the Lord’s “chosen” people. They wanted Him to come so that they would 
be the “greatest” among all nations.

How do you tell a nation they are wrong? The wonderful story about the lion, the 
bear, and the serpent illustrates the hopeless efforts of their traditional expectations 
of the Lord. Instead of having “light,” they had “darkness.” AR 413 explains how 
“darkness” entered their minds: “...by reasonings from the natural man, and more 
still from the Word, (they) confirm with themselves that evils are not sins.”

The “serpent” biting their hand is such a graphic description of sensual reasoning 
overcoming the power of the natural man’s ability to perform the ultimate uses so 

129

necessary in the life of worship to the Lord and love of the neighbor. Uses were 
turned to self-interests.

QUESTIONS TO STIMULATE REFLECTION

1. With so much given to us from the Writings about these verses, did you find it
easier to anticipate the summary of them? What skills do you learn from 
studying the Word regularly?

2. Past and present political indiscretions have produced a need for the White 
House advisors to hire people who are gifted as “spin masters.” What this 
means is that these people are to work on “spinning” a positive interpretation
on any news that would appear harmful to the president of the United States 
or any other important senator or congressperson. Does hell have a gifted 
crew of “spin masters” employed in its effort to dominate interior reasonings 
that bring about darkness? What are some of their techniques?  How can we 
spot them and see through them?
Israel longed for the coming of the Lord. He told them they didn’t really want 
Him to come. He told them that when He walked among them, there would be
great wailing and their streets and cities, vineyards and husbandmen would 
wail, crying out “Alas, alas.”

3.

4. As New Church men and women, what do we think about when we reflect on 
this prophecy? Do we make assumptions like those the Israelites made? Have 
we built a system of traditional beliefs that are blinding us to the Lord’s 
truth? Do we put too much emphasis on traditional forms of worship?  How 
do we distinguish tradition from theology?

5. How much time do we spend studying the three-fold Word?  What happens 
when we study regularly?  When we don’t? Are we fleeing from the lion to 
encounter the bear? When at home, are we allowing our hands to be bitten by
the serpent? Can we reflect on this question with a determination that some 
positive alternatives will come forward?

AMOS 5:21-22

I hate, I despise your feast days,
And I do not savor your sacred assemblies.
Though you offer Me burnt offerings and your grain offerings, 
I will not accept them,
Nor will I regard your fattened peace offerings.

“...it is evident that burnt-offerings and sacrifices were nothing else than 
representatives of internal worship; and that when they (internal and 
external sacrifices) were separated from internal worship they became 
idolatrous. This anyone of sound reason may see. For what is an altar but 
something of stone, and what is burnt-offering and sacrifice but the slaying of
a beast? If there be Divine worship, it must represent something heavenly 
which they know and acknowledge, and from which they worship Him whom
they represent...It is by internal things, namely, charity and the faith 
therefrom, that He who is represented is to be seen and acknowledged and 
believed, as is clearly evident in the prophets....” Amos 5:22, 24 are verses 
used to illustrate the above.

DERIVED DOCTRINE

“...when we read in the Word concerning Jehovah or the Lord ‘hating’...in the 
internal sense (it) is not ‘hatred,’ but mercy, for the Divine is mercy; but when
this (mercy) flows in with a man who is in evil...it then appears as hatred.... 
Above all other peoples the Jewish and Israelitish people were such that as 
soon as they observed anything unfriendly, even in associates, they believed it
lawful to treat them cruelly, and not only to kill them, but also to expose them
to wild beasts...and therefore...they could not believe otherwise than that 
Jehovah also entertained hatred, was angry, wrathful, and furious, and for this
reason it is so expressed in the Word according to the appearance; for such as
is a man’s quality, such the Lord appears to him....” (AC 3605)

Burnt-Offerings and Sacrifices of Every Kind



“The burnt-offerings and sacrifices in the Jewish Church represented nothing 
else than the celestial things of the Lord’s kingdom in the heavens, and of the 
Lord’s kingdom on earth (that is, in the church), also of the Lord’s kingdom or
church with each person, and in general all things which are of love and 
charity, for these are things celestial; and each kind of sacrifice represented 
something special and particular.”  (AC 2165[3])

 The laws for burnt-offerings may be found in Leviticus 1.
 The laws for bread-offerings may be found in Leviticus 2.
 The laws for sin-offerings may be found in Leviticus 4:1-35.
 The laws for offerings for defilement may be found in Leviticus 5:1-13.
 The laws for trespass-offerings may be found in Leviticus 5:14-19 and 6:1-7.
 The laws for peace-offerings may be found in Leviticus 3 and 7:28-34.
 The meanings of many of these sacrifices are covered extensively in the 

Arcana. The teachings are so extensive it would be impossible to quote all of 
them. For those who wish to pursue the quotes, turn to AC 2176-2185 for the 
meaning or use of each offering.

“I will not accept them, nor will I regard your fatted peace offerings.”

 Why wouldn’t the Lord accept their offerings? Was He interested in 

something deeper than the smell of burnt offerings and showy celebrations? 
The power of the literal sense is very clear with an answer in Micah 6:6-8:

o “Wherewith shall I come before the Lord, and bow myself before the 

high God? Shall I come before Him with burnt offerings, with calves of 
a year old? Will the Lord be pleased with thousands of rams, or with 
ten thousands of rivers of oil? Shall I give my first born for my 
transgression, the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul? He hath 
shewed thee, O man, what is good; and what doeth the Lord require of 
thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy 
God?”

PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER

1. The children of Israel were making noise and sacrifice that was empty. Their 
hearts were not intent on repentance and change. They thought they were 
“buying” the Lord’s favor. In effect, they were saying, “Look at what we are 
doing. See how special our assemblies are. Look at the cost of what we offer. 
Be pleased with us, give us more stature with other nations, and increase our 
possessions.”

2. The Lord wanted nothing to do with these offerings. He wanted clean hearts 
and minds. He wanted charity and faith to increase. He wanted them to walk 
humbly with Him, shunning evils as sins.

132

3. When Israel sensed His displeasure with their offerings, they thought He 
hated and despised them. The message could have brought them to their 
knees beseeching help, asking for forgiveness, but it did not motivate them to 
do so.

QUESTIONS TO STIMULATE REFLECTION

1. “What is an altar but something of stone, and what is a burnt-offering but the 
slaying of a beast?” As a child, growing up in a non-New-Church environment,
I wondered at the requirement to offer up sacrifices. It seemed somewhat 
cruel and barbaric. I even wondered at Abraham’s willingness to offer up 
Isaac. I remember my teachers telling me it was a test of one’s faith. God 
needs to test our mettle. He needs to see whether we can endure the tests of 
faith. Does God really not know me? Is it somewhat questionable to Him what
I will do under certain stresses? I never liked the explanations of sacrifices. 
Thankfully, I can now read what the Writings teach regarding this subject.
What were some of your earliest questions or doubts when you heard or hear
of sacrifices?

2. “...for such as is a person’s quality, such the Lord appears to them....”  Looking 
at the history of religious faith, the Lord has been represented as a cruel, 
demanding taskmaster. He has been presented as the “absentee Creator.” The 
Lord is seen as one who became so angry with the world that He demanded 
payment for the sins of all peoples.
The teaching in AC 3605 clearly indicates that we project on to the Lord what 
is in our own hearts. How can we work on improving our perceptions of the 
Lord? How can we project a more representative image of His mercy to 
ourselves and others? 

3. “What shall I render to the Lord?” What kind of worship is acceptable to the 

Lord? These verses told Israel, “Your worship cannot be acceptable.”

AMOS 5:23-25

Take away from Me the noise of your songs,
For I will not hear the melody of your stringed instruments.
But let justice run down like water,
And righteousness like a mighty stream. 
Did you offer Me sacrifices and offerings
In the wilderness forty years, O house of Israel?

Noise

 Noise may have several meanings: “...tumult, or disturbance, and also on the 

occasion of any happy event....it [also] denotes accusation.” (AC 375)

Singing



“...in the Ancient Church and afterward in the Jewish Church the songs were 
prophetic and treated of the Lord, especially that He would come into the 
world, and would overthrow the diabolical crew...and would liberate the 
faithful from their assaults....the songs contained such things...[that] signified 
a glorification of the Lord, that is, a celebration of Him from gladness of 
heart....” (AC 8261[2])

Stringed Instruments



“In general, by wind instruments were expressed affections of good, and by 
stringed instruments affections of truth...” (AC 8337[2])

Forty Years in the Wilderness





“...‘forty’ denotes the duration of vastation and desolation; and in the internal 
sense forty years are not meant, but only, in general, the desolation of faith...”
See AC 730[2&4].

PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER

1. We can probably get a mental picture of what is being represented here if we 
can recall a chapel service with a piano playing a hymn.  Two hundred or 
more were standing, out of custom, with hands in their pockets. Hymnals 
were not open, and certain in attendance were not singing from the heart. 
With glazed eyes, they stood waiting for the song to finish so they might sit 
and comfortably go to sleep.
Israel lost the “joy” of singing about the coming of the Lord. They did not feel 
the joy of the Lord rescuing them from their spiritual enemies. There was no 
glorification of the Lord and no celebration within their hearts.
Instead of a melody, that had harmony to it, there was a “noise” of tumult and 

135

disturbance within their minds. The Lord had to let them know there was no 
excitement in their voices.
The Lord offered them a “new song” the words of which encouraged them to 
let justice and righteousness flow like water and a mighty stream. He wanted 
them to pursue good and truth that would renew their lives with works of 
charity and a derivative faith.

2. The closing question asked them if sacrifices were necessary when they were 
in the wilderness for forty years. No! The Lord led them and provided those 
things that helped sustain them through those periods of vastation and 
desolation. Why would they think that offering sacrifices would be necessary 
to “win” His favor now? The Lord cannot be bribed with the offerings of tired 
and meaningless acts of worship.

QUESTIONS TO STIMULATE REFLECTION

1. Music can touch the depths of our souls. Certain songs bring back memories 
of wonderful experiences we had with a friend or friends. But not if the tune 
is a song of one note. Some of us get so tied up with the sameness of religion 
that our melodies probably lack the chords and parts that blend and enliven 
the song of our hearts. What is your impression of this idea? Can we allow the
Lord to teach us “a new song”? How?
Justice and righteousness running like water and a mighty stream are 
illustrative of a land where the running water gives life to an abundance of 
things. The plant life is lush and hearty, and it draws from rippling pools that 
are not stagnant.

2.

The Lord is challenging us to put our principles of faith into practice. Don’t let them 
gather in the memory like stagnating facts. Let good and truth flow like a mighty 
stream.

How can we do these things? What does it take to put the things the Lord wants 
from us into action? Do we need to rethink and sing enthusiastically about the Lord’s
Second Coming? Do we need to talk more about His liberation work? Can we show 
others by our actions that we are free of the curse of hell? What will keep us from 
having to hear the Lord say, “Take away from Me the noise of your songs....”?

I think this is a wonderful challenge presented to us. Talk about ways that 
individuals and organizations can accept and meet this challenge.

AMOS 5:26-27

You also carried Sikkuth your king

vers. 26, 27.”

AC 1715



“The farthest boundary of the land of Canaan, beyond Dan, is described as 
being Damascus, as in Amos...(Amos v. 26, 27).”

DERIVED DOCTRINE

Sikkuth and Chiun



Is it Sikkuth or Sakkuth or Moloch? Is it Chiun or Kaiwan or Rephan? The 
Writings have no references or representations that I can find for these two 
pagan deities. They were Assyrian deities.  Acts 7:42-43 quotes the prophecy 
of Amos but uses the names of Moloch and Rephan in the place of Sikkuth 
and Chiun. The Interpreter’s Dictionary of the Bible says that Moloch had a 
title: “the king.” That seems to fit in with the text when Amos accuses the 
Israelites of carrying Sikkuth (Sakkuth) “your king.”

 Rephan or Kaiwan was worshiped by the Assyrians as an astral deity, and it is
the Babylonian name for Saturn. This also seems to fit in with the prophecy of
Amos when he told the Israelites they had an idol that was “the star of [their] 
gods.”

The Idols that They Made for Themselves



In this charge, it is clear that idols are the works of their own hands and are 
powerless creatures that should not be in the house of the Lord. It is a 
reference to the futility of pagan worship.

137

Going into Captivity beyond Damascus



Is this like the idea the world had prior to Columbus sailing to the new 
world? Did the Israelites think that there was little or nothing beyond 
Damascus? 

 Damascus, the oldest city in the world, a city that once had the remains of the 
Ancient Church, represented in the positive sense the knowledges of good 
and truth. (AC 1715)

 Was the Lord telling the Israelites that they were about to lose all knowledge 
of good and truth? Was He telling them that their worship of other gods was 
taking them to a dangerous unknown point where they would be deprived of 
the holy representatives given to the church?

PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER

 That is what we did above. With only two short references, we had little 

doctrine to follow. Therefore, I feel all of the above will serve us as an “open 
summary” with the Lord leading us to any tentative conclusions.

DERIVED DOCTRINE

Ease

 Regarding those who are “at ease,” the Swedenborg Concordance directs our 

attention to the word “secure” instead of the word “ease.”

 The wrong kind of security will let a person acquiesce to evils and falsities. 

See AC 2220[3].

139

 DP 340[4] warns that the person who reasons that the Lord’s mercy will save
all people so therefore it doesn’t matter what kind of life one leads “...such a 
security makes nothing of adultery, frauds, injustice, violence, defamation, 
and revenge...he lets his spirit run riot in them all...”

 AE 706[7] cites a conversation the Lord had with the Pharisees and Scribes 
about what signs they were to look for. They were not really interested in 
signs but were tempting or mocking the Lord with their questions. They were
so at “ease” with their security that they lacked the spiritual quest that would
have shown them the signs of truth. The AE 706[7] quote ends with these 
words: “...they had no knowledge of the Lord, and lived securely in falsities 
from evil...”

 Could these passages help us see what is meant by “Woe to you who are at 

ease...”

Ease in Zion

 Zion in its positive correspondence represents “...the church as to love.” (AR 

612) Used in the opposite sense, it would appear that the Lord was telling the
Israelites that they were careless with their love toward Him.

Trusting “...in Mount Samaria...”

 AC 10050[2] tells us “...by ‘them that dwell in Samaria’, are those who are in 

external worship...”

 A mountain usually represents the extension of worship from either love of 
the Lord or a love from self. It seems reasonable to assume that this passage 
is speaking of the extension of external worship from the love of self. They 
were very much into the worship of the Lord for what it would do for them.

“Notable persons in the chief nation, to whom the house of Israel comes!”

 This quote seems to carry a warning instead of a compliment. Excellence, 

eminence, dignity, and sovereignty are terms that, when involving the Lord or
a representative of the Lord, are spoken of with the word “glory.” Truth of 
faith and the good of charity are the uses the Lord allows to flow through His 
representative “notable persons.” (See AC 6345). But this verse gives no hint 
of genuine dignity or notableness. It sounds like they were in love with the 
human prudence offered from those not seeking to impart wisdom from the 
Lord.

 “Go over to Calneh and see...”

 This directive to look at Calneh had as its end a lesson about the 

consequences of external and profane worship. Would the Israelites look at 
the tragic results of Calneh so they might amend their worship of the Lord? 

140

Or would they rest in their belief that they were a chosen people and 
therefore continue on in their false sense of “ease” or security?
 Nimrod, as a descendent of Ham,” was mighty “in hunting before 

Jehovah....And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel and Erech, and Accad 
and Calneh, in the land of Shinar.” (Genesis 10:9-10)  These cities, in the land 
of Shinar, were in external worship where all holy things were profaned. See 
AC 1183.

“And from there go to Hamath the great...”

 AC 1205 describes “Hamathite” as one of many nations representative of 
those who “...are entirely unwilling to know internal things, and when 
instructed reject them, are very prone to all...idolatries...whose interiors are 
unclean (who will) rush into interior idolatries...”

 “Then go down to Gath of the Philistines.”

 Those who pervert the truths of the Word are seen as having “streets” that 

are filled with offensive and disgusting refuse. Evil reigns in the street, and to 
represent this, the streets appear “...full of dung, mire and clay.” In II Samuel 
1:20, Israel was told, “Tell it not in Gath, publish it not in the streets of 
Ashkelon, lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice.”

 “Are you better than these kingdoms?”

 What a powerful question! The sadness of this is that Israel probably 

responded, “Yes, we are.” They had no sense of how full of spiritual decay 
they were. They probably saw no validity in the contrast of the nations of 
heathens with themselves.

 “Is their territory greater than your territory?”

 We have no direct teaching on the word “territory,” but what might this 

question mean if it were phrased this way: “Are you any better off than those 
who openly reject the Lord? Are you enlarging or expanding the borders of 
your mind into new territories of the Lord’s truth?”

PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER

1. This chapter offers us a valuable consideration of contrasts. The contrast is 
not to make us feel proud or special. Instead, it is offered to see if we are 
making the progress necessary to increase the “borders” of knowledge. Are 
we, as readers of the three-fold Word, clearing away the falsities of the other 
nations? Are we intellectually and affectionately open to the things of internal
worship, or are we worse than the religious systems of the “other nations”?

141

2. The streets of the New Jerusalem, as shown in Revelation 21:21, are to be like

“...pure gold, as it were transparent glass.” Gold, when refined, is free of 
impurities and represents the pure love we are to give to the Lord. Revelation
describes gold that is like transparent glass. Our worship is to be open and 
free of any blockage or hidden agendas.

3. These questions need not be ominous. Instead, they are liberating and 

challenging to improve whatever we do in our worship of the Lord. Falling 
into a lazy form of ease or security is not in our best interest for spiritual 
health. Expanding, growing, forging ahead into the wonders of spiritual 
territory is our challenge.

QUESTIONS TO STIMULATE REFLECTION

1. When you reviewed these verses, were you able to see the progression of the 

prophecy regarding the demise of worship?

2. We all like what is comfortable, familiar, and non-threatening. We must be 

aware of dull routines. On the other hand, changing for the sake of changing 
doesn’t ensure success, so what is the best way to invite the Lord’s sphere 
into our lives?

3. Self-intelligence “hatching out” doctrines: does this sound like anything we 

ought to participate in? In other references, the Writings warn about 
“innovators” who seek to impose their ideas and doctrines on the church. 
Where is that fine line between being creative and spontaneous, and 
becoming “hatchers” or “innovators”?
This reminds me of a classic argument that took place in the organized 
church when a debate raged on about “doctrinalists and personalists.” Those 
who rigidly followed doctrine were seen as unfeeling and “uptight” 
individuals who were short on emotional responses. The personalists saw 
themselves as free and caring individuals who were ready and willing to take 
“risks” to explore new forms of worship. Bitter feelings and words were 
exchanged between them. We still see some of this suspicion in the church. 
How do we resolve this and keep self-intelligence out of the process?  

AMOS 6:3-6

Woe to you who put far off the day of doom,
Who cause the seat of violence to come near;
Who lie on beds of ivory,
Stretch out on your couches,

142

Eat lambs from the flock
And calves from the midst of the stall;
Who sing idly to the sound of stringed instruments,
And invent for yourselves musical instruments like David;
Who drink wine from bowls, 
And anoint yourselves with the best ointments,
But are not grieved for the affliction of Joseph.

instruments of music like David, etc.] treats of those who counterfeit good

externals is signified by ‘playing upon the psaltery, devising for themselves 
instruments of music, and anointing themselves with the firstfruits of the 

144

oils;’ to bring forth many things from the Word for the sake of appearances is 
signified by ‘drinking out of bowls of wine;’ that they have no regard for the 
truths of doctrine of the church, even though the church should perish by 
falsities, is signified by ‘they are not grieved over the breach of Joseph,’ 
‘Joseph’ meaning the spiritual church, which is with those who are in the 
truths of doctrine.”

DERIVED DOCTRINE

Day of Doom

 What is meant by putting off the “day of doom?” In the positive sense, “day” 
means the Advent of the Lord. In the context of these passages, where the 
children of Israel had little regard for the perishing of the church and their 
counterfeiting truth, the advent of the Lord would appear to them as a day of 
doom. See Doctrine of the Lord 5 for references to the many meanings of the 
word “day.”

Seat of Violence

 Causing the “seat of violence” to come near has many interesting possible 
meanings. A seat represents things in the natural which receive the goods 
and truths “inflowing from the internal.”  See AC 6675.

 Coupling this with “the seat of violence,” we get a picture of “those who 
destroy the truths of faith and the goods of charity.” (AC 6353[8]) The 
attitude of indifference was the seat of violence that worked systematically to
prevent the inflowing of anything good from the Lord.

“Singing idly to the sound of stringed instruments”





Singing is a way of glorifying the Lord for His wonderful liberation. See AC 
8261. Here, we get a picture of the children of Israel “idly” or mindlessly 
singing or mouthing the words, but their hearts were not filled with a joyful 
melody of gratitude.
Stringed instruments represent the exciting of the affections by truth. See AC 
8337[2] for a fuller explanation. But the nexus of this verse is that the 
Israelites were void of any real excitement about what the Lord was doing for
them.

PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER

1. With so much information given to us that we can see clearly what the Lord 
was saying to the children of Israel. He told them they had an abundance of 
all things of the church. He told them that they were counterfeiting the truths 
of the church. Cleverly, they were applying the literal sense of the Word so 

145

that it would appear to justify their ends. By doing this they were offering a 
“seat of violence” to all incoming truths. Before truth had a chance to take 
hold, grow up, and cause a change in their lives, they killed the messengers of 
spiritual hope.

2. Their beds of ivory were well-polished forms of reasoning that lulled their 

minds to sleep. They appropriated for themselves the things of innocence and
ruined their quality in both the internals and externals. They took the best of 
the “first” oils for themselves, ignoring the need to offer them up first to the 
Lord.

3. Therefore, the Israelites were ignoring the day of doom. They did not seek the

Advent of the Lord into their hearts and mind.
As a result, they didn’t see or care that the spiritual church was dying in their 
hearts and minds. Even sadder is the fact that they had plenty of spiritual 
resources to use, but they chose to ignore them. To use an analogy, they were 
starving in the midst of plenty.

QUESTIONS TO STIMULATE REFLECTION

1. We could use many issues for our discussion. What specific applications to 

today’s issues could we place in our text to examine? Are there any 
indications of the “day of doom” being put off? Remember, this day of doom is
to be a happy advent, but to the mind occupied with self, it seems like doom.
2. The beds of ivory make for an interesting thought. They refer to well-polished
forms of reasoning that lull the mind to sleep. Can you think of examples in 
our world?

3. The seat of violence is something to ponder, too. How effective were the 

Israelites at blocking the entrance so that they stopped the in-flowing from 
the internal (soul)?

4. The “singing idly” is a wonderful point to ponder. Do we sing (talk) enough 

about the liberating power of the Lord from the forces of hell? Do we instead 
seem to be more prone to sing about “poor me, look at how sad my life is!”?

5. How can we help our children feel excitement for the Lord and His New 
Church? Historical faith can carry them just so far, and then they have to 
move on to a genuine experience of their own. Explanations are good, but 
discovery seems best and the most lasting. Do we have discovery in our 
educational techniques?  What are some ways we can help our children find 
the Lord?

And those who recline at banquets shall be removed.

And hate his palaces;
Therefore I will deliver up the city
And all that is in it.

are called ‘palaces’ because they belong to the proud, and because the 
falsities of such are embellished in external form so as to appear magnificent, 
although they are most vile, like huts full of rubbish and filth; ‘to shut up the 
city and the fullness thereof’ signifies to condemn the doctrine, because it is 
full of the falsities of evil, and is possessed by them, ‘city’ meaning doctrine, 
and ‘fullness’ the falsities of evil; therefore ‘if there remain ten men in one 
house they shall die’ signifies that all the truths of good with every one shall 
perish, ‘ten men’ meaning all truths, ‘house’ man in respect to good, and ‘to 
die’ to perish.” 

DERIVED DOCTRINE

Going as the First of the Captives



I’m not sure of the meaning of this verse. However, there are some interesting
possibilities. AE 811[27] says that those who bar others from truth and good 
will themselves be captive to falsities. Might we assume that this verse is 
telling us that those who are most guilty of perverting truth and good will be 
the first to be captives? 

 Could this be a reference to love, that it is first in end and first to go captive?

Reclining at Banquets



“... by banquets and feasts is signified conjunction, specifically initiation to 
conjunction....” (AC 5698)

 Reclining, the Concordance tells us, means to “press” or to “encumber” or to 
be “weighed down.” Probably, this represents those who seek to make the 
“initiation or conjunction” of spiritual food seem impractical or lacking in 
nourishment. Those who would “press” truth would direct others away from 
the Word to things that seem more interesting than doctrine, saying that it is 
impossible to fulfill the commandments of the Lord. The Lord, they say, is a 
“hard taskmaster.”

148

PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER

1. The Lord “swears” that if we break our covenant with Him, we will become 
captives. Hell will carry us away on its torrent of falsity. Hell will press us 
down with a long list of excuses why we do not read the Word and apply its 
teachings to our lives. They will press us to put off what is essential for our 
souls. Excuses will spill forth about the “style” of the Word. We will be 
pressed with doubts about correspondences, significatives, and 
representations.

2. Once evil rationalizations possess the mind, they will build “magnificent” 

palace walls to hide their true selves. The walls cover up the vile scenes and 
are “like huts full of rubbish and filth.” Remains gathered will “die” off, and as 
AC 576[2] tells us, “very little would be left being only... remains of remains.”

READ AND REVIEW

QUESTIONS TO STIMULATE REFLECTION

1. How many covenants do we have with the Lord? Was our baptism a 

covenant? Is Holy Supper a covenant? Is a marriage a covenant? How about 
the rite of confirmation?

2. Are there specific things we can do to cooperate with the Lord to keep 

remains alive and well? Admittedly only the Lord knows where remains are 
stored, but we can tune them out.

3. The walls of Jacob, instead of being protective from evil, seem to be set up to 
perpetuate a hoax that we are spiritual. How do we overcome the pretense so
that we can be open to the Lord and get rid of the trash in our lives?  How 
might the pretense of spirituality bar us from achieving actual spiritual life?

4. What did you think about the meaning of “reclining” being more like 

“pressed” or “encumbered?”

5. The Lord tells us that His burden is light, but we tend to think of it as heavy 

or difficult. Why? How can we come to see His way as easy or light?

AMOS 6:10-12

And when a relative of the dead, with one who will burn the bodies, picks up the bodies 
to take them out of the house, he will say to the one inside the house, “Are there any 
more with you?” Then someone will say, “None.” And he will say, “Hold your tongue! 
For we dare not mention the name of the Lord.”

149

For behold, the Lord gives a command:
He will break the great house into bits,
And the little house into pieces.

Do horses run on rocks?
Does one plow there with oxen? 
Yet you have turned justice into gall,
And the fruit of righteousness into wormwood.

“...insomuch that nothing (of the spiritual church) will remain, vers. 10-12...”

 Houses are compared, or likened, to “memory-knowledges that are collected.”
When collected in the mind, it is like that which “frames the external man,

to “break the great house into bits.”

AE 519[6]



“In Amos...(vi. 11, 12)...‘Jehovah will smite the great house with gaps, and the 
little house with clefts,’ signifies much perversion and falsification of truth

learned man, and a ‘little house’ an unlearned man; ‘gaps’ signify truths 
destroyed by falsities, and ‘clefts’ the same, but in a less degree...”

AC 5895[4]



“In Amos...(vi. 12) ‘shall horses run on the rocks?’ denotes shall the truth of 
faith be understood? For ‘rock’ in the spiritual sense is faith....and ‘horses’ are 
those things which are of the understanding....‘will one plow with an oxen?’ 
denotes shall he do good? ‘Oxen’ being good in the natural.... That this could 
not be done is signified by the words which follow: ‘because ye have turned

 This number contains a rather long description of the meaning of the 

expressions “righteousness” and “judgment.” Quoting all of these references 
would take up quite a bit of the paper, and listing the references from the 
Word would be quite extensive. I therefore leave that for you to follow up on 
as needed.

“‘Wormwood’ signifies infernal falsity, from its intense bitterness, whereby it 
renders food and drink abominable....” Amos 5:7 and 6:12 are cited. We 
covered “wormwood” in our study of Amos 5:4-9. Go back and review that 
section if you have forgotten it.

AR 668

 AR 668 cites the signification of “judgment” and “justice.” Judgment is of 

Divine truth, and justice is of Divine good. Amos 5:24 is cited.

TCR 51

 TCR 51 says that “...in the Word justice [or righteousness] is predicated of 
love, and judgment of wisdom...it is by means of these two that God’s 
government is carried on in the world...” Amos 6:12 is cited.

AE 355[34]



 “In Amos...(vi. 12)...‘Shall horses run upon the rock?’ signifies, is there any 
understanding of truth? ‘Shall any one plough with oxen?’ signifies, is there 
any perception of good? This is plainly the meaning, for it follows, ‘for ye have
turned judgment into gall, and the fruit of justice into wormwood;’ ‘to turn 
judgment into gall,’ signifies to turn truth into falsity, and ‘to turn the fruit of 
justice into wormwood,’ signifies to turn good into evil.” 

151

DERIVED DOCTRINE

Gall



In the Interpreter’s Dictionary of the Bible, we are told that gall is a poisonous 
juice extracted from the herb “Conium maculatum,” and that in the Word, it is 
often mentioned with “wormwood.” Gall is a poison, and wormwood causes 
one to lose a sense of what is right or wrong.

Relative, Family

 Looking up the word “relative” is not helpful at this juncture. “Family” 

member is somewhat more helpful. Turning to the Arcana, we read that in 
the process of regeneration, all the goods and truths, or things of charity and 
faith, are brought together by the Lord and are represented by families. (AC 
917) Therefore, could this reference in Amos 6:10 of the relative of the dead 
be a powerful contrast of the total burn-out of the soul to the celebration of 
the newness of life that should have occurred? 

Burning the Bodies

 The burning of the bodies I think represents the destructiveness of self love. 

AE 1173 describes the grief of the mind when it sees the “burning” or 
“punishment on account of the direful falsities that flowed from their loves.” 
It is self-love that consumes and destroys the very essence of its victim, not 
the Lord.

The Dead

 The question posed to them was, “Are there any more [dead] with you?” 

Taking stock, counting the losses, does not escape the Lord’s attention. He 
knows the extent of our deadness, but do we?

“Hold your tongue! For we dare not mention the name of the Lord.”

 What could this mean? I think it ties into the bold answer the Israelites gave, 
saying that there were no other dead within the house. Maybe they hadn’t 
looked carefully, and maybe there was a bit of rebellion there. Evil cannot 
mention the Lord’s name. The mere mention of His holy name would put 
them to flight. In other words, the “relative” of all that was good in them 
recognized that evil should not speak idly in the Lord’s presence. “Hold your 
tongue” could mean, “Be careful what you say, for we are in the presence of 
the Lord.”

152

PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER

1. As in so many stories in the literal sense, it appears in these verses as if the 

Lord is angry or “fed-up” with the decisions of His people. The Lord breaking 
up great and little houses into bits and pieces seems harsh and a “rush to 
judgment” until we are given the internal meaning of the text. The Lord is 
lovingly righteous, and His judgment is full of mercy. Love and wisdom are 
the means by which “...God’s government is carried on in the world.” (TCR 51)
There cannot be a variance from His laws of Providence. So the great and the 
small will have their houses brought before His Divine “fairness.” Will they 
stand?

2. Their “houses” of memory-knowledges had been framed up with such gaps 
and flimsy falsities that the great and small houses just couldn’t stand. The 
foundation pieces were not solidly anchored. The Lord’s truth placed along 
side of these distorted frameworks just knocked their props out. Can we 
picture our experience in the world of spirits when our “book of life” is 
opened? Might there be some structures we built falling apart? Yet, we 
thought the world of those “great houses.”

3. Turning the Lord’s things into gall and wormwood is a serious blunder by 
those who turn against the Lord. They must stop offering poisonous and 
delusional drinks offered to themselves and others. Only the Lord can call out
the dead, and only the Lord can give us the perception of good and 
intelligence. Otherwise, we try the silly acts of horses or oxen ploughing 
rocks: futile work with no returns.

QUESTIONS TO STIMULATE REFLECTION

1. Have you ever seen a “house” you thought would last forever only to see that 
it had to be torn down and built again? It would seem that this is par for us as
humans. The problem comes when we become defensive and deny the 
building is in danger or we become lazy and fail to apply ourselves to the 
rebuilding efforts. What is your experience with this?

2. Have you ever confronted someone about their speaking disrespectfully of 
Divine things? Have you been looked at as a fanatic for caring so much for 
holy things? Have you ever wanted to say, “Hold your tongue. You don’t know 
not what you’re saying.”?
It’s interesting to consider the teaching about mixing gall in with justice. It 
poisons the intellect and kills the conscience so that nothing bothers us. The 
result is that the fruit of justice is spoiled by wormwood, causing delusions in

 The AC 2832 translation of Amos 6:13 agrees with that in the quote above: 
“Ye who rejoice in a thing of naught, who say, have we not taken to us horns 
by our own strength? ‘horns here denote the power of falsity’.”

AC 10182[7]



“In Amos...(vi. 13)...by ‘horns’ is signified power, is evident, and indeed power 
in both senses, namely, the power of truth against falsity, and of falsity against
truth....”

AE 316[21]



“In Amos...(vi. 13) ‘To take horns by our own strength’ signifies by the powers
of self-intelligence to acquire falsities by which truths will be destroyed.”  
Amos 6:13 is cited.

DERIVED DOCTRINE

“Have we not taken Karnaim for ourselves....”

 The Writings give us little or no help with the meaning or correspondence of 
this region. One Interpreter’s Bible Dictionary source says that Karnaim 
means “the horns.” That seems consistent with what we have been presented 
in the passages regarding the people’s boast of taking power (the horns) by 
their own strength.

The affliction “from the entrance of Hamath...”

 The Hamathites were many nations, and they signified many different 

idolatries. The nature of these idolatries is that they are “entirely unwilling to
know internal things, and when instructed reject them....” (AC 1205)

Arabah

 Where is this place called Arabah? There is no mention of it in the Writings. 

Scholars debate its location. Some place it between the Dead Sea and the Gulf 
of Eilat (Aqaba). Do we try to make some application? It seems better not to 
because our information about it is so uncertain. To “press” some application 
might take us away from the spiritual issues.

PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER

1. Under King Jeroboam II, Israel had become extremely confident in its military
strength. They had been boasting about their most recent conquests. To hear 
from an unknown prophet that these conquests were “Lo Debar” (“of no 
importance”; “it doesn’t matter”; “forget it”) seemed so inappropriate. They 
probably responded, “Look at what we have done by our own strength. It 
seems evident the Lord is not upset with us. We have recaptured lands that 
our forefathers had possessed and then lost. We are moving forward, and 
other nations can see we are a military force to be feared.”
When the Lord to told them that they had lost all of their spirituality, it must 
have been hard to match up that failure with the events of their recent past. 
To be told they practiced the worst forms of idolatry didn’t seem right for the 
“chosen ones.”

2. How do we see this in our own life story? We get so wrapped up in the effort 
to get ahead in our work that we set religion aside. We face the competition 
in the work world and have to be “politically astute” to navigate that fine line, 
and we compromise our morals to avoid standing out. Talking religion is not 
the corporate thing to do, so we avoid it as a topic of conversation. Over the 
years, other priorities force religion out, and we fail to have a devotional life 
that has substance to it.

155

When this happens, we lose the “check and balance” that spirituality offers to 
a person living in our world, where most people want fewer and fewer 
restrictions to “doing it my way.” When we get into this mindset, we do feel as
though we have taken the bull by the “horns” and wrestled all successes for 
ourselves. 

3. What was the idolatry of the Hamathites? They became “entirely unwilling to 

know internal things, and when instructed rejected them....”
We need to pray that this condition of mind will not come to us and infill us 
with its coldness toward the things of the Lord.

QUESTIONS TO STIMULATE REFLECTION

At this point, we need to allow you to come up with some questions. The ability to 
put oneself into the text is important. I will give you one question to start you off, 
and then you can use the space provided to write out questions of your own.  Write 
as many as you wish. When you are finished, please share your questions in the 
group discussion.

1. Are there examples of an unwillingness to know internal things present in 

our times?

156

Chapter Seven

AMOS 7:1

 Thus the Lord God showed me: Behold, He formed locust swarms at the beginning of 
the late crop; indeed it was the late crop after the king’s mowings.

PASSAGES FROM THE WRITINGS

P&P



"That the church has increased from the externals to externals, ver. 1..."

AE 543[11]



"The ‘locust’ signifies...falsity in the most external things, or the densest 
falsity...which is one of the curses if they did not keep and do the 
commandments of Jehovah....and the ‘locust’[denote] dense falsity from the 
sensual man that consumes and destroys...." Amos 7:1-2 is cited.

Derived Doctrine

Swarming Locusts

 The swarming of locust is not covered specifically for this verse of Amos, but 
we can draw on other references from the Word such as Exodus 10:14-15, in 
which the locust were so thick they darkened Egypt, and they ate the residue 
(the late crop) of what was left from the plague of hail.

 The Writings make a point that this represents a sad period in the life of an 

evil person who "persuade themselves that they are in truth by faith, but they
are not; they are in falsity, and are against the truth of faith." (AC 7689) Such a
spiritual state severs all connection with the light of heaven and the "crop" of 
every living thing is devoured with a malicious swarming of lies thus 
producing a gross darkness of the mind.

King

 We need to note the good and bad representation of king. In the good sense, 
"king" represents being led by the divine truth and divine good from the 
Lord, our "king." In the bad sense, it represents those who feign obedience 
but really seek to rule themselves by claiming, or demanding, merit. Let this 
quote help us see the difference:

157



"Those who have lived a good civic and moral life, but have persuaded 
themselves that they merit heaven by their works...have their false principles 
turned into such phantasies that they seem to themselves to be cutting grass, 
and are called grass-cutters.... They are always hoping to be taken up to 
heaven, and sometimes consult together how they may introduce themselves 
by their own power." (AC 1111)

 The locusts eat early and "late" mowings by such self-serving kings.

Putting It All Together

1. The reading in P&P on this verse turns our attention to this teaching: "That 

2.

the church has increased from externals to externals..." What does that mean 
to you? To answer this question, let’s turn to a passage in the Arcana: "...when
a man is in things external, as when he is in worldly and bodily things, then 
the angels are removed, and when they are removed, then nothing at all 
of...goods and truths appears." (AC 5897[11])
Increasing from externals to internals is lauded. We are told that such a 
progression causes a conjunction of the Lord with His church. But that is not 
what is happening in this prophecy. All thinking and living is from sensual 
and bodily things. Let’s liken this process to a sand dune. Little grows on it. It 
offers little in the way of a firm foundation because its substance shifts with 
the prevailing current or wind.

3. Have you ever looked at a teaching from the Word and thought you 

understood the essence of the passage until popular opinions caused you to 
have doubts about its eternal application? Were precedents pointed out that 
appeared to provide exceptions to the teaching? It sometimes appears that 
human experience testifies against a teaching in the Word, and we need to 
explain away the former rigidity with modern enlightenment. "We were 
turning people away from the church with such hard teachings." This is an 
appearance, not the truth.

4. The "mowings" of modern meritorious thinking seem to hold more of an 
appeal than the "antiquated" teachings of the Word. There are those who 
want to have a feel-good experience with religion. Are we in a period of 
moving from externals to externals? Has the external world rationalized the 
Lord’s Word to the point where a "swarm" of locusts plunder everything in 
sight, silencing the warnings of our conscience and perception?

5. Lastly, do we see evidence that there are those who keep "cutting grass" 

thinking that leading a civil and moral life will carry the day and earn heaven 
for them? How about this statement: "It doesn’t matter what kind of faith we 
follow as long as we are kind to one another. We all worship the same God, 
and after all that is all that really matters in the long run." What truth and 
falsity are mixed in this statement?

Questions to Stimulate Reflection

1. What is the first act of charity? To shun evils as sins. If we move from 

externals to externals, how can we even begin to fulfill this requirement? 
Why is the internal necessary to the existence of charity in us?

2. Have you ever done a study of what acts of worship the Lord abrogated? 
Please check out AC 9349. This quote might be of great use if a discussion 
should arise about the validity of rites and rituals. Old forms verses modern 
forms can be a heat-producing topic.
Did you see anything in this number that would be of great use when the 
world or the bodily senses (logic) try to abrogate inconvenient prohibitions 
to their ends?

3. How flexible have the "external of externals" made us in our thinking? Why?

4. Would you see yourself as a "mower of grass"?

5.

Is it necessary for us to rework the image of the church to bring those who 
have been hurt back into the fold of the church? What specific things would 
have to be looked at and possibly changed? Would those external changes 
eventually lead to internal changes? Are there internal changes we can make 
that would bring about external changes? How can we be softer, but yet true 
to the Word of the Lord, so that we don’t have a "swarm of locust" so thick 
that the skies grow dark and the spiritual food of the soul is devoured?

AMOS 7:2-6

“And so it was, when they (the locust) had finished eating the grass of the land, that I 
said:
O Lord God, forgive, I pray!
Oh, that Jacob may stand,
For he is small!
So the Lord relented concerning this.
It shall not be, said the Lord.
Thus the Lord God showed me: Behold, the Lord God called for conflict by fire,
and it consumed the great deep and devoured the territory.
Then I said: O Lord God, cease, I pray!
Oh, that Jacob may stand, 

159

For he is small!
So the Lord relented concerning this.
This also shall not be, said the Lord God.”

PASSAGES FROM THE WRITINGS

P&P



“...that when externals were corrupted, reparation was made, vers. 2-6...”

AC 4281



“...in the Word ‘Jacob’ denotes not only Jacob, but also all his posterity.... Jacob 
and his posterity were of such a character that with them celestial and 
spiritual love could not be conjoined with natural good (that is, the internal 
or spiritual man with the external or natural man)...for they did not know, nor
were they willing to know, what the internal or spiritual man is, and therefore
this was not revealed to them; for they believed that nothing exists in man 
except that which is external and natural. In all their worship they had regard
to nothing else, insomuch that Divine worship was to them no otherwise than
idolatrous....” Amos 7:2 is cited.

AC 7571[2]

 This number cites Amos 7:2 regarding the meaning of “grass and herbs.” By 
these words are meant such things as are of the church. “...the truth which is 
of faith...”

AC 10441[3]



“In these passages Jehovah is said to have ‘repented,’ when yet it cannot be 
that He repents, because He knows all things before He does them; from 
which it is evident that by ‘repenting’ is signified mercy.” Amos 7:3, 6 are 
cited.

AC 587



 “...it is of mercy to be punished, because mercy turns all the evil of 
punishment into good.... Mercy has its name from the fact that it delivers man 
from miseries and from hell...”  

AE 538[13]



“In these passages...‘the abyss’ and ‘the depth of the sea’ signify the hell where
and from which are the falsities of evil; for the reason that the evil spirits who

160

are there, and who while they lived as men in the world were in the falsities 
of evil, seem to dwell as it were in the bottom of the seas, and this more 
deeply according to the grievousness of the evil from which was their falsity.” 
Amos 7:4 is cited as one of many examples.

DERIVED DOCTRINE

 “Oh, that Jacob may stand...” 









In AC 7068, we have this interesting quote: “...they who are in truth are as it 
were rigid, and stand erect as if they were hard; and when they ought to 
humble themselves before the Divine, they only bend the body a little; but 
they who are in good are as it were soft, and when they humble themselves 
before the Divine, they bow themselves down to the earth.”
In AR 366, we are told that standing before God is to hear and do what He 
commands.
Standing represents new life such as belong to a regenerate person. (AE 
666[3])
Somewhere in this wide range of meanings, it would appear that the Word is 
contrasting the state of the Israelites to that of the external man. He is broken
by the “locust” events in his life, and yet he remains resistively proud and fails
to give total humility to the Lord. The external man is only willing to bend the
body slightly to acknowledge the mercy of the Lord.

Jacob’s Small Size



In AE 696, we have an explanation of the “small and the great” fearing the 
name of the Lord. The “small” mean those “...who have but little knowledge of 
the truths and goods of the church, and ‘the great’ those who know much, 
thus those who worship the Lord little and much; for (small or great) is 
measured according to how much a man knows the truths of faith and lives 
according to them....”

The Lord Relenting



“The Lord relented concerning this....” Could this mean that the Lord took into
account how “small” Jacob was? If Jacob had been described as “great,” would
the Lord’s mercy have relented?

Conflict by Fire

 AE 702 includes a teaching that may offer us a possible meaning of this verse.
“...Where the evil are there were conflicts and disturbances of the thoughts 
and reasonings...respecting the goods and truths of the church.” The ranting 

161

and ravings of hell offered up confusion and uncertainty to the worship of the
Lord.

 The conflict of fire could represent how the Lord’s love (fire) will consume all
of these illogical ravings and disturbances. This prophecy tells us that the 
Lord’s love or mercy will “consume” and expose the malignant insanities the 
evil thought they had well hidden in the deepest recesses of their dwellings 
or territory.

Repetition in the Word

 Once again, the plea of the prophecy asks the Lord to cease and to help Jacob 
stand for he is small, and once again, we are told that the Lord relented. Why 
are these words repeated? Is it for poetical emphasis?

 We need to hear the teaching of the Writings:

o “...there is not the least word [in the Word] that is superfluous and 

vain...There is therefore no repetition, except with another 
signification.” (AC 734)

o “...he who does not know the mystery...cannot but think...[that] 
repetition [is] for the sake of emphasis. But this is not so.... One 
expression has reference to truth, the other to good; thus one has 
reference to the intellect...and the other to the will....” (AC 4691)

 Therefore, we must see that this second reference is not repetition; it is for 

the examination of the quality of the will.

PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER

1. When externals are corrupted, the Lord works to make reparations possible 
for His children. When the locust “finished eating the grass of the land...the 
Lord relented....” Evil has to run its course, and human beings have to almost 
hit the bottom of despair. Providence can then enter and lift us from the grip 
of hell’s influence. Such states of despair help to break up the hard ground of 
the mind. The ground of our minds wants relief and protection from the 
barrenness hell has left us in.

2. How small or great are we? Will we stand before the Lord with rigidness and 
reluctance, bending so slightly to His magnificent royalty? Or will we fall 
prostrate before Him with a degree of softness and loving humbleness?
3. The Lord tells us that all factors of our choices (intentions) will be given 

proper consideration. We will be given an opportunity to see the contents of 
our understanding and our will. Mercy will carry a degree of “punishment” so
that we may be led into good and that we may be rescued from the miseries 
of hell and their conflicts and worrisome disturbances.

QUESTIONS TO STIMULATE REFLECTION

1. This section covers five verses. In comparison to some of the other sections, 
we had little doctrinal exposition. We had to use some “derived doctrinal” 
application. Is this an appropriate thing for us to do? What are the positive 
and negative aspects of this approach?
If you are interested in this question, get a copy of W.F. Pendleton’s The 
Science of Exposition. Starting on page 194, he has a chapter on making 
comparisons of words and passages that is very helpful and encouraging to 
the researcher.

2. Prayer groups form to pray for someone in the congregation or community. 
They “seem” to pray so as to get the Lord to relent over some difficulty or 
illness. Who is helped the most with prayer?  Do you think your praying will 
help the problem a friend is facing? How?

3. What is your reaction to the quotation about mercy? “It is of mercy to be 
punished,” and mercy has its name “from the fact that it delivers us from 
miseries and from hell.”

4. The teachings on “repetition” make a statement about the Word. The Word is 
not superfluous and vain. When I reflect on this, I wonder about courses that 
teach the Bible as poetry or for literature appreciation. What spiritual effects 
might come from this kind of instruction? What effect will there be on 
organized religion if it doesn’t recognize the spiritual reasons for repetition?
5. What are some other things in the Word that appear on the surface to make 
no sense?  What might be present “under the surface”?  How can you find 
out?

AMOS 7:7-9

Thus He showed me: Behold, the Lord stood on a wall made with a plumb line, with a 
plumb line in His hand. And the Lord said to me, “Amos, what do you see?” And I said, “A
plumb line.” Then the Lord said:

“Behold, I am setting a plumb line
In the midst of My people Israel;
I will not pass by them anymore.
The high places of Isaac shall be desolate,
And the sanctuaries of Israel shall be laid to waste.
I will rise with the sword against the house of Jeroboam.”

163

PASSAGES FROM THE WRITINGS

P&P



“...when the [corruption of] inmost things were reached, then all things were 
destroyed, because they were against God, vers. 7-9...”

Coronis 56

 This number quotes Amos 7:9 and simply says, “‘Land,’ here is for the 

church.”

DERIVED DOCTRINE

The Lord standing on a wall “made with a plumb line, with a plumb line in His hand.”

 A wall has the following representations:

o That which withholds falsities on all sides. See AC 8206.
o The walls of Jericho signify the false reasonings that defended evils. 

See AC 8815.

o Walls signify the Word in its literal sense, which protects the doctrine 

of the Lord’s New Church. See AR 898.   



Spiritual character and integrity are important to the Lord. His ways are 
straight and uncompromising with falsity. He seeks to protect all with His 
walls of truth. His walls are there for our protection so as to withhold, or keep
out, evil on all sides.

 Honest mistakes are pardonable when we have the resolve to correct 

mistakes when we find them. That is not what Israel was doing. They took the
literal sense of the Word and were “leaning” or “bending” the walls of the 
Lord to suit their own ends.  The Lord could not “pass by.” He couldn’t 
pretend He didn’t see their unfaithful use of the literal sense. Nothing slips by 
His Divine awareness, and that is a comfort for our souls. The falsity of hell 
will not catch Him sleeping or being inattentive.

 Accountability, estimations, and measurements were needed to show how 

foolishly unstable their spiritual walls were. “...for all measures and weights, 
in the Word, signify the estimation of truth and good.” (AR 313)

The plumb line is in the Lord’s hand, and Amos is asked to acknowledge it.



I’m emphasizing this passage because it is a powerful concept and image to 
reflect on.

 When there is mention of the Lord’s hand, AR 55 gives a general principle to 

follow:

o “...the presence of the Lord with man is adjunction, and thus 

conjunction by contiguity; and this contiguity is near and fuller in 

164

proportion as man loves the Lord, that is, does His 
commandments....by ‘laying His right hand upon him,’ is signified 
inspiring him with His life.”

 The principle here seems to be that the Lord wanted Amos to see and 

recognize what was in His hand. Measurement was needed, and the spiritual 
wanted to bring about a state of adjunction through some natural means 
(Amos, as His prophet) for the purpose of contiguity and inspiring new life 
among the people.

“The high places of Isaac shall be desolate.”



It seems we get a hint about this passage when we use the principle, taught in
AC 85, that explains the meaning of being “’borne over the lofty things of the 
earth, and [being fed] with the heritage of Jacob.’ Isaiah 53:14. This 
represents enjoying internal peace and happiness...and at the same time 
external tranquility and delight...”
Isaac represents spiritual love, or charity. See AC 1025[2].
Isaac represents the “rational man” within every person. See AC 1893.
Isaac represents the Lord’s interior man, or His Divine Rational. See AC 1950.




 The loss of Isaac’s high places (using the doctrine as explained in AC 85) 

seems to indicate the loss of an inner peace of rationality and the desolation 
of clear thinking.

The Sanctuaries of Israel Laid to Waste

Sanctuaries signify the truth of heaven and the church.  See AC 8330.
Sanctuaries signify the Word. See AE 724.
Sanctuary signifies the mercy of the Lord. See AC 57.




 AE 632[8] says that when the sanctuary is trampled down, this signifies “to 

destroy the truths of doctrine from the Word....”

PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER

1. We worked hard on these passages. It appears to me that our summary is 

pretty clear. The church and the children of Israel were in deep trouble. What 
had been intended to protect them and to wall out evil from every side was so
compromised with falsity that the Lord saw that it was time to bring 
measurement and accountability upon His people. True love would not turn 
its back on their disorders. The Lord would not pass by. His plumb line was 
going to be in the midst of them.

2. P&P teaches us that when corruption reaches to inmost things, all things are 
destroyed. Israel had reached that point, and the Divine needed to confront 
the hells.

QUESTIONS TO STIMULATE REFLECTION

1. Do you know what a plumb line is?  How is it used? Have you heard a sermon 
on the plumb line? What do you think about the meaning of walls and their 
spiritual applications to your life?

2. We use the expression mental walls” in conversation. Have you ever “walled 

someone out” or been “walled out” by someone close to you?  How is this like 
or unlike what the Lord does with His walls?

3. Spiritual integrity, being morally straight, being level with everyone are 

necessary and useful qualities in a person. Are you able to mentally picture 
yourself being level with the Lord? Do we sometimes try to pretend that He 
doesn’t see or know about our disorders? Why is that dangerous?

4. There is a saying that goes like this: A mistake is not a mistake unless we 

refuse to correct it.  If we find a crooked wall, are we likely to tear it down or 
make excuses why it is crooked and necessary that it be that way?

5. People sometimes talk about the difference between healthy boundaries, or 
walls, and unhealthy boundaries.  Earlier, we talked about being “walled out” 
by someone you love.  This kind of wall can hurt.  What are some examples of 
healthy walls?  How can we maintain them?

AMOS 7:10-13

“Then Amaziah the priest of Bethel sent to Jeroboam king of Israel, saying, “Amos has 
conspired against you in the midst of the house of Israel. The land is not able to bear 
all his words. For thus Amos has said:
“Jeroboam shall die by the sword,
And Israel shall surely be led away captive
From their own land.”

Then Amaziah said to Amos:
“Go, you seer!
Flee to the land of Judah.
There eat bread,
And there prophesy.
But never again prophesy at Bethel,
For it is the king’s sanctuary, 
And it is the royal residence.””



“‘Bethel’ is the Divine Good, and is therefore called the ‘king’s sanctuary,’ and 
the ‘house of the kingdom’ (Amos vii. 13).”

DERIVED DOCTRINE

Amaziah

 Amaziah, the priest of Bethel, represents the perverted church. (AE 624[10]) 

Historically, Amaziah was a priest who backed Jeroboam II when he 
instituted a nationalistic, idolatrous cult at Bethel. The prophecy spoken 
through Amos must have troubled him greatly. He feared that Amos’ words 
might rally certain rebels who would cause trouble to him and his authority 
and wealth.  As is the way of evil, Amaziah sought to discredit and silence the 
Lord’s truth with lies, distortion, and subtlety.

 Amaziah called Amos a traitor and claimed his words were proof of his 

conspiracy against the king of Israel.

Jeroboam



Jeroboam’s reign as king of the northern kingdom was filled with excesses. 
He ignored the plight of the poor, justice was ignored, luxury was worshiped 
and morality was a sham.

“The land is not able to bear all of his words.”



In AC 620, we are taught that “land” signifies various things depending on the
preceding correspondence. For instance, AC 2571 explains that land may 
signify the internal man of the church; the region where the church is; the 

167

church itself; the doctrine of love and charity where the faith of the church 
resides.

 Amaziah the priest spoke these words.  A priest’s use is to lead others to the 
good of life. Therefore, we might assume that this preceding correspondence 
is speaking about the charity of the church having no room in its idolatrous 
system to “bear” the words of the Lord. The church had no room for love of 
the Lord and love of the neighbor.

“Jeroboam shall die by the sword, and Israel shall surely be led away captive....”

 A sword signifies self-love “with its insane cupidities and persuasions, [and 
such]...are carried away to corporeal and earthly things...[a sword] signifies 
the desolation of man such that he sees nothing that is good and true, but 
mere falsities and things contrary....”(AC 309)
If the “king,” as a representative of ruling loves, is killed by self-love, then 
sadly, he leads his people into captivity, too. His insanity removes them from 
“their own land.” He leads them out of the region where the church’s faith, 
love, and charity reside.



“Go, you seer!”

 What are we to do with this term “seer”? Is it synonymous with “prophet”? I 
can’t find a direct teaching on the difference between “seer” and “prophet”. 
However,  here is an interesting teaching to consider: “We read of the 
prophets that they were in vision, and that Jehovah spoke to them. When they
were in vision they were not in the body, but in their spirit, in which state 
they saw things such as are in heaven. But when Jehovah spoke to them, they 
were in the body, and heard Him speaking. These two states of the prophets 
should be carefully distinguished. In their state of vision, the eyes of their 
spirit were opened, and those of their body shut....” (Doctrine of the Lord 52, 
emphasis added)

 Could Amaziah, not realizing what he was saying, have been used by the Lord 
to testify that the words of Amos were really of things such as are in heaven?

“Flee to the land of Judah. There eat bread.”

 Amaziah felt a great deal of indignation against Amos. When we despise 

someone, we want them out of our sight. The rational and emotional feelings 
of Amaziah willed to subjugate the Divine truth for its own comfort and 
would not humble itself to the Lord. See AC 1923 for a fuller explanation.
 Amaziah, even though he was a corrupted priest, was used by the Lord for 

good.  It reminds us of the story of the Wisemen losing sight of the star. They 
went to the corrupt priests of Herod and got the help necessary to find the 
star again.

 Telling Amos to flee to the land of Judah has wonderful correspondences. AC 
3880 and 3881 explain the inner meaning of Judah. Judah signifies the Lord 
and the Divine of His Love; the Word as it relates to the Lord’s celestial 
kingdom; and the doctrines of the Word.

 Eating bread in Judah means to appropriate every good that would provide 
for man’s reciprocality to the Lord, and to the neighbor. These were the 
essentials missing in Bethel.

“...never again prophesy at Bethel, for it is the king’s sanctuary, and it is the royal 
residence.”

 Behind this bold statement, we have a recurring question for all times. Who 

will serve you as king? Is this life mine or the Lord’s? Is the world our 
sanctuary? Are pleasures in the royal residence?

PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER

1. Hell is not willing to look on the face of prophecy. It wants to banish it from 

its presence.
Hell is afraid that if we listen to the teaching of doctrine, we might rally our 
forces to expel it from the sanctuary of idolatry.

2. Literally, we need to use the sword of truth to kill the self-love leadership of 
Jeroboam. The “seer” of heavenly doctrine needs to share the vision of the 
spirit to restore within us the reciprocal and mutual love to the Lord and the 
neighbor.
“If anyone eats of this bread, he will live forever.” (John 6:51)

QUESTIONS TO STIMULATE REFLECTION

Please note that there are questions throughout the “Passages From the Writings” 
section. Please use them for this section, and add at least two questions of your own 
to practice your Word-study skills.

AMOS 7:14-16

Then Amos answered, and said to Amaziah:
“I was no prophet,
Nor was I a son of a prophet,

169

But I was a sheepbreeder
And a tender of Sycamore fruit.
Then the Lord took me as I followed the flock,
And the Lord said to me,
‘Go prophesy to My people Israel.’
Now therefore, hear the word of the Lord:
You say, ‘Do not prophesy against Israel,
And do not spout against the household of Isaac.’

PASSAGES FROM THE WRITINGS

P&P



“...so that there was no longer any doctrine, vers. 14-16.”

AE 624[10]



“In Amos...(vii. 14-17) ‘To prophesy against Israel, and to drop against the 
house of Isaac,’ signifies to refute those of the church who are in the falsities 
of evil, ‘to prophesy’ signifying to teach and refute, and ‘Israel’ and ‘the house 
of Isaac’ signifying the church. Because the falsities of evil are what must be 
refuted, this is said to Amaziah, who represented the perverted church...”

DERIVED DOCTRINE

Refuting of the Falsities of the Church: Amos Answering Amaziah’s Rebuke

 To illustrate the demise of enlightenment in the church, Amos tells them that 
he is neither a prophet nor one of the sons of the prophets. Those who would 
have been chosen by the Lord were so far into disorder that “there was no 
longer any doctrine.” So the Lord called a man whose uses would signify the 
needs of the church.

 We mentioned Amos’ two uses in the introduction. A shepherd represents 

one who exercises charity and is protects innocence. The Israelites as a flock 
were not being cared for by the priests of the church. They were vulnerable 
to spiritual predators of all kinds.

 Amos, as a “pincher” or pruner of the Sycamore tree, illustrated what a poor 
quality of fig tree (obedience) Israel represented: poor quality, tasteless figs 
that most people ignored. The Lord sought to refine them and turn their evil 
into something good, in spite of their stubborn and rebellious nature. The 
Lord, through Amos, spoke words of truth that refuted the contempt and 
intolerance of Amaziah.

Read Amos 7:14-16.

Read the summary from P&P.

PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER

1. Do we need to draw this section to a fuller summary? Are the two quotes 
from P&P and AE 624[10] enough of an explanation? The Lord replied and 
refuted Amaziah’s stout defense of the falsities in the life of the church. The 
doctrine of the church was gone. Its demise was the result of all the things the
Israelites had allowed their king, their priests, and their hearts to destroy 
within the church.

QUESTIONS TO STIMULATE REFLECTION

1. As I wrote that last paragraph, I felt a deep sense of sorrow. The children of 

Israel had the great use of being a representative church to the world. Instead
of fulfilling this commission, they tried to turn it to self-love. What lessons 
may we draw from these chapters that we can apply to our church and uses?
2. The Lord answered Amaziah, “Do not…Do not…” This is a stern warning. It is 
an evaluation of the priesthood. What I hear behind these passages is that the
Lord was telling Amaziah not to speak words that dishonored Him.  I found 
myself wishing the Lord would speak similar things to our age. (Of course, I 
believe He is speaking through His Second Coming) What would you list as 
the most important things we hear Him saying to us?  Where and how do we 
hear them?

3. As we know, when someone does not want to hear you, they will think of 

many reasons why they shouldn’t.  Amaziah did not want to hear Amos, and 
he came up with reasons why Amos should be silent.  The reasons were not 
true, but they must have seemed plausible to Amaziah. What happens when 
we mix anger, or disorder, with “plausible” reasoning?  What makes the 
reasoning “plausible”? What is the greatest danger to us when we think this 
way? What are some other dangers?

AMOS 7: 17

Therefore thus says the Lord:
“Your wife shall be a harlot in the city;
Your sons and daughters shall fall by the sword;
Your land shall be divided by survey line;
You shall die in a defiled land;

171

And Israel shall surely be led away captive
From his own land.”

PASSAGES FROM THE WRITINGS

P&P



“...that the church with all things belonging to it will perish, vers. 17.”

AE 624[10]



“[Amaziah’s wife] ‘shall be a harlot’ signifies the falsification and adulteration 
of the Word; ‘his sons and daughters shall fall by the sword’ signifies that the 
truths and goods of the church will be destroyed by the falsities of evil; and 
‘the land shall be divided by line’ signifies that the church and everything 
belonging to it will be scattered.” Amos 7:14, 17 are cited.

AC 9854[3]



 “...in the Word ‘cords’ (lines) also signify portions of inheritance and of land, 
for the reason that measurements were made with cords....” Amos 7:17 is one 
of the references cited. 

DERIVED DOCTRINE

Dying in a Defiled Land

 Dying in a defiled land seems to speak of a place where goods and truths are 
adulterated, namely, hell and its land of bogs, quicksand, and its awful stench, 
which are well documented for us in Heaven and Hell. Those who live there 
love the dank abodes, and they could not think of being elsewhere.
 Those who follow the likes of Amaziah will find themselves enslaved to 

falsity, and they will lose that spot in heaven that the Lord had reserved for 
them, a spot that only they could have filled. Each of them is “led away captive
from his own land.”

PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER

1. Have you ever heard someone talk about “victimless acts”? The premise of 

this idea is that if two people freely consent to be sexually intimate, and they 
are discrete about it, no harm has been done. The reasoning, to them, is clear:
What one does with one’s body should not be of concern to others if “no 
harm” is done. Are such acts truly “victimless”?  Who or what might be the 
victim?

172

2. Amaziah’s wife, the adulteration of the Word, is still a harlot on the streets of 
the doctrinal city. People are being defrauded and lied to. Being “street smart”
is lauded as a virtue when in fact it is often a hardness of heart that lacks 
compassion for the neighbor. “Do others before they do you” is a twisting of 
the Lord’s Golden Rule. Innocence is always a target of hell.

3. Sons and daughters represent the “births” out of the conjugial principle: the 
conjunction of good and truth applied to use. When we ignore the Word of 
the Lord our “births” become casualties of the sword of self-love.
If we fail to be “keepers” of the Word, we will eventually be divided by the 
cord of measurement, and we will lose the eternal inheritance the Lord 
would lovingly give us. It is hard to believe that some prefer, and allow, the 
slavery of the mind to lead them to a land that is defiled.

QUESTIONS TO STIMULATE REFLECTION

1. Does the theme “Paradise Lost” seem to be an ageless experience that must 

repeat itself? Why doesn’t the experience of one loss of paradise cure the rest
of us from risking paradise again?

2. Think of someone you love very much. Imagine this person preparing a 

special gift for you, deciding what would suit you best, and spending love and 
effort preparing it. Imagine this person’s happy, excited face as you begin to 
open this gift.  Imagine what that face would look like if you threw down the 
gift and trampled it.  Think of the Lord in those personal terms, and imagine 
His grief at any rejection of the special places He has made for us in heaven.  
Talk about this image and your special place in heaven.

3. Has the Lord begun His work with the “remnant” to build the New Church?
4. Have you dealt with a “there’s no harm...” attitude toward this or that license 
or liberty the proprium seeks to foist on the conscience? What makes this 
simple or difficult?

Chapter Eight

AMOS 8:1

Thus the Lord God showed me: Behold, a basket of summer fruit.

PASSAGES FROM THE WRITINGS

P&P



“That some new [element] of the church will arise, vers. 1...”

DERIVED DOCTRINE

“Thus the Lord showed me... a basket of summer fruit.”

 We read in AC 9996 that a “basket” has a signification “...as being the 

sensuous because the sensuous is the ultimate of man’s life, and in the 
ultimate are stored up all the interior things in order....”
“Summer” indicates that this is representative of the fullness of the church. 
(DLW 73)



 For “fruit,” we need to look at its positive meaning: “...good works are the fruit
of faith in the external sense...but that these good works have no life unless 
they proceed from charity; and that thus the fruit of faith in the proximate 
interior sense is charity. But as charity or love toward the neighbor ought to 
proceed from love to the Lord, this love is the fruit of faith in the internal 
sense; and as all love is from the Lord, it is the Lord Himself.” (AC 1873)

PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER

1. This verse describes, not so much the fullness of Israel’s potential, but what 
will come from the establishment of the New Church. It will be a basket of 
summer fruit. The fruits of the New Church will be beneficial to the neighbor 
and most importantly to the Lord. How much potential will the New Church 
have? Its “sensual ultimates” will be full. Its good works and its “summer” will
enhance the ripening of all the fruits of faith. It will bring all manner of fruit 
and the healing of the nations with its leaves.

2. When the Lord told Amos to look and tell Him what he saw, we have a clue 

that the Lord was about to pronounce or reveal a judgment, an evaluation or 
accountability to see what they had done with what they had. How would 
their charity measure up? Would it be a charity proceeding from the influx of 
the Lord?  Would their charity, or fruit, be sweet, or lifeless and tasteless?

174

3. “The Lord showed me.”  We will get the answers to all of these questions from
the penetrating light of the Lord. There will be no darkened corners were 
things escape His notice.
“In him was life, and the life was the light of men. The light shines in the 
darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it.” (John 1:4-5)

QUESTIONS TO STIMULATE REFLECTION

1. How well do we handle evaluations? Do we feel most of our ratings are fair?  

Are evaluations necessary?

2. Don’t we like to hear our strengths lauded but dislike hearing our 

weaknesses mentioned? Is this also true when we evaluate ourselves?
3. What about our spiritual baskets? Do we feel they have summer fruits in 

them?

4. Some people will have smaller baskets than others. Does the size of the 

basket matter, or is it what we do with what we have?

5. While Joseph was in prison, he interpreted the dreams of the butler and the 

baker. The butler’s life was spared. The baker was hanged. The baker’s dream
had birds eating bread out of his “three white baskets” (or “three baskets 
with holes in them”). The Writings tell us that these two men represent the 
understanding and the will. The butler represents the understanding and the 
baker represents the will. The understanding (butler) could have its ways 
corrected. The perversion of the will (baker) is not as easily corrected. In AC 
5077-5078, we read that the baker represents the external sensual, the 
internals of which did not terminate in use to the Lord or the neighbor. Love 
of self robbed what was spiritual from the will.
Does any of this story from the Word seem to apply to this prophecy given to 
Amos?

6. Our understanding of this verse requires a positive prayer. We need to invite 
the Lord to show us our baskets so that we can bring the “sensuous” things of
life to the higher order of the Lord’s priority.

Amos 8:2-3

And He said, “Amos, what do you see?” So I said, “A basket of summer fruit.” 
Then the Lord said to me:

The end has come upon My people Israel;
I will not pass by them anymore.

175

And the songs of the temple
Shall be wailing in that day,
Says the Lord God
Many dead bodies everywhere,
They shall be thrown out in silence.

PASSAGES FROM THE WRITINGS

P&P



“...that then will be the end of the old church, vers. 2, 3...”

Doctrine of the Lord 4



“...the expressions ‘that day,’ ‘in that day,’ and ‘in that time;’ in which, by ‘day,’ 
and ‘time,’ is meant the Lord’s advent.” Among the many illustrations of these 
phrases, Amos 8:3, 9, and 13 are cited. 

Scripture Confirmations N. IX 4

 Amos 8:2-3 are quoted in here, referring to how the day of Jehovah shall be 

upon every one that is proud and haughty.

DERIVED DOCTRINE

“The end has come upon My people Israel”

 These words seem to say that the Israelites had so far removed themselves 
from the truths and goods of the Lord that they were destroying their vital 
internals. Their hearts were hardened to the prompting of the Lord. The Lord
did not create this ending. This rebellious nation brought about its own end. 
The Lord constantly wants His children to live, but if they refuse to listen, He 
has to tell them that their end is here. Amazingly, He tells them without anger.
Notice how this verse has a tender phrase, “My people Israel.” Anger would 
have omitted such tenderness.
“O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, killing the prophets and stoning those who are sent 
to you! How often would I have gathered your children together as a hen 
gathers her brood under her wings, and you would not!” (Matthew 23:27)
“And you would not!” That attitude seems to capture the meaning of “the end 
has come upon My people.” It was this darkness that moved the Lord to make 
His first advent. If He had delayed any longer, it would have been all over, 
spiritually, for the human race.





176

“I will not pass by them anymore.”

 The Writings offer us several passages where “to pass” represents positive 
experiences. To “pass by” means to receive Divine influx into the will and 
understanding. (AC 683) It also signifies to feel, and to have, peace. (AC 3170)
It signifies having the ability to judge things from truth. (AC 6510) In another 
passage, it means to know and to perceive the quality of things. (AC 3992)

 Does “I will not pass by them anymore” mean that the Israelites had cut 

themselves off from the Lord’s influx? Had they lost that inner peace? Were 
they so blind with ambition that they lost the ability to judge and to sense the
inner quality of things? 

“…the songs of the temple shall be wailing in that day.”

 We cited the following number before in our study, and it is one we need to 

think more about when we sing in our worship services.

 This number, AC 8261, tells us that the nature of singing is let the heart pour 
forth its affection for the Lord’s glorification so that we will be inspired to 
celebrate His victory over hell so we see and believe how much His liberation 
frees us from hell’s slavery.

 That’s the positive side. Israel’s spiritual death took away the joyfulness of 

such singing. They saw nothing of the Lord’s redemption. They thought only 
of the moment and had little assurance that there was spiritual life after 
death. To the ears of the Lord, their songs probably sounded like wailing, 
morbid, pessimistic, and monotonous tunes.

“Many dead bodies everywhere”

 Where might we begin with this quote? The body subsists through its soul; 
wherefore, everything in the body is representative of its soul. See AC 
1807[3].

 Could we take this idea and apply it to our text? The soul of Israel was not in a
living and vibrant use for the Lord. “Many dead bodies (souls) everywhere” 
seems to cry out that the light of truth was flickering, and almost 
extinguished, in the winds of falsity. The preponderance of indifference ruled 
for the time being.

“They shall be thrown out in silence.” 

 AE 687[11] seems to sum up the meaning of this passage when it quotes 
Isaiah 47:5 “Sit in silence and enter into darkness....” as meaning to be in 
falsities, and thence in damnation. Israel might have imagined their thinking 
was well-reasoned and powerful in its philosophical logic. But before the 
Lord, their best was silence.  How sad for a people who had so much given to 
them. They were a full basket of summer fruit.

177

PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER

I feel we did this in the above section. We had so much to derive from the passages 
because we didn’t have direct teachings to work with, and therefore the section 
carried itself in the way of summation throughout our research.

READ AND REVIEW

Read the summary from P&P.

QUESTIONS TO STIMULATE REFLECTION

1. Does the Lord still “pass by” in your mind? Do we get a sense that influx flows

into our will and understanding?
Do we feel the peace that comes from trusting in His providence?
Do we have the ability to judge “things” from truth?

2. Are we “singing” songs that sound like wailing or are excited about the Lord’s 

redemptive work and spiritual liberation?

3. How can we keep ourselves from being like dead bodies everywhere? How 

can the soul keep its youth and vitality?

4. The voice of silence sounds so sad. What can we do to have voices that will be

dignified and acceptable to the Lord’s ears?

AMOS 8:4-6

Hear this, you who swallow up the needy,
And make the poor of the land fail,
Saying:
“When will the new moon be past,
That we may sell grain?
And the Sabbath,
That we may trade wheat?
Making the ephah small and the shekel large,
Falsifying the scales by deceit,
 That we may buy the poor for silver,
And the needy for a pair of sandals-
Even sell the bad wheat?”

178

PASSAGES FROM THE WRITINGS

P&P



“...when there is nothing but the adulteration of good and truth, vers. 4-6...”

AC 8540[2]



“...‘an ephah’ denotes good...because by it and by an omer were measured dry 
things that served for food, such as wheat, barley, fine flour; and by things 
that are used for food are signified goods...” Amos 8:5 is cited. 

AE 373[5]



“As a just estimation and exploration of good and truth are signified in the 
Word by ‘measures,’ it was commanded that the measures should be just, 
with no fraud about them.... So justice, where it means the estimation and 
exploration of men in accordance with the quality of good and truth in them, 
is everywhere in the Word expressed by scales and balances of various kinds, 
and by ‘ephahs,’ ‘omers,’ ‘homers,’ ‘seas,’ ‘hins’...and injustice is expressed by 
‘scales and balances of fraud and deceit’ (as in...Amos viii. 5...).”

DERIVED DOCTRINE

“Hear this, you who swallow up the needy”



In AC 5217, we find an explanation of the thin ears of corn “swallowing” up 
the seven fat and full ears in Pharaoh’s dream. “...this signifies that the 
memory-knowledges of no use banished the good memory-knowledges... the 
‘fat and full ears,’ as being memory-knowledges into which the things of faith 
and charity could be applied....” (Emphasis added)

 The swallowing up of the needy indicates a diversion of spiritual things away 
from the soul. Instead of placing a priority on things of the spirit, they had a 
higher priority for self or the sensual comfort needs.

 When the quality of the spiritual life is in a state of “no use,” the “poor of the 
land” will feel the effect of this spiritual apathy. The “land” is representative 
of the mind. If the soul languishes in a state of need, the mind will fail to 
discriminate between what “is” and what “is not.”

“When will the new moon be past...” 

 From research into the meaning of the “new moon,” it appears that the 
Israelites were involved in the worship of a pagan moon god. Monthly 
worship was made to a male deity named “Yarah.” The records of antiquity 
indicate that the followers of this cult were in Palestine and Syria. In spite of 

179

the teachings of Deuteronomy 4:19 and 17:3 forbidding worship of the moon,
or any other heavenly body, the Israelites practiced these pagan rites, 
ignoring the warnings.  Some people offered sacrifices to “Yarah” in the midst 
of the temple when the “new moon” occurred, and no one seemed to object to
this obvious disregard of the Lord’s directive.

 This prophecy uttered by Amos not only exposes their pagan worship, but 

highlights their superficial devotion to the pagan deity. They couldn’t wait to 
get the “new moon” sacrifice over with so they could get back to their 
profitable cheating system of false weight measurements.

Trading Wheat on the Sabbath



“Trading” represents the effort to secure knowledges for self and to 
communicate them. (AC 4453) In the good sense, the “Sabbath” represents a 
state of peace or rest from temptation. (AC 853)  In Matthew 24:20, we find a 
reference to someone taking “flight from the Sabbath,” which represents an 
effort to remove one’s self from the good of love and innocence. (AC 3755[2])
 Trading “wheat,” in the good sense, represents trying to advance in the state 

of love and charity. (AC 3941)

 Might we derive from these teachings that this was representative of how the 
Israelites traded off the essentials of doctrine and soothed themselves with 
how “acceptable” their expanded worship of the “new moon” was because 
others were doing it, too? They sold, or talked, themselves out of the good of 
love and innocence the Lord offered them, in the true sense of trading on the 
“Sabbath day.”
In the parable of the merchant seeking goodly pearls, when he found the 
pearl of great value, he “sold” all that he had to purchase the pearl. We are 
taught that this represents ridding ourselves of the self love that would 
prevent us from purchasing the pearl. The Israelites were not interested in 
offering this gift of sacrifice to the Lord. They saw no profit or advancement 
in such honest measurements. They only wanted to find or hear things that 
would confirm or affirm what they were doing.



“Making the ephah small...the shekel large…and falsifying the scales by deceit...”

 AE 373[5] calls our attention to the meaning of this passage. The Israelites’ 

sense of justice was gone. They were willing to go to any extreme to 
adulterate the good and truth of the Word. They lived by the “scales and 
balances of fraud and deceit.”

Weights and Measurements

 While we are considering weights and measurements, let’s consider this 
teaching from AC 5658: “Weights and measurements are frequently 
mentioned in the Word, but, in the internal sense, they do not signify weights 

180

and measurements, but...weights signify states of a thing as to good, and 
measurements, the states of a thing as to truth.”

 Those who cheated the poor and needy had a code of life that allowed them 
to buy the “poor” for silver and the needy for a pair of sandals and even sell 
inferior products such as spoiled wheat. Profit took precedence over love of 
the neighbor.

 Have you ever heard someone interviewing a famous person, and they ask 
them, “What words would you like to have on your grave stone?” Certainly, 
we would not want, “Here lies a person whose scales and balances were 
measured in fraud and deceit, who sold off truth for profit and the poor for a 
pair of sandals.”

 We should not forget as well the interview with the Lord’s angels when we 

arrive in the spiritual world. What is their first question to the newly arrived?
What did you love? Where your heart is, there will your treasure be.

QUESTIONS TO STIMULATE REFLECTION

1.

2.

In some sense, can we identify with Israel being drawn into a pagan worship 
of the “new moon”? The moon represents faith. It is supposed to reflect the 
light of the sun. If the Lord is not the source of our light, what is? There are so
many things trying to take the place of the Lord as the way to find an inner 
peace. It shouldn’t be hard for us to think of a similar issue.
Justice is the means of exploring the quality of good and truth. How often do 
we try to “tip the scales and balances” in our favor? Facing the intent of our 
actions is not always easy, and we look for others who are having trouble, too.
It gives us comfort and a ready excuse for not taking on the unfair nature of 
self-love. What do you think about this issue?

3. What meaning or application can we make with the teachings about selling 

off the poor, or getting a pair of sandals as an even exchange for the life of the 
poor?
Remember, the feet represent the natural, that which we walk on all day long. 
How do we apply true measurements to the practical events of our lives?

181

4.

The sandal represents what we use to protect the feet from painful injuries. Is
there a positive sense to purchasing “sandals”? Is there a negative sense of 
“sandals” we need to avoid?
It is interesting to note the representation of the weight system: ephahs, 
omers, homers, seas, and hins. The shekel is also mentioned. Isn’t it awesome 
to think that in the spiritual world we will have all the “time” we need to 
study their fuller meaning and application to the spiritual and celestial sense?
Do you think our modern systems of weights and measures have 
correspondences?

5. “Selling bad wheat” seems to indicate callousness toward good and truth. Is 

there anything that you can relate this to? Can the food for the soul be tainted
with a spoiled quality?

AMOS 8:7-10

“The Lord has sworn by the pride of Jacob:
‘Surely I will never forget any of their works.
Shall the land not tremble for this,
And everyone mourn who dwells in it?
All of it shall swell like the river,
Heave and subside
Like the River of Egypt.
And it shall come to pass in that day,’ says the Lord God,
That I will make the sun go down at noon,
And I will darken the earth in broad daylight;
I will turn your feasts into mourning,
And all your songs into lamentation;
I will bring sackcloth on every waist,
And baldness on every head;
I will make it like mourning for an only son,
And its end like a bitter day.”

“In these passages by ‘sun’ is not meant the sun of this world, but the Sun of 
the angelic heaven, which is the Divine love and the Divine wisdom of the 
Lord; those are said to be ‘obscured,’ ‘darkened,’ ‘covered,’ and ‘blackened’ 
when there are evils and falsities with man. Hence it is evident, that similar 
things are meant by the Lord’s words, where He speaks of the consummation 
of the age, which is the last time of the church...” Amos 8:9 is one of the 
references cited.

“...day and night, morning and evening, summer and winter, constitute time in
this world, and when understood in the spiritual sense, they constitute the 
states of the church; therefore when these states no longer exist, there is no 
church; and when there is then no church, when there is no longer any good 
and truth, thus when the light of truth is thick darkness...‘there is time no 
longer.’”  Amos 8:9 is cited..

AE 401[16]



“In Amos:- (viii. 9) ‘It shall come to pass in that day, that I will cause the sun 
to set at noon, and I will darken the earth in a day of light.’ This signifies that 
the church, where the Word is from which it might be known what is good 
and true, there is nevertheless nothing but evil and falsity. ‘To cause the sun 
to set,’ and ‘to darken the earth,’ signify the evil of life, and the falsity of 
doctrine in the church; for ‘the rising of the sun’ signifies the good of love, 
which is the good of the life, and ‘the setting of the sun’ signifies the evil of 
love, which is the evil of the life; and ‘the darkening of the earth’ signifies the 
consequent falsity of doctrine, ‘darkness’ signifying falsities, and ‘the earth’ 
the church; ‘at noon,’ and ‘in the day of light,’ signify when there might be the 
knowledges of good and truth, because they have the Word, ‘noon’ signifying 
where there are the knowledges of good, and the ‘day of light’ where there 
are the knowledges of truth.”

AC 3693[2]



“...it was a mark of deep mourning, and also a great disgrace, for any one to 
make himself bald, or to be seen bald....‘baldness’ signified the Word without 
its ultimate sense.” Amos 8:10 is quoted as one of the examples from the 
Word.

 This number contains more information on the representations of 

“mourning” and “sackcloth.”

AE 66[5]

 This number has more references to the meaning of baldness and how the 

bald are seen in the world of spirits. The bald there “...are such as have abused
the Word, and have applied the sense of the letter...to wicked purposes, and 
therefore have been deprived of all truth. These are most malignant.” Amos 
8:10 is cited.          

AE 637[15]



“In Amos:- ( viii. 10) ‘Sackcloth upon the loins’ signifies mourning because 
the good of love is destroyed, for this is signified by the ‘loins;’ and ‘baldness 
upon the head’ signifies mourning because the understanding of truth is 
destroyed.”

DERIVED DOCTRINE

“The Lord has sworn...” 

 When the Word says the Lord “swore,” it is to signify an “...irrevocable 

confirmation from the Divine.... The Divine cannot confirm from any other 
source than from Itself; and what it confirms is irrevocable, because it is 
eternal truth.... The Lord never confirms anything by an oath; but when the 

185

Divine truth...passes down to a man...it is turned into the semblance of an 
oath.” (AC 2482)

“The pride of Jacob...”



Jacob has many representations. Which of them are we to use?  Looking at 
the literal sense, it appears that we must choose one that shows a 
troublesome or shallow external in its representation. Perhaps the 
description in AC 3548 would come close to the internal meaning. In this 
number, we read that “Jacob” represented truth that appears in its outward 
form like good and the truth of good but which is not such internally. Could 
this be the pride of Jacob that the Lord was going to irrevocably expose and 
remove from the church?

 Pride signifies the love of self. (AC 1306) Pride involves a process of false 

reasoning that seems to favor self-love. Pride wears a face of arrogance and 
projects self-assurance. (AC 1585[4]) Pride carries with it an attempt to 
wield the power of domination over the things of the church. (AC 8678)

The Land Trembling



In the positive sense, trembling represents a great alternation and change of 
state when one is regenerating and truth gives place to good. (AC 3593)
 Holy trembling occurs in the presence of the Lord and prepares the way for 

the reception of good. (AC 8816)

 AC 2571 tells us that “land” signifies various things: the internal man of the 
church; the region where the church is; where the faith of the church is; the 
doctrine of love and charity where the faith of the church resides.

 The condition of the church—“the land”—seems to be the thing that needed 
to tremble before the Lord. The church and its faith had to have a way opened
for the Lord to come in. The church needed to return to a state of holy fear to 
help it prepare and receive the good that it needed to be vibrant in spiritual 
things.

“All of it shall swell like a river, heave and subside....”

 AE 518[26] has a beautiful promise for all ages. “...although the church and all
things thereof perish, still the Word and the Divine truth it contains shall not 
perish....” Though the falsity of the church swell, heave, and subside, the Word
will not suffer injury nor “perish in any respect.”

Losses Experienced by People of a Corrupt Church

 The Lord lists what losses the people of a corrupt church will experience:

o “...the sun (will) go down at noon” represents a loss of love and 

heaven’s intelligence and wisdom.

186

o “...darken the earth in broad daylight...” represents the mind losing its 
ability to see clearly in spite of the abundance of the knowledges of 
truth within the Word.

o “...feasts into mourning...songs into lamentations...” represents the loss 
of worshiping the Lord from a genuine, spontaneous joyfulness. They 
would lack the cordial union and felicity that banquets and singing 
would normally bring to the repentant worshiper of the Lord.
o “...sackcloth on every waist...” represents a state of sadness because 
their indifference and falsity was doing harm to the conjugial 
principle. There would be a loss of the spiritual birth of good and truth
because they were severing, or preventing, new life from the Lord.
o “...mourning for an only son...its end like a bitter day.” Having a son to 
continue the lineage of the family traditions was important to the 
Israelites. The Lord touches that nerve. He tells them in the spiritual 
sense that they have lost their link to the rise of a new church. Indeed, 
it is an end “like a bitter day.”

 Their pride, their love of falsity brought about “baldness on every head.”

PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER

1. As sad as this section seems, we must not allow the literal sense to 

discourage us. We need to focus on every one of these correspondences in 
their most positive sense regarding the Lord’s New Church.
Let us with a sense of awe have the holy fear that keeps us from bringing any 
harm to the Lord and His Word. We need to pray that our river of knowledge 
might swell and heave in such a way as the river Nile spilled over its banks, to
bring richness to the crops that the Lord plants within our minds.
We need to pray that our sun will not go down at noon. We need to long for 
the truths that give us the light to sort through the pitfalls of hell. May our 
feasts and our songs flow out of us like the joyous outbursts of happy 
children. We need the spontaneous enthusiasm of one who once was blind 
but now can see.
May we search for the conjugial principle so that we may have an ardent 
desire to spiritually procreate and to protect what is procreated. We need 
those heirs to further the cause of the New Church. May we not do anything 
to the sacredness of the Word that would bring baldness upon the head of 
anyone.
Let us sing the song, “This is the day that the Lord hath made. Let us be glad 
and rejoice in it.” We can offer a prayer that, in spite of what hell tries to tell 
us, we are not going to have this day or any day “end like a bitter day.”

QUESTIONS TO STIMULATE REFLECTION

1. Can we turn the darkness of Israel’s failure into a ray of hope? What can we 

learn that could be useful to our church? Does the Lord always offer a source 
of hope, no matter how dark His words seem?  How can we find it?

2. Negative thoughts, if given a chance to get out of control, rob us of our hope. 

What is dangerous about losing hope? How can we regain lost hope?

3. The description of “baldness” gives us a challenge not to play games with the 
Word. Do we need this “picture” as a reminder to be true to the Word and its 
spiritual sense? What does being true to the Word look like in everyday life?

AMOS 8: 11-14

“Behold, the days are coming, says the Lord God,
That I will send a famine on the land,
Not a famine of bread,
Nor a thirst for water,
But of hearing the words of the Lord.
They shall wander from sea to sea, 
And from north to east;
They shall run to and fro, seeking the word of the Lord,
But shall not find it.
In that day the fair virgins
And the strong young men
Shall faint from thirst.
Those who swear by the sin of Samaria,
Who say
As your god lives, O Dan!
And, As the way of Beersheba lives!
They shall fall and never rise again.”



“In Amos:-...( viii. 11-13) ‘by famine’ and ‘thirst,’ namely, that a famine for 
bread is not meant, nor a thirst for water, but for hearing the word of Jehovah,
thus that it is a lack of the knowledges of good and truth that is meant; and 
that these are not in the church or in its doctrine is described by the words, 
‘they shall go from sea to sea, and from the north to the sunrise, seeking the 
word of Jehovah, and shall not find it,’ ‘from sea to sea’ signifying on every 
side, for the outmost boundaries in the spiritual world, where truths and 
goods begin and terminate appear like seas; consequently ‘seas’ in the Word 
signify the cognitions of truth and good, also knowledges ( scientifica) in 
general; ‘from the north to the sunrise’ signifies also on every side where 
truth and good are, ‘the north’ meaning where truth is in obscurity, and ‘the 
sunrise’ where good is. Because ‘famine and thirst’ signify a lack of the 
knowledges of good and truth, therefore it is also said ‘in that day shall the 
beautiful virgins’ meaning the affections of truth from good, and “youths’ the 
truths themselves that are from good, ‘the thirst for which they shall faint’ 
meaning the lack of these.”

“...they [who] have loved truths because they are truths...are meant by

to be conjoined with the Lord, loves truths because they are truths....all they 
who are such in the Lord’s church, whether they be virgins or young men,

DERIVED DOCTRINE

The Sin of Samaria

 What is the sin of Samaria? Scholars say that this prophecy refers to the twin 
“calf altars” at Dan and Bethel. In various other references, the Writings 
identify the disorderly side of Samaria as various inner sins. For instance, AC 
2466[4] says that Samaria had an affection for falsities. AC 10050[2] says it 
signifies those who are in external worship. AE 193[8] says Samaria signifies 
evils of the will. AC 223[20] says Samaria signifies the false doctrines of those
who reject the Lord. Could any (or all) of these be the sin of Samaria the 
prophecy alludes to?

“They shall fall and never rise again.”



Is this prophecy referring to the fall and demise of a people or to the fall and 
demise of their false human reasoning that gave birth to the falsities within 
the church? 

190

PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER

1. Several key words seem to draw this section to a summary: ignorance, 

deficiency, and confusion.

2. When the Word of the Lord is ignored, can there be any other outcome but 

ignorance and spiritual deficiencies? The virgins and the young men “sense” 
that they want and need something. Where can we find it? How can we 
satisfy this great thirst and famine?
They have physical bread and water, but they need a “hearing” of the words of
the Lord. From sea to sea, from north to east, they can find no one who can 
open the words of the Lord for them. There is a sense of loss. They feel a 
sense of not being conjoined to the Lord.

3. The sins of Samaria, the sins of sensual or external worship, prevail from 
inmosts to outmosts.  The prophecy tells the Israelites that they have lost 
what they need most—conjunction with the Lord. Their pursuit of frivolous 
things will make them faint from a great lack of the “living bread” and the 
“living waters” that only the Lord could provide.

4. Why must this happen? Is it because Beersheba lives? The Writings tell us 
that Beersheba represents a human reason that is not adjoined to the 
doctrine of faith. The Lord lays before us the results of such a ruling love: 
Human comprehension will not be willing to receive divine guidance. “They 
shall fall and never rise again.”

QUESTIONS TO STIMULATE REFLECTION

1.

Is there any evidence of a longing for good and truth among us today? Where 
do you see it?

2. Do you see a searching from sea to sea, from north to east for the word of the 

Lord? What are the signs of this search?

3. AR 620 reminds us that “virgins” and “young men” represent anyone desiring
to be conjoined to the Lord.  For the sake of discussion, is there a process here
that tells us what to do as a parent or church? For instance, are we being 
taught that the individual must desire to be fed and given water before he or 
she can be helped? In some passages of the Word, we are taught to not throw 
our pearls before the swine because they will trample them into the ground. 
In other places, the “master” or the “king” sent his servants out into the 
streets and highways to find people to bring them to the banquet. 

191

Which is it: people must desire to be fed, or people must be found and fed? Or
are both true?

Chapter Nine

AMOS 9:1-5

“I saw the Lord standing by the altar, and He said:
Strike the doorposts, that thresholds may shake,
And break them on the heads of them all.
I will slay the last of them with the sword.
He who flees from them shall not get away,
And he who escapes from them shall not be delivered.
Though they dig into hell,
From there My hand shall take them;
Though they climb up to heaven,
From there I will bring them down;
And though they hide themselves on top of Carmel,
from there I will search and take them;
Though they hide from My sight at the bottom of the sea,
From there I will command the serpent, and it shall bite them;
Though they go into captivity before their enemies,
From there I will command the sword,
And it shall slay them. 
I will set My eyes on them for harm and not for good.
The Lord God of hosts,
He who touches the earth and it melts,
And all who dwell there mourn;
All of it shall swell like the River,
And subside like the River of Egypt.

“In Amos:-…(ix.1) ‘I saw the Lord standing upon the altar, who said, Smite the 
pomegranate that the posts may shake; that is, divide them in the head, all of 
them; I will slay the last of them with the sword.’ where ‘to smite the 
pomegranate’ denotes to destroy the memory-knowledges of good by means 
of the falsities of evil; the posts are then said to ‘shake,’ because ‘posts’ denote
the truths of the natural (n.7847); ‘to slay the last with the sword’ denotes in 

193

this way to destroy the ultimate things; for a ‘sword’ denotes truth fighting 
against falsity and destroying it: and the converse (n. 2799, 4499, 6353, 7102,
8294).”

AC 9125[2]



“...‘to dig through into hell’ denotes to hide themselves there, thus in falsities 
from evil; for ‘hell’ denotes falsity from evil, because this reigns there. The 
falsities there are called ‘darkness,’ within which they hide themselves from 
the light of heaven; for they flee from the light of heaven, which is Divine 
truth from the Lord.” Amos 9:2 is cited.



“...it is clear that God is omniscient in hell as well as in heaven, and in like

have suffered evils to take possession of them; ‘adversaries’ meaning evils, 
and ‘to go into captivity’ meaning to be possessed by them. ‘Thence do I

that ‘the earth shall be darkened in the day of light.’.... As the ‘river of Egypt’ 
signifies falsity, therefore Moses was commanded to smite with his staff upon 
the waters...they consequently turned into blood, every fish died, and the 
river stank....” Amos 8:8, 9 and Amos 9:5 are cited in this number.

AR 503

 There is a vague reference to Amos 9:5 in AR 503. “‘Egypt’ signifies not only 
intelligence but also insanity in spiritual things....” Such is represented by 
‘being drowned by the river of Egypt.’”

AE 654[75]



“All this describes how the natural man is vastated, which takes place when 
he casts away from himself all the truths and goods of the church, and 
imbibes falsities and evils, until there is no longer any truth or good of the 
church remaining.” Amos 9:5 is one of the references used to illustrate this 
teaching.

DERIVED DOCTRINE

The Lord Standing by the Altar

 How beautifully this illustrates the Lord visiting the holy “element” that was 
provided to worship Him. The customs, the rituals, the songs, the sacrifices. 
What did these elements do for the quality of worship in the hearts of His 
people? He knew, but now it was time for them to “see” what they were 
doing.

Strike

 To “strike” means to bring, or apply, holy truth so that a contrast of judgment 
may be seen. The Lord’s presence brought innocence and all the holiness of 
His Love and Wisdom. Of course this would be “striking.” It would be 
awesome and frightening. The Lord’s striking was going to break away the 
veneer of Israel’s monotonous (vain) worship services. 

Door

 A door, or doorposts, signifies that which has the potential to introduce the 
Lord and His good and truth. The Israelites’ love of falsity had to be exposed 
so that order might be restored. The Lord would do this by opening the 
arcana of heavenly truths. As with a mighty wind, the pollution of falsity was 
about to be cleaned away.

“That thresholds may shake”

 When winter comes to earth, it provides that many useful things occur to the 
soil or ground. There is a period of “rest” when vegetation does not draw 
from the soil’s nutrients. The ground freezes and cracks.  The hardened 

195

ground, with frost heaves, cracks open and thus allows for the aeration of the 
soil. The soil rejuvenates so as to provide for the coming splendor of spring. 
Shaking the threshold seems something like that. We get in ruts of thinking. 
We miss the opportunities of new growth. Could this shaking of the threshold
be a positive thing the Lord “permits” for our benefit? Is the message here a 
reminder that it all happens so new spiritual beginnings may replace the 
states of indifference?

The Lord’s Hand, Sight, Eyes

 Throughout these first five verses the Lord mentions His hand, His sight, and 
His eyes. Let’s look at some of their correspondences so we can understand 
their importance in this prophecy:

 Hands represent ability, power, communication, and confidence.


Seeing means that He knows all and everything from eternity; the Lord’s 
conscience   spurring man on to regeneration.

 Eyes represent His great powers of intellection and lucid perception that go 

beyond human comprehension.

 These Divine attributes are not listed merely to impress us. They are stated to
show that nothing escapes the Lord’s notice. He is the Power, the Wisdom, 
and the Everlasting Father of all. Hell, in its fantasy world, thinks that it is 
able to fool or deceive the Lord with its bag of illusions. This prophecy shakes
the very threshold of hell and strikes the head of them all.

Leaving the Lord’s Presence



It is an illusion to believe one has left the Lord’s presence.  These verses refer 
to the illusion of leaving His presence by digging into hell, climbing up to 
heaven, hiding on top of Mount Carmel, or hiding at the bottom of the sea.
 The attempt to dig into hell has an interesting possibility. To “dig” represents 

to search for, to investigate, or to apply truths to false ends. (AC 7343)

 Climbing up to heaven pictures those who think they can force their way into 
heaven through their intellectual ability to reason apart from receiving good 
from the Lord. (AC 5497)

 Hiding themselves on top of Mount Carmel: Here again we have a very 

interesting contrast. As there is a problem with emphasizing reason apart 
from the affections, we now see a concerted effort to obtain good through the 
truths of the church from a natural application of the Word. This goal seems 
worthy to seek but lacking in discrimination and prudence. The truths of the 
Word were turned to the convenience of the moment as directed by the 
natural mind.

 To hide from the Lord at the bottom of the sea seems to be explained in this 
number from the Arcana: “...the hells of some appear...as deeps and as seas.... 
From those hells come the evil spirits that devastate... their phantasies...pour 

196

in.... That hell is called the ‘deep’ and that the foul emanations therefrom are 
called ‘rivers’...” (AC 756[2])

 Through all these conditions, it appears from the literal sense that the Lord is 
angry and is intent on slaying the Israelites. We know that it is not the Lord 
who is doing these things. It is the evil within them that is destroying them. 
The evil, in the Lord’s presence, is in anguish because of the purity of His 
Love and Wisdom, and it turns on itself and finds how empty and void its 
choices have been. For a brief moment, evil sees the horror of its insanity.

PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER

1. Psalm 139 beautifully reminds us that there is no place where we can escape 
the presence of the Lord. This chapter mentions ascending into heaven, 
having a bed in hell, taking the wings of the morning, the uttermost parts of 
the sea, tells us that darkness shall be as light to the Lord, and repeats the 
phrase, “You [the Lord] are there.” The words of this Psalm are offered in a 
comforting way. Now contrast that Psalm with this chapter from Amos. Is 
there a different message or tone? We may claim that we don’t feel Him near 
us, but the “distance” or absence of the Lord is our choice. If we move away 
from the Lord, we close ourselves off from His providential leading. However, 
the bottom line is that we can’t escape Him, and there will be a final judgment
for each of us. “He will be there.”

2. The insanity of those who reject the Lord’s Word must be “shaken.” The 

series of moments to eternity has to be considered more carefully. The choice
made in each moment will carry consequences. Prayerfully, we need to ask 
the Lord to guide our decision-making methods. We need to make corrections
as soon as we see our mistakes. But spiritual insanity gets so deeply 
imbedded in us, with the ill-fated logic of our proprium, that the “door posts” 
of the mind get log-jammed with falsity. Like a thick cloud, falsity cuts off the 
light of heaven. The Lord never ceases in His effort to restore us to our 
rightful mind. Will we allow Him to do that, or will we work in every way to 
run away from this necessary task?

3. The message of these verses seems to say, “Don’t ignore the way of the Lord. 

Take care of spiritual things as a priority of the highest order.”

QUESTIONS TO STIMULATE REFLECTION

1. How easy is it for us to imagine we act independently from the Lord? It 

appears that we do everything alone. The striking, the shaking, the being 

197

knocked down may seem like a mean act of the Lord. Being bitten by 
serpents, slain with swords, made captives, and made to mourn seems hard. 
Instead of meanness, there really is love. Spiritual reality has to remove evils. 
We must be shaken and humbled so that our selfish proprium will be put 
aside and replaced with the Lord’s Proprium. Such things must happen if the 
New Church is to come to us.

2. Do you feel comfortable explaining passages like this one to someone who 

says that God is a hard taskmaster? How would you explain them?

3. Do you remember the story of the man possessed with demons? (Mark 5:2-
14) He lived among the tombs, no chains could hold him, and no man could 
tame him. He cried in turmoil and cut himself with stones. When he saw 
Jesus, he ran to him for help. The Lord took pity on him and cast all of the 
demons into the swine. Can we see any application of that lesson to our text?
It is hell that does the hurting. Hell enjoys the misfortune of others. The Lord 
has infinite mercy and He wishes no one harm. It is our imperfect perception 
that leads us to picture the Lord as a hard taskmaster. What are some ways to 
correct that misperception?

5. We would do well to remind ourselves of this truth. Every day in thousands of
ways the Lord’s Divine Providence seeks to help us. If we could but see one 
way fully, we would be amazed at the care and detail He puts into caring for 
us. Not once does He try to frustrate or punish.
Instead of punishment, the Lord wants order. He wants to imprint His faith 
and charity in each of our hearts. Not everyone wills to cooperate with this 
goal, and the Lord seems unreasonable, hard, and cruel to them. They draw 
this conclusion because He seems to be interfering with their desire to avoid 
His influence and direction. What conversation might you have with someone
who is in this state?  How does it feel when you are in this state?

AMOS 9:6

“He who builds His layers in the sky,
And has founded His strata in the earth;
Who calls for the waters of the sea,
And pours them out on the face of the earth-
The Lord is His name.”

“It is said ‘go up on steps,’ for the reason that elevation to interior things 
appears in the world of spirits, where celestial and spiritual things are 
presented in forms like those of the world, as an ascent by steps. This 
representative it has often been given me to see. For this reason also it was 
that angels were seen by Jacob in his dream going up to the Lord by steps of a
ladder (Gen. xxviii. 12). Therefore also by ‘steps’ in the Word is signified 
ascent to higher things, that is, to interior things....” Amos 9:6 is quoted as a

of intelligence and wisdom of the spirits and angels. The stars there are 
knowledges of good and truth; and the clouds which are sometimes seen 
beneath the heaven are of various signification according to their colors, their

transparent from good.”  There are many passages cited, one of which is

DERIVED DOCTRINE

“His strata in the earth…”

 We are given an explanation of the Lord building His layers in the sky but 

nothing about the meaning of His “strata in the earth.” A reference in AC 2162
might help us see what this means. This number tells us that the heavens 
denote celestial and spiritual things “...thus all things which are of internal 
worship.... But the ‘earth’ is all lower things that correspond to... the lower 
rational and natural things, whereof also things celestial and spiritual are 
predicated from correspondence....also those in the church and in external 
worship, and in the literal sense of the Word; in short, all such things as 
proceed from things internal and are presented in things external....”

Pouring the Waters of the Sea on the Face of the Earth

 The order of the Lord is imprinted on everything created. Everything that has
being owes its very existence to the finition of His Divine Love and Wisdom.

 How can we illustrate this from the teachings of the Lord? The Pharisees 
came to the Lord to ask Him to quiet, or discipline, the people when they 
shouted, “Blessed be the King that cometh in the name of the Lord: peace in 
heaven, and glory in the highest.” (Luke 19:38)

 The profoundness of the Lord’s answer is awesome when we allow it to touch
our hearts. He said, “I tell you that, if these [the disciples] should hold their 
peace, the stones would immediately cry out.” (Luke 19:39)



 Earthly wisdom may seek to silence the beauty of the Lord’s glory.  Spiritually
blind eyes may refuse to see the truths that are all about them. But the Lord 
has poured out His truth over the whole earth so that even the “stones” give 
evidence of the infinite planning and order of the Lord. The denial of 
humanity will not quiet the work of the Lord.
Speaking of evidence, let’s consider this quote from The Canons of the New 
Church: “At this day nothing else than the self-evidencing reason of love will 
reestablish [the church], because they have fallen.” The hope for our internal 
church is that we will rekindle our love for the Lord so that our eyes will see 
the self-evidencing proof of God all around us, even in the “stones” of the 
earth.
“And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, and we beheld His glory, 
the glory as of the only begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth.” (John 
1:14)



PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER

1. P&P reminds us that it is the Lord who gives life and vitality to the church. It 
is not the buildings, not the priesthood, not the people nor the size of the 
congregation. “The whole of religion is founded upon [having as correct as 

200

possible] an idea of God.” If a church errs concerning its idea of God, it will err
concerning matters of faith. It will also err concerning charity and will know 
nothing of eternal life. Thus, the church will be in a thick darkness. (This is a 
summary of the introduction to The Canons of the New Church.)

2. The meaning of this verse seems so clear now. The Lord has ordered the 

heavens. He has given us the literal, spiritual, and celestial sense of the Word. 
He has eternal truths that will keep us in a state of growing forever. The 
power of His order may be seen in all the things of earth. He pours out His 
loving benefits to the whole universe. Our “cup runneth over.” Those who 
choose to miss the benefits of the Lord are like people who starve in the 
midst of spiritual plenty.

3. Our verse of study asks: “Who has done all of this?” We are given the answer: 
“The Lord is His name.” This closing sentence of our study verse calls us back 
to basics. “Be still, and know that I am God: I will be exalted...in all the earth.” 
(Psalm 46:10)  Let the contrite acknowledge the Lord’s endeavors by saying, 
“Amen,” for the word “amen” means “so be it.”
In the Doctrine of Faith 6, we read “...the ancients...instead of saying Faith, 
were accustomed to say Truth. For the same reason truth and faith are one 
word in the Hebrew language, namely Amuna or Amen.” Let the order of the 
Lord lead us into the mysteries of faith with understanding so that we may 
say Amen.

QUESTIONS TO STIMULATE REFLECTION

1. How do you understand the meaning of the phrase “self-evidencing reasons 
of love”? The Canons indicate it is a necessary element of faith to reestablish 
the light of the Lord within the church. Have you ever heard a doctrinal class 
on this subject?

2. See if you can pick out some examples of how self-evidencing reasons of love 
make all the difference in understanding the truths of the Lord. Think about 
your own experience with this.

3. What “stones” cry out, the truths of the Lord, when skeptics deny His glory 

and power?

4. How can we best assist the layers in the sky to be founded in the strata of the 

5.

earth? Do we do this when we unfold the inner sense of the Word?
If you were to pick the most important elements of your internal church, 
what would you choose and how would you rank them in importance? How 
can each of us keep our human “prudence” from over-riding the Lord’s will?

201

6. Did you note the difference in the quote of Amos 9:6 in the Writings? Our 
New King James translation says, “He...builds His layer...” and the Writings 
have the words “...go up on steps...” Any idea why there is such a difference in 
translations?

AMOS 9:7

The Philistines from Caphtor,

those who have been initiated into spiritual truths and goods by means of 
memory-truths. (That ‘the sons of Israel’ denote those who are in spiritual

Caphtor’ denote those who have been initiated into interior truths by means 
of exterior, but who have perverted them and applied them to confirm

DERIVED DOCTRINE

Children of Israel





Is there a reason the Lord addresses them, “O children of Israel....”? Children 
signify innocence, charity, good, truth, and the remains stored up in a person 
from infancy.
It seems appropriate to assume that the Word uses children to show us how 
the Lord from our childhood has touched that part of our heart that will 
listen and want to obey His gentle, wise, caring ways. The Lord is not absent 
from us for the least of a moment. “O children...” touches remains and tries to 
soften us to listen.

 Churches before the Israelites had made serious spiritual mistakes. The Lord 
wished the Israelites to take heed of them and not follow their folly. It was as 
if He said, “Do you need examples? If I point out the folly of earlier churches, 
will you listen and make appropriate changes?” This is what I hear in this 
verse. How about you?
“Look at the Ethiopians! Look at the Philistines! Look at the Syrians! Do you 
want to be like them?”



o Ethiopians, in the “bad sense, signify the interior knowledges of the 

Word applied to confirm false principles.” (AC 1164)

o Philistines “represent those who conceive false principles and reason 
thence concerning spiritual things which overflow man.” (AC 705)

o Syrians, in a “bad” sense represent the abuse and misuse of the 

knowledge of good. (AC 3762)

A Reminder of the Escape from Egypt

 The Lord also reminds the Israelites that He brought them out of the land of 

Egypt. Could the reminder of this fact indicate that the Israelites thought that 
they had won their own strength and accomplishments? Were they on the 
brink of ingratitude?

 Bringing up Israel from the land of Egypt signifies leaving behind memory-
knowledges that had no feeling or meaning to them. Put another way, the 
Lord wanted them to move from historical faith toward a true faith that was 
drawn from the Word. The Lord wanted them to have a commitment to the 
things of faith so that they would honestly appreciate them. (See AC 1541, 
4735[15], AE 654 for further illustration of these ideas.)

203

PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER

1. The words that ring out in my mind about this verse are these: (They) “talked

much about faith...and yet had no life of faith.” The Lord, in this verse, 
reminds us that prior churches talked much about faith. They emphasized the
idea that knowing many things would bring about salvation. There were 
those who talked about how much they knew, but there was no life in what 
they knew because they twisted the truth to confirm evils and falsities to 
justify their ends. There was no life in their faith. This is a sad commentary on
the former churches. Israel, too, was on the brink of meeting the same end.
The perversion of truth for selfish ends stifles the spiritual life. The corrupt 
external initiates a series of consequences that layer over the wonderful 
potential of interior things. The outer lies prevent the inner conatus 
(endeavor) from manifesting itself in uses for the Lord and the neighbor.
2. The concern of the Lord and His mercy is forever recorded in His words, “O 

children of Israel.” These words are a loving Divine appeal to the innocence in
the souls of all His children. It is a reminder to all that we each have the 
potential to become an angel of the Lord if we become like “little children.”

3. This verse asks a question of great importance. Will we learn from the 

mistakes of those who tried to gain salvation from cold and indifferent facts 
passed on by tradition or lore? Are we in a state to learn these things?

READ AND REVIEW

Read Amos 9:7.

Read the summary from P&P.

QUESTIONS TO STIMULATE REFLECTION

1.

In Amos 9:7, there is a series of nations (churches) mentioned: the 
Ethiopians, the children of Israel, the Egyptians, the Philistines from Caphtor, 
and the Syrians from Kir. Have you taken notes on the meaning of that series 
from AC 9340[6]? What downward progression of each church did you note?

2. To get a glimpse of Ethiopia in its prime, turn to AC 116 and 349 to read 

about the wonderful things they possessed in the beginning of their church. 
As a contrast read, AE 780[5] to see what they were like after they turned 
away from the Lord. Can you get any sense of what went wrong with them?
3. The Philistines represent those who hold false ideas and then reason about 
spiritual things from those false ideas. (AC 705) Have you ever done this? 
How easy is it to do? How may we avoid making the same mistakes?
4. Syria signifies those of the second Ancient Church in respect to their 

knowledges of good and truth. (AE 195[8]) The Ancient Word existed in 
Syria. (Doctrine of Sacred Scripture 102) How did they lose such gifts? With 
their knowledge of the Ancient Word, it is both sad and perplexing to read 

204

that they falsified the Word for selfish reasons. What do you think we must do
to keep from repeating the mistakes of the prior churches?

5. Do we as a church talk about what we know but have no life in our faith? Or 

do we feel the indescribable power of the Word and Lord to lift us to spiritual 
heights where we see the dazzling spectrum of the Lord’s beauty and order? 
Is this a personal or organizational state?

6. Look up the word “enthusiasm” in a dictionary. Note that we are told the 

word means: to be inspired; to be possessed by God; transported; to have an 
ardent zeal or fervor. It seems that we would do well to seek the right kind of 
enthusiasm for the Lord that would inspire us to invite Him into our lives so 
that we might be “possessed” by His order. Does this sound like evangelical or
“born again” type of thinking? I think the New Church could use some feeling 
of excitement or enthusiasm. What do you think?

AMOS 9:8-10

“Behold, the eyes of the Lord God are on the sinful kingdom,
And I will destroy it from the face of the earth;
Yet I will not utterly destroy the house of Jacob,”
Says the Lord.
“For surely I will command,
And will sift the house of Israel among the nations,
As a grain is sifted in a sieve;
Yet not the smallest grain shall fall to the ground.
All the sinners of My people shall die by the sword,
Who say, ‘The calamity shall not overtake nor confront us.’”



“They who know nothing of the internal sense of the Word cannot believe

themselves believed....Hence also it is that most persons in the Christian 
world also believe that that nation will again be chosen, and will then be 
brought back into the land of Canaan, and this also according to the sense of 
the letter, as in many passages....” Amos 9:8, 9 are cited among the many 
passages given in this number.

205



In the closing paragraph of this number, we read: “From all of this it can now 
be seen that the Israelitish and Jewish nation was not chosen, and still less 
that it will be chosen; and also that there was not anything of the church with 
it, nor could be, but only the representative of a church; and that the reason 
why it has been preserved even to this day, has been for the sake of the Word 
of the Old Testament.”

DERIVED DOCTRINE

“The eyes of the Lord are on the sinful kingdom....”

 AR 48 gives us a wide range of correspondences for “eyes” in the Word. When
a human being’s eyes are mentioned, it refers to human understanding and 
intelligence. “...when spoken of the Lord, the Divine wisdom is meant; but by a
‘flame of fire,’ is signified spiritual love, which is charity; wherefore, when 
spoken of the Lord, the Divine love is meant...that by ‘eye,’ when predicated of
the Lord, His Divine wisdom...His Divine omniscience and providence....” are 
signified.

 Using this quote, we can understand that it was not Divine anger at work but 
Divine Love, Wisdom, Omniscience, and Providence looking at the sinfulness 
of Israel. They were focused on finite goals whereas the Lord wanted them to 
focus on eternal goals. To those with finite priorities, it appears that God is 
angry and vindictive. “Hence I (the Lord) will destroy it from the face of the 
earth....” describes the way an unregenerate person perceives the operation of
the Lord’s love.

The Face of the Earth

 What is meant by “the face of the earth...”? There is an interesting teaching 
expressed in AC 358: “The face, with the ancients, signified internal things, 
because internal things shine forth through the face; and in the most ancient 
times men were such that the face was in perfect accord with the internals.... 
They considered it a monstrous thing to show one thing by the face and think 
another.”

 Could the above quote be a direct teaching from the Lord that the Israelitish 

church would not be allowed to continue its practice of saying one thing with 
the lips and believing another thing in their hearts? Was the Lord telling them
that the reign of hypocrisy was over?

The House of Jacob

 Why was the “house of Jacob” not utterly destroyed? A house in its positive 
sense represents a mind in which there is intelligence and wisdom. A house 
also contains affections which are of the will. (AC 1488) But in reality, 

206

whenever one church comes to an end, the Lord provides that a remnant is 
saved so as to continue, or build, His church anew. (AE 407 & 676)

 Also Micah 5:7-8 speaks of “...the remnant of Jacob shall be in the midst of 
many people as a dew from the Lord, as the showers upon the grass...the 
remnant of Jacob shall be among the Gentiles in the midst of many people....” 
(AE 278)

 The “house of Jacob” represents the “external church” and the “house of 

Israel” represents the “internal church.” (AC 5550)

 What then is the Lord teaching us about the “house of Jacob”? As we might 

expect, the meaning is deep and fully involved with all of the history of Jacob 
and his children. But consider the following quote as a possible indicator of 
the core of deeper things: “...Jacob represented...the Lord’s natural; and as 
where Jacob is treated of...in the internal sense the Lord is treated of, and 
how He made His natural Divine....” Is the promise that the “house of Jacob” 
would not be destroyed a promise that the Lord’s advent would overcome the
idolatrous worship of the previous churches so that the New Church might 
become the “crown of all churches”? Is it a story of His natural serving a use 
prior to being glorified? Later in Jacob’s life, he was told, “Thy name shall no 
longer be called Jacob, but Israel.” (Genesis 32:26) This is a movement from 
being a representative of the external church to becoming a representative of 
the internal church.

 “Sifting” the House of Israel Among all Nations

 Let’s first consider the meaning of “all nations.” AC 249 says that a passage 

from Micah 7:16 where “nations” is mentioned represents those who trust in 
their own proprium. In AC 622, “nations” represents evils that are of the will, 
or of cupidities. Nations therefore seems to represent a vast network of 
proprial desires that are so integrated into the lives of people that only the 
Lord can “sort things out.” It is comforting to know that the Lord will not be 
fooled by appearances. He can distinguish between what is and what is not. 
He will sort out things that confound the wisest civil laws and the best human
prudence. True justice in the hands of the Lord will be given to everyone. No 
one will be able to claim that the Lord treated him or her unfairly. Our 
emotional “Gordian knots” will be unwrapped, and there will be nothing left 
unattended among “all nations.” 

 These insights give us a clearer picture of why the Lord said He would sift the
nations, the mind, the proprium, the cupidities, to remove the “chaff from the 
wheat.”

 AC 9726 explains a passage from Exodus 27:4, “And thou shalt make for it a 

grating, a network.” The grating represents “...as it were (sifting and 
separating) the things which enter into man and are presented to the 
understanding and the will, thus truths and goods.”  

207

“...not the smallest grain shall fall to the ground.”

 This is like the verse in the Word that reminds us that nothing escapes the 
Lord’s notice. Even the hairs of our head are numbered. There is not a 
sparrow that falls to the ground but the Lord knows. We might wish 
otherwise so that we could escape accountability, but the Lord’s omniscience 
is beyond human comprehension. Not even the smallest grain shall fall to the 
ground. The Divine sieve works to remove the useless and to protect the 
potential of the smallest seeds, just as He did for the mustard seed. It was 
able to grow beyond expectations.

“All the sinners of My people shall die by the sword”

 To get help with the internal sense, we can read AC 2799[20&21]. “...the 

‘sword’ denoting the punishment of falsity.... The angel of Jehovah standing in 
the way against Balaam with a drawn sword (Numbers xxii. 31) signified the 
truth which resisted the falsity in which Balaam was; and for that reason also 
he was killed with a sword.... That a ‘sword’ in the genuine sense signifies 
truth combating, and in the opposite sense falsity combating, also the 
vastation of truth, and the punishment of falsity....”

 Those who are opposed to the Lord’s truth see nothing of what is good and 
true. When they are shown the error of their ways, they prefer falsity and 
defiantly demonstrate a contrary spirit against the Lord. (AR 309)

 The mental picture I get is that they are so angry with the Lord’s truth that 

they rush upon the “sword” to destroy themselves instead of admitting their 
falsity. They prefer to die by the sword then to be defended by the Lord.

 How do we see that the explanation above might be so? Listen to the words of
the people. “The calamity shall not overtake nor confront us.” Their haughty, 
contemptuous, proud words seem to defy the Lord’s prophecy.

 These words speak a form of “denial” that seems so human. Turning away 
from issues, refusing to admit them, or blaming others just doesn’t work. 
Eventually we have to deal with the results of unbridled behavior. Evil seeks 
to hurt and destroy us. Ignoring disorder is not a part of regeneration.

 Putting It All Together

1. The summary of this section, by now, should be pretty clear. Those in the 
church (any church) who refuse to obey the Lord’s Word will “perish” 
spiritually. The Lord will not be fooled with any teaching or tradition about 
“specialness.” There are no chosen people. Salvation is not a “right” earned by
giving money to build ornate houses of worship. From the beginning of this 
study, we have been made mindful of the need to love the Lord and His ways. 
Love truth for truth’s sake, and do not twist the Word to excuse or justify the 
desires of self.

208

2. The correspondence of the sifting of nations through the Divine sieve so that 
nothing (the smallest grain) goes to waste is a wonderful reminder that the 
Lord sees and knows all. The story of the widow’s mite is a worthy example 
of this.
The thought, the look, the touch, the kind word we offer might be the small 
grain that becomes the mustard tree that provides branches for the birds to 
build nests and to hatch their young.  As a secular song says, “Little things 
mean a lot.”

READ AND REVIEW

QUESTIONS TO STIMULATE REFLECTION

1. The Writings teach that the advent of the Lord takes place every time the 
Word is read with love. Do you see these verses as a theme of the Lord’s 
advent and glorification?

2. We have considered this theme before: What can we do to break down or 

soften our stubbornness? Why is it that we have a love for what is forbidden? 
Some have described this as a “command-resistance” act to demonstrate our 
proprial freedom. Is our insistence on “freedom” all bad? Couldn’t that 
longing to be free also come from a “healthy urging” that is planted by the 
Lord? “As of self” is a useful tool in regeneration. Discuss the different types 
of freedom.

3. How do you picture life’s emotional “Gordian knots” being unwrapped by the 
Lord’s loving Wisdom? Have you ever been frustrated with situations that 
seem to offer no solvable answers to troublesome issues? Do you look 
forward to the “time” when all will be settled with no “backlash” effects?
4. The quote from P&P says the “church will not perish, but that those perish 
who are in the church.” Does this remind you of what happened to the 
children of Israel in the wilderness? Those who sinned against the Lord 
roamed and roamed for 40 years. When they had all died, then the Lord led 
the remaining generations into the Promised Land.  What are some ways that 
we distinguish between the church and its members? How about the 
distinction between the spiritual church and the human organization on 
earth?

And repair its damages;

209

And all the Gentiles who are called by My name,”

“In Amos: (ix. 11, 12)...the ‘tabernacle of David’ denotes the church and 
worship of the Lord; the ‘remnant of Edom,’ those who are in good within the 
church; the ‘nations that were called by His name’ those who are in good out 
of the church.”

AC 4391[4]



“...in Amos ix. 11...to ‘set up the tent of David that is fallen,’ denotes to restore 
the holy of truth after it has perished; ‘David’ denotes the Lord relatively to 
Divine truth...for a ‘king’ denotes Divine truth.... As a ‘tent’ signified the holy of
truth, and ‘dwelling in tents,’ the derivative worship...”

AC 4926[3]



“In Amos ix. 11...[this passage is] describing the church which is in good, the 
‘tent of David that is fallen’ being the good of love and charity from the 
Lord....and that ‘David’ is the Lord.... To ‘fence up the breaches’ means to 
amend the falsities which have entered by the separation of truth from good; 
‘to build it according to the days of eternity’ denotes according to the state of 

210

the church in ancient times; that state and those times are called in the Word 
the ‘days of an age,’ and also ‘of generation and generation’...”

AC 9163[5]



“...‘In that day will I raise up the tent of David that is fallen, and close up the 
fractures thereof; I will set up again its ruins, and I will build them as the days
of eternity (Amos ix. 11); ‘the house of David,’ and ‘the tent of David,’ denote 
the church of the Lord, for ‘David,’ in the prophetic Word, denotes the Lord....”

AC 10248[8]



“...where by ‘the days of an age’ is meant the time of the Most Ancient Church, 
which was celestial.” Amos 9:11 is the verse being explained.

AC 10545[7]



“...the ‘tent of David’ denotes the church of the Lord and what is holy of the 
worship of Him; ‘to close up the breaches, and restore the ruins’ denotes to 
restore these by removing falsities. That ‘David’ in the Word denotes the 
Lord...hence it is that ‘the tent of David’ denotes the church of the Lord, and 
that which is holy of worship.” This passage is in explanation of Amos 9:11.

AE 799[19]



“That a ‘tent’ signifies the church in respect to the truths of doctrine....” Amos 
9:11 is cited.

AR 704



In AR 704, a long series of quotes from the Word are given “...in which the 
Lord’s coming and the New Church from Him at that time are meant by ‘the 
day of Jehovah’...” Amos 9:11, 13 are within that series of references given 
from the Word.

DERIVED DOCTRINE

“On that day I will rise up....”

 Let’s focus on the words “on that day...” because they differ from “the days of 

old,” the “day of vengeance,” or the “day of wrath.” Checking the 
correspondence of to “rise up” might give us a clue. AC 4160 tells us that “to 
rise” signifies to reveal or to discover. AC 2218 teaches us that when people 
“rise up,” it signifies that perception has come to an end.

211

 Could this portion of the prophecy be a combination of both things 

mentioned in the quotes above? The Lord saw Israel’s movement away from 
Him. He witnessed the flickering light of inner perception fading away until 
darkness filled the mind. “On this day,” the Lord was going to reveal (let them 
discover) just how far they had moved away from Him.

Gentiles

 The Writings describe Gentiles as “...various forms of worship among those 
remote peoples who lived in mutual charity.” (AC 1158) In another quote, 
Gentiles “signify all who are in the good of love to the Lord.” (AE175[2])  
Gentiles also represent “those who are in good out of the church.” (AC 
3322[4])

PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER

The Lord’s words are quite plain and straightforward. He tells us that:

 A New Church will be instituted that will acknowledge Him.
 The tabernacle of celestial and holy things of worship will be restored.
 The Lord will raise the church up from the mental and spiritual ruins.
 The church will be built like the days of the Most Ancient Church.
 The New Church will have the restored truths to work with.
 The church’s love will be freed of self-love.
 The church fences will have the breaches (infractions of Divine order) 

mended.

Most of all there is given a prophecy, a new song, of hope. There is a call for a rally of 
the faithful to come around Him. A beginning. A church whose kingdom will be 
forever and ever. “Come and taste and see that the Lord is good.”

QUESTIONS TO STIMULATE REFLECTION

In Revelation 6:10, we find a picture of those who had been slain for the Word of God
gathered for the opening of the fifth seal. They were yearning for the day when the 
Lord would avenge their abuse. They asked the Lord, “How long, O Lord, holy and 
true, until You judge and avenge our blood on those who dwell on the earth?”

212

1. After reading this prophecy in Amos, do you feel the same kind of modified 
question forming in your mind? “How long, Oh Lord, holy and true, until…” 
You bring the promised New Church to those who dwell on the earth?

2. We seem so small and so diversified as a church organization We long for the 
truths to take hold and spread. The delay, we are taught in the Writings, is for 
a purpose. Slow growth is necessary. Growth of the church must occur for the
right reasons. Yet how long will it be? 

AMOS 9:13-15

“Behold, the days are coming,” says the Lord,
“When the plowman shall overtake the reaper,
And the treader of grapes him who sows seed:
The mountains shall drip with sweet wine,
And all the hills shall flow with it
I will bring back the captives of My people Israel;
They shall build the waste cities and inhabit them;
They shall plant vineyards and drink wine from them;
They shall also make gardens and eat fruit from them.
I will plant them in their land, and no longer shall they be pulled up
From the land I have given them,”
Says the Lord your God.

PASSAGES FROM THE WRITINGS

P&P



“…that in it (the church) there will be the doctrine of truth and its 
understanding, vers. 13-15…”

AR 704



“That ‘the great day of God Almighty’ signifies the coming of the Lord, and 
then the New Church, is evident from many passages in the Word, as from 
these:- [Amos 9:11, 13 are cited among the many references.]”

AE 433 [27]



“From this it can be seen how far from the truth those have wondered, who 
believe that at the end of time the Jews will be converted to the Lord and 
brought back into the land of Canaan. Those who have hitherto so believed 
are excusable, because they have known nothing of the spiritual sense of the 
Word, and therefore have not known that the ‘land’ signifies the church, 
‘Jerusalem’ the church in respect to doctrine, ‘Israel’ those who are of the 
spiritual church, and ‘Judah’ those who are of the celestial church; also that 

213

bringing them into the land of Canaan is treated of in the prophets, bringing 
the faithful into heaven and into the church is meant. This took place when 
the Lord came into the world, for then all those who lived in the good of 
charity and had worshiped God under a human form were brought into 
heaven; these had been preserved under heaven until the Lord came, and 
when He glorified His Human they were brought in. These are the ones meant
in many passages in the prophetic Word that treat of the captivity of the sons 
of Israel and Judah, and their being brought back into their land.” Among the 
many passages offered, Amos 9: 12-15 is cited.

AC 6435 [10]



“...‘mountains’ denote celestial love, and ‘hills’ spiritual love...in these passages
the goods of celestial love are signified by ‘mountains;’ and likewise by ‘hills,’ 
but in a lower degree.” Amos 9:13 is cited as one reference.

AC 5117[7]



“In Amos...it treats here of the setting up of the spiritual church, which is thus 
described–the conjunction of spiritual good with its truth by the ‘ploughman 
reaching the reaper;’ and the conjunction of spiritual truth with its good by 
the ‘treader’ of grapes reaching him that draweth the seed;’ the goods of the 
love and charity therefrom are signified by the ‘mountains dropping new 
wine and the hills melting;’ ‘bringing back the captivity of the people’ denotes
deliverance from falsities; ‘building the waste cities’ denotes rectifying the 
falsified doctrinals of truth; ‘inhabiting them and planting vineyards’ denotes 
cultivating those things which are of the spiritual church; ‘drinking the wine 
thereof,’ appropriating the truths of that church which are of charity; and 
‘making clusters and eating the fruit of them,’ appropriating the goods thence
derived. Every one can see that ‘building cities,’ ‘planting vineyards,’ ‘drinking
wine,’ ‘making clusters,’ and ‘eating the fruit of them,’ are merely natural 
things, in which there would be nothing Divine unless they contained a 
spiritual sense.” Amos 9:13, 14 are cited.

AC 6377 [8]



“That ‘wine’ denotes the good of love and of faith, is plain from the Lord’s 
words which He said of wine when He instituted the Holy Supper...which He 
would give to those who are of His kingdom.” Amos 9:13, 14 are cited.

AR 316



“...that ‘wine’ signifies truth from...good, is evident from the following 
passages...” Amos 9:13, 14 are cited.

214

AR 336



“It is because the habitations of the angels are upon mountains and hills, that 
‘mountains’ and ‘hills’ in the Word signify heaven and the church, where 
there exists love to the Lord and love to the neighbor, and, in the opposite 
sense, hell, where there exists self-love and the love of the world...[this] is 
evident from the following passages...” Amos 9:13, 14 are cited.

AE 405[19]



“In Amos...‘The mountains’ are said ‘to drop sweet wine,’ and ‘the hills to 
dissolve,’ because ‘mountains’ signify the good of love to the Lord, and ‘hills’ 
the good of charity towards the neighbor, and ‘sweet wine’ truths; therefore 
these words signify that from these two goods they shall have truths in 
abundance, for the bringing back of the people from captivity, about which 
this is said, signifies the establishment of a new church.” Amos 9:13, 14 are 
cited.

AE 376[6]



“In Amos...ix. 13-15...This chapter treats first of the vastation of the church, 
and then of its restoration by the Lord; and ‘the people Israel’ do not mean 
that people, but those with whom the church was to be established; and ‘the 
ploughman shall overtake the reaper, and the treader of grapes him that 
draweth forth the seed,’ signifies that he who receives good and truth shall 
also perform uses, or bear fruit, thus that with the man of the church the two 
shall be present at the same time; ‘the mountains shall drop down sweet 
wine, and all the hills shall dissolve,’ signifies, as just above, that from the 
good of love to the Lord and from the good of charity towards the neighbor 
there shall be truths in abundance, ‘sweet wine’ here, or ‘wine,’ meaning 
truth; that ‘the captivity of the people Israel shall be brought back’ signifies 
the restoration of the church among the Gentiles, for ‘captivity’ means 
spiritual captivity, in which those are who are remote from goods and truths, 
and yet in a desire for them (see A.C., n. 9164). ‘The waste cities that they 
shall build’ signify the doctrinals of truth and good from the Word, before 
destroyed and at that time to be restored; ‘the vineyards which they shall 
plant,’ and ‘the wine of which they shall drink,’ signify all things of the church 
from which there is intelligence, ‘a vineyard’ signifies the spiritual church, 
and therefore ‘vineyards’ signify all things of the church; ‘wine’ signifies the 
truth of the church in general, and ‘to drink it’ signifies to be instructed and 
become intelligent, thus intelligence; and ‘the gardens which they shall make, 
and the fruit of which they shall eat,’ signifies wisdom, ‘gardens’ meaning all 
things of intelligence, and their ‘fruit’ signifying the goods of life, thus ‘to eat 
their fruit’ signifies the appropriation of good, thus wisdom, for wisdom 
comes when truths are committed to the life; and because this is what is 
meant, therefore it is said of Israel, ‘I will plant them upon their ground.”

215

AC 1069[3]



“‘Planting vineyards’ denotes the planting of the spiritual church; thus a 
‘vineyard’ means the spiritual church, or Israel.” This quote follows the citing 
of Amos 9:14.

AC 1071[5]



“In Amos...ix. 14...This is said of the spiritual church, or ‘Israel,’ of which 
planting vineyards and drinking the wine thereof is predicated, when it 
becomes such as to have faith from charity.”

AR 90



“Wisdom and intelligence are also signified by ‘garden’ in...Amos ix, 14...The 
man of the church is also like a garden as to intelligence, when he is in the 
good of love from the Lord, because the spiritual heat which vivifies him is 
love, and the spiritual light is intelligence therefrom. It is known that gardens 
in this world flourish by means of heat and light; it is the same in heaven.”

TCR 467[4]



“Elsewhere in the Word ‘garden’ signifies intelligence (as in...Amos ix. 14...)

in the Word where ‘vineyard’ is mentioned (as in...Amos ix. 14...).”

DERIVED DOCTRINE

It would appear that we have little need to turn to derived doctrine for help. 
We have enough direct teachings as our source to help us with our summary 
and application section. Our sixteen references explain just about all of the 
major points of the verses, helping us to frame up the internal sense. Once 
again, if anyone finds additional reference numbers, please share them in the 
discussion period.

PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER

1. Contrasts are an essential part of any learning process. If you were to read 
books about Amos written by people who are not members of the New 
Church, the commentary on this last chapter would be filled with statements 
like this one:
Israel will in that day be restored from centuries-long captivity to rebuild her 
cities and inhabit them with the enjoyment of her vineyards and her 
gardens...Then Israel will be planted and rooted in her own land...never more 
plucked up and uprooted from her God-given land. The day of exile, thank 
God, will be past.... God’s heart is full of good things in store for Israel. (This 
quote is taken from page 124 of The Minor Prophets, by Charles L. Feinberg, 
Moody Press.)

2. The Writings, on the other hand, remark that Israel (and the Jewish nation) 
“was not chosen, and still less that it will be chosen...” Israel was only “the 
representative of a church...” (AC 7051)
Instead, the closing prophecy in Amos is about the Lord. It is about His 
coming into the world to glorify His Human. Those who had been preserved 
(the remnant), those who had remained faithful, are the ones who are to be 
brought back into the land. This closing prophecy is about the New Church. 
The promise of sweet wine, the hills flowing with the abundance of wine, the 
planting, the gardens, being fed, refer to the gifts the New Church will enjoy.
Put simply, the Lord is promising to restore the spiritual gifts of love and 
wisdom. Balance, conjunction, and elevation of heart and mind will help us 
see what is planted in the restored land of our captivity. We are to see the 
beauty and order of the gardens. We will taste the wine of the mountains. No 
longer will Hell be able to pull up the resources of the Lord. The New Church 
will be the crown of all churches whose kingdom shall reign forever and ever. 
Amen!

QUESTIONS TO STIMULATE REFLECTION

1. Have you heard recently anyone speaking about Israel being the chosen 

people? Have you ever heard someone describe the chaos in the Middle East 
as a sign that the end of the world is coming?  What do you think about this?
2. How might this “chosen people” concept interfere with our understanding of 
the internal sense? When we understand the internal sense, how is this 
concept a part of it?
Is there a sense of excitement as you read this final section of Amos? Why?

3.

217

4. After reading all of the hard messages directed to the unfaithful, isn’t it 

wonderful to end with an uplifting message about the Lord coming to our 
rescue with a permanence and victory? The hells do not prevail. The hells are 
not stronger than the Lord. The effort to remain faithful pays off. What were 
we worried about? Should we have been so unsure of ourselves and the Lord?
How can we hold onto this triumphant state during times when it doesn’t 
seem visible?

5. Doesn’t this final chapter do a lot in restoring our confidence in the 

inevitability of the New Church?  Let’s talk about this.

218

Epilogue: A Summary of the Nine Chapters of Amos

The following summaries draw and expand on the outline given in “Summary 
Exposition of the Prophets and Psalms.”

CHAPTER ONE

The message of this chapter outlines what happens to a church (or individual) when 
it perverts the Word and turns aside the goods of spiritual knowledge. Those who 
intend to “turn aside” the Word do violence to the literal sense. Those who “turn 
aside” the Word are likened to an army that flees in the day of combat and 
capitulates because it does not use the Lord’s resources.

CHAPTER TWO

Adulterating the good of the literal sense will corrupt the church. The fatalities of 
adulteration are both the celestial (love) and spiritual (wisdom) that are within or 
available to the church. Adulteration of the things of the church is like a person who 
is in “possession of truth and yet is without truth.” Adulterating the good of the 
literal harms the sense of judgment for the church, or person, and ultimately, that 
church or person will perish.

CHAPTER THREE

A church cannot serve two masters. It cannot peacefully coexist with truths and 
falsities. To want to live with both and to seek a compromise will cause the church to
be laid to waste. The church will perish, and the goods and truths of the Word will be
taken away from it.

CHAPTER FOUR

Compromise will pervert doctrine of the church. The “sensual scientifics” that result 
from such perversions will obfuscate external worship to give the appearance that 
all is well. Seemingly plausible reasons for the perversions were woven into the 
externals of worship. But when the Lord looked at the heart of things, He saw death 
and told the Israelites there was no “power” in their truths. The Lord exhorted them 
to turn back to Him before they became like people with “no teeth.”

219

CHAPTER FIVE

Self intelligence will lay the Church to waste. The Lord, once again, exhorted the 
Israelites to return. If they continued in their ways, it would lead them into all ruin. 
He told them their worship was not acceptable. If they would turn back to the 
essentials, He would lead them to “acceptable” worship, and they would once again 
possess the good and truth. Otherwise, they would be deprived of every knowledge 
of truth and good.

CHAPTER SIX

Israel’s choices had made it the worst religious system among the nations. What 
made this so sad was that they possessed an “abundance [of] all things of the 
church.” To continue as they were would cause all spiritual things to perish, 
insomuch that “nothing would remain.” The Lord told them that they had no one to 
blame but themselves. “...they have acquired these things to themselves from self.”

CHAPTER SEVEN

The organized church was increasing from externals to externals. The course of their 
actions could lead but to one thing: corruption and breaches that would end with 
the destruction of internal or inmost things. Their decisions were against God and 
doctrine. The church with all things belonging to it would “perish.”

CHAPTER EIGHT

The Lord was not going to sit by and watch the church die. He revealed to the 
Israelites that He was going to bring about a change. Here is the promise made: a 
“new [element] of the church will arise.” The old church would end, but with a 
remnant, the coming of the Lord and the glorification of His Human would 
successfully establish a New Church.

CHAPTER NINE

The Last Judgment would be thorough. None of the perpetrators of evil responsible 
for the demise of the church would escape the Last Judgment. Prior churches had 
followed a similar path of spiritual ruination. But this time, the new church would 
not degenerate as the others had. The Lord announced to Israel that a church would 
arise that will not perish. This New Church will worship and acknowledge the Lord. 
It will have soundness of doctrine and understanding, new wine, new gardens, and 
the abundance and beauty of the Lord’s restoration of His Church.
