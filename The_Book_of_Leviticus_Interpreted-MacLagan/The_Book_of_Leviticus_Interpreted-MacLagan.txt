Leviticus Chapter 1

Summary of the Spiritual Sense

1. The Lord must be worshiped from natural and spiritual good together, vers. 1-2. 
2. But worship is first from natural good, or affection, in the order of time, vers. 3-9. 
3. Secondly, it is from spiritual affection, vers. 10-13. 
4. And thirdly, from the same affections on a lower plane, vers. 14-17. 

The Contents of each Verse

1. AND the LORD called to Moses, and 
spoke to him out of the tent of 
meeting, saying, 

1. There is influx from the Lord through the heavens,
by means of Divine Truth, or the Word, giving the 
perception,

2. Speak to the children of Israel, and 
say to them, When any man of you 
offers an oblation to the LORD, you 
shall offer your oblation of the cattle,
even of the herd and of the flock. 

3.

If his oblation be a burnt offering of 
the herd, he shall offer it a male 
without blemish: he shall offer it at 
the door of the tent of meeting, that 
he may be accepted before the LORD.

4. And he shall lay his hand upon the 
head of the burnt offering; and it 
shall he accepted for him to make 
atonement for him. 

2. That such influx is for the instruction of the man 
of the Spiritual Church, enabling him to see that, 
in every act of worship by the acknowledgement 
of the Lord, and by the consecration of the 
affections to Him, these must be natural and 
spiritual.

3. And if the Lord is worshiped from the natural 

affection of good, wholly devoted to Him, it shall 
be by means of truths, purified from falsity or evil,
or by genuine truths, and with the 
acknowledgement that the Lord alone gives man 
power so to worship by influx through the 
heavens; for this only is acceptable.

4. Also such worship shall be with all the power of 
the will and understanding, communicated from 
the Internal, in which case it is acceptable to the 
Lord, because thereby evil is removed and 
conjunction with the Internal is effected.

5. And he shall kill the bullock before 
the LORD: and Aaron's sons, the 
priests, shall present the blood, and 
sprinkle the blood round about upon 
the altar that is at the door of the tent
of meeting. 

5. Moreover, such natural affection shall be prepared 
by self-denial for the worship of the Lord; and by 
truths derived from good and conjoined therewith, 
shall charity be acknowledged to be from the Lord
externally and internally, in order to gain 
admission to heaven.

3

6. And he shall flay the burnt offering, 

and cut it into its pieces. 

7. And the sons of Aaron the priest 

shall put fire upon the altar, and lay 
wood in order upon the fire: 

8. And Aaron's sons, the priests, shall 
lay the pieces, the head, and the fat, 
in order upon the wood that is on the
fire which is upon the altar: 

9. But its inwards and its legs shall he 
wash with water: and the priest shall 
burn the whole on the altar, for a 
burnt offering, an offering made by 
fire, of a sweet savour to the LORD. 

10. And if his oblation be of the flock, of
the sheep, or of the goats, for a burnt
offering; he shall offer it a male 
without blemish. 

11. And he shall kill it on the side of the 
altar north-ward before the LORD: 
and Aaron's sons, the priests, shall 
sprinkle its blood upon the altar 
round about. 

6. Also from such natural affection shall all falsity be
separated; and the truths relating to it will then be 
distinctly arranged by the Lord in order under their
own good.

7. Also by truths derived from and conjoined with 
good, shall the Lord be worshiped from love, at 
the same time that it is done by man as from 
himself, or as if he claimed merit for his worship.

8. Also by truth derived from good and conjoined 
therewith, shall perfect arrangement take place, 
and a perfect distinction be made between truth 
and good, and between the good of merit and the 
good of love in the worship of the Lord.

9. But sensuous feelings and thoughts exterior and 

interior, shall be purified by the application of the 
truth in the work of repentance; and then the 
whole natural man may be devoted to the Lord in 
worship from good or from pure love, which will 
be grateful and acceptable to the Lord, and 
productive of heavenly rest and peace.

10. Again, if the worship of the Lord be from spiritual

affection, that is, either from charity or from the 
faith of charity, and the spiritual man be wholly 
consecrated to the Lord, it shall also be by means 
of truths purified from evil.

11. And such spiritual affection shall be prepared for 

worship by truths adapted for that purpose; and 
then by truths derived from good and conjoined 
therewith, shall holy charity be acknowledged to 
be from the Lord and to promote conjunction with 
Him.

12. And he shall cut it into its pieces, 

12. Also a proper arrangement of truths shall take 

with its head and its fat: and the 
priest shall lay them in order on the 
wood that is on the fire which is 
upon the altar: 

place; truth shall be accurately distinguished from 
good; and the good of merit shall be distinguished 
from the good of love, in the pure worship of the 
Lord.

4

13. But the inwards and the legs shall he 
wash with water: and the priest shall 
offer the whole, and burn it upon the 
altar: it is a burnt offering, an 
offering made by fire, of a sweet 
savour to the LORD. 

14. And if his oblation to the LORD be a 
burnt offering of birds, then he shall 
offer his oblation of turtledoves, or 
of young pigeons. 

13. And sensuous feelings and thoughts interior and 

exterior shall be purified by the application of the 
truth in the work of repentance; and then the 
whole spiritual man may be devoted to the Lord in
worship from good or from pure love, which will 
be grateful and acceptable to the Lord, and 
productive of heavenly rest and peace.

14. And thirdly, if the worship of the Lord be from the
understanding, then it shall be from the truth or 
good of faith.

15. And the priest shall bring it to the 

altar, and wring off its head, and 
burn it on the altar; and the blood 
thereof shall be drained out on the 
side of the altar: 

15. And in this case it is from the principle of good 
and not from good itself; but it is sanctified by 
influx from the Divine Love, and charity is 
acknowledged to be from the Lord, but only in an 
external way.

16. And he shall take away its crop with 
the filth thereof, and cast it beside 
the altar on the east part, in the place 
of the ashes: 

17. And he shall rend it by the wings 
thereof, but shall not divide it to 
pieces: and the priest shall burn it 
upon the altar, upon the wood that is 
upon the fire: it is a burnt offering, 
an offering made by fire, of a sweet 
savour to the LORD. 

References and Notes

16. Also falsity and evil shall be separated from such 

worship, and shall be condemned as proceeding 
from selfish love and its ultimate defilements.

17. But in such worship there is no parallelism and 

correspondence with the Lord; there is only a 
preparation for it through the power of faith and 
the acknowledgement of the Lord; and yet such 
worship is accepted by the Lord, and shall be 
consecrated to Him, the good of merit being 
therein distinguished from the good of love.

1. Ever since the inspired books of the Old and New Testaments were written, there has existed, 
more or less, a conviction that, besides their literal, grammatical, or historical meaning, they 
contain a hidden meaning descriptive of spiritual and eternal realities. It is now pretty 
generally admitted that the early chapters of Genesis are not historical; and this being so, it 
follows that they must necessarily contain such a hidden meaning. The books of the Word 
also, which are manifestly historical, yet contain many statements which afford evidence that 
they involve very much more than history. Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, with Joseph and his 
brethren, were not only real persons whose lives are recorded in the books of Genesis and 
Exodus, but they are also representative characters; and only by admitting this can we properly
understand many things that are said of them. Who cannot see, for example, that Abraham's 
exchange with Jehovah as recorded in Gen. xv. - xviii. contains some underlying spiritual 
teaching, and that his offering up of Isaac as in Gen. xxii. does the same?

But besides this, the later books of the Word show this truth concerning the former books and 
concerning themselves in a remarkable way; and thus the Word itself affirms of itself, that it 

5

contains a Divine and spiritual sense. For in Psalm 78:1, we read: "Give ear, O my people, to 
my law: incline your ears to the words of my mouth. I will open my mouth in a parable, I will 
utter dark sayings of old;" and then follows in the rest of the psalm a brief recapitulation of the
history of the children of Israel, thus proving that the whole of that history, in the Word, is 
parable as well, and therefore contains an inner sense. But not only so. There are some 
passages which plainly indicate also that the laws of Moses have a spiritual as well as a literal 
signification. Take, for example, the following from 1 Sam 15:22: "Has the Lord as great 
delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices as in obeying the voice of the Lord? Behold, to obey is
better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams"; and this taken in connection with 
what is said in Isaiah 1:11-20, and in Matt 23:23, clearly shows that the laws of Moses as well 
as the sacrifices are parabolic.

And lastly, that the inspired books involve an internal sense both in general and in particular, is
more especially evident in the Gospels and in the Apocalypse. Hence we are told that not only 
is the testimony of JESUS the spirit of prophecy, but that the whole Word treats of Him in its 
inmost sense, and that this sense was made known to the disciples by the Lord on the occasion
of His resurrection so that they might understand it (Rev 19:10; Luke 24:27, 45). It is not 
surprising, therefore, that the early Christians who lived in the centuries immediately 
following the time of the Apostles, should have believed that the Scriptures contain an internal
sense, and that we have evidence in their writings of this fact. Let one or two examples be 
given. Ignatius says (on Psalm cxviii., sect. 26): "The law of God is spiritual, and they have 
not the true law who do not take it spiritually." Augustine declares that "They who take the 
writings of Moses according to their literal sense do not desire to be learned in the kingdom of 
heaven" (contra Faust, lib. xii. cap. 4). And Origen says, speaking of the Rites and Ordinances 
of the Mosaic Law: "Unless they be all of them taken in another sense than the literal... they 
are a greater stumbling block, and tend more to the subversion of the Christian religion than to
its advancement and edification" (in Levit., cap. vii). Also in another part of the same 
commentary on Leviticus (cap. iii) he says: "The laws of the sacrifices which are given in this 
book of the Law, are to be fulfilled according to their spiritual meaning; for no man having 
right or sound reason, can admit that rams, and goats, and calves are fit offerings for an 
immortal and incorporeal God."

Now, from the foregoing observations, the intelligent mind will be prepared to acknowledge 
not only that there is an internal sense in every part of the Word, but also that the expositions 
of that sense given in his great work entitled Arcana Coelestia, by Emanuel Swedenborg, who 
declares himself to be the Herald of the Second Coming of the Lord, and the appointed 
instructor of mankind in the Doctrines of the New Christian Dispensation (TCR 779), are a 
genuine revelation from the Lord, not only demonstrating the truths of the Spiritual Sense, but 
also the universal Law of Correspondences between natural and spiritual things, according to 
which the Word has been constructed, and could only be constructed, by the Lord Himself. 
And further, when it is clearly seen that the genuine Internal Sense of the Word can be 
everywhere correctly evolved from it by the application of this universal law in every one of 
the inspired books from beginning to end, then also it will be seen that the Divine Mission of 
the Seer of the New Dispensation is genuine and true, and that those who have faithfully 
followed him in their teachings have established themselves on a safe and sure foundation; 
because through this same Law of Correspondences the Lord teaches every man spiritual truth 
from the Word (TCR 780).

6

The spiritual instruction, therefore, given now in a regular and uninterrupted series, of the 
books of Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy, is proved entirely from the Arcana Coelestia,
and is necessarily dependent not only upon the particular correspondences there explained, but
also upon the general and particular spiritual laws and principles therein abundantly 
illustrated.

With these introductory remarks, let us now proceed to the exposition of our first verse. By the
LORD, or as it is in the Hebrew, by Jehovah, is specifically denoted the Divine Being as to His 
Love, 2001; by calling is denoted influx, 6840; by Moses is represented Divine Truth, or the 
Word, 7010, 6752; speaking also denotes influx, will, and thought, 2951; by the tent of 
meeting are denoted the three heavens, 35403; and by saying is denoted perception, 1791, 
1822.

Let it be observed here that what, in the literal sense, is said in application to particular 
persons and places, in the internal sense, is to be understood of all men and states. Life flows 
in from the Lord both immediately, and mediately through the heavens, with all men; influx is 
from Divine Love, and by Divine Truth; it therefore manifests itself in man as affection and 
thought; and thence he has perception in various degrees according to his state. How very 
much, then, is involved in the words we are considering! The Lord is continually appealing to 
every one of us in the threefold manner here indicated by the expressions calling, and 
speaking, and saying; and we are never without directions from Him as to how we ought to 
feel, to think, and to act from our highest and best perceptions. But before proceeding to the 
next verse, it will be well for us to pause and consider carefully whether we have a 
comprehensive and clear idea of JEHOVAH or the LORD? What is the idea possible for us?

According to the Hebrew, the word for Jehovah is derived from, or is a variation of, that which
means the Being Who was, and is, and is to be, that is, the Self-existent and Eternal Divine 
Being of Whom, in His Infinite perfection no idea can be formed (Exod 3:14); and this may be
why some say that He is "without body, parts, or passions"; but, at any rate, it certainly is why 
even the Word itself declares concerning Him: "No man has seen God at any time" (John 
1:18). But this is not all that the word Jehovah means. For we read (Isaiah 43:10, 11), "Before 
me there was no God formed, neither shall there be after me. I, even I, am Jehovah; and beside
me there is no saviour." Here, observe, we are first taught that the Lord always was a "God 
formed," because that which is self-existent, or Life Itself, must be the most substantial of all 
beings, and substance without form or quality is impossible. But of course this one only 
substance is not that of which we are conscious; it is Infinite and Divine. Secondly, these 
words teach us that this "God formed," and yet beyond our comprehension, is the same God 
that would afterwards be formed and become a saviour in the lower degrees of life of which 
we are conscious. For all the old prophecies of the Word confirm the statement here made, that
Jehovah Himself would become, in the fullness of time, the Redeemer and Saviour. One or 
two passages in proof will suffice.

"And it shall be said in that day, Lo, this is our God; we have waited for Him and He will save 
us: this is Jehovah; we have waited for Him, we will be glad and rejoice in His salvation" (Isa 
25:9). Again: "Behold the days come, says Jehovah, that I will raise to David a righteous 
Branch, and He shall reign as king and deal wisely, and shall execute judgement and justice in 
the land... and this is His name whereby He shall be called, Jehovah our righteousness" (Jer 
23:5). And again, we read: "1 am Jehovah your God: them shall know no God but me; for 

7

there is no saviour beside Me" (Hos 13:4). And when we add to these the passages in the New 
Testament which confirm them, then we see that Jesus Christ our Lord was, and is, Jehovah 
manifested, and therefore that the true idea of God is that of an infinitely glorious Divine Man 
in whose single person is embodied the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, or the whole Divine 
Trinity, according to the words of Paul (Col 2:9), that "in Him dwells all the fullness of the 
Godhead bodily." For it is said of Him: "You shall call His name JESUS, for He shall save His 
people from their sins" (Matt 1:21); that He is "Immanuel," or "God with us" (Matt 1:23); that 
He is "Lord of all" (Acts 10:36); that "He was manifest in the flesh" (2 Tim 3:16); that He is 
the very image (or form) of the Divine substance (Heb 1:3); that, from His Divine, He has all 
power in His Human Nature (Matt 28:18); that His Name is the name of the Father, Son, and 
Holy Spirit (Matt 28:19; Acts 19:5); and that His Human Nature is the manifestation of His 
Divine (John 1:18). No wonder, therefore, that He says of Himself: "Before Abraham was I 
AM" (John 8:58; Exod 3:14); "He that has seen me has seen the Father" (John 14:9; Isaiah 
9:6, 7); "Except you believe that I AM, you shall die in your sins" (John 8:24); and "I am 
Alpha and Omega, says the Lord God, which is, and which was, and which is to come, the 
Almighty" (Rev 1:8). And when we add that He says also, "The Father abiding in Me does His 
works (John 14:10); and that "He breathed on His disciples and says to them, 'Receive you the 
Holy Spirit'" (John 20:22), then we may see that the Father or Divine Nature is in Jesus as the 
soul in the body; that the Son, or Human Nature, when glorified, is the full manifestation of 
the Father in One Divine Person; and that the Holy Spirit proceeds from Him alone. And 
thence we may further see that this is the only true idea of the otherwise incomprehensible 
Jehovah; and that if it is not received, then there remains of Him either a perverted and 
grotesque idea or no idea at all. And further still, in order to complete this argument, let it be 
remembered that man is created in the image and likeness of God (Gen 1:26, 27), from which 
it follows that God Himself must be essentially and substantially Man in first principles; that 
indeed, otherwise, He could not have become, in the fullness of time, a Man in last or lowest 
principles; that His Human Nature, therefore, assumed in the world, was, essentially and 
substantially, derived from His Divine; that there can be no such thing as abstract power, 
wisdom, and love either finite or infinite, and consequently no such thing as abstract 
Omnipotence, Omniscience, and Omnipresence (Matt 28:18-20); that one essential of the 
Divine Trinity cannot be separated from the rest without the destruction of the whole; and that 
without the DIVINE HUMAN in all the degrees of life and substance, the Universe spiritual and 
natural, could neither have been created, nor could it continue to exist.

2. This appears from the signification of speaking as denoting influx, 2951; of saying as denoting
perception and thus instruction, 1791, 1822; of Israel as denoting the Spiritual Church, 3654; 
of offering an oblation as denoting the acknowledgement of the Lord and worship, 349, 922; 
and of cattle of the herd and of the flock as denoting natural and spiritual affections 
respectively, 5913, 6126.

The three main things in the spiritual sense of this verse are that influx and consequently 
revelation is mediate as well as immediate; that the worship of the Lord must be in freedom; 
and that worship consists essentially in the acknowledgement of the Lord, and the devotion to 
Him of the affections of the heart. The Lord did not speak to the Israelites immediately, but 
through Moses and from the tent of meeting. No one can receive the influx of the Divine life, 
or love, or good, except by means of Divine Truth, because love has no quality except by 
truth; and truth is without life except it be from good; also the truth as received by the internal 

8

man, in its descent, must be accommodated to the state of the external man. And, again, of 
what value is worship if it be forced? The Israelites were not compelled to offer their burnt 
offerings and sacrifices to the Lord. And lastly, who does not see that love itself is free, and is 
the essential of all worship both natural and spiritual? To worship the Lord truly is to love Him
with all the heart and with all the soul inwardly and outwardly.

But an important question here naturally arises. In the remarks on the previous verse it is 
shown that the Lord is a Divine Person, because there can be no such thing as abstract power, 
wisdom, and love, and some may therefore imagine that to love the Lord is to adore Him as to 
His person supremely, without regard to His essence. But this would be a great error. It is true 
that we cannot think rightly of God unless we think of Him as a Divine Person; but it is also 
equally true that we cannot worship or love Him simply as a person. On the contrary, we must 
worship or love Him first as to His essence, and thence as to His person. And thus It will be 
seen that to love the Lord chiefly means to love, the good and the truth which constitute Him, 
and to acknowledge that whatever we have of good and truth, or of affection and intelligence 
is continually in us from Him. And this is how it is to be understood that we are to devote our 
natural and spiritual affections to His service. We must, in short, love Him because He has first
loved us, and is willing to impart eternal life and happiness to us, when we reciprocate His 
love by rightly using the affections and powers we receive from Him.

3. This is true, because a burnt offering denotes Specifically worship from love, and sacrifices 
worship from faith, 8680; an offering of the herd denotes worship from natural good, 5913, 
6126; burnt offerings also denote full devotion to the Lord, or full sanctification, 2776; the 
male denotes truth, 725; without blemish, denotes purification from falsity and evil, 7837; the 
door denotes the acknowledgement of the Lord, 2356; the tent of meeting denotes the heavens,
3540; and to be accepted by the Lord, denotes reception on account of purification, 95061.

The points to be particularly noted in this verse are, that there is no genuine worship of the 
Lord except by means of the truths of the Word and purification from evil. How common is 
the remark at this day that if a man's heart is only right, it is not of so much consequence what 
his doctrine is! But here we learn that some-thing more is required in the worship of the Lord 
than affection; there must also be genuine truth or doctrine. For how can an affection be 
devoted to Him while it is contaminated by falsity of doctrine, by impurity of motive, or by 
any action carrying with it any thought of self-righteousness or merit? No, indeed! The natural
good from which we worship must be good received from the Lord through our previous 
reception of truth, and its application to life in the work of repentance. Our offering must be "a
male perfect, or without blemish." And then again, this true worship involves something more.
It is not enough that we should abstain from the outward act of sin by the influence of the 
Truth; we must also acknowledge the Lord as the door (John 10:7-9); and we must be fully 
persuaded that it is by His influence through the heavens, that is, by the operation of the Holy 
Spirit flowing into us, even immediately, or in accommodation to our state, that we can have 
my power to worship. For wherever there is mediate influx, there also is that which is 
immediate, 7004, and by it the Lord keeps all things both generally and as to the most minute 
particulars in due connection and order. He, indeed, is willing constantly to receive worship 
from every one; but it cannot be grateful and acceptable to Him, unless there is internal 
purification as well as external.

9

4. The proofs here are, that the hand signifies power, 878; that laying the hand upon the head of 
the offering, signifies the communication of power from the Internal to the External, 10023; 
and that being accepted, to make atonement, signifies what is grateful and well pleasing to the 
Lord, because thereby evil is removed and conjunction with the Internal is effected, ver. 3; 
10042.

The meaning of the Hebrew word here translated atonement, or to make atonement, is to be a 
covering for sin; and it is said to have three significations, namely, "to expiate for sin, to 
appease anger, and to avert calamity." Now it may help us to understand this rightly, if we ask 
ourselves what it really is that affords a covering or expiation for sin, that appeases anger, or 
that averts a calamity? The answer, in the literal sense, is, of course, the burnt offering, and in 
the spiritual sense the natural good affection denoted thereby. And can we not see, in truth, that
there can be no other covering or atonement for sin than good of different degrees and of 
various qualities received from the Lord? Yea, can we not see when we have loved and 
practised any particular evil, and have afterwards repented of it by shunning it as a sin against 
God, that nothing could be a covering for it or remove it but the acknowledgement and 
reception of the opposite good? This consideration, therefore, shows us the true spiritual 
meaning of burnt offerings and sacrifices. They denote the consecration of our good affections
to the service of the Lord in all the duties of a holy life; and we have now to see how this 
devotion is a covering for sin, an appeasing of anger, and the averting of calamities. It has 
been too commonly believed that the covering or atonement for sin was the sacrifice or death 
of Christ, considered as a punishment inflicted upon Him for the sins of all mankind. But this 
error is rapidly disappearing before the light of the New Age. It is impossible that sin can be 
covered or removed by punishment merely, whether it be that of the sinner himself or any 
substitute for him. It is well known that punishment does not remove evil, although it may 
repress it. Only the real work of repentance can do that. And certainly the punishment of 
another for any man's sins, even though that other should be the Lord in His Human Nature, 
cannot effect this. Hence the prophet Isaiah says: "We did esteem him stricken, smitten of God 
and afflicted. But He was wounded for our transgressions, He was bruised for our iniquities: 
the chastisement of our peace was upon Him; and with His blows we are healed" (Isaiah 53:4, 
5). That the Lord suffered for man in redeeming him is true; but it is not true that His 
sufferings and death were, in any sense, a punishment inflicted upon Him by evil men and 
spirits or by the Father. Again we say, No, indeed! On the contrary it was because He "so 
loved the world" (John 3:16), that He submitted, as to His Human Nature, to the sufferings He 
endured, which were not only natural and physical, but involved mighty conflicts against all 
the powers of darkness. And this He did in order that He might deliver man from the absolute 
dominion of evil, by preserving in him perfect freedom of choice between evil and good; and 
thus, in the very grandest sense, was and is the Divine Love, a covering or atonement for man 
by the removal of evil from him! For, by the work of Redemption, evil is for ever prevented 
from taking away this liberty of man, and is, in this sense, for ever covered, or removed, 
hidden and rendered quiescent. But also, what is true in the grandest sense is true as to each 
individual, with the exception, that while the Lord absolutely preserved man's liberty, and 
expelled all the maternal life, with its tendencies to evil, from His Human glorified, man's 
evils remain with him to eternity, but are so covered or quiescent by his prevailing state as to 
good in the regenerated, that they cease to appear or to trouble him, 868. Thus, then, we see 
what is meant in this verse and elsewhere in the Word by the covering or atonement both in its 
universal and particular sense (2 Cor 5:18, 19).

10

But secondly, how can this atonement be an appeasing of anger? Can we possibly conceive 
that there is anger in the Lord, or that such anger requires to be appeased by the sufferings of 
men? By no means. For the infinitely perfect Lord cannot be angry, according to His own 
words when He says: "I, Jehovah, change not; therefore you, O sons of Jacob, are not 
consumed" (Mal 3:6); and when we read, "Vengeance is mine and recompense" (Deut 32:35), 
we are to understand the mercy of the Lord which provides for the salvation of man, even by 
the permission of suffering and punishment, and by the appearances of truth in the Word 
through which anger, wrath, and vengeance are attributed to Him, 6997. Hence, then, anger 
signifies the aversion of man from the Lord, and the aversion of the external or natural man 
from the internal, which produce the appearances of anger; and therefore the way in which 
anger is appeased in the atonement is by bringing man into harmony with the Divine Love, 
and the external man into harmony with the internal, through the rejection of evil from a 
principle of love and the consequent communication and reception of good.

And thirdly, how are calamities averted by the atonement mentioned in the verse before us, 
and so frequently in other places? This may be easily understood by the simple consideration 
that it is in the very nature of evil to produce mischief, and of good to do the contrary; so that 
it is no wonder that calamities should overtake the wicked, and that they should be averted 
through the reception of good. And if we apply this principle to the kind of good denoted by 
the burnt offering of the herd, it is evident that when men devote the natural affections and 
powers which the Lord has given them to merely selfish and worldly purposes, they must 
expect the calamities that inevitably follow; and also that when they devote them to the Lord 
according to the internal sense of these verses, they will turn aside those calamities and have 
conjunction with the Lord, through the conjunction of the external with the internal man as 
here described. And let it be observed here, that the remarks now made will serve to illustrate 
much that follows in this and the other chapters of the book of Leviticus.

5. This is thus proved: The killing of the bullock, denotes preparation, by self-denial, for the 

worship of the Lord from the good of innocence in the natural man, 10024, 9990; the sons of 
Aaron the priest, denote truths derived from good and conjoined therewith, 9946; presenting 
the blood, denotes the acknowledgement that charity is from the Lord, 10227, 1001; sprinkling
the blood round about upon the altar, denotes the conjunction of truth with good externally and
internally, 10047; and at the door of the tent of meeting denotes, "in order to gain admission to
heaven," 2356, 35403.

It is interesting to notice in this verse the double signification involved in the slaying of the 
animals offered in the sacrifices. On the one hand there is the rejection of the old or merely 
natural life, and on the other the putting on of the new or higher life. For it is evident that, in 
the course of regeneration, we must put off the "old man with his doings," and put on the "new
man" (Col 3:9); and the sacrificed animal has its correspondence in both aspects. Essentially it 
denotes the new and higher life; because only this can be devoted to the Lord; but relatively it 
signifies the old and lower life by the rejection of which preparation is made for the reception 
of the perfect life; as for the soul that sins, it shall die, daily or continually, by the rejection of 
what is good; but the soul that repents shall also die daily by the rejection of what is evil (Ezek
18:20; 1 Cor 15:21). And this cannot be, apart from man's own co-operation by the steady 
practice of self-denial. Also, again we see how essential the truths of the Word derived from 
good, represented by the sons of Aaron, are in this work of regeneration; how these truths have

11

their power from good; and how they acknowledge charity, and the necessary conjunction of 
truth with good, in the attainment of the heavenly life.

6. This is evident, because by flaying a burnt offering, or by removing the skin, is denoted the 
separation of falsity in ultimates, 10036; and by cutting the animal into its pieces is denoted 
the arrangement of truths in order under good, or the arrangement of inferior good in order 
under that which is superior, 10048.

Here it is to be particularly observed, that no directions were given concerning the offering of 
the sacrifices which do not involve some necessary part in the work of man's regeneration. For
no one can imagine that such directions were given by revelation from heaven, simply because
there was any value in them as outward acts of worship only. As we have already seen, the 
Lord does not desire such worship (Ps 40:6-8); much less, then, could He desire the minutiae 
of it. But nevertheless, each particular part of the ceremonial was intended to signify and 
represent some indispensable part of true spiritual worship, and thus of the true heavenly life. 
And of these certainly the removal of falsities, and the orderly arrangement of good and true 
affections are not the least. But this is the work of the Lord alone. It is only He who can in 
reality do either the one or the other while man co-operates. How often in the course of our 
religious experience have we not longed for such deliverance, and for such a state of 
perfection as this! And yet, although we have, it may be, sincerely endeavoured to realize 
them, it seems to be all in vain; so that not one of us can say, "1 am free from error, and perfect
externally and internally." Here, however, we are assured that it must be; and therefore we 
may rest satisfied that it will be. Our apparently imperfect efforts will finally be crowned with 
success; and if we cannot see how it is that each day's work in life contributes to this end, we 
may yet take consolation, and know from the Word the reason why. It is that all through our 
probationary state the "tares" and the "wheat" in us must both grow together (Matt 13:30). We 
cannot ourselves tell truly, in this matter, where we are; our state may be much better than we 
feel or think, or it may be much worse; but certain it is that we must do each day's work with 
care and diligence, and that if we endure to the end we shall be saved. And then when the right
time comes the "tares" will disappear; the "wheat" will be gathered into the barn; there will be 
an orderly arrangement of all our states; our associations with those who most resemble us 
will be just and true; and we shall indeed, according to our degree, be perfect, even as our 
Father Who is in heaven is perfect.

7. This is demonstrated as follows: the sons of Aaron represent truths derived from good and 

conjoined therewith, 9946; fire signifies love, 934; the altar also signifies the worship of the 
Lord as to Divine Good or Love, 9964; and the wood laid in order signifies the good of merit, 
2784.

8. By Aaron's sons the priests, are denoted truths derived from good and conjoined therewith, 
9946; by the placing of the pieces in order, are denoted the arrangement and distinction of 
truths and goods according to Divine Order, 10048; by the head, are denoted inmost things, 
specifically as to truth, 10048, and by the fat the same specifically as to good, 10033; by the 
wood, is denoted the good of merit, or man's action as from himself in which is the tendency 
to claim merit, 2784; by fire, is denoted love to the Lord, 934; and by the altar, is denoted 
worship, 9964.

9. Here, by the inwards, or the intestines, are denoted lowest things, and thus sensuous feelings 

and thoughts exterior, by the legs are denoted "the exteriors which are of the natural man," and

12

thus sensuous feelings and thoughts interior, 10049, 10050; by washing is denoted 
purification, 3147; by burning the sacrifice upon the altar, is denoted the devotion of the whole
natural man to the Lord in worship from pure love, 10052; by an offering made by fire, is also 
denoted worship from pure love, 10055; and by a sweet savour to the Lord, is denoted what is 
grateful and acceptable, and productive of heavenly rest and peace, 10054.

It is evident from the literal sense of this verse that these particulars must contain the internal 
sense according to the proofs, because no other worship can be a "sweet savour," or "an odour 
of rest" to the Lord but real worship which is expressed in a perfect life of obedience to Him 
springing from love and directed by an enlightened faith. And it is to be remembered here that 
what, in the internal sense, has reference to the regeneration of man, in the supreme sense 
relates to the glorification of the Lord, as all that is said in the references clearly shows. But 
see more especially 10053; and observe, that as the glorification of the Lord consisted in the 
union of the Human with the Divine, so the regeneration of man involves the conjunction of 
the External with the Internal, and thus, as it has been said, the devotion of the whole man to 
the Lord, namely, the natural man signified by a bullock as well as the spiritual man signified 
by a ram.

10. This is evident, because animals of the flock denote spiritual affection, 5913, 6126; sheep 

denote charity, and goats the faith of charity, 4169; a burnt offering denotes full devotion or 
consecration to the Lord, 2776; a male denotes truth, 725; and without blemish denotes 
purified from evil, 7837.

11. This appears from the signification of killing the animal as denoting preparation for spiritual 
worship, 10024, 4169; of the side of the altar northward as denoting truths adapted for the 
purpose, 9499, 9648; of Aaron's sons the priests as denoting truths derived from good and 
conjoined therewith, 9946; and of sprinkling the blood on the altar round about as denoting the
conjunction of truth with good, and thus the acknowledgement that spiritual good or charity is 
from the Lord, 10047.

12. By cutting the animal in pieces is denoted the arrangement of truths in order under good, or 

the arrangement of inferior good in order under that which is superior, 10048; by the head are 
denoted inmost things specifically as to truth, 10048, and by the fat the same specifically as to 
good, 10033; by laying the pieces in order is denoted the actual arrangement of inferior things 
under superior; while by cutting the animal in pieces is denoted preparation for such 
arrangement, 10048; by the wood is denoted the good of merit, 2784; by fire is denoted love, 
934; and by the altar is denoted worship, 9964.

13. Here again, by the inwards, or the intestines, are denoted lowest things, and thus sensuous 

feelings and thoughts exterior, by the legs, are denoted the exteriors which are of the natural 
man, and thus sensuous feelings and thoughts interior, 10049, 10050; by washing is denoted 
purification, 3147; by burning the sacrifice upon the altar is denoted the devotion of the whole 
spiritual man to the Lord in worship from pure love, 10052; by an offering made by fire is also
denoted worship from pure love, 10055; and by a sweet savour to the Lord is denoted what is 
grateful and acceptable, and productive of heavenly rest and peace, 10054.

14. This is evident, because birds signify spiritual things which relate to faith or truth and thus to 
the understanding, 1826; and turtle-doves and young pigeons signify exterior things and 

13

interior things, and thus truth and good, respectively, 1827; and they also signify the innocence
which must be involved in a state of worship which is denoted by them, 10132.

15. This is also evident, because the priest bringing the sacrifice to the altar, denotes the worship 
of the Lord from good, 9946, but in this case good adopted as a principle or rule of life, and 
not good actually, since it has relation to the birds which denote what is of the understanding, 
1826; because to wring off the head, denotes that there is not permanent conjunction with the 
Lord by worship from the understanding only, or from the principle of good only, 8079; 
because to burn the head upon the altar nevertheless, denotes that still this worship is 
sanctified inmostly by the influence of Divine Love, 10052; and because to drain out the blood
at the side of the altar, denotes that charity is acknowledged to be from the Lord, but only in an
external way, 1001, 10227, 9648, 9499.

16. This is true, since to take away the crop with the filth thereof, signifies to separate falsities and
evils from such worship, 4883, 5174; and to cast it beside the altar on the east part in the place 
of the ashes, signifies the rejection of such falsities and evils. For to cast out, denotes to be 
exterminated or rejected, 2657; beside the altar, denotes from any connection with worship, 
9964; the east denotes good, but here in the opposite sense evil, 7679; and the place of the 
ashes, denotes a state where falsities are conjoined with evils, ashes denoting falsities, and the 
east denoting evils, 7519, 9723. And this is a state of condemnation from self-love and its 
ultimate defilements.

17. This may be seen from considering that rending the bird by the wings thereof, but not dividing
it, denotes no parallelism and correspondence with the Lord in such worship, but only a 
preparation for it, 1832, 4171, because the rending, like the killing, was a part of the 
preparation of the bird for sacrifice, and also denotes the suffering and temptation brought 
about by indulgence in evils through the misunderstanding or perversion of the truth, as the 
last reference given clearly shows; because rending it by the wings, denotes that thus the 
power of faith is weakened by giving way to evil, but strengthened by overcoming the 
temptation through acknowledgement of the Lord and resistance to evil in consequence, 8764; 
and because there cannot be so genuine a worship of the Lord from a principle of good as 
there can from good itself, since real good, or the real love of good only, gives correspondence
with the Lord, and brings the external man into harmony with the internal, 1832. But 
nevertheless this imperfect worship is accepted by the Lord, as the rest of the verse shows, in 
order that it may lead up to genuine spiritual devotion. For by the burning of the offering is 
represented conjunction with the Lord, and the conjunction of faith with charity, 10052; by the
wood is denoted the action of man as from himself in which there is the tendency to claim 
merit, 2784; by fire is denoted love to the Lord, 934; and by a sweet savour, or an odour of rest
to the Lord, is denoted what is grateful and acceptable in worship and productive of heavenly 
rest and peace, 10054. And thus imperfect worship is consecrated by the prevailing state of 
good or love in which the worshiper is inmostly.

Discussion

Taking now a brief review of this chapter, we may observe that its general subject is the worship of the 
Lord; that this worship must be from natural and spiritual affection combined, that it is first from 
natural affection; secondly, from spiritual affection; and thirdly, from the same affections on a lower 
plane.

14

The internal sense first states that natural and spiritual worship are combined, because the Lord's 
operation, in regeneration, is from the inmost through the spiritual, into the natural degree; and then it 
describes natural and spiritual worship, successively, because according to man's experience, he begins 
his life in the natural degree, and afterwards becomes spiritual. But since the natural man is internal and
external, and also the spiritual, therefore the worship of the external man or his first conscious natural 
and spiritual life is also described.

Next we learn the requirements for the true worship of the Lord, which, generally considered, are the 
same in different degrees. And the first essentials named are exceedingly important. There must be 
truth and there must be purity; truths, in fact, which reveal man's impurity, naturally, and then the work 
of repentance by which purity comes. But these, by themselves, are not sufficient. There must be 
conjunction with the Lord by the sincere acknowledgement of Him, and of His operation through the 
heavens. After this it follows in order that, from the Lord, there is the powerful influence of the internal
man upon the external, producing the reconciliation or agreement of the two, which is said to be 
acceptable to the Lord, because the worship of the external separate from the internal cannot be so; and 
therefore there must be preparation for this by the rejection of the corrupted "old" life, so that good and 
truth conjoined may be fitly and fully manifested. But there is a peculiarity here which requires notice. 
The preparation for spiritual worship is distinguished from that for natural worship in this description, 
by its being said to be by truths adapted for that purpose. Now it may occur to the thoughtful student 
that surely this is the case also with preparation for natural worship, although this statement is not 
found in verse 5. we have to consider, therefore, why it occurs in verse 11. The reason appears to be 
that the more interior our worship is, so much the more is it seen to be from an enlightened mind, as 
well as from a loving heart. The spiritual man sees truths more clearly than the natural man. But still 
preparation for worship never can be otherwise than obscure, when compared with worship itself; and 
therefore this obscurity is also named. The animal representing worship was killed on the side of the 
altar northward; and "northward," as the reference (9648) shows, denotes obscurity as to truths. But for
further illustration of this interesting point see also 9736, 10185.

We learn, in the next place, however, that there are three other requirements for true worship. Not only 
must evil and falsity be removed from the heart and understanding, but from the life also; and then 
follows a distinct and orderly arrangement of all man's powers by the Lord, with the complete 
purification of all sensuous feelings and thoughts, so that the natural man in its entirety may be devoted
without hindrance to the service of the Lord.

And lastly, what happens to the affections must happen to the intellectual powers, as described at the 
end of the chapter. In fact, the same general process again appears, under other and exactly appropriate 
symbolism, the chief truths made manifest being the subordination of the understanding to the will, and
of the external man to the internal; the impossibility of conjunction with the Lord, through the 
understanding alone, or through faith alone; and the inevitable result, namely, that the understanding 
must not only be subordinate, but must also be in complete harmony with the will, in the holy life of 
worship which consists in doing justly, loving mercy, and walking humbly with our God (Mic 6:8).

Leviticus Chapter 2

Summary of the Spiritual Sense

1. The worship of the Lord from the highest degree of celestial love is described, vers. 1-3. 
2. Then follows a description of worship from interior celestial love, or charity to the neighbour, 

showing how it is connected with that from the highest celestial good, which is pure love to the 
Lord, and the lowest, ver. 4. 

3. A similar description of worship from celestial good in the Internal of the Natural succeeds, 
accompanied by an account of the arrangement of truths there, and of the influx of inmost 
celestial good, vers. 5-6. 

4. And lastly, worship from the External of the Natural is described, showing that it is similar to 

worship from higher loves, but is in a lower degree, ver. 7. 

5. It is then shown that celestial worship in all these degrees and ways involves certain particulars, 
namely: the power to worship must be ascribed to the Lord; it must be acknowledged to be from
celestial good inmostly derived from Him; and it must be exercised from Him. Also the 
worshiper will realize the conjunction of truth with good as from himself; he will be able to 
devote his life to the service of the Lord; he will experience a state of heavenly joy and peace; 
he will be able to appropriate good and truth; and he will worship the Lord from pure love, vers.
8-10. 

6. Again this worship of the Lord must be free from falsity; it must not be vitiated by merely 

natural delight; such imperfect worship only appertains to preparatory states; and in all worship 
there must be the mutual desire of truth for good and of good for truth, or in other words, every 
one who really loves the truth will desire also to be good, and all who sincerely desire to be 
good will also long for the truth, vers. 11-13. 

7. And also, during such worship, in preparatory states, it will be from natural good, and truth 

influenced by celestial good, and involving the sincere acknowledgement of the Lord, vers. 14-
16. 

The Contents of each Verse

1. And when any one offers an oblation

of a meal offering to the LORD, his 
oblation shall be of fine flour; and he
shall pour oil upon it, and put 
frankincense thereon: 

1. Again, when the Lord is worshiped from the good 
of celestial love, it shall be by the pure truth 
proceeding from that love, and also thence is the 
grateful perception of truth.

16

2. And he shall bring it to Aaron's sons 
the priests: and he shall take thereout
his handful of the fine flour thereof, 
and of the oil thereof, with all the 
frankincense thereof; and the priest 
shall burn it as the memorial thereof 
upon the altar, an offering made by 
fire, of a sweet savour to the LORD: 

3. And that which is left of the meal 
offering shall be Aaron's and his 
sons': it is a thing most holy of the 
offerings of the LORD made by fire. 

2. And this worship shall be acknowledged to be by 
truth from good, and shall be with full power as to 
pure truth, as to the good from which it flows; and 
as to grateful perception; being the consecration of
the heart to the Lord, by the conjunction of truth 
with good from pure love, bringing joy and peace 
to the worshiper.

3. And from this holy worship the celestial man 

appropriates good and truth; it is the highest form 
of the worship of the Lord from pure love.

4. And when you offer an oblation of a 

meal offering baked in the oven, it 
shall be unleavened cakes of line 
flour mingled with oil, or unleavened
wafers anointed with oil. 

4. And further, when the worship of the Lord is from 
interior celestial good, still it shall be worship 
from pure good without falsity, involving inmost 
celestial good; or external celestial good of such a 
heavenly quality.

5. And if your oblation be a meal 

offering of the baking pan, it shall be
of fine flour unleavened, mingled 
with oil. 

5. And when such worship is from the Internal of the 
Natural, it shall be by truth derived from good, 
free from falsity, and involving inmost celestial 
good.

6. You shall part it in pieces, and pour 
oil thereon: it is a meal offering. 

6. And in such worship there shall be an accurate 

arrangement of truths, and thus of affections, and 
also the continual influx of inmost good, because 
it is celestial worship.

7. And if your oblation be a meal 

7. And lastly, when such celestial worship is from the

offering of the frying pan, it shall be 
made of fine flour with oil. 

External of the Natural it shall also be from pure 
truth, conjoined with good.

8. And you shall bring the meal 

offering that is made of these things 
to the LORD: and it shall be 
presented to the priest, and he shall 
bring it to the altar. 

8. And the power to worship the Lord in all these 
ways shall be ascribed to Him; it shall be 
acknowledged to be from Him in celestial good; 
and it shall be exercised from conjunction with 
Him.

9. And the priest shall take up from the 
meal offering the memorial thereof, 
and shall burn it upon the altar: an 
offering made by fire, of a sweet 
savour to the LORD. 

9. Also the celestial man shall then be able to realize 
that conjunction, as from himself, with the power 
of devoting thereby his life to the service of the 
Lord, and of being receptive of a holy state of joy 
and peace.

17

10. And that which is left of the meal 
offering shall be Aaron's and his 
sons': it is a thing most holy of the 
offerings of the LORD made by fire. 

10. And from this holy worship the celestial man will 
appropriate good and truth; for it is the worship of 
the Lord from pure love most holy.

11. No meal offering, which you shall 

11. Moreover, no worship of the Lord from celestial 

offer to the LORD, shall be made 
with leaven: for you shall burn no 
leaven, nor any honey, as an offering
made by fire to the LORD. 

love shall be contaminated with falsity; for neither 
falsity nor any merely natural delight shall enter 
into this worship, because it is from pure love to 
the Lord.

12. As an oblation of first fruits you 
shall offer them to the LORD: but 
they shall not come up for a Sweet 
savour on the altar. 

12. These indeed may be permitted in the early stages 
of progressive celestial life, but they are not 
acceptable to the Lord, as worship from pure love 
is.

13. And every oblation of your meal 

13. And further, all worship from celestial love, of 

offering shall you season with salt; 
neither shall you suffer the salt of the
covenant of your God to be lacking 
from your meal offering: with all 
your oblations you shall offer salt. 

whatever degree, must involve the desire of truth 
for conjunction with good, and the desire of good 
for conjunction with truth; and these shall on no 
account be wanting, because they involve also the 
desire of man for salvation from the Lord, and the 
desire of the Lord for the salvation of man.

14. And if you offer a meal offering of 
firstfruits to the LORD, you shall 
offer for the meal offering of your 
firstfruits corn in the ear parched 
with fire, bruised corn of the fresh 
ear. 

14. And again, when the Lord is worshiped in the 

early stages of regeneration, it will be inmostly, 
although unconsciously, from celestial love, 
externally taking the form of natural good and 
truth influenced by celestial good, and acquired by
temptations as to good and as to truth.

15. And you shall put oil upon it, and lay
frankincense thereon: it is a meal 
offering. 

15. And hence, celestial love shall be within, and also 
spiritual love, because it is genuine celestial 
worship.

16. And the priest shall burn the 

16. And therefore in such worship there is the 

memorial of it, part of the bruised 
corn thereof, and part of the oil 
thereof, with all the frankincense 
thereof: it is an offering made by fire
to the LORD. 

conjunction of truth with good, and consecration 
to the Lord from good acquired in temptations, 
from some love to the Lord, and from charity 
entirely, and involving the sincere 
acknowledgement of the Lord from that love and 
charity.

References and Notes

1. This is proved by considering that a meal offering denotes celestial good, 4581; that fine flour 
denotes truth from good, or truth from love, 9995; that oil denotes celestial good, 2177; and 
that frankincense, from its odour, denotes a grateful perception, 2177, 9993.

18

After the description, in the previous chapter, of natural and spiritual worship, we have in this, 
that of celestial worship, according to the order of the three heavens; and the distinction 
between these three is the same as that between obedience to the Lord from a sense of duty, 
from an affection for the truth, or from the love of good. Or to express it in a more popular 
way, natural good, in worship, is obedience to the laws of Divine Order because it is so 
commanded in the Word; spiritual good is obedience from charity to the neighbour; and 
celestial good is obedience from love to the Lord.

2. This is thus demonstrated: the sons' of Aaron the priest denote truth front good, 9946; bringing
the offering therefore to them, denotes that celestial worship is by truth from good, and is 
acknowledged to be so, 10227; to take a handful denotes that the act of worship is with full 
power, 7518; burning the handful upon the altar, denotes the consecration of the heart to the 
Lord, by the conjunction of truth with good from pure love, 10052; a memorial denotes the 
quality of worship as to truth, and it also denotes remembrance, 6888; and a sweet savour to 
the Lord, denotes a state of heavenly joy and peace, 10054.

In connection with these two verses it will be well to consider more particularly what is said in
the Arcana Coelestia concerning the meal offering. In the first reference given, 4581, and also 
in 10079, it is shown that it signifies celestial good; and it is stated in the latter that while the 
sacrifices of animals were not commanded but permitted, because they were not well pleasing 
to the Lord, or in the heavens, the meal offering was well pleasing; also that whereas, 
generally speaking, they both denoted celestial good, yet specifically the flesh of the sacrifices
denoted spiritual good, while the bread of the meal offering denoted celestial good, from 
which it evidently appears that the meal offering had, relatively, a higher signification than the
sacrifices. But in 2177 a different interpretation is given; for we there read that while the 
sacrifices and the meal offering represented similar things, yet the meal offering did so in a 
less degree than the sacrifices, and consequently denoted things spiritual and things belonging
to the external church, from which it follows that the meal offering had, relatively, a LOWER 
signification than the sacrifices.

Now these varying and apparently contrary explanations naturally cause difficulty to many 
minds, and in giving the internal sense of the chapter before us we have to consider and decide
whether the meal offering here signifies celestial good or spiritual good, for evidently, in the 
Word, it sometimes denotes the one and sometimes the other. And it is thought, in this case, 
that the series of things in the internal sense enables us to determine in favour of celestial 
good, because, evidently, the first chapter commences by describing worship from natural 
good, and continues and ends by the description of worship from spiritual good, while the 
second chapter is devoted to the description of celestial worship in all its degrees. The reason, 
however, why spiritual worship is described by the meal offering in 2177 is because there the 
fine-flour is especially the subject of thought, this denoting "what is spiritual" as distinguished 
from bread which denotes what is celestial, and has just previously been named, besides 
which, it afterwards follows in the series of that chapter, that natural good is described by the 
young ox, the order being from celestial, through spiritual, to natural things. But in 10079 the 
comparison is made between the bread of the meal offering, as denoting the highest celestial 
good and the flesh of the sacrifices as denoting spiritual good, in order to show that, 
intrinsically, the worship of the Lord by the sacrifices of animals denoted an inferior state of 
worship to that denoted by the meal offering considered as bread.

19

3. This appears from the signification of Aaron and his sons as denoting those in good, and those 
in truth derived from good, 9946; of having the residue of the meal offering, that is of eating it,
as denoting appropriation, 2177, 2187; and of what is most holy of the offerings of the Lord 
made by fire, as denoting the highest form of the worship of the Lord from pure love, 10129, 
10055.

In this verse the whole mystery of the life of the regenerating and regenerated man is involved;
for it includes, on the one hand, the communication of life from the Lord, and on the other, its 
conscious reception by man as if it were his own. The influx of life from the Lord, indeed, is 
not sensibly perceived, because what flows in appears as if it were inherent; but when man 
becomes a conscious recipient of heavenly good, the very nature of that good causes him to 
perceive that it is not from himself, but from the Lord continually, or moment by moment, this 
being the effect of the purification denoted by what is unleavened in the meal offering. It is 
only in proportion as everything false and evil, signified by leaven, 2177, is removed by the 
work of repentance, and thus by victory in temptations, that pure-and holy love and charity 
can be adequately realized. How essentially; practical, therefore, is the teaching here implied!

4. This is true, because by what is baked in an oven is denoted interior celestial good, which is 
charity, and is peculiar to the middle heaven, 7356; by what is unleavened is denoted what is 
pure from falsity and evil, 2177; by cakes is signified good and truth conjoined, 2177, and also
the good of love towards the neighbour, 7978; by oil is denoted celestial good, 2177; and by 
wafers is denoted external celestial good, 9994.

In this verse we see how, when any one worships the Lord truly from spiritual or natural good,
such worship implies the operation of the Lord through celestial good, or through the celestial 
heavens; for the oil mingled with the fine flour signifies the conjunction of the Celestial with 
the Spiritual.

5. This is thus proved: a meal offering, baked in a baking pan or frying pan, denotes worship 

from the Internal of the Natural, because it follows in order that which was baked in an oven, 
which denotes interior or spiritual good, 7356; and its being of fine flour unleavened, and 
mingled with oil, denotes truth derived from good, free from falsity and involving inmost 
celestial good, 2177, 9995.

6. This appears thus: parting in pieces, signifies an accurate arrangement of truths and thus of 

affections, 10048, 3110; pouring oil thereon, signifies the influx of inmost good, 3728, 9780; 
and a meal offering signifies celestial worship, 4581.

7. This is seen from observing that a meal offering baked in a frying pan, or pot, denotes worship
from the External of the Natural because it follows in the series, the Internal of the Natural, 
7356; and that fine flour mixed with oil denotes pure truth conjoined with good, 2177, 9995.

8. This appears from the signification of bringing the meal offering to the Lord, as denoting to 
confess the power of worshiping to be from Him, 10227; of presenting it to the priest, as 
denoting to acknowledge that it is from Him in celestial love or good, 9946; and of bringing it 
to the altar, as denoting that worship, or rather the power to worship, is exercised from Him, 
10242, 2342.

9. By a memorial is denoted the quality of worship as to truth, and also remembrance which is 
active from affection or good; and hence, to take up the memorial, in this case, denotes to 

20

conjoin good with truth, the priest denoting good, 6888, 7518, 9946, 1728; to burn (he 
memorial upon the altar, denotes to realize that conjunction and worship the Lord from it, 
10052; and an offering made by fire of a sweet savour to the Lord, denotes devotion to the 
Lord, and a state of joy and peace, 10055, 10054.

10. This is evident from considering that what was left of the meal offering being Aaron's and his 
sons', denotes that from his holy worship the celestial man, of every degree, will appropriate 
good and truth, ver. 3; and that a thing most holy of the offerings of the Lord made by fire, 
denotes the worship of the Lord from pure love most holy, ver. 3.

11. This appears from the facts, that the meal offering denotes the worship of the Lord from 

celestial love, 4581; that leaven denotes falsity, 2177, 2342; that honey denotes natural delight,
here in its opposite sense, 5260, 10137 end; and that an offering made by fire to the Lord, 
denotes worship from pure love, ver. 3.

12. This is manifest from the signification of leaven and honey, as shown in the previous verse.

13. This is evident from the signification of salt, as denoting the desire of truth for conjunction 

with good, and the desire of good for conjunction with truth, 9207, 10137 end; of not causing 
the salt to be lacking, or to cease, as denoting that the desire for this conjunction should on no 
account be wanting, because a covenant signifies conjunction, 9207; and of salt being offered 
with every offering as denoting that all worship must have respect to this conjunction, because
it involves the desire of man for salvation from the Lord, and the desire of the Lord for the 
salvation of man, thus what is reciprocal. See also 10300.

14. This appears thus: the offering of the firstfruits denotes one of the preparatory stages of 

regeneration, namely, the implantation of truth in good, during which the worship of the Lord 
is compared with the state of celestial good, relatively imperfect, being contaminated with 
falsity and merely natural delight, denoted by leaven and honey as described in ver. 12, 9294-
5; the meal offering denotes worship from celestial love, which is inmost, 4581; man in this 
state has not yet realized celestial love, 9223, 9300; corn in the ear parched with fire, denotes 
the good of charity in the natural man, or natural good which is influenced by celestial good, 
9295; and bruised corn in the fresh ear, denotes the good of truth, or good acquired by means 
of truth through temptations, 9295, 6537, 6539.

15. This is true, because by oil is signified celestial love, 2177; by frankincense, spiritual love, 

10303; and by a meal offering, genuine celestial worship, 4581.

16. The proofs are, that the priest burning the memorial on the altar denotes the consecration of 
the heart to the Lord by the con-junction of truth with good from pure love, 10052; that the 
bruised corn denotes good acquired in temptations, ver. 14; that the oil denotes celestial love, 
2177; that frankincense denotes spiritual love, which is charity, 10303; and that an offering 
made by fire to the Lord, denotes the sincere acknowledgement of the Lord from that love and 
charity, 10055.

Discussion

Considering now the practical application of the spiritual teaching of this short account of the different 
kinds and degrees of celestial good, we remark that since every individual is a heaven in the least form,
or may become so, therefore he has the power to love the Lord, to love the neighbour, or to be obedient

21

to the Lord, according to his position in the universal heavens. That is, his inmost love may be celestial,
his interior love may be spiritual, and his external love may be natural, to whichever of the three 
general heavens he may belong. Hence then no one need say to himself, "I cannot be celestial," because
every one can be in good if he likes, and good in the universal sense is the celestial principle.

But if this is a practical truth relating to life, it involves also a practical truth relating to the 
understanding of the Word; for it shows that this chapter, in its entirety, may also be explained in 
reference to spiritual love or natural love, each in its degrees. So that if we consider that the first 
chapter of this book, which is limited to the description of the BURNT OFFERING, gives an account of 
celestial worship, then we may consider that the second chapter, which is limited to the description of 
the MEAL OFFERING, gives an account of spiritual worship, 2177, and that the third chapter, which is 
limited to the description of the peace OFFERINGS, gives an account of natural worship. And from all 
this it is evident that the series of three chapters not only describes regeneration successively from what
is internal to what is external, but also that each chapter, in its own way, describes the whole process, 
while yet having a specific relation to its own degree.

However, we have regarded this chapter as specifically relating to celestial love, on account of the 
series from what is external to what is internal in the first, culminating in the second, in which case the 
third, as we shall see, describes the full and free worship of man, simultaneously in the natural degree, 
when regeneration is completed. And we are delighted to be able to show that the series is really both 
ways without any confusion, and thus to justify the apparent paradox that the meal offering may and 
does denote, in the Word, a higher or a lower degree of worship, as the case may be in particular 
instances where it is mentioned, without any violation of the law of interpretation.

And now without making any particular remarks upon the different kinds of meal offering, it will be 
sufficient in this place to point to the practical character of two or three things mentioned in connection 
with it. First, no leaven was to be used. Why? Because it is inconsistent that the falsity, which is 
denoted by leaven, should be conjoined with the good signified by the meal offering. It is the duty of 
the man of the church, therefore, to separate himself from all false doctrine. "Beware you of the leaven 
of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy" (Luke 12:1). It is a fine thing to be genuine. What is merely 
external worship in the sanctuary on the Sabbath day but a pretence and a sham? And what, on the 
other hand, is genuine external worship there but the glory and signature of a good life every day in the 
week? But if falsity in worship is disastrous, how much more is effusive and merely natural affection to
which honey corresponds? How much of that there is in the world among worshipers at the present 
day! The merely natural delight sometimes attending revivals of religion is of this character. It is said of
John the Baptist, "His meat was locusts and wild honey" (Matt 3:4). But there is, all the same, a true 
natural delight in external worship that is not forbidden in this law of Moses concerning the meal 
offering. "He should feed them also with the finest wheat, and with honey out of the rock should I 
satisfy you" (Ps 81:16). Honey out of the rock is delight in the Word of the Lord from the affection of 
truth. But then, in true worship which leads to a good life and is also the effect of a good life, there is 
even something more than the absence of falsity, and of merely natural delight, there is the desire of 
truth to good, and the desire of good to truth, signified by salt. "With all your oblation," in fact, "you 
shall offer salt."

And this salt is called "the salt of the covenant of your God," because, as we have often seen, a 
covenant denotes conjunction. Not only, therefore, must worship be affectionate and genuine, or from 
good and free from false doctrine, but it must involve the conjunction of goodness with truth, and also 

22

the reciprocal conjunction of truth with goodness, and what amounts to the same thing, the reciprocal 
conjunction of the external man with the internal.

And lastly, therefore, there now follows the meal offering of the firstfruits. It is, of course, the 
beginning of regeneration under one aspect; but then it is the beginning of the heavenly life when 
regeneration is completed under another; and hence its position in this series, where worship from 
freedom, denoted by the peace offerings, follows it.

23

Leviticus Chapter 3

Summary of the Spiritual Sense

1. The subject of the entire chapter is the worship of the Lord from a state of freedom when 

regeneration is completed, and also occasionally during regeneration; and such worship from 
natural good is described, vers. 1-5. 

2. Then such worship from the good of innocence involved in charity, or love to the neighbour, 

vers. 6-11. 

3. And lastly, such worship from the good of faith, which is charity manifested through the 

understanding, vers. 12-16. 

4. But in every state of the worship of the Lord, no one can appropriate either truth or good as his 

own independently of the Lord, ver. 17. 

The Contents of each Verse

1. And if his oblation be a sacrifice of 
peace offerings; if he offer of the 
herd, whether male or female, he 
shall offer it without blemish before 
the LORD. 

1. Again, when the worship of the Lord is from free-
will, thus promoting the conjunction of the 
External with the Internal, and this worship is 
from the affections of the natural man, as to truth, 
or as to good, it shall be without any admixture of 
evil or falsity.

2. And he shall lay his hand upon the

communicated to the External; and the External 
shall be prepared, by the acknowledgement of the 
Lord, and influx from Him through the heavens, 
for such worship; while the conjunction of truth 
with good shall be effected, and thus conjunction 
with the Lord.

3. And he shall offer of the sacrifice of 
peace offerings an offering made by 
fire to the LORD; the fat that covers 
the inwards, and all the fat that is 
upon the inwards, 

3. And such free worship shall be acknowledged to 

be from the Lord through the principle of love, and
consequently through the good of love in the 
lowest degree of the natural man as to the 
understanding; in the lowest degree thereof as to 
the will;

4. And the two kidneys, and the fat that
is on them, which is by the loins, and
the long lobe upon the liver, with the
kidneys, shall he take away. 

4.

and the affection thereof, by which the conjunction
of truth with good is effected; and in the interior 
degree where the conjunction of good with truth is
effected, all these varieties of good being 
separated.

24

5. And Aaron's sons shall burn it on the
altar upon the burnt offering, which 
is upon the wood that is on the fire: it
is an offering made by fire, of a 
sweet savour to the LORD. 

6. And if his oblation for a sacrifice of 
peace offerings to the LORD be of the
flock; male or female, he shall offer 
it without blemish. 

7.

If he offer a lamb for his oblation, 
then shall he offer it before the 
LORD: 

5. And also, they shall be wholly consecrated to the 

Lord, and shall be acknowledged as proceeding 
from Him, at first by the worshiper as from 
himself, or as if he claimed merit thereby, and 
afterwards from pure love, which is grateful and 
acceptable to Him, and productive of heavenly rest
and peace.

6. Again, when this worship from freedom 

promoting the conjunction of the external man 
with the internal, is from spiritual affection as to 
truth or as to good, it shall be also free from 
contamination with evil and falsity.

7. And if it be from the good of innocence, it shall be

acknowledged to be from the Lord;

8. And he shall lay his hand upon the 
head of his oblation, and kill it 
before the tent of meeting: and 
Aaron's sons shall sprinkle the blood 
thereof upon the altar round about. 

8. Also that from Him is the power to worship, by 
preparing himself to do so, according to influx 
through the heavens; and thus shall the 
conjunction of the spiritual man with the Lord be 
effected.

9. And he shall offer of the sacrifice of 
peace offerings an offering made by 
fire to the LORD; the fat thereof, the 
fat tail entire, he shall take it away 
hard by the backbone; and the fat 
that covers the inwards, and all the 
fat that is upon the inwards, 

9. Also this freedom in worship bringing joy and 
peace, because grounded In love, shall be 
according to celestial good internal, and according 
to celestial good in ultimates, perfect and 
separated from merely natural love; according to 
the lowest good of the natural man as to the 
understanding, and as to the will;

10. And the two kidneys, and the fat that
is upon them, which is by the loins, 
and the long lobe upon the liver, with
the kidneys, shall he take away. 

11. And the priest shall burn it upon the 
altar: it is the food of the offering 
made by fire to the LORD. 

12. And if his oblation be a goat, then he
shall offer it before the LORD: 

10. According to the middle good thereof as to 

discriminating truths and their affections, by which
the conjunction of truth with good is effected; and 
according to the interior good thereof, where the 
conjunction of good with truth is effected, all these
varieties of good being separated,

11. And consecrated to the Lord entirely, because they
are the celestial principle of love from Him.

12. And again if such free worship bringing peace be 

from the good of faith, still it shall be 
acknowledged to be from the Lord.

25

13. And he shall lay his hand upon the 
head of it, and kill it before the tent 
of meeting: and the sons of Aaron 
shall sprinkle the blood thereof upon 
the altar round about. 

13. And the internal man shall flow into this good 

with power, the external man being prepared by 
the influx of spiritual life through the heavens; and
thus again shall Divine Truth be conjoined with 
Divine Good, by means of holy truths derived 
from celestial good.

14. And he shall offer thereof his

oblation, even an offering made by 
fire to the LORD; the fat that covers 
the inwards, and all the fat that is 
upon the inwards,

is upon them, which is by the loins, 
and the long lobe upon the liver, with
the kidneys, shall he take away.

the altar: it is the food of the offering
made by fire, for a sweet savour: all 
the fat is the LORD's.

good of the natural man as to the understanding 
and as to the will;

15. Through middle good as to discriminating truths 

and the affections thereof by which the 
conjunction of truth with good is effected; and 
through interior good where the conjunction of 
good with truth is effected, all these varieties of 
good being separated;

16. And they shall be consecrated to the Lord in 

worship from the good of faith, because even this 
good is sanctified by Divine Love, and is 
productive of heavenly rest and peace; for

good nor truth celestial can be appropriated by the 
merely natural man as his own.

References and Notes

1. Here the peace offering signifies the worship of the Lord from freedom, 10097; it is said 

"promoting the conjunction of the External with the Internal," because when man has entered 
into the celestial state, described in the last chapter, and in consequence ceases to act from a 
principle of truth, and begins to act freely from love or good with delight and gratitude, this 
naturally brings the affections of the external man into conjunction and harmony with those of 
the internal, 3987; see also 93, 95; an offering of the herd signifies worship from the affections
of the natural man, 5913, 6126; male and female signify as to truth and as to good, 725; and 
without blemish before the Lord signifies free from any admixture of evil and falsity, 7837.

2. This appears from the signification of laying his hand upon the head of the offering, as 

denoting the communication of power from the Internal to the External, 878, 10023; of killing 
it at the door of the tent of meeting, as denoting the preparation of the External by the 
acknowledgement of the Lord, and influx through the heavens, 10024, 2356, 35403; and of 
sprinkling the blood on the altar round about, as denoting the conjunction of truth with good, 
and thus conjunction with the Lord, 9946, 10047.

26

3. The proofs are, that a peace offering denotes worship from freedom, 10097; an offering made 
by fire denotes the acknowledgement of the Lord from pure love, 10055; fat denotes good, 
10033; the fat that covers the inwards or intestines and the fat that is upon them denote the 
lowest natural good as to understanding and will, because the understanding is not only, in the 
perfect man, the outward form and expression of the will, but is also the covering of the will, 
10033, 353, 9632.

4. This is true, because as the inwards or intestines denote the lowest degree of good, so the two 
kidneys with the fat upon them denote a middle degree of truth and good, 10032, 10074, 353; 
the loins denote the conjunction of truth and good, 3915; the long lobe upon the liver denotes 
the interior good of the external or natural man, 10031; and this being taken away or separated
with the kidneys, denotes that all these varieties of good are to be consecrated to the service of
the Lord, as appears from the following verse.

5. Here, by Aaron's sons burning all this fat upon the altar upon the burnt offering, is denoted 
entire consecration to the Lord, as to the external or natural man, 10052; upon the wood, 
denotes acknowledgement at first as from a sense of meriting thereby, because the wood 
signifies the good of merit, 2784; upon the fire, denotes afterwards from pure love, 934; and 
an offering made by fire of a sweet savour to the Lord denotes worship from pure love, which 
is grateful and acceptable to the Lord, and productive of heavenly rest and peace, 10052, 
10054.

6. This is shown as follows: a peace offering of the flock signifies worship from freedom under 
the influence of spiritual affection, 5913, 6126, 10097; male or female signifies as to truth or 
as to good, 725; and without blemish signifies free from contamination with evil and falsity, 
7837.

7. This is demonstrated from the signification of a lamb as denoting the good of innocence, 3994;

in this reference we are also told that the iamb may denote charity, and the reason why, 
namely, that the original Hebrew word means a sheep as well as a lamb, 4169; and to offer the 
sacrifice before the Lord evidently denotes to acknowledge the Lord in worship, 10227, 9373.

8. Here, laying his hand on the head of his oblation denotes the communication of power to 

worship from the Lord through inmost principles to the internal or spiritual principle, chap 1:4,
10023; killing the animal denotes preparation for worship, 10024, 2356, 35403; 10025, by 
influx through the heavens, and conjunction with the Lord. Also sprinkling the blood on the 
altar round about denotes the conjunction of the spiritual man with the Lord, 10047.

9.

In this verse, an offering made by fire to the Lord denotes that which brings joy and peace, 
because grounded in love, 10055; the fat thereof denotes celestial good internal, 10033; the fat
tail entire denotes celestial good external, or in ultimates, and perfect, 10070, 7837; taken 
away hard by the backbone denotes separation from merely natural love, 10071; and the fat 
that covers the inwards and the fat that is upon them denote the lowest good of the natural man
as to the understanding and as to the will, ver. 3.

10. This is true, because, as the inwards or intestines denote the lowest degree of good, so the two 
kidneys with the fat that is upon them denote a middle degree of truth and good, 10032, 
10074, 353; the loins denote the conjunction of truth with good, 3915; the long lobe upon the 
liver denotes the interior good of the external or natural man, 10031; and this being taken 

27

away or separated with the kidneys, denotes that all these varieties of good are to be 
consecrated to the service of the Lord, as appears from the following verse.

11. This is true also, because burning the sacrifice upon the altar denotes consecration to the Lord,
10053; and the food, or bread of the offering made by fire to the Lord, denotes the celestial 
principle of love from Him, 276, 10055.

12. This may be seen from the signification of a goat, as denoting the good of faith, which is the 

same as the good of truth, 4169; and of its being offered before the Lord, as evidently denoting
the acknowledgement of the Lord, 10227, 9373.

13. By laying the hand on the head of the offering is denoted that the internal man shall flow into 

the external, that is, into this good of faith, with power, 10023; killing the animal before the 
tent of meeting denotes preparation by influx through the heavens, 10024, 35403; and the sons 
of Aaron, sprinkling the blood upon the altar round about denotes that Divine Truth is 
conjoined with Divine Good, by means of holy truths derived from celestial good, 10047, 
9946.

14. The proofs are, that the oblation, which was a peace offering, denotes worship from freedom, 
10097; that an offering made by fire to the Lord denotes the acknowledgement of the Lord 
from pure love, 10055; that fat denotes good, 10033; that the fat covering the inwards or 
intestines denotes the lowest natural good as to the understanding; and the fat upon them, the 
same as to the will, 10033, 353. 9632.

15. This is true, because, as the inwards or intestines denote the lowest degree of good, so the two 
kidneys with the fat upon them denote a middle degree of truth and good, 10032, 10074, 353; 
the loins denote the conjunction of truth with good, 3915; the long lobe upon the liver denotes 
the interior good of the external or natural man, 10031; and this being taken away or separated
with the kidneys denotes that all these varieties of good are to be consecrated to the service of 
the Lord, as appears from the following verse.

16. This is true also, because burning the sacrifice on the altar denotes consecration to the Lord, 
10052; the food, or bread of the offering made by fire to the Lord, denotes the celestial 
principle of love from Him, 276, 10055; a sweet savour, or an odour of rest, denotes what is 
productive of heavenly rest and peace, 10054; and all the fat being the Lord's, denotes that all 
celestial good is from the Lord, 10033.

17. This is demonstrated from the signification of a perpetual statute, as denoting a perpetual law 
of Divine Order, 7884, 7931; of throughout generations, as denoting regeneration by the 
reception of good, 1041; of eating, as denoting appropriation, 2187; of fat, as denoting 
celestial good, 10033; and of blood, as denoting Divine Truth, 10026.

Discussion

We now proceed to make some remarks of a general character on this whole chapter. When man has 
passed from the spiritual into the celestial state, and thus, when love prevails, it is evident that he 
comes into essential freedom, for all freedom is of the ruling love.

Yet it must not be supposed that his worship of the Lord was not free before. It was so, indeed, but it 
was not fully in freedom. In order to worship the Lord truly in any state the worshiper must freely 

28

choose to do so; and he may do this even by compelling himself to act decidedly against his merely 
natural inclinations, and, in that case, he may often appear to worship not freely. Let him not, however, 
be discouraged, but persevere; for in perseverance to accomplish a good end there lies concealed the 
genuine freedom described by the sacrifices in this chapter in the very best sense.

But again, like the meal offering, these peace-making sacrifices may, in some places, describe the 
imperfect states of freedom just hinted at. For many a time in the course of our spiritual trials and 
temptations there arises within us a season of joy and peace, and freedom from care and anxiety, which 
is a foretaste of the true heavenly freedom which will finally be ours. And in such states we shall be 
prompted by gratitude and affection spiritually to offer our free-will offerings, or to embody our inward
state in some action expressive of gratitude and delight; and such offerings, like our final peace 
offering, will, in their degree, not fail to promote the harmony of the internal and external man, without
which full heavenly freedom could not exist and be permanent.

And these thoughts lead immediately to another consideration. In proportion as our natural man is 
purified, in the same proportion is true freedom established. And this shows why we have in the chapter
before us such particular mention of the respective offices of the intestines, the kidneys and the liver 
which so exactly correspond to the functions of our spiritual purification in various degrees. All our 
evils, in fact, originate in the natural degree, and therefore in the natural degree are found the means of 
our cleansing.

Another thought also worthy of our notice is that the natural processes for the preservation of our 
bodies in health are not under our own direction. We may, by some actions, either injure or promote the
proper course of these processes. But we never direct them. The Lord alone does that. And when we 
consider this truth as regards our very bodies, we can see in it a wonderful and confirming evidence of 
the existence and universality of the continual Divine presence and power. And so undoubtedly it is 
spiritually. We cannot purify ourselves from evil and falsity; it is the Lord alone who purifies, and this 
by various methods. The goodness of the Lord, even the real celestial principle, is present even in the 
ultimates of our spiritual being; and this goodness it is which aids us, and which must be preserved and 
consecrated to the Lord, because it comes from Him. This is denoted all through by the fat, yea, even in
that part of our life which is represented by the intestines.

But goodness alone does not purify. It operates by truth. And the share of truth in discriminating from 
good, between truth and falsity, is represented by the two kidneys, as we have already seen. And here 
again the discrimination is so perfect that we feel we cannot claim the direction of the process. The 
Lord directs, but we have the power of co-operation with Him, both as regards the acquisition of truth 
and goodness.

And finally, it is to be observed (a) that the whole process of man's purification, by the exercise of 
power from the Lord freely or voluntarily, results in complete and eternal conjunction with Him, the 
course of purification always being in the natural man in a threefold way, as represented by the 
functions of the intestines, the kidneys and the liver, whether the subject of regeneration be a natural or 
spiritual man; and (b) that it is impossible for any one to eternity to receive either truth or good from 
the Lord so as to have it inherent in himself, the regenerated man being only a continual receptacle of 
these blessings, and thus, too, continually dependent upon his Creator and Redeemer and Regenerator 
for every good and perfect spiritual power and natural delight.

The Contents of each Verse

1. And the LORD spoke to Moses, 

1. There is influx from the Lord by Divine Truth 

saying. 

giving the perception,

2. Speak to the children of Israel, 
saying, If any one shall sin 
unwittingly, in any of the things 
which the LORD has commanded not 
to be done, and shall do any one of 
them: 

3.

If the anointed priest shall sin so as 
to bring guilt on the people; then let 
him offer for his sin, which he has 
sinned, a young bullock without 
blemish to the LORD for a sin 
offering. 

4. And he shall bring the bullock to the 
door of the tent of meeting before the
LORD; and he shall lay his hand upon
the head of the bullock, and kill the 
bullock before the LORD. 

2. And revelation to the man of the Spiritual Church, 
that when he violates the Divine law through 
ignorance and error in those particulars of Divine 
Truth concerning the shunning of evil, and shall 
actually commit sin not intending to do so;

3. As, for example, when any one who is inwardly in 
celestial good by reception from the Lord, shall err
so as to bring injury upon those in a lower state 
who are in truths but not as yet in good, then 
because such a person is in the innocence of 
ignorance belonging to the natural man, he will 
worship the Lord from that good of innocence; the
error shall not be imputed to him; and the 
remission of evil shall take place.

4. And this worship shall be by the 

acknowledgement of the Lord and His operation 
through the heavens; there shall be influx from the
internal man into the good of innocence in the 
external with power; and the natural man shall be 
prepared by self-denial for such worship.

31

5. And the anointed priest shall take of 
the blood of the bullock, and bring it 
to the tent of meeting: 

6. And the priest shall dip his finger in 
the blood, and sprinkle of the blood 
seven times before the LORD, before 
the veil of the sanctuary. 

7. And the priest shall put of the blood 
upon the horns of the altar of sweet 
incense before the LORD, which is in 
the tent of meeting; and all the blood
of the bullock shall he pour out at the
base of the altar of burnt offering, 
which is at the door of the tent of 
meeting. 

5. And he who has erred shall, from his essential 

good, discern the Divine Truth relating to the good
of innocence in the natural man, acknowledging 
that it is from the Lord through the heavens.

6. And this good shall operate from Divine Good 

with some power by Divine Truth in a holy state of
acknowledgement that truth is to be conjoined 
with good in the Natural, even though the inmost 
state of their conjunction does not appear.

7. But nevertheless this conjunction is through the 

celestial and spiritual degrees, even in the ultimate 
truths thereof, and shall be acknowledged to be 
from the Lord there; and it shall be effected also in
the natural degree in completeness by a similar 
acknowledgement.

8. And all the fat of the bullock of the 
sin offering he shall take off from it; 
the fat that covers the inwards, and 
all the fat that is upon the inwards, 

8. For all celestial good is to be distinguished and 

separated from merely natural good, even the 
lowest degree thereof as to the understanding and 
the will;

9. And the two kidneys, and the fat that
is upon them, which is by the loins, 
and the long lobe upon the liver, with
the kidneys, shall he take away, 

10. As it is taken off from the ox of the 
sacrifice of peace offerings: and the 
priest shall burn them upon the altar 
of burnt offering. 

9. The middle degree as to discriminating truths and 
the affections thereof, by which the conjunction of 
truth with good is effected; and the interior degree 
where the conjunction of good with truth is 
effected,

10. Just as it is in the worship of the Lord from 

freewill; and all these varieties of good shall be 
wholly consecrated as from the Lord.

11. And the skin of the bullock, and all 
its flesh, with its head, and with its 
legs, and its inwards, and its dung, 

11. But all merely natural truth and good, inmost, 
middle, and lowest, thus everything that is 
absolutely impure,

32

12. Even the whole bullock shall he 
carry forth without the camp to a 
clean place, where the ashes are 
poured out, and burn it on wood with
fire: where the ashes are poured out 
shall it be burnt. 

12. With what is excrementitious, and in fact the 

whole unregenerate natural man, shall be separated
from the heavenly life, the act of such separation 
being pure in itself, and coinciding with the 
removal of such things as have served their 
purposes And thus the merely natural good which 
claims merit for itself shall be vastated through 
self-love in the case of the wicked, and rejected 
through love to the Lord in the case of the spiritual
man, because it is no longer a means of use.

13. And if the whole congregation of 

13. Again, when the spiritual man as well as the 

Israel shall err, and the thing be hid 
from the eyes of the assembly, and 
they have done any of the things 
which the LORD has commanded not 
to be done, and are guilty; 

14. When the sin wherein they have 

sinned is known, then the assembly 
shall offer a young bullock for a sin 
offering, and bring it before the tent 
of meeting. 

celestial shall err, and yet he is ignorant thereof, 
and thus actual sin is committed, contrary to the 
laws of Divine Order, and consequently there is 
guilt;

14. Then, when such error and sin are discovered to 
the spiritual man, he shall worship the Lord from 
the natural affection for good in its innocence, in 
order that the evil may be removed; and this shall 
be done by the acknowledgement of the Lord and 
the heavenly life from Him.

15. And the elders of the congregation 

shall lay their hands upon the head of
the bullock before the LORD: and the
bullock shall be killed before the 
LORD. 

15. And from the internal man, shall there be influx 
with power into the natural affection, with 
acknowledgement of the Lord; and the natural 
man shall be prepared, by self-denial, for such 
worship.

16. And the anointed priest shall bring of
the blood of the bullock to the tent of
meeting: 

17. And the priest shall dip his finger in 
the blood, and sprinkle it seven times
before the LORD, before the veil. 

16. And from the good of celestial love operating in 
the natural man, shall the Divine Truth be 
discerned relating to the good of innocence, with 
the acknowledgement that it is of the Lord through
the heavens.

17. And also from celestial good operating in the 
Truths of faith with some power, shall the 
conjunction of truth with good, or of faith with 
charity, be acknowledged as from the Lord 
through the celestial heavens, in a holy state, 
although the inmost celestial life of the spiritual 
man is, as yet, obscure.

33

18. And he shall put of the blood upon 

18. Also the conjunction of truth with good in the 

the horns of the altar which is before 
the LORD, that is in the tent of 
meeting, and all the blood shall he 
pour out at the base of the altar of 
burnt offering, which is at the door 
of the tent of meeting. 

spiritual degree shall be acknowledged with power
in worship; and it shall be effected with fullness in
the Natural, by the acknowledgement of the Lord 
and of His operation through the heavens.

19. And all the fat thereof shall he take 

19. But whatever of celestial good there is in the 

off from it, and burn it upon the altar.

20. Thus shall he do with the bullock; as 
he did with the bullock of the sin 
offering, so shall he do with this: and
the priest shall make atonement for 
them, and they shall be forgiven. 

21. And he shall carry forth the bullock 
without the camp, and burn it as he 
burned the first bullock: it is the sin 
offering for the assembly. 

22. When a ruler sins, and does 

unwittingly any one of all the things 
which the LORD his God has 
commanded not to be done, and is 
guilty; 

23. If his sin, wherein he has sinned, be 
made known to him, he shall bring 
for his oblation a goat, a male 
without blemish; 

24. And he shall lay his hand upon the 

head of the goat, and kill it in the 
place where they kill the burnt 
offering before the LORD: it is a sin 
offering. 

natural degree of the spiritual man, is to be 
acknowledged as from the Lord, and is to be 
wholly consecrated to Him.

20. This is the law for the purification and 

sanctification of the Natural; as it is in the case of 
the remission of sins, so it is in the case of errors, 
the state as to good from the Lord and consequent 
purification, brings about the reconciliation of the 
spiritual man with the Lord, and of the External 
with the Internal.

21. And all merely natural affections shall be 

separated from the heavenly life, whether they 
belong to the celestial or spiritual man, for they are
consumed by self-love; and thus as to the whole 
man must evil and error be removed.

22. Again, when any one in the truth of faith, through 
ignorance and without evil intention, violates the 
commandments which enjoin the shunning of evil 
as sins, and therefore incurs guilt;

23. Then, when such a person is enlightened so as to 
perceive his fault, he shall worship the Lord from 
the truth of his faith, free from error;

24. And the internal man shall then, with power, flow 
into his truth of faith; and he shall prepare himself,
by self-denial, for the worship of the Lord from 
love; and the evil shall be removed,

34

25. And the priest shall take of the blood
of the sin offering with his finger, 
and put it upon the horns of the altar 
of burnt offering, and the blood 
thereof shall he pour out at the base 
of the altar of burnt offering. 

26. And all the fat thereof shall he burn 
upon the altar, as the fat of the 
sacrifice of peace offerings: and the 
priest shall make atonement for him 
as concerning his sin, and he shall be
forgiven. 

25. And from the principle of good shall the truth of 
faith be animated with some power; and the 
conjunction of truth with good shall take place in 
the natural degree.

26. But the celestial good belonging to the natural man
shall be acknowledged as from the Lord, and shall 
be consecrated to Him from a principle of free-
will, and in this way shall the evil be removed and 
forgiveness follow.

27. And if any one of the common 

people sin unwittingly, in doing any 
of the things which the LORD has 
commanded not to be done, and be 
guilty; 

27. Also when any one in the good of faith, which is 
interior, shall through ignorance and without any 
evil intention violate the commandments which 
enjoin the shunning of evils as sins, and shall thus 
be guilty;

28. If his sin, which he has sinned, be 
made known to him, then he shall 
bring for his oblation a goat, a 
female without blemish, for his sin 
which he has sinned. 

28. When his error is discovered to him, then he shall 
worship the Lord from the good of his faith 
without any admixture of evil or error, 
acknowledging that he has acted against the laws 
of order.

29. And he shall lay his hand upon the 
head of the sin offering, and kill the 
sin offering in the place of burnt 
offering. 

30. And the priest shall take of the blood
thereof with his finger, and put it 
upon the horns of the altar of burnt 
offering, and all the blood thereof 
shall he pour out at the base of the 
altar. 

29. And the internal man shall flow into the external 

with power; and the interior man shall be prepared
for the worship of the Lord from love.

30. And from celestial good shall the good of faith be 
rendered active, and shall be conjoined with truth 
with some power in the interior; and moreover, the
conjunction of truth with good shall be effected 
also in the Natural.

31. And all the fat thereof shall he take 
away, as the fat is taken away from 
off the sacrifice of peace offerings; 
and the priest shall burn it upon the 
altar for a sweet savour to the LORD; 
and the priest shall make atonement 
for him, and he shall be forgiven. 

31. For all celestial good in such worship shall be 
separated from evil and error, just as in sincere 
adoration from free-will; and it shall be 
consecrated to the Lord, being grateful and 
acceptable to Him. And thus evil shall be 
removed; and thus, too, shall the external man be 
reconciled to the internal.

32. And if he bring a lamb as his 

32. But if such a person worship the Lord from 

oblation for a sin offering, he shall 
bring it a female without blemish. 

celestial love and its innocence which is inmost 
worship, it shall be without any admixture of evil.

35

33. And he shall lay his hand upon the 
head of the sin offering, and kill it 
for a sin offering in the place where 
they kill the burnt offering. 

34. And the priest shall take of the blood
of the sin offering with his finger, 
and put it upon the horns of the altar 
of burnt offering, and all the blood 
thereof shall he pour out at the base 
of the altar: 

35. And all the fat thereof shall he take 
away, as the fat of the lamb is taken 
away from the sacrifice of peace 
offerings; and the priest shall burn 
them on the altar, upon the offerings 
of the LORD made by fire: and the 
priest shall make atonement for him 
as touching his sin that he has 
sinned, and he shall be forgiven. 

33. And the internal man shall flow in with power into
the external; and he shall be prepared for the true 
worship of the Lord from love.

34. And from the Lord shall celestial good in 

innocence be animated with some power; truth 
shall be conjoined with good inmostly; and also 
there shall be full conjunction of truth with good 
in the Natural.

35. And thus all the celestial good shall be reserved as 
to the good of innocence, which is reserved in a 
free state of worship; it shall be acknowledged to 
be from the Lord; and shall be consecrated to Him 
in worship; for it is the worship of the Lord from 
pure love. And thus evil shall be removed by 
celestial love from the Lord; the worshiper shall be
reconciled to the Lord, and the external man to the
internal; and a full state of separation from evil 
shall be the result.

References and Notes

1. By the Lord, or by Jehovah, is denoted the Divine Being as to His love, 2001; by speaking is 
denoted influx, 2951; by Moses is represented Divine Truth or the Word, 7010, 6752; and by 
saying is denoted perception, 1791, 1822.

It is to be observed that the words of this verse, and similar expressions, frequently occur in 
the Word, the reason for which is, that they signify, with regard to the internal sense, a new 
beginning, but continuous with what goes before, and thus a change of the subject, and the 
connection of one subject with another. Up to this point the general subject has been the 
worship of the Lord by man in different states; and this subject is now continued; but whereas 
the previous chapters have relation to the adoration of the Lord from various affections, what 
now follows describes such worship as ought to be offered, in consequence of error and sin. 
And if we reflect upon our own experience in the course of regeneration, we shall actually find
that our changes of life internal and external mostly bring with them new states of thought, or 
new revelations; and thus the Word itself in many places appears to us in a new light, because 
every change in the state of our affections which is the consequence of continued and 
determined resistance to evil, makes our perceptions of truth clearer, fulfilling the law 
expressed in the words, "Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God." To become pure
in heart is to have the affections purified; and to see God, as a consequence, is to discern the 
truth more clearly, 7191.

2. The proofs are as follow: speaking denotes revelation, 8920; the children of Israel represented 

the Spiritual Church, 3654; to sin unwittingly, is to violate the Divine law through ignorance 

36

and error, 9156, 10042, III.; the things which the Lord has commanded not to be done are evils
that should be avoided, as is evident; and to do these is to commit sin, 5076.

3. This is clear from the signification of the anointed priest, as denoting those in celestial good 

by reception from the Lord, 99547; of sinning as, in this case, denoting error, ver. 2; of guilt as 
here denoting the consequences of error, namely injury, 3400; of the people in respect to the 
priest as denoting those in a lower state, 6451; of people, therefore, as denoting those in truths 
and not yet in good, 1259; of the priest, as evidently denoting one in the innocence of 
ignorance, ver. 3; of an offering for sin, as denoting the worship of the Lord in that state, 5913,
6126; of a young bullock without blemish, as denoting the good of innocence in the natural 
man, 9391, 7837; and of the sin offering, as denoting that the error is not imputed, and that 
remission shall take place, 3400, 10122. See also the notes under ver. 4, chap, i., where the 
subject of atonement is considered, to which it may be added that the forgiveness of sin 
depends on the repentance of man; the worship of the Lord in that state of repentance; and 
man's coming, consequently, fully into the state of good, or, in other words, of love to God and
man, which is the real atonement or reconciliation (Rom 5:11; 2 Cor 5:19).

4. This is seen by considering that, to bring the bullock to the door of the tent of meeting, denotes
the acknowledgement of the Lord and His operation through the heavens, 2356, 35403; that to 
lay his hand upon its head, denotes influx from the internal man into the good of innocence in 
the external with power, 878, 10023; and that killing it before the Lord denotes preparation by 
self-denial for such worship, 10024, 9990.

5. This is true, because the anointed priest denotes the essential good belonging to the offender 
conjoined with its truth, 99547; the blood of the bullock, denotes the Divine Truth relating to 
the good of innocence in the natural man, 10047; and bringing it to the tent of meeting denotes
the acknowledgement of the Lord, and His influence through the heavens, 2356, 35403.

6. Here, by the priest dipping his finger in the blood, is denoted operation from Divine Good 

with some power by Divine Truth, 7430; by sprinkling the blood seven times before the Lord 
is denoted a holy state of acknowledgement that truth is to be conjoined with good in the 
Natural, 10047, 716; by the blood being of the bullock is denoted, what is of the Natural, 
5913, 6126; and by its being sprinkled before the veil of the sanctuary, is denoted that the 
inmost state of conjunction does not appear, 9670, 3207.

7. To put of the blood on the horns of the altar of sweet incense, denotes that this conjunction is 
through the celestial and spiritual degrees, even in the ultimate truths thereof, and shall be 
acknowledged to be from the Lord there, 10176, 10208, 2832, 10642; and to pour the blood of
the bullock out at the base of the altar of burnt offering which is at the door of the tent of 
meeting, denotes that this conjunction shall be effected, also in the natural degree in 
completeness by a similar acknowledgement, 10047, 2356, 35403.

8. This is demonstrated thus: the fat of the bullock denotes celestial good, 10033; to be taken 

away, is to be distinguished and separated from merely natural good, as is evident, chap 3:4, 5;
and the fat that covers the inwards, and all the fat that is upon them, denote this good in the 
lowest, or natural degree as to the understanding and will, chap. iii. ver. 3.

37

9. Also the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, which is by the loins, and the long lobe 

upon the liver, denote the middle degree as to discriminating truths and the affections thereof 
by which the conjunction of truth with good is effected, and the interior degree where the 
conjunction of good with truth is effected, chap. iii. ver. 4.

10. Here, "as it is taken off from the ox, of the sacrifice of peace offerings," denotes just as it is in 
the worship of the Lord from freewill, 10097; and the priest burning them upon the altar of 
burnt offering, denotes that all these varieties of good are wholly consecrated as from the 
Lord, chap. iii. ver. 5.

11. By the skin of the bullock, is denoted all merely natural truth, 3540; by the flesh, all merely 
natural good, 10040; by the head is denoted the inmost, 10048; by the legs is denoted the 
middle, 10049, 10050; by the inwards is denoted the lowest, 10049; and by the dung is 
denoted everything that is absolutely impure, 10037.

12. By the whole bullock is here denoted the entire unregenerated natural man, 10040; by without 
the camp, is denoted separation from the heavenly life, 4236; by the clean place, is denoted 
that the act of separation is pure, 4545, 2625; by where the ashes are poured out, is denoted the
removal of things that have served their use, 9723; by the wood is denoted the good of merit, 
2784; by fire is denoted love, 934; and by burning is denoted vastation through self-love, or 
rejection through love to the Lord as the case may be, 934, 2445, 2449.

13. This is plain from the signification of the whole congregation of Israel as denoting, the 

spiritual Church, 3654; of the erring as evidently denoting sinning by mistake, 9156; of the 
thing being hidden from the eyes, as denoting through ignorance of truth in the understanding, 
6721, 4526; of doing any of those things which the Lord has commanded not to be done, as 
denoting to commit sin which is contrary to Divine Order, 5076; and of being guilty, as 
denoting a consciousness of the error, 3400.

14. This is evident, because the sin becoming known, denotes the discovery of the fault from a 

knowledge of the truth, 2230; because a young bullock denotes, in the sacrifices, the worship 
of the Lord from the good of innocence in the natural man, 9391; because a sin offering 
denotes the removal of evil, 3400, 10122; and because bringing it before the tent of meeting, 
denotes the acknowledgement of the Lord, and the heavenly life from Him, 2356, 35403.

15. The elders of the congregation denote, with respect to the assembly generally, the internal 

man, since they denote chief points of wisdom, 6524; laying their hands upon the head of the 
bullock, denotes influx with power into the natural affection, 878, 10023; before the Lord, 
evidently denotes with acknowledgement of the Lord, 10024, and the bullock being killed 
denotes preparation by self-denial for such worship, 10024, 9990.

16. The truth of this appears from considering that the anointed priests denotes the essential good 
of the offender conjoined with its truths, 9954; the blood of the bullock, denotes the Divine 
Truth relating to the good of innocence in the natural man, 10047; and bringing it to the tent of
meeting, denotes the acknowledgement of the Lord and of His influence through the heavens, 
2356, 35403.

17. Here, by the priest dipping his finger in the blood, is denoted operation from Divine Good, 

with some power, by Divine Truth, 7430; by sprinkling the blood seven times before the Lord, 

38

is denoted a holy state of acknowledgement that truth is to be conjoined with good in the 
Natural, 10047, 716; by the blood being of the bullock, is denoted what is of the Natural, 
5913, 6126; and by its being sprinkled before the veil of the sanctuary, is denoted that the 
inmost state of conjunction does not appear, 9670, 3207.

18. To put of the blood on the horns of the altar, which is before the Lord in the tent of meeting, 
denotes that the conjunction of truth with good in the spiritual degree is to be acknowledged 
with power in worship, 10176, 10208, 2832, 10642; and to pour the blood of the bullock out at
the base of the altar of burnt offering, which is at the door of the tent of meeting, denotes that 
this conjunction is effected with fullness also in the Natural, by the acknowledgement of the 
Lord, and His operation through the heavens, 10047, 2356, 35403.

19. This is clear from the signification of the fat, as denoting celestial good, 10033; and of burning
upon the altar, as denoting entire consecration to the Lord in worship by acknowledgement, 
faith and love, 10052.

20. To do thus with the bullock, denotes the law for the purification and sanctification of the 

Natural, 9391, 7837; as he did with the bullock of the sin offering, so shall he do with this, 
denotes that as it is in the remission of sins, so it is in the case of errors, 10042, III.; the priest 
shall make atonement for them, and they shall be forgiven, denotes that the state as to good 
from the Lord and consequent purification, brings about the reconciliation of the spiritual man 
with the Lord, and of the External with the Internal, 95061, 10023, 10042, II.

21. Carrying forth the bullock out of the camp, signifies that all merely natural affections shall be 

separated from the heavenly life, 10040, 4236; doing with it as he did with the first bullock, 
signifies the same for the spiritual as for the celestial man, because the priest denotes the 
celestial and the assembly the spiritual, 99547, 3654; burning the bullock without the camp, 
signifies consumption by selfish love, 934, 2445, 2449; and a sin offering for the assembly, 
signifies the removal of evil and error from the whole man, since the assembly denotes the 
external man, 3654, 10243.

22. This is thus proved: a ruler or prince denotes one in primary truths, and thus one in the truth of

faith, 2089, 8314; doing unwittingly what is commanded not to be done, denotes to sin 
through ignorance, 9156, 10042, III.; the things which ought not to be done are falsities and 
evils that ought to be shunned as sins; and to be guilty is to incur guilt, as is evident.

23. By his sin being made known to him is denoted that he is enlightened by the Truth so as to 

perceive his fault, 2230; by bringing an oblation is denoted to worship the Lord, 349, 922; by a
goat, a male, is denoted the truth of faith, 4169, 725; and by being without blemish is denoted 
freedom from error, 7837.

24. Laying his hand upon the head of the goat, denotes that the internal man flows into the truth of
his faith in the external man with power, 878, 10023; killing the goat denotes preparation, by 
self-denial for the worship of the Lord from love, 10024, 4169; in the place where they kill the
burnt offering denotes in a state of worshiping from love, 2625, 923; and its being a sin 
offering denotes the removal of the evil by such worship, 3400, 10122.

25. This is evident from considering that the priest denotes the principle of good, 9946; that the 
blood of the goat denotes the truth of faith, 10047, 4169; that dipping his finger in the blood 

39

denotes the operation of good upon truth with some power, 7430; that putting the blood upon 
the horns of the altar denotes the conjunction of truth with good internally; and pouring it at 
the base of the altar of burnt offering denotes the conjunction of truth with good in the natural 
degree, 10047.

26. The fat being burned upon the altar denotes that the celestial good belonging to the natural 
man shall be acknowledged to be from the Lord, and shall be consecrated to Him, 10033, 
10052; like the fat of the peace offerings, denotes from a principle of free-will, 10097; and the 
priest making atonement for him denotes the removal of the evil, and consequently 
forgiveness, 95061, 10042, II.

27. This is evident, because one of the common people, or, more strictly, one of the people of the 
land, denotes one in the good of faith, which is interior, 2928, 2950; and because sinning 
unwittingly in doing any of those things which the Lord has commanded not to be done, and 
being guilty, denotes sinning through ignorance and without any evil intention, 5076, 3400.

28. His sin being made known to him evidently denotes when his error is discovered by means of 
truth from the Word, 2230; to bring for his oblation a goat, a female without blemish, denotes 
to worship the Lord from the good of his faith without any admixture of evil or error, 349, 
922, 4169, 725, 7837; and that it was for his sin which he had sinned, denotes the 
acknowledgement of having acted against the laws of order, 9506, 10023, 10042, II.

29. Laying his hand upon the head of the sin offering denotes that the internal man flows into the 

good of faith in the external man with power, 878, 10023; and killing the sin offering in the 
place of the burnt offering denotes preparation of the interior man for the worship of the Lord 
from love, 10024, 4169, 2625, 923.

30. By the priest taking of the blood thereof with his finger and putting it upon the horns of the 

altar of burnt offering, is denoted that from celestial good shall the good of faith be rendered 
active, and shall be conjoined with truth with some power in the interior, 9946, 10047, 4169, 
7430; and by all the blood being poured also at the base of the altar, is denoted that the 
conjunction of truth with good is effected also in the Natural, 10047.

31. This is demonstrated from the signification of the fat as denoting celestial good, 10003; of 

being taken away, as evidently denoting to be separated from evil and error, chap. iii. vers. 4, 
5; of the peace offerings as denoting adoration from free-will, 10097; of burning upon the 
altar, as denoting consecration to the Lord, 10052; of a sweet savour, or an odour of rest to the 
Lord, as denoting what is grateful and acceptable to Him, 10054; and of the priest making 
atonement, and of his being forgiven, as denoting the removal of evil and the reconciliation of 
the external man with the internal, 95061, 10023, 10042, II.

32. This is thus proved: a lamb as an oblation for a sin offering denotes celestial love, and its 

innocence which is inmost, 10132; a female denotes good, as distinguished from a male which
denotes truth, 725; and without blemish denotes without any admixture with evil, 7837.

33. Laying his hand upon the head of the sin offering denotes that the internal man shall flow into 
the external with power, 878, 10023; and killing the sin offering in the place where they kill 
the burnt offering, denotes preparation for the true worship of the Lord from love, 10024, 
2625, 923.

40

34. The priest taking of the blood of the sin offering with his finger, and putting it upon the horns 
of the altar of burnt offering, denotes that, from the Lord, shall celestial good in innocence be 
animated with some power, and shall be conjoined with truth in the inmost, 9946, 7430, 
10207; and his pouring the blood at the base of the altar denotes full conjunction of truth with 
good in the Natural, 10047.

35. This is seen from the signification of the fat as denoting celestial good, 10033; of being taken 
away, as evidently denoting to be separated from evil and error, chap. iii. vers. 4, 5; of the 
peace offerings as denoting adoration from free-will, 10097; of burning upon the altar, as 
denoting consecration to the Lord, 10052; of an offering made by fire, as denoting worship 
from pure love, 934, 10055; and of making atonement for him, and his being forgiven, as 
denoting the removal of evil by celestial love from the Lord, reconciliation to the Lord, and 
the reconciliation of the external man to the internal, and thus a full state of separation from 
evil, 95061, 10023, 10042, II.

Discussion

We may now profitably take a general review of this whole chapter, already having given a brief 
summary of it. What precedes in the previous chapters is a connected series of truths descriptive of the 
worship of the Lord from pure, natural, spiritual, and celestial affections, showing that the essence of 
all real worship is the love of the Lord and the neighbour. To worship the Lord is to love Him. And 
when this truth is realized, it follows naturally that no one can worship the Lord without knowing Him; 
for how can any one love him of whom he knows nothing? Hence, then, one of the primary things in 
worship is to have a correct knowledge of the object of worship. But the question immediately arises, 
"How is such knowledge to be obtained? Is man so constituted that he can, from the visible things of 
creation around him, discover either the fact of the Lord's existence or what He is?" Certainly not; for 
no observation of this kind, by itself, can suggest the being of a God or disclose His character. And this 
is one reason why so many persons of vast attainments in science and philosophy have denied His 
existence. Who can by "searching" find out God (Job 11:7)? From all this, then, it follows that the idea 
of God, and some positive knowledge of Him, can only have come from God Himself, in the first 
instance, by Revelation. For we can hardly suppose the existence of a Divine Being, Who has endowed 
man with the capacity of thinking about Him, without at the same time concluding that "to believe in a 
God and in no revelation from Him is to believe in a God unjust and unwise." The Lord, therefore, we 
may be sure, has always revealed Himself to man; and this revelation is what we call the Word, or 
Divine Truth proceeding from Him, whether it has assumed the form of open communication, or of 
written composition preserved and handed down from age to age. And from this point of view we may 
see that the Word, as we now have it, must be wholly from the Lord, both as to its inward spirit and 
life, and as to its outward form. From the Word therefore we have our knowledge of the Lord, and to 
the Word only must we apply for even a more extensive knowledge of Him than we at present possess.

The Word, then, even in its literal sense, and more particularly in its internal sense, shows us the 
character of the Lord in order that we may worship Him right. He is, essentially, the self-existent 
Being, Who is love itself and wisdom itself united; and from Whom continually proceeds all the love 
and intelligence that man enjoys; and hence He is the Giver of every good and perfect gift, with Whom 
is no variableness nor shadow of turning. And if we worship Him, therefore, that is, if we love Him, 
we, too, shall be givers from Him, desiring to communicate to our fellow-creatures all that we can of 
His goodness, His truth and His happiness. "To love God and to love the neighbour is to love the good 
and the true, and to do them from the heart" (HH 16). And hence it is that by worship is not meant the 

41

adoration of the Lord in the sanctuary, by ceremonials and rituals, or even by prayers and praises, the 
reading of the Word, and the hearing of sermons, these being only either aids to the true worship of the 
Lord from love to Him, or the effects of our love to Him.

But now having made these general remarks illustrative of what real worship is, and ought always to 
be, we notice that our chapter in its internal sense, has special reference to that worship of the life 
which exists with those who, nevertheless, are guilty of violations of the laws of order through 
ignorance or error. And certainly one great truth that shines brightly in this description is, that the 
highest as well as the lowest order of mankind, and mankind in the aggregate as well as individuals, are
liable to error, from the effects of which only their real worship of the Lord by love can deliver them. 
For the remission of sin, or the forgiveness of sin, as it is often called, really means the removal of evil 
or error through genuine love, according to the laws of Divine Order, 865, 868, 874, etc.

Next we may notice the general similarity of the sacrifices required from the four sets of offenders by 
error, representing, of course, that the love of the Lord with them all has a certain general resemblance 
in externals. In short, all must do the work of repentance, even as regards unintentional mistakes, and 
all must recognize from the Lord that they are in innocence, by virtue of their ruling love of good, and 
not on account of any inherent good in themselves. And thus the bullocks, the goats, and the lamb are 
equally representative of innocence according to its different kinds and degrees.

But again, if there is a general similarity in the worship of the Lord, respectively with celestial, spiritual
and natural men, there are also specific differences; and these, in the chapter, are described by their 
appropriate symbolism. Let us notice them, therefore. Comparing the case of the priest that sinned 
unwittingly, with that of the assembly, we find that while the latter is said not to have known of the 
offence and afterwards to have been informed, it is not so said of the former, and this indicates one 
point of difference in character between the celestial, who are denoted by the priests, as we have 
shown, and the spiritual, who are denoted by the assembly or congregation. The celestial perceive their 
errors from their state of good, but the spiritual have to discover their errors from a knowledge of the 
truth. Some people seem to imagine that the celestial, before the commencement of the decline of the 
Most Ancient Church, were not the subjects of evil or error, and that their regeneration consisted in 
their advancement from a lower merely natural good, through spiritual good, to a perfect state of 
celestial good. But a careful study of the description of their regeneration as given in the first chapter of
Genesis, reveals the fact that those early celestials, who lived as wild animals, were not free from evil 
and error; for their darkness which was upon the face of the deep denoted the lusts and consequent 
falsities of their unregenerate natural man, 286, 18 (AE 294). Thus we see that the most ancient people,
who were of a celestial, as distinguished from a spiritual race, 640, were the subjects of evil and error, 
equally with those who, when the Most Ancient Church began to decline, also fell by the abuse of their 
liberty, 146. True, the origin of evil and the cause of it are not described previously, but they are 
certainly taken for granted as existing; and indeed, how can we suppose that while the highest order of 
celestial men gradually declined from their state of perfection, the lowest order did not do so at all? 
Hence we see from these considerations, as well as from our chapter, that a celestial race of men may 
err, and fall into sin equally with a spiritual race.

But now another point of difference between the worship of the celestial and spiritual orders is 
indicated in these accounts. Not only is there a difference as to the understanding, but there is a 
difference also as to the will. For the will of the celestial is represented by the priest, and the will of the 
spiritual by the elders. That is, the will of the celestial is good or love, while the will of the spiritual is 
truth or wisdom, since the elders denote chief points of wisdom. And thus it appears that the will of the 

42

celestial is more interior than the will of spiritual. Yet in both cases the will is the internal of the man 
and flows into the external with power to bring about a state of harmony.

And again a third peculiarity here noticeable is, that it is not the elders who make atonement in the case
of the spiritual, but the priest. The reason is, because the spiritual heaven derives its life from the Lord 
through the celestial, and thus only the pure good peculiar to the celestial can fully effect the perfect 
reconciliation of man with the Lord and of the External with the Internal.

We turn now, however, to the cases of the ruler or prince, and the man of the common people, or, more 
correctly, of the people of the land. And in passing we remark that, when the priest sinned, even the 
anointed priest, who represents those in truth conjoined with good, he brought guilt upon the people; 
and that when he made the atonement, the guilt must have been removed from both. Can any one sin, 
even unwittingly, and not affect injuriously those who are dependent upon him; and, more interiorly, 
can the affections wander into forbidden tracks, and the intellect remain unimpaired? And so again, can
an individual err, and his error not affect the community; or, more interiorly, can the intellectual 
principle in the External of the Natural, which ought to guide the affections, be in error, and not affect 
the well-being of those affections, and indeed of the whole man? Thus is the life of man in the 
aggregate one life, in which no individual can escape from his responsibility to mankind as a whole. 
Now that this ruler, or prince, rightly corresponds to the External of the Natural, is seen from observing
that he was required to offer a goat, a male without blemish. It was a goat and not a bullock, because it 
denotes what is of the intellectual principle in the External of the Natural, rather than what is of the 
affections; it was a male, because the truth of faith, as a ruling motive, is understood, and it was 
without blemish to denote such purity and perfection as belongs to a state of innocence. Natural men 
who have nothing but the truth of faith as a sincere principle of life, do not intentionally commit sin, or 
fall into error. But besides this we must remark that, in this case, the priest was required to take of the 
blood of the goat with his finger and put it upon the horns of the altar of burnt offering, and not as 
before on the horns of the altar of sweet incense, again showing that the person making the offering 
denotes worship from the External of the Natural.

And coming at length to the fourth case, we observe that the description differs from that of the third in
one or two particulars, which require notice. This person was one of the people of the land, and he 
represents those in good derived from truth, which is interior. Hence, therefore, his offering was a goat, 
a female, which corresponds to such good, but in other respects the description of his worship is the 
same as that for the ruler, who denotes the truth of faith, which must, in the beginning of man's 
religious experience, govern him until he advances thence. But it is not sufficient even for natural men 
to remain only in good as a principle; for they must become celestial according to their degree, and 
advance to the love of good itself, and the innocence that properly belongs to it. And this is the reason 
why, in this fourth case, the offering of a lamb is also described in the same terms as the offering of the 
goat. And thus we have in this whole chapter a regular series in the internal sense.

Leviticus Chapter 5

Summary of the Spiritual Sense

1. Concerning the confirmation of truths, ver. 1. 
2. Concerning sins of ignorance, through the force of impure affections, according to their degrees,

vers. 2-13, 

3. Concerning errors in internal worship, as to the will, vers. 14-16. And concerning similar errors 

as to the understanding, vers. 17-19. 

The Contents of each Verse

1. And if any one sin, in that he hears 
the voice of adjuration, he being a 
witness, whether he has seen or 
known, if he do not utter it, then he 
shall bear his iniquity: 

1.

If any one of the Spiritual Church violates Divine 
Order,—after he has confirmed the truth by the 
testimony of his understanding, either through 
perception, or knowledge received from others,—
by refusing to speak or act according to it, then 
evil is to be ascribed to him. Or again, from 
another point of view, if any one, having a 
perception and knowledge of the truth, becomes 
aware of his disposition to avert himself from it, 
and yet neglects to speak or act according to it, 
then evil is to be ascribed to him.

2. Or if any one touch any unclean 

2. Or if any one, in the slightest degree, acts 

thing, whether it be the carcase of an 
unclean beast, or the carcase of 
unclean cattle, or the carcase of 
unclean creeping things, and it be 
hidden from him, and he be unclean, 
then he shall be guilty: 

according to impure affections in the natural man, 
or according to evils there, which he has himself 
contracted, and which are without any spiritual 
life, whether they are inmost, interior, or external, 
and this happens to him unconsciously, yet he is in
evil.

3. Or if he touch the uncleanness of 
man, whatever his uncleanness be 
with which he is unclean, and it be 
hid from him; when he knows of it, 
then he shall be guilty: 

3. Or again if, in the slightest degree, any one acts 

according to interior evils of whatever kind, which
cause impurity, because grounded in the selfish 
and worldly life, and yet he is unconscious of 
wrong doing, then when he is led to see his 
impurity, he shall confess that he is in evil.

44

4. Or if any one swear rashly with his 
lips to do evil, or to do good, 
whatever it be that a man shall utter 
rashly with an oath, and it be hid 
from him; when he knows of it, then 
he shall be guilty in one of these 
things: 

5. And it shall be, when he shall be 

guilty in one of these things, that he 
shall confess that wherein he has 
sinned: 

6. And he shall bring his guilt offering 
to the LORD for his sin which he has 
sinned, a female from the flock, a 
lamb or a goat, for a sin offering; and
the priest shall make atonement for 
him as concerning his sin. 

7. And it his means suffice not for a 
lamb, then he shall bring his guilt 
offering for that wherein he has 
sinned, two turtledoves, or two 
young pigeons, to the LORD; one for 
a sin offering, and the other for a 
burnt offering. 

8. And he shall bring them to the priest,
who shall offer that which is for the 
sin offering first, and wring off its 
head from its neck, but shall not 
divide it to pieces: 

9. And he shall sprinkle of the blood of 
the sin offering upon the side of the 
altar; and the rest of the blood shall 
be drained out at the base of the 
altar: it is a sin offering. 

10. And he shall offer the second for a 
burnt offering, according to the 
ordinance: and the priest shall make 
atonement for him as concerning his 
sin which he has sinned, and he shall
be forgiven. 

4. Again, if any one through mistaken zeal confirms 
himself in falsities or in truths with the intention of
living according to them, whatever his error may 
be, and yet he is ignorant of it, on the discovery 
thereof, he shall acknowledge himself in evil.

5. And then it is his duty, on considering his 
particular fault, to acknowledge that also,

6. And he shall worship the Lord either from the 

internal or from the external good of innocence, 
doing the work of repentance; and then, because 
he is inmostly in good, his evil shall be remitted, 
and he shall have conjunction with the Lord.

7. But if he is neither in the celestial nor in, the 

spiritual good of innocence, he shall worship the 
Lord from the good of faith internal or external, on
the one hand by sincere repentance, and on the 
other with sincere affection.

8. And this shall be done from the principle of good, 
repentance preceding full worship, for, on account 
of evil, the internal man is, as yet, separated from 
the external in worship; and because such worship 
is from truth rather than good, there is not 
correspondence with the Lord.

9. Also there is to be the conjunction of good with 

truth in the spiritual degree according to the state, 
and in the natural degree in fullness according to 
the state.

10. But true worship must follow that involved in 

repentance, that is, worship from love according to
Divine Order; and thus the love of good will effect
the removal of evil rashly committed, and 
remission will follow.

45

11. But if his means suffice not for two 
turtledoves, or two young pigeons, 
then he shall bring his oblation for 
that wherein he has sinned, the tenth 
part of an ephah of fine flour for a 
sin offering; he shall put no oil upon 
it, neither shall he put any 
frankincense thereon: for it is a sin 
offering. 

11. And if such a person be not in the good of faith but
in the truth thereof, his devotion to the Lord 
through repentance and obedience shall be 
accordingly by truth, for it cannot be from celestial
love and spiritual truth, because it is worship 
implying and involving the removal of evil only, in
the first instance.

12. And he shall bring it to the priest, 

12. But still it shall be from the principle of good, 

and the priest shall take his handful 
of it as the memorial thereof, and 
burn it on the altar, upon the 
offerings of the LORD made by fire: 
it is a sin offering. 

standing for the genuine worship of the Lord, and 
being inscribed on the life, the evil being rejected; 
for Divine Love is opposed to evil.

13. And the priest shall make atonement 
for him as touching his sin that he 
has 

13. And good shall cause the removal of evil in all its 

forms; remission shall follow; and good shall be 
appropriated, even as is the case in worship from 
celestial and spiritual love.

14. And the LORD spoke to Moses, 

14. Moreover, there is revelation from the Lord giving

saying, 

the perception, by Divine Truth,

15. If any one commit a trespass, and sin
unwittingly, in the holy things of the 
LORD; then he shall bring his guilt 
offering to the LORD, a ram without 
blemish out of the flock, according 
to your estimation in silver by 
shekels, after the shekel of the 
sanctuary, for a guilt offering: 

15. That if any one unknowingly violates the Divine 
law in internal worship, apparently, from love or 
good, still he shall acknowledge the Lord and 
worship Him from the good of innocence in the 
internal or spiritual degree, uncontaminated with 
evil, according to the quality of spiritual truths 
with him, to which good is conjoined, in order that
guilt may be removed;

16. And he shall make restitution for that
which he has done amiss in the holy 
thing, and shall add the fifth part 
thereto, and give it to the priest: and 
the priest shall make atonement for 
him with the ram of the guilt 
offering, and he shall be forgiven. 

16. And repentance shall follow in respect to his error 

in internal worship, and further, some remains of 
truth shall be appropriated by good, and thus again
good shall remove evil and remission shall follow.

17. And if any one sin, and do any of the

17. And in short, if any one violates Divine law 

things which the LORD has 
commanded not to be done; though 
he knew it not, yet is he guilty, and 
shall bear his iniquity. 

concerning anything relating, generally, to the 
rejection of evil, he is guilty, although he may not 
be aware of it, and evil will adhere to him.

46

18. And he shall bring a ram without 

blemish out of the flock, according 
to your estimation, for a guilt 
offering, to the priest: and the priest 
shall make atonement for him 
concerning the thing wherein he 
erred unwittingly and knew it not, 
and he shall be forgiven. 

19. It is a guilt offering: he is certainly 

guilty before the LORD. 

18. And therefore he must worship the Lord from 
spiritual good, or the good of innocence in the 
internal man, according to his state and quality as 
to truths, and as being in evil; and by good evil 
shall be remitted according to the necessity, when 
sin takes place through ignorance as to the will and
understanding, and remission shall follow.

19. For all worship, more or less, is tainted with evil 
or error; and it cannot escape the searching 
scrutiny of Divine Good.

References and Notes

1. The proofs are, that to sin denotes to violate Divine Order, 5076; to hear the voice of 

adjuration, denotes to confirm the truth by the testimony of the understanding, for by hearing 
is signified perception, 3163, 8361, by a voice is signified the annunciation of truth, thus what 
appeals to the understanding, 6971, and by adjuration or swearing is signified the confirmation
of truth, 2842; a witness denotes the confirmation of good by truth, 4197; seeing denotes 
perception, 2150; knowing evidently denotes knowledge, 2230; not uttering it, denotes neglect
or refusal to speak or act according to the truth, for not to tell clearly denotes not 
acknowledging the truth by words and consequently by actions, 7550; and bearing iniquity 
denotes, in this case, that evil is ascribed, 9937, end. But under the other point of view 
swearing denotes aversion from good and truth, 1423.

2. This is evident from the signification of touching, as denoting what is of the affections, and 

also communication, translation, and reception, 4404, 10199; of an unclean thing, as denoting 
an impure, or evil affection, 10130; of a carcase, as denoting what is void of spiritual life, 
3900; of an unclean beast, or cattle, or creeping thing, as denoting impurities, internal, interior,
and external, 987, 46, 994; of the thing being hidden, as denoting what happens unconsciously,
6721; and of being guilty, as denoting to be in evil, 3400.

It is to be noted that, in this verse, the Hebrew word translated cattle in the A.V. and R.V. is 
rendered beast in AC from the Latin bestiam, in the original, while the word rendered in the 
versions by beast is, in AC translated wild animal from the Latin feram in the original under 
Gen 1:25, and the word rendered creeping things is not the same in this verse of Leviticus and 
in Gen 1:25. But now discarding the translations, and comparing the Hebrew alone, in this 
verse and in Gen 1:25, we observe that the three things, named in this verse in a series, are the 
same as those named in Genesis, corresponding there to good affections, but here to impure 
affections; so that if we carefully study the reference given above, 46, and particularly the 
tenth verse of Ps. cxlviii. there quoted, we shall see more clearly the correctness of our 
interpretation of this verse, and also the importance of a knowledge of the Hebrew in 
unfolding intelligently the internal sense of the Word in the Old Testament. It may be 
allowable to add also, that the two Hebrew terms used for creeping things, the one in this 
verse, and the other in Genesis and Ps. cxlviii., indicate, in their primary literal meaning, 
respectively, the abundance and the activity of the creatures for which they stand, and in their 
spiritual meaning, the tendency of merely natural and sensual affections to be continually 

47

repeating themselves, presenting themselves in new forms, and being persistent in their 
endeavours to cause excitement and unlawful agitation, verifying that, indeed, the serpent is 
more subtle than any wild animal of the field that the Lord God has made (Gen 3:1; AC 195). 
Certainly the delusions of sensual things are many and very presuming; and experience shows 
that they are to be avoided with much care.

3. This is true, because by touching is denoted communication, translation, and reception, as 
already shown; by uncleanness is denoted the spiritual impurity; and by the uncleanness of 
man as distinguished from animals, is denoted interior impurity through evil and falsity, 
10130, 7424.

4. To swear denotes to confirm truth or falsity, 2842; to swear rashly, evidently denotes to act or 
speak from mistaken zeal, that is, falsely, as the meaning of the Hebrew word shows; to do 
truth or falsity is to live according to it, 5755, but to utter it with the lips is first to confirm it in
the understanding, 1285; of a thing that is hidden a person is ignorant, 6721; but its being 
made known denotes instruction, 2230; and to be guilty denotes to be in evil, 3400.

5.

In this verse the internal sense appears to be almost identical with the latter; but it is to be 
observed that the outward confession of sin, unless there be also an inward acknowledgement 
of the particular evil that caused it, is of no value, and hence that this inward 
acknowledgement and confession are involved in the literal statement, 2329, 3880.

6. This is evident from considering that a guilt offering of a lamb or a goat, denotes the worship 
of the Lord from the good of innocence internal or external, 10132, 4169; that a female 
especially denotes good, 725; that without blemish denotes pure from evil and falsity, 
involving the work of repentance, 7837; that the priest denotes inmost good, 9946; and that 
making atonement denotes the removal of evil and conjunction with the Lord, 9506, 10023, 
10042, II.

7. This is proved from the signification of the means not sufficing for a lamb or a goat, the single
Hebrew word meaning either, as denoting inability on account of not being either in the 
celestial or spiritual good of innocence, 10132, 4169; of guilt, as, in this case, denoting sir, 
through ignorance, ver. 4; of turtledoves and young pigeons, as denoting the good of faith 
internal and external, 870, 1827, 10132; and of a sin offering and a burnt offering, as denoting,
respectively, the remission of sins, and conjunction with the Lord, 3400, 10122, 8680, 10053.

8.

In this verse, bringing the offering to the priests denotes the acknowledgement that this 
worship is from the principle of good, 9946, 10227; offering that which was for the sin 
offering first, denotes that repentance must precede full worship, 3400, 10122; wringing off its
head from its neck denotes the separation of the internal from the external in worship, and also
that worship from the understanding, denoted by the birds, does not give permanent 
conjunction with the Lord, 8079; and not dividing it to pieces denotes no correspondence with 
the Lord, 1832.

9. By sprinkling the blood of the sin offering at the side of the altar is signified the conjunction of
good with truth in the spiritual degree according to the state, 9736, 10185; by draining the rest 
of it at the base of the altar, is denoted full conjunction in the natural degree according to the 
state, 10047; and by "it is a sin offering," is denoted that thus there is the removal of evil, 
3400.

48

10. Offering the second bird for a burnt offering according to the ordinance signifies that true 

worship must follow that involved in repentance, as may be seen from the correspondence of 
the burnt offering, 8680, 10053; chap 1:14-17; and the priest making atonement for him and 
his being forgiven signify that the love of good will effect the removal of evil rashly 
committed, and that remission will follow, 9506, 10042, II.

11. His means not sufficing for two turtledoves or two young pigeons denotes that such a person is
not in the good of faith, 870, 1827, 10132; bringing for his oblation the tenth part of an ephah 
of fine flour, denotes worship from the truth of faith, 9995, 10136-7; and his putting no oil nor 
frankincense thereon denotes that worship cannot be from celestial love and spiritual truth 
because it is worship implying and involving the removal of evil only in the first instance, 
10137.

12. But to bring the oblation to the priest denotes that worship, in this case, shall still be from the 

principle of good, 9946; the priest to take a handful as a memorial denotes that this worship 
from truth stands for genuine worship, and its power, 6888, 7518; to burn it on the altar 
denotes consecration to the Lord, by the conjunction of truth with good, and consequently its 
being inscribed on the life, 10052; and its being a sin-offering denotes that the evil is rejected, 
because Divine Love signified by fire is opposed to evil, 3400, 10055.

13. The priest making atonement for him signifies that good causes the removal of evil in all its 

forms, 95061, 10023, 10042, II.; his being forgiven signifies the remission or removal of evil, 
ver. 10; and the remnant being for the priest signifies that good is appropriated, 9946, 2177, 
2187; while by its being said "as the meal offering," is denoted "even as is the case in worship 
from celestial and spiritual love," 4581, 9995, chap 2:1.

14. This is evident, because by Jehovah is denoted the Divine Being, as to His love, 2001; by 

speaking is denoted influx, 2951; by Moses is represented Divine Truth or the Word, 7010, 
6752; and by saying is denoted perception, 1791, 1822; chap 4:1.

15. By any one committing a trespass, and sinning unwittingly in the holy things of the Lord, is 
denoted, that if any one unknowingly violates the Divine law in internal worship, as may be 
seen from the signification of sinning unwittingly or by error, which signifies sin through 
ignorance, 9156, 10042, III., and of the holy things of the Lord, as distinguished from what the
Lord has commanded not to be done, chap 4:2, as denoting errors committed in internal 
worship as distinguished from those in external, 10149; by bringing a guilt offering to the 
Lord is denoted worship, apparently for the removal of evil, as if from good, 3400, 2001; by a 
ram is denoted the good of innocence in the internal man, 10042; by without blemish is 
denoted not contaminated with evil, 7837; by according to your estimation in silver by shekels
is denoted according to the quality of spiritual truths with him, 2959; by after the shekel of the 
sanctuary is denoted according to truth conjoined with good, 2959; and by "for a guilt 
offering" is denoted, in order that guilt may be removed, 3400.

16. This appears as follows:—to make restitution is to do the work of repentance, 9087, 9097, 

9130; that which he has done amiss in the holy thing denotes the error in internal worship, ver.
15; adding the fifth part denotes some remains of truth, 649; giving it to the priest denotes the 
appropriation by good, 10227, 9946; the priest making atonement denotes that good removes 
evil, 9946, 10042, and his being forgiven denotes the actual removal of evil, ver. 10.

49

17. This is evident, because to sin denotes to violate Divine law,. 5076; the things which the Lord 
has commanded not to be done denote evils that ought to be rejected, chap 4:2; being guilty 
denotes to be in evil, 3400; not knowing it clearly denotes to be ignorant of the fact, 6721, 
2230; and bearing his iniquity denotes, in this case, that evil will adhere to him, 9937.

18. Bringing a ram without blemish out of the flock, according to estimation for a guilt offering to 
the priest, denotes the worship of the Lord from spiritual good, or the good of innocence in the
internal man, according to his state and quality as to truths, and as being in evil, ver. 15; and 
the priest making atonement for him concerning the thing wherein he erred unwittingly, his not
knowing it, and his being forgiven, denote that by good, evil shall be remitted, according to 
the necessity, when sin takes place through ignorance as to the will and understanding, and 
that remission shall follow, 9946, 10042; ver. 10.

19. This appears thus: a guilt offering denotes worship on account of the removal of evil, 3406; 
and being certainly guilty before the Lord denotes that evil and error cannot escape the 
scrutiny of Divine Good by means of Divine Truth, 2001.

Discussion

It will have been noticed by the careful reader that the fourth chapter gives an orderly account, in the 
internal sense, of certain sins committed in ignorance, and remitted by worship from the good of 
innocence in the natural or external man, commencing with those who are celestial, proceeding to those
who are spiritual, and ending with those who are natural, the offerings in each case representing the 
appropriate good of innocence; and now, in this fifth chapter, the same subject is continued, referring 
respectively to the celestial, the spiritual and the natural as before, but involving sins by error in 
relation to the natural affections rather than in relation to doctrine. And this is evident, because in every
case in the fourth chapter the unconscious error is against those things which the Lord has, commanded
not to be done, vers. 2, 13, 22, 27; but in this chapter it is against the touching of anything unclean, and 
against swearing rashly, or from impulse, to do evil or to do good.

Secondly, the first verse of this chapter is so particularly placed and constructed as to need some 
explanation. It is, in fact, so placed and so constructed as to form the conclusion of all that is said in the
previous part of the general subject in the spiritual sense; and at the same time the commencement or 
introduction to the following part of the general subject. Also it does not imply sin through ignorance of
true doctrine on the one hand, or of the distinction between evil and good on the other. It describes, in 
short, a state of hesitation as to whether the truth acquired in the understanding is to be confirmed, or 
the evil and falsity opposed to it. The character here represented hears the voice of adjuration, of 
swearing, or spiritually, of confirming the truth, by the determination of the will and by action, and he 
also hears the voice of cursing, or spiritually of averting himself from the truth. Whence proceed these 
voices? They are the results of his communication with heaven or hell. We all hear these voices. And 
we must all decide whether we will embody the truth sincerely in our words and actions or not. There 
are, indeed, many sins which we commit unwittingly, and these will not really condemn us, because our
hearts may be right, although our intellects, in this probationary state, may, from various states and 
circumstances, fail to discern between truth and falsity. But when we have known and seen the truth, 
and thus, too, have become witnesses to it, that is, when we have received it with affection, yea, when 
the oil of love has been poured upon it, then let us beware lest we avert ourselves from it, and our last 
state is worse than our first.

50

For, thirdly, it is not only a case of truth or falsity that we have to settle, but one of good or evil, since 
we cannot confirm good in ourselves except by means of truth, nor evil except by means of falsity; and 
besides, if we confirm the truth inwardly from good, then we shall not bear our iniquity, or remain in 
evil, even although we unconsciously come into spiritual contact with things unclean. Hence we now 
see why this verse introduces the subject of accidental impurity and the means of purification from it.

We proceed, therefore, to study the order of verses two, three, four and five, which describe the series 
of offences resulting from the contamination of evil affections in the natural man. That there is such 
contamination with us all, no one can doubt who carefully considers and watches his own inner life. 
And first we reflect on the use, in the literal sense, of the word carcase to denote those evil affections. 
They are such as are deprived of all spiritual life. They are "without form and void," or "waste and 
void" (Gen 1:2), because there is in them no truth and no good, and yet, as they present themselves in 
the thoughts of the regenerating man, they really appear as a part of his life, which manifests itself by 
delight. The things which are actually dead because they are not of the Lord, to infernals, are most 
delightful; and it is because there is a tendency to similar infernal delights in ourselves, on account of 
our own actual evil, that evil spirits can flow into us and make us believe that things of which, long 
ago, we have truly repented are yet, with us, as active as ever they were. This is the touching of the 
unclean things of which we read in the inner sense of verses 2 and 3. No one can tell how or when dead
affections of this kind will present themselves. They indeed agitate us, even when regeneration must, or
may, have made some progress with us. And it will be well for us if, when they do, we can truly 
confess that of ourselves we are nothing but evil, as we are instructed to do in verse 5. In verse 2, 
however, as we have seen, the unclean affections, indicated by the correspondences employed, are of 
three degrees, and belong properly to the external man; but in verse 3 they belong to the internal, 
according to the distinction, spiritually, between a beast and a man. Also observe that the Hebrew word 
for man in verse 3 is adam, and not ish, because the former corresponds to good, or affection, and the 
latter to truth or intelligence, and affection is especially the subject of these verses. And taking now 
verse 4, and observing that it speaks of swearing rashly with the lips to do evil or to do good, we may 
see that it describes the impulsive determination of the will conjoined with the understanding to act 
according to an affection without sufficiently considering its real quality, or without being; aware that it
is really an evil affection. Thus the three verses, in the internal sense, describe the course of temptations
to confirm evils first from the incitements of merely natural loves, then from the more interior loves of 
the world and of self, and lastly from the strong and impulsive force of evil, which urges a man to 
action, while yet he is ignorant, from outward states and circumstances, as to whether his action is evil 
or good.

Having seen, up to this point, the series of evil affections that infest or tempt the man of the church, we 
are next to consider the means of purification, through worship, to be adopted respectively by celestial, 
spiritual, natural, or sensual men. And this account extends from verses 6 to 13 inclusive. For no one, 
surely, can fail to discern that the successive offerings of a lamb or a kid, of turtledoves and young 
pigeons, and lastly of fine flour, clearly denote different and successive states of worship in descending 
order. The worship of celestial and spiritual men is described together in ver. 6; of those constituting 
the internal of the natural, as to good or truth, in ver. 7; and of those constituting the external of the 
natural in ver. 11. But besides this, there are some particulars the consideration of which is very 
important. In every case there must be repentance, and as described in ver. 8, this must precede true 
worship. Evil must be shunned, and good must be done as a duty, before the former can be fully 
removed and the latter fully realized as delightful. During imperfect states of worship, also, the external
man is in a state of opposition to the internal; there is not correspondence with the Lord; and yet there 

51

must be the conjunction of truth with good both as to the spiritual and natural degree, as we see in ver. 
9. Let it be understood, however, that this conjunction is necessarily imperfect until real worship from 
love or good takes place, and that then it is according to the ordinance in that worship as indicated in 
ver. 10, and more fully described in the next chapter. We may all easily see that the degree of our 
conjunction by love with the Lord is exactly according to the degree in which evils are removed, for 
there is really nothing that prevents it but evils, and their consequent falsities and errors. And indeed 
this truth is well illustrated in ver. n, where it is said that no oil nor frankincense are to be put upon the 
offering of fine flour because it is a sin offering. This does not mean that our lower states of worship 
are uninfluenced by celestial and spiritual love, but only that we are not, as yet, fully in celestial or 
spiritual worship. We know truly that all worship which is genuine must be from some love, and that 
the highest, or inmost worship must be from celestial love; and therefore we act upon that as a law; but 
we do not actually come into that love simply because we know about it, or even because we, to the 
best of our ability at the time, act according to the law. We must wait; we must be patient; we must be 
persevering to the end; and then at last we shall realize that love after which we are aspiring. Let us not 
forget that this love is already in us from the Lord; that it is the essential part of us; and indeed that 
when we are fully regenerated we shall not rise above it since it is our genuine individuality, so that all 
the lower loves in us will be arranged under it in proper order.

I have often thought that our highest capacity is in us from the Lord when we are born; [See, however, 
1555.] but that it depends upon the proper exercise of our freedom and reason whether we ever realize 
it. We are certain, at any rate, that we do not begin life by doing so; and also that if, by chance as it 
were, during our earthly life we get, at times, some obscure perceptions of it, other conditions and 
circumstances throw a cloud over it, and we feel that we know only in part, and love only in part. 
Nevertheless, we may be sure from the spiritual teaching of verses 12 and 13 that final success awaits 
us, and that our external man as well as our internal will embody or appropriate the good or delight 
which distinguishes us from every other human being (Rev 2:17).

But ver. 14 shows that we are having a change of subject, and we pass therefore from the consideration 
of errors having relation to the external man to the study of those peculiar to the internal. This is the 
reason why we have the expression, "the holy things of the Lord," and also why, in every case of error 
as far as ver. 7 of chap. vi. inclusive, a ram, which denotes the good of innocence in the internal man, 
was the offering. For, as a matter of fact, the general subject of the internal sense closes again with this 
verse; and it is remarkable that, in the Hebrew, chap. v. ends with it. This leads us to notice that the 
division of the Old Testament into chapters and verses, both in the original and in the translations, was 
evidently made without reference to, or even without any knowledge of, the inner sense. It is true 
indeed that, in the case before us, the arrangement of the Hebrew agrees with the series of the internal 
sense; but this is not always the case, because the first three verses of Genesis. ii., really form the 
conclusion of Gen. i., and show how man passes out of the spiritual state into the celestial, thus 
completing his course of regeneration; and then the fourth verse of Gen. ii. begins a new subject, which
is the regeneration of the celestial order of men as distinguished from the regeneration of the spiritual 
order, 89.

But in proceeding, we notice now that the errors of the internal man are divided into three kinds, 
namely, those which have reference to the will, as described in vers. 15 and 16; those which are of the 
understanding, as appears from vers. 17-19; and those which relate to the conduct, as they are set forth 
in chap 6:1-7. And the only thing that calls for special mention because it does not occur in the 
accounts of the errors of the external man, is that the offering is said to be according to the estimation 
of Moses in silver by shekels after the shekel of the sanctuary. This means, as we have seen, that 

52

worship from the good of innocence in the internal man differs from similar worship in the external 
man in being more particularly according to the quality of truths to which good is conjoined. All 
worship, as we have already seen in studying the first chapter, must be by means of truths, and takes its 
quality from them, but this is not so manifest in external worship as it is in internal; for it is in 
proportion as worship becomes more internal that it is more particularly according to truths, at the same
time that the conjunction of truth with good becomes also more determined. And in addition to this, the 
quality and degree of innocence with the worshiper becomes intensified and purified. Hence then the 
internal sense of the Word confirms the general truth of the literal sense, and the testimony of 
experience, that external worship is more from the innocence of ignorance, and internal worship more 
from the innocence of wisdom.

And here lastly it is to be observed that the account concerning errors of the understanding is 
distinguished from that concerning errors of the will by the expression, "the things which the Lord has 
commanded not to be done," as distinguished from "the holy things of the Lord."

The Contents of each Verse

1. And the LORD spoke to Moses, 

saying, 

1. There is revelation from the Lord by Divine Truth 
to the man of the Spiritual Church giving the 
perception,

2.

If any one sin, and commit a trespass
against the LORD, and deal falsely 
with his neighbour in a matter of 
deposit, or of bargain, or of robbery, 
or have oppressed his neighbour; 

2. That whenever he infringes the laws of order by 
any offence against the truth of faith, falsifying it 
by separating it from charity either in the memory, 
or in the understanding, or in the will by ascribing 
it to himself, or by violating the good of charity;

3. Or have found that which was lost, 

and deal falsely therein, and swear to
a lie; in any of all these that a man 
does, sinning therein: 

4. Then it shall be, if he has sinned, and
is guilty, that he shall restore that 
which he took by robbery, or the 
thing which he has gotten by 
oppression, or the deposit which was
committed to him, or the lost thing 
which he found, 

3. Or having discovered or perceived true doctrine, 
which had been lost, falsifies it, and confirms 
himself in such falsification, especially if such 
errors are expressed in the discourse or in the 
actions;

4. Then, when he confesses that he has sinned 

internally and externally, he shall cease to ascribe 
to himself what is from the Lord, or to do violence
to the principle of good, to hold the truth in his 
memory without application to life, or to corrupt 
true doctrine restored to the church,

54

5. Or any thing about which he has 

5. Or to confirm himself in false doctrines. And 

sworn falsely; he shall even restore it
in full, and shall add the fifth part 
more thereto: to him to whom it 
belongs shall he give it, in the day of
his being found guilty. 

6. And he shall bring his guilt offering 
to the LORD, a ram without blemish 
out of the flock, according to your 
estimation, for a guilt offering, to the
priest: 

7. And the priest shall make atonement 
for him before the LORD, and he 
shall be forgiven; concerning 
whatever he does so as to be guilty 
thereby. 

therein he shall fully do the work of repentance, 
not only by shunning the evil, but by practising the
truth, in order that some remains may be 
implanted with him; yea, he shall humbly ascribe 
all the good and truth with him to the Lord, as 
soon as he fully realizes his evil state.

6. And herein he shall sincerely worship the Lord 
from the good of innocence in the internal man 
free from falsity; and according to the quality of 
his good as manifested in truths in the external 
man, on account of his offence against the truth of 
faith, by acknowledging that it is from the Lord.

7. And his state of good shall cause the removal of 
evil and reconciliation with the Lord, evil being 
remitted, whatever may be its nature and quality.

8. And the LORD spoke to Moses, 

8. Also there is revelation from the Lord by Divine 

saying, 

Truth giving the perception,

9. Command Aaron and his sons, 

saying, This is the law of the burnt 
offering: the burnt offering shall "be 
on the hearth upon the altar all night 
to the morning; and the fire of the 
altar shall be kept burning thereon. 

10. And the priest shall put on his linen 
garment, and his linen breeches shall
he put upon his flesh; and he shall 
take up the ashes whereto the fire has
consumed the burnt offering on the 
altar, and he shall put them beside 
the altar. 

9. Through influx to those who are in good, and in 
truths thence derived, concerning the worship of 
the Lord from pure love, that in every state of 
obscurity, this love shall be predominant, and also 
in every state of brightness, by the determination 
of man as from himself; for love must be constant,
and must never be extinguished.

10. And celestial good shall be manifested in the 

truths of faith; also the conjunction of truth with 
good shall be maintained externally as well as 
internally; and whatever in previous states of 
worship, has served its use, shall be thereby 
elevated, but yet is respectively subordinate.

11. And he shall put off his garments, 

11. But changes of state as to truths will always 

and put on other garments, and carry 
forth the ashes without the camp to a
clean place. 

accompany or follow changes of state as to good; 
and such knowledges as are no longer required for 
use are separated from the heavenly life, abiding 
in the external memory which is quiescent, where 
they are not contaminated with evil.

55

12. And the fire upon the altar shall be 
kept burning thereon, it shall not go 
out; and the priest shall burn wood 
on it every morning: and he shall lay 
the burnt offering in order upon it, 
and shall burn thereon the fat of the 
peace offerings. 

13. Fire shall be kept burning upon the 
altar continually; it shall not go out. 

14. And this is the law of the meal 

offering: the sons of Aaron shall 
offer it before the LORD, before the 
altar. 

12. But the inmost of worship, which is pure love, 

must be ever active, and must not be extinguished;
and this must be effected by him who is in good as
from himself in every new state; perfect 
arrangement as to affections and thoughts must be 
maintained; and especially must celestial good 
from a principle of freedom and peace be ascribed 
to the Lord.

13. For the Divine Love and Mercy are constant with 
man, when from the heart he worships the Lord; 
and, indeed, they never cease.

14. Also these are the laws of order as to the worship 
of the Lord from celestial love in the spiritual 
degree, or as to worship from charity: it proceeds 
from Divine Truths derived from Divine Good; 
and it is spiritual worship.

15. And he shall take up therefrom his 

15. Also it shall be in full power with the spiritual man

handful, of the fine flour of the meal 
offering, and of the oil thereof, and 
all the frankincense which is upon 
the meal offering, and shall burn it 
upon the altar for a sweet savour, as 
the memorial thereof, to the LORD. 

16. And that which is left thereof shall 
Aaron and his sons eat: it shall be 
eaten without leaven in a holy place; 
in the court of the tent of meeting 
they shall eat it. 

17. It shall not be baked with leaven. I 
have given it as their portion of my 
offerings made by fire; it is most 
holy, as the sin offering, and as the 
guilt offering. 

in pure truth derived from good; and in addition, 
has celestial and spiritual good and truth therein in
true worship; for all shall be acknowledged to be 
from the Lord in a state of holy peace and rest 
inscribed on the interior memory.

16. And thus and thence shall those who are in good, 
and those who are in truth thence derived, namely 
the celestial and spiritual, appropriate good from 
the Lord; good shall be appropriated in a state of 
separation from falsity; in a state of holiness; and 
in the natural degree of the mind, and hence fully 
in every degree.

17. And even in preparing for such a state of 

appropriation shall there be no admixture of 
falsity. It is a gift from the Lord to the celestial and
spiritual man, according to the Divine Love and 
Mercy; it is inmost good adapted to each degree of
the mind; and it is inmostly in previous states of 
deliverance from evil and error.

56

18. Every male among the children of 

18. And this celestial and spiritual good shall be 

Aaron shall eat of it, as a due for 
ever throughout your generations, 
from the offerings of the LORD made
by fire: whoever touches them shall 
be holy. 

appropriated by all who are in truths in the 
understanding from good in the will; it shall be as 
if it were their own in every change of state to 
eternity; and it is from the Divine Love, as 
received by man, and acknowledged by him; yea, 
all contact with such good, however slight, 
produces a state of holiness.

19. And the LORD spoke to Moses, 

19. Further, there is revelation from Divine Good by 

saying, 

Divine Truth giving the perception,

20. This is the oblation of Aaron and of 
his sons, which they shall offer to the
LORD in the day when he is 
anointed; the tenth part of an ephah 
of fine flour for a meal offering 
perpetually, half of it in the morning,
and half thereof in the evening. 

20. That those who are in celestial good and in the 

truth thence derived, shall then acknowledge the 
Lord in worship, when truth is intimately 
conjoined with good; there shall be with them 
fullness as to remains of Divine Truth from Divine
Good perpetually; and this shall be the case in all 
states both of brightness and of obscurity.

21. On a baking pan it shall be made 

21. And the preparation for such a state shall be by 

with oil; when it is soaked, you shall 
bring it in: in baked pieces shall you 
offer the meal offering for a sweet 
savour to the LORD. 

means of exterior truths operated upon by celestial
good; in the process an orderly arrangement of 
truths under good shall take place; and it shall be 
acknowledged to be from the Lord, bringing joy 
and peace in worship.

22. And the anointed priest that shall be 
in his stead from among his sons 
shall offer it: by a statute for ever it 
shall be wholly burnt to the LORD. 

22. And external good conjoined to truth shall 
minister to essential good in effecting full 
conjunction: and such external worship from 
internal shall be perpetual.

23. And every meal offering of the priest
shall be wholly burnt: it shall not be 
eaten. 

23. For indeed all inmost worship from good shall be 
fully ascribed to the Lord, because man cannot 
appropriate good from himself.

24. And the LORD spoke to Moses, 

24. Further, there is revelation from Divine Good by 

saying, 

Divine Truth, giving the perception,

25. Speak to Aaron and to his sons, 
saying, This is the law of the sin 
offering: in the place where the burnt
offering is killed shall the sin 
offering be killed before the LORD: it
is most holy. 

25. By influx to those who are in good and thence in 
truths, concerning worship during deliverance 
from evil; that inmostly such worship is identical 
with the worship of the Lord from pure love, and 
that the preparation for such worship is the same, 
being from the Divine Love. In short, it is the 
effect of inmost; worship.

57

26. The priest that offers it for sin shall 
eat it: in a holy place shall it be 
eaten, in the court of the tent of 
meeting. 

27. Whatsoever shall touch the flesh 

thereof shall be holy: and when there
is sprinkled of the blood thereof 
upon any garment, you shall wash 
that whereon it was sprinkled in a 
holy place. 

28. But the earthen vessel wherein it is 
sodden shall be broken: and if it be 
sodden in a brazen vessel, it shall be 
scoured, and rinsed in water. 

26. And he who is thus inmostly in good shall then 

appropriate good externally, it shall be a holy state 
of worship; and. it shall be appropriated in the 
natural man, which is derived from the spiritual 
and celestial man.

27. And thus external worship shall be holy from what
is internal; and when the holy state of charity is 
conjoined with truth in such worship, purification 
from sin shall take place in that holy state.

28. But the merely natural affection which was 

instrumental in such worship shall be separated; 
and if such natural affection was good from the 
Lord, it shall be purified from; all falsity and from:
all evil.

29. Every male among the priests shall 

29. And indeed every truth from good shall thus 

eat thereof: it is most holy. 

30. And no sin offering, whereof any of 
the blood is brought into the tent of 
meeting to make atonement in the 
holy place, shall be eaten: it shall be 
burnt with fire. 

appropriate its own good. It is external worship 
conjoined with internal.

30. And the worship of the Lord in order to interior 

purification, which is from the essential principle 
of charity proceeding from the Lord through the 
heavens, and which purifies from sin, thereby 
reconciling the external man with the internal, 
must not be appropriated by man as his own. It is 
to be acknowledged as being wholly from the 
Lord, and is to be wholly devoted to Him.

References and Notes

1. This is evident, because by Jehovah is denoted the Divine Being as to His love, 2001; by 

speaking is denoted influx, 2951; by Moses is represented Divine Truth, or the Word, 7010, 
6752; and by saying is denoted perception, 1791, 1822, chap 4:1.

2. The proofs are that to sin is to infringe the laws of Divine Order, 5076; to commit a trespass 
denotes an offence against the truth of faith, 9156; to deal falsely with the neighbour denotes 
to falsify the truth by separating it from charity, because a neighbour denotes one who is in 
good, or in charity, 6711, 6712; and therefore to deal falsely with him is to separate truth from 
charity, 8087; a deposit denotes "what is laid up for every use," and thus what is in the 
memory, 5299; what is put into the hand, or, in other words, a second deposit (Heb. Lex.), 
fellowship (A.V.), bargain, or pledge (R.V.), denotes what is in the understanding, 10062; 
robbery, or what is taken away by violence, denotes an act of the will by man when, from 
selfish love, he ascribes the truth to himself, 8906; and oppressing the neighbour denotes to 
violate the good of charity, 6711, 6712.

58

3. To find that which was lost denotes to discover true doctrine, 9150; to deal falsely therein 

evidently denotes to falsify true doctrine, 8087; to swear to a lie denotes to confirm what is 
false, 2842; and sinning on account of any of these things denotes expressing evil and falsity 
in discourse or in actions, 5076, 9156.

4. This is true, since the words "if he has sinned and is guilty" imply confession internally and 

externally, 5076, 3400; restoring that which was taken by robbery denotes ceasing to ascribe to
self what is from the Lord, 8906; restoring the thing gotten by oppression denotes no longer 
doing violence to the principle of good or to charity, 6711, 6712; to restore the deposit which 
was committed to him denotes no longer to hold the truth in his memory without application to
life, 5299; and restoring the lost thing which is found denotes no longer to corrupt true 
doctrine restored to the church, 9150.

5. Moreover, restoring anything about which there has been false swearing denotes ceasing to be 
confirmed in false doctrine, 8087, 2842; to restore fully is to do the work of repentance not 
only by shunning evil, but by practising the truth, 9087, 9097, 9130; adding the fifth part 
denotes the implantation of remains, 649, 5291; restoring it to him to whom it appertains 
denotes the ascribing of good and truth to the Lord, 8906; and the day of being found guilty 
denotes the state in which evil in oneself is realized as evil, 487, 3400, 9133.

6. This is seen from the signification of a guilt offering of a ram, as denoting the worship of the 
Lord from the good of innocence in the internal man, 3400, 2001, 10042; of without blemish, 
as denoting free from evil, 7837; of out of the flock, as denoting what is spiritual, 5913, 6126; 
of according to estimation, as denoting according to the quality of good as manifested in truths
in the external man, 2959; and of a guilt offering to the priest, as denoting on account of his 
offence against the truth of faith, 9156, while by bringing the offering to the priest is denoted 
the acknowledgement that the truth of faith is from the Lord, 3670.

7. By the priest making atonement for him is denoted that good from the Lord shall cause the 
removal of evil, and reconciliation with the Lord, 9946, 10042; by his being forgiven is 
denoted remission, 8393, 9506; and by whatever he does so as to be guilty thereby is denoted 
whatever may be the nature and quality of evil, 3400.

As this verse closes the subject of sins committed in error, in the internal sense, it may be as 
well to review the last few verses. Observe that the first verse again indicates a new subject, 
although it is clear that the general subject is continued and here concluded, for a ram is again 
the appointed offering. Why is this? The reason is that there are three subdivisions of the 
general subject, the first describing what has relation to the will of the internal man, the 
second, what has relation to the understanding, and the third, what has relation to the conduct. 
And in verses 2 and 3 there is a series of six different errors for consideration, according to 
man's reception and embodiment, in the actions, of truths received into the memory, into the 
understanding, into the will externally, into the will internally, by profaning externally and by 
profaning internally, the last, of course, being the confirmation of evil and falsity, 
notwithstanding successive warnings against them. Now it is well known in the church that, in
the order of regeneration, as far as the outward appearance goes, man advances successively 
from a state of instruction through states of intelligence and obedience to a state of love or 
good, and consequently it is evident that numerous errors are liable to arise in his progress, 
these receiving their quality from his prevailing state as he proceeds, and hence we see the 
reason of the order in which the terms occur in the first place. But when these terms are 

59

repeated in verses 4 and 5, which describe the work of repentance, we notice that the order is 
changed, the cause of which is, that the arrangement of truths with every one is according to 
his prevailing state as to the reception of good from the Lord. When man, therefore, comes 
into a state of repentance, interior things begin to take the first place, and exterior things are 
regarded as of secondary importance; and thus we find that things taken by robbery and by 
oppression are first named, while the things relating, spiritually, to the memory are next 
mentioned. And this involves important teaching. True repentance is a change of motives, 
rather than of opinions, or of actions merely. But still it is certain that the deepest evils may 
lurk within, and so the tendency to confirm evil states is last spoken of. The state of 
repentance, therefore, is only a transition state; but it will have to be carried out in all 
completeness in order to realize good.

This brings us to another matter which is worthy of serious consideration. It is the 
implantation of remains, represented by adding the fifth part. There is a difference between the
storing up of remains and their implantation. By remains are meant good affections and true 
thoughts from the Lord; and these are said to be stored up with man, when he is not conscious 
of them, and yet they are preserved by the Lord in his internal man ready for manifestation and
use when the right time comes. And when it does come, then they are implanted and take root, 
as it were, in his External, where they bud and blossom and bring forth fruit. This is the 
implantation of remains, and by it is accomplished the regeneration of man, his conjunction 
with the Lord, and the conjunction of the external with the internal man. And, of course, this 
work proceeds just in proportion as evils and errors are repented of, and are forgiven or 
remitted, the result being that all good and truth are perceived inwardly and acknowledged 
outwardly to be from the Lord. Thus we see the rational and practical value of the spiritual 
teaching in ver. 5, and how it is connected with the verses which precede and which follow. It 
is unnecessary, however, to explain more at length the contents of verses 6 and 7, as all the 
points therein have been before considered. But an interesting reference in regard to the 
implantation of remains is 6156, which deserves careful study; and others are 1616, 589711, 
1737, 2284.

8. This is evident, because by Jehovah is denoted the Divine Being as to His love, 2001; by 

speaking is denoted influx, 2951; by Moses is represented Divine Truth, or the Word, 7010, 
6752; and by saying is denoted perception, 1791, 1822, chap 4:1.

9. Commanding Aaron and his sons, and saying, denote influx with those who are in good and in 
truths thence derived, 5486, 9946; saying denotes perception, 1791, 1822; the law of the burnt 
offering denotes concerning the worship of the Lord from pure love, 8680; its being on the 
hearth, or on the firewood, denotes that love shall be predominant, because the burning of the 
fire signifies the activity of love, 9723, 68323; all night denotes in every state of obscurity, 
6000; the morning denotes a state of brightness, 9787; and the fire being kept burning on the 
wood denotes the determination of man as from himself that love shall be constant, and shall 
never be extinguished, 2784.

10. By the priest putting on his linen garment is denoted that celestial good shall be manifested in 

the truths of faith, 9946, 9814; by the linen breeches being put upon his flesh is denoted that 
the conjunction of truth with good shall be maintained externally as well as internally, 9959, 
160, 161; by his taking up the ashes is denoted that whatever, in previous states, has served its 

60

use is thereby elevated, 9723; and by putting them beside the altar is denoted that it is 
respectively subordinate, 9736, 10185.

11. Putting off his garments and putting on other garments denotes that changes of state as to 

truths will always accompany changes of state as to good, for garments signify truths, 9814, 
and the priest signifies good, 9946, while putting off and putting on evidently signify changes 
of state, 3405; and carrying forth the ashes without the camp to a clean place denotes that such
knowledges as are no longer required for use are separated from the heavenly life abiding in 
the external memory, which is quiescent where they are not contaminated with evil, since by 
without the camp is signified separation from the heavenly life, 4236; by a clean place is 
denoted that the act of separation is pure, 4545, 2625; and by it also the external memory, 
which is quiescent, 9723.

12. This appears from the signification of fire, as denoting the inmost of worship which is pure 
love, 9723; of burning, as denoting the activity of such worship, 9723, 68323; of the fire not 
going out, as clearly denoting that love must not be extinguished; of the priest burning wood 
on the altar every morning, as denoting that this must be effected by him who is in good, as 
from himself in every new state, 9946, 2784, 7844; of laying the burnt offering in order, as 
denoting perfect arrangement as to affections and thoughts, 5288; and of burning on the wood 
the fat of the peace offering, as denoting that especially must celestial good from a principle of
freedom be ascribed to the Lord, because the fat denotes celestial good, 10033, 353; peace 
offerings denote worship from freedom, 10097; and burning on the altar as an offering or 
oblation denotes to ascribe to the Lord, 2776.

13. Here fire denotes the Divine Love and Mercy, 1528; its being kept burning continually denotes
that these are constant with man, 10133; and its not going out denotes that they never cease, as
is evident. And it is evident also that the repetition of this statement which was made in the 
last verse is not merely for the sake of emphasis, as appears from the literal sense, but for the 
sake of conveying, according to the series of the internal sense, the truth that the Divine Love 
and Mercy are unchangeable.

14. This is true, because by the law is denoted the truths which relate to love to the Lord, signified
by the burnt offering, and love to the neighbour, signified by the meal offering, 1121, 2177; by
the meal offering in this series, therefore, is denoted celestial love in the spiritual degree, or 
worship from charity, chap 2:1-2; by the sons of Aaron offering it is denoted that spiritual 
worship proceeds from Divine Truths derived from Divine Good, 9946; and by "before the 
Lord before the altar" is denoted spiritual worship conjoined with celestial, and derived from 
the Lord, because "before the Lord" denotes that such worship is from the Lord, 16024, and 
the altar denotes the Lord and the worship of the Lord, 9714.

15. This is seen from considering that taking the handful denotes the exercise of full power, 7518; 
that fine flour denotes pure truth derived from good, 9995; that oil and frankincense denote 
celestial and spiritual good and truth, 2177, 10177; that "upon the meal offering" denotes in 
true worship, ver. 14; that burning the handful upon the altar denotes consecration to the Lord, 
10052, and the acknowledgement that all good and all truth are from Him, 10055; that a sweet 
savour, or an odour of rest, denotes a state of holy peace and rest, 10054; and that a memorial 
denotes what is inscribed on the interior memory, 6888.

61

16. That which was left of the meal offering being for Aaron and his sons to eat denotes the 

appropriation of good from the Lord by the celestial and spiritual, 9946, 2177, 2187; it being 
without leaven denotes separation from a state of falsity, 2177, 2342; it being eaten in a holy 
place denotes appropriation in a state of holiness, that is, a state of love and faith, 3652; and in 
the court of the tent of meeting denotes in the natural degree of the mind, and hence fully in 
every degree, because by the court is denoted the ultimate heaven, and thus the natural degree,
9741, 9825; and in the ultimate degree "all interior things are held together in their order, and 
in their form and connection," and thus there is fullness in every degree, 9824.

17. Not being baked with leaven denotes that even in preparing for such a state of appropriation 
there shall be no admixture of falsity, 8496, 7906; it being given as the portion of Aaron and 
his sons of the offerings made by fire denotes that the good represented by the meal offering is
a gift from the Lord to the celestial and spiritual man, 4397, 9946, 10055; and it being most 
holy denotes that it is inmost good adapted to each degree of the mind, 10129, 10042, 9156.

18. This is demonstrated thus: the meal offering denotes celestial and spiritual good, 4581, 2177; 
the male among the children of Aaron denotes truth from good, 725, 9946; eating denotes 
appropriation, 2187; a law, or statute, for ever throughout your generations denotes the 
reception of good as if it were man's own, in every change of state to eternity, because this is 
according to heavenly order, 7884, 7931, 9845, 1712; from the offerings of the Lord made by 
fire denotes from the Divine Love as received by man, 10055; and every one touching them 
being holy denotes that all contact with such good, however slight, produces a state of 
holiness, 10023.

19. This is evident, because by Jehovah is denoted the Divine Being as to His love, 2001; by 

speaking is denoted influx, 2951; by Moses is represented Divine Truth, or the Word, 7010, 
6752; and by saying is denoted perception, 1791, 1822, chap 4:1.

20. Aaron and his sons denote those who are in good and in truth thence derived, 9946; to bring an
oblation is to acknowledge the Lord in worship, 349, 922; the day when he is anointed denotes
the state when truth is intimately conjoined with good, 99547; the tenth part of an ephah of 
fine flour for a meal offering perpetually denotes fullness as to remains of Divine truth from 
Divine good perpetually, 576, 10136, 10133; and half being offered in the morning and the 
other half in the evening denotes in all states both of brightness and obscurity, 10255, 6000, 
9787.

21. The meal offering being baked in the baking pan and mixed with oil denotes that preparation 
for such a state shall be by means of exterior truth operated upon by celestial good, 8496, 
7356, 2177; it being brought in when soaked or saturated denotes in the process, or when 
truths are conjoined with good, the fine flour denoting truths and the oil good, 9993; it being 
in baked pieces denotes an orderly arrangement of truths under good, 10048, 3110; and a 
sweet savour to the Lord denotes the acknowledgement of the Lord which brings joy and 
peace, 10054.

22. This appears thus: the anointed priest that shall be instead of Aaron signifies external good 

conjoined to truth and ministering to essential good, 99547, 10017; the meal offering denotes 
what effects conjunction, ver. 20; and its being wholly burnt to the Lord by a statute for ever 
denotes that such external worship from internal shall be perpetual, ver. 18.

62

23. Every meal offering of the priest being wholly burnt denotes that all inmost worship from 

good shall be fully ascribed to the Lord, 9946, 10055; and its not being eaten denotes that man
cannot appropriate good from himself, 2187.

24. This is evident, because by Jehovah is denoted the Divine Being as to His love, 2001; by 

speaking is denoted influx, 2951; by Moses is represented Divine Truth, or the Word, 7010, 
6752; and by saying is denoted perception, 1791, 1822.

25. Speaking to Aaron and to his sons and saying denotes influx to those who are in good and to 
those in truths giving perception, 9946, 2951, 1791, 1822; the law of the sin offering denotes 
concerning worship during deliverance from evil, 3400; the sin offering being killed in the 
place where the burnt offering is killed denotes that such worship is identical with the worship 
of the Lord from pure love, and that the preparation for such worship is the same, 3400, 
10053, 2625, 10024; before the Lord denotes from Divine Love, 2001; and most holy denotes 
that it is the effect of inmost worship, 10129.

26. The priest that offers it for sin eating it denotes that he who is thus inmostly in good shall then 
appropriate good externally, 9946, 2187; the sin offering being eaten in a holy place denotes a 
holy state of worship, 2625; and in the court of the tent of meeting denotes appropriation in the
natural man, 9741, 9825.

27. Whatsoever touches the flesh thereof being holy denotes that external worship shall be holy 
from what is internal, as it appears from the signification of touching as denoting contact 
spiritually, 4404, 10199; of the flesh of the sin offering, as denoting external worship, 8682, 
10040; and of being holy, as denoting holiness in consequence of connection with internal 
worship, vers. 25, 26; the blood of the sin offering being sprinkled upon a garment denotes the
holy state of charity conjoined with truth in such worship, because blood in this case signifies 
charity, 1001, and a garment denotes truth, 1073, while sprinkling denotes conjunction, 10047;
and washing that whereon the blood was sprinkled denotes purification, 3147; a holy place 
denoting a holy state, 2625.

28. This is evident, because an earthen vessel denotes a merely natural affection, 10105, in this 

case an affection of truth which is instrumental, 5948; being broken denotes to be separated or 
removed, 9163; sodden in a brazen vessel denotes preparation by means of truths derived from
good, 10105; and being scoured and rinsed in water denotes purification from all falsity and 
all evil, 10105.

29. Every male among the priests eating thereof denotes that every truth from good shall thus 

appropriate its own good, 725, 9946, 2187; and it being most holy denotes that it is external 
worship conjoined with internal, since the sin offering denotes worship involving purification 
from sin, 3400, and most holy denotes what is internal or inmost, 10129.

30. This is true, because the sin offering of which the blood is brought into the tent of meeting 

denotes sincere worship involving interior purification, 3400; the blood denotes charity, 1001; 
brought into the tent of meeting denotes acknowledgement that it is from the Lord through the 
heavens, 2356, 35403; to make atonement in the holy place denotes the reconciliation of the 
external man with the internal in that holy state, 10042, 2625; not being eaten denotes not to 
be appropriated by man as his own, 2187; and being burnt with fire denotes full devotion to 
the Lord, 10052.

63

Discussion

Continuing now our comments on this chapter from where we left off. we have to reflect carefully on 
the various particulars of the Divine Law concerning the burnt offerings and sacrifices by which are 
Represented the worship of the Lord in various states and under various circumstances. And first, with 
regard to worship from celestial love which is of the highest degree, namely, the purest love of the 
Lord, or of goodness and truth from Him for their own sakes. What are the laws? We read in the 
description given that above all things there can be no such worship apart from the Divine influx of life
into man on the one. hand, and man's co-operation on the other. The burnt offering was commanded to 
be on the hearth or on the firewood all night until the morning. Throughout the whole process of 
regeneration the Divine Love never ceases to flow in with man, producing in him the disposition to 
worship; and this must be manifested in the peculiar individuality of the worshiper. Every one must 
worship the Lord as from himself. There can be no true worship which is not voluntary and deliberate 
on the part of man. The burnt offering must be upon the firewood. Notice particularly that heat, in the 
natural world, is always to be obtained from the sun by its proper medium, the atmosphere; and so, 
spiritually, the Divine Love is always present with man by the medium of its recipient, namely, that 
Divine Truth which is called the Holy Spirit and the Comforter. "Lo, I am with you always, even to the 
consummation of the age" (Matt 28:20). "All night to the morning." The Divine Love never sleeps. But 
also you do not get the heat consciously apparent unless you have the wood, or some ultimate 
substance and form equivalent. This is the law of creation, and spiritually it is the law of regeneration 
as well. Now the will and the understanding of the man, just as he exercises them as his own from the 
Lord, are, taken together, that ultimate; and the heavenly marriage which constitutes regeneration—the 
conjunction of the Church with the Lord—must be effected in the proprium, or in man's own 
realization of life, as it were, properly belonging to him, 155, 253. And this may be called, indeed, the 
grand law of human life, because it lies at the foundation thereof, just as the Lord Himself is at the 
summit.

Another law in relation to this supreme love of the Lord, which is called celestial par excellence, is that
it is displayed in truths which are like beautiful garments that at once adorn it and present it in 
accommodated forms according to the state. They are truths derived from good, expressive of good, 
and conjoined with good. That they are derived from good is meant by the garments being the garments
of the priest; that they are expressive of good is denoted by their being changed according to the state, 
and also by their being different for different parts of the body; and that they are conjoined with good is
signified by their being upon the flesh, for flesh, as we have seen, denotes good.

A third law in relation to celestial worship is expressed in the action of the removal of the ashes. It is 
that man cannot advance to the realization of his highest good unless the states leading to it are first 
regarded as subordinate, and afterwards set aside as things done with, and yet abiding in the memory as
precious relics, so to speak. Who that has made some advance in the regenerate life cannot look back 
and call to mind those holy states of his early religious life when certain forms of thought and feeling 
which, although they were in reality but as dust and ashes compared with the genuine experiences of 
the present, yet, at the time, were of great importance on account of their use in fostering the life of 
good? And surety none of these are absolutely lost. True, they are "out of the camp," they cannot form a
part of heavenly order, but nevertheless they are "in a clean place," that is, they cannot be reckoned as a
part of things evil and false. Sweet is the memory of those early states, although, as a rule, it is 
quiescent in our state of perfection.

64

Further, a fourth law of celestial worship is that it must be constantly maintained from the inmost; that 
this also must be done by man as from himself; that it produces an orderly arrangement of the lower 
affections; that it causes the inmost love to be manifested in a state of peace and rest; and that this can 
be accomplished by man because the love and mercy of the Lord never fail, nor can they be 
extinguished. And this, let us add, is applicable to the wicked as well as the good, since it is of the 
Lord's continual loving kindness and mercy that they never lose their life, and that all their experiences 
tend to the amelioration of their condition, and their more and more orderly arrangement among those 
with whom they must be, on their own plane of existence, eternally associated.

And thus we see that the laws of celestial worship proceed immediately from the Divine Love; that 
their operation fills the heavens with joy and peace, and affects eternally for the very best the state and 
condition of every human being according to his acquired character.

The laws of celestial worship having special reference to love to the Lord, it now follows that the laws 
of spiritual worship have particular relation to charity or love to the neighbour, which is celestial love 
in an image. Or, what is the same thing, celestial love has reference to Divine Good, while spiritual 
worship has relation to Divine Truth; for the good of charity is acquired by truth as a medium. Hence 
we observe that it was the duty of the sons of Aaron to offer the meal offering; but that, since both love 
to the Lord and love to the neighbour are involved, therefore this is indicated by its being said "before 
the Lord" and "before the altar" This shows us that there can be no genuine love to the neighbour 
without the reception of truths from the Word on the one hand, and the acknowledgement of the Lord 
on the other. Then we see, in the fifteenth verse, how spiritual worship is connected with celestial 
worship. It is by both together being embodied with power in the act of worship. Thus, to do good to 
the neighbour from a principle of truth which has charity as a motive is really to love the Lord (Matt 
25:40). This is to take the handful of fine flour with the oil thereof and all the frankincense thereof and 
burn it upon the altar. Herein is the conjunction all together of a good act; of truth from good; of love to
the Lord; of the grateful hearing and perception, interiorly, of Divine Truth; and of the powerful 
influence of Divine Love. But the spiritual man, in his simple acts of obedience to law, does not see and
feel all these things that are involved therein, and hence he does not realize the full force of what he 
does. But the next three verses show this. The law is that by doing good he appropriates good. It 
becomes a part of his life. And, indeed, he has no true spiritual life without this appropriation of good 
and truth from the Lord as if they were his own (John 6:53). Notice here the connection between the 
words appropriation and proprium, and then will be seen the reason of the particular directions which 
follow. The meal offering was to be eaten without leaven, in a holy place, in the court of the tent of 
meeting. In order to appropriate good there must be the rejection of falsity and evil, holiness derived 
from a love of the truth, and the life of religion in the natural degree. Nay, more, even in preparing for 
such appropriation must falsity and evil be put away, for good and truth, which nourish the soul, are the
gift of the Lord; and on that account, where good operates and man co-operates, even in the work of 
repentance for evils committed and for inadvertent errors, there is a state of holiness. And thus this state
of holiness appertains to all who are in truth from good of whatever degree in the course of 
regeneration, and is the means of conjoining the external man, represented in the expression a due, or a 
statute, with the Internal man among the spiritual, denoted by the sons of Aaron. And all this is the 
effect of the Divine Love, when the Lord is acknowledged in the true worship of a good life; for no one
can be affected with the least consciousness of good and truth, as being distinct from the selfishness of 
man because they are from the Lord, without at the same time having a consciousness of their holiness.

But now we have another subdivision in the general subject, as appears from verse 19. There is a 
special meal offering for Aaron and his sons, that is, for all who are inwardly in good in the course of 

65

regeneration, when they are anointed, or spiritually, when good is finally conjoined with truth in the 
realization of the heavenly life. And this most appropriately concludes the account, in the internal 
sense, of the laws concerning spiritual life or worship, represented here by the meal offering. And we 
note, in this case, that remains are full, that is, remains of truth from the state of good, and continual in 
all states whether bright or obscure. Observe, however, in the next place, that this perfect celestial state 
is attained by a proper course of preparation, which is denoted by the baking and by the manner of the 
baking. In fact, it is the spiritual experiences of man which prepare him for the celestial by a secret 
orderly arrangement of his truths under good, which is the work of the Lord, as he proceeds. In 
regeneration, we may think that we do much because we act in freedom; but in reality the Lord Himself
is the principal, and, indeed, in a certain and true sense, the only worker (Isaiah 44:24). Hence 
therefore, the account of the meal offering of the priest concludes with the statement of three important 
laws concerning it. Only an anointed priest could offer it; it was to be wholly burnt to the Lord; and 
every meal offering of the priest was to be wholly burnt, and none of it could be eaten, denoting, 
respectively, that external good shall minister to internal in promoting conjunction; that worship in this 
state ascribes good wholly to the Lord; and that this is true even in the lowest degree of worship, or in 
the ultimate heaven, since no angel, or no person with whom the conjunction of good with truth is 
complete, presumes to appropriate good as his own, but only as if it were his own.

Finally, the chapter concludes by stating the laws in relation to the sin offering, that is, spiritually, of 
worship for the removal of actual evils during the state of repentance. First, this worship proceeds from
inmost good, although such good is not as yet realized; it is, therefore, identical with inmost worship, 
and so it is called "most holy"; secondly, good is appropriated in that state of worship, the state of 
appropriation is holy, and it is in the natural degree; thirdly, all the natural affections denoted by the 
touch and the thought thereto belonging signified by the garment, are thereby rendered holy, and are 
purified; fourthly, all merely natural affection which has been instrumental shall be separated, while 
good from the Lord shall be purified; and lastly, every truth shall appropriate its own good, while all 
the good of charity shall be ascribed to the Lord, and not to the proprium, thus effecting full 
reconciliation, as to the whole man, with the Lord, and full devotion to Him from pure love.

Herein, then, we now clearly see how completely the particulars of the process of regeneration are 
described in the Word, in different ways, by the various sacrifices of the Israelitish and Jewish 
Dispensation.

6. A general summary of the laws of Divine Order concerning worship, vers. 37-38. 

The Contents of each Verse

1. And this is the law of the guilt 
offering: it is most holy. 

1. And the laws of Divine Order with reference to the
worship of the Lord from the truth of faith, and at 
the same time with reference to deliverance from 
exterior evils, are as follow: such worship, and 
such deliverance, are derived from the inmost state
as to good.

2.

In the place where they kill the burnt
offering shall they kill the guilt 
offering: and the blood thereof shall 
he sprinkle upon the altar round 
about. 

2. And therefore preparation for such worship and 
deliverance is similar to, and is grounded in, the 
worship of the Lord from pure love; and by this 
worship and deliverance, the conjunction of truth 
with good is effected in every mode and degree.

3. And he shall offer of it all the fat 

thereof; the fat tail, and the fat that 
covers the inwards, 

3. Also all the good thereof is to be wholly ascribed 
to the Lord, even all exterior and external natural 
good.

4. And the two kidneys, and the fat that
is on them, which is by the loins, and
the long lobe upon the liver, with the
kidneys, shall he take away: 

5. And the priest shall burn them upon 
the altar for an offering made by fire 
to the LORD: it is a guilt offering. 

4. Also the discrimination or purification of truth, 
and the good thereof conducing to the heavenly 
marriage, with interior natural good promoting the 
discrimination of truth, are to be separated from 
selfish good.

5. And all these are to be ascribed to the Lord, and 

are to be devoted to Him in worship from pure 
love. And this is the worship by which there is 
deliverance from exterior evil.

67

6. Every male among the priests shall 
eat thereof: it shall be eaten in a holy
place: it is most holy. 

7. As is the sin offering, so is the guilt 
offering: there is one law for them: 
the priest that makes atonement 
therewith, he shall have it. 

6. And all those who are in the truth of faith derived 
from the good of charity shall appropriate good in 
this worship; it shall be appropriated in a holy 
state; and it is the outward expression of inmost 
good.

7. And this worship is one with the worship of the 

Lord from the good of faith, and thence man's 
deliverance from interior evil; there is the same 
law for deliverance from evil in general; and those 
who are in good by which there is deliverance 
from evil and reconciliation with the Lord, shall 
appropriate the good of this worship.

8. And the priest that offers any man's 
burnt offering, even the priest shall 
have to himself the skin of the burnt 
offering which he has offered. 

8. Besides which, the good from which any one 

devotes himself wholly to the Lord shall be 
appropriated by the worshiper, only as to the 
external thereof, or only as if it were from himself.

9. And every meal offering that is 
baked in the oven, and all that is 
dressed in the frying pan, and or the 
baking pan, shall be the priest's that 
offers it. 

10. And every meal offering, mingled 

with oil, or dry, shall all the sons of 
Aaron have, one as well as another. 

9. And this appropriation shall include every 

intermediate state of worship in its three degrees in
the natural man, where preparation is made by 
conjoining truth with good.

10. And every sincere act of worship, whether it be 
consciously from affection, or from the truth of 
faith apparently without affection, really 
appertains to man only externally, or as if from 
himself.

11. And this is the law of the sacrifice of
peace offerings, which one shall 
offer to the LORD. 

11. Also these are the laws of Divine Order in relation 
to the worship of the Lord from freedom in every 
individual case:

12. If he offer it for a thanksgiving, then 
shall he offer with the sacrifice of 
thanksgiving unleavened cakes 
mingled with oil, and unleavened 
wafers anointed with oil, and cakes 
mingled with oil, of fine flour 
soaked. 

12. If such worship is a token of thanksgiving, then it 
shall be from truth conjoined with celestial good 
uncontaminated with falsity, and in its three 
degrees, such truth being derived from good, and 
leading thereto.

13. With cakes of leavened bread he 
shall offer his oblation with the 
sacrifice of his peace offerings for 
thanksgiving. 

13. And he who worships the Lord freely from 

gratitude, grounded in celestial love, also humbly 
acknowledges that of himself he is only evil, and 
has been purified by the Lord; through temptation.

68

14. And of it he shall offer one out of 

14. And therefore this heavenly state is confessed to 

each oblation for an heave offering 
to the LORD; it shall be the priest's 
that sprinkles the blood of the peace 
offerings. 

15. And the flesh of the sacrifice of his 
peace offerings for thanksgiving 
shall be eaten on the day of his 
oblation; he shall not leave any of it 
until the morning. 

16. But if the sacrifice of his oblation be 
a vow, or a freewill offering, it shall 
be eaten on the day that he offers his 
sacrifice: and on the morrow that 
which remains of it shall be eaten: 

17. But that which remains of the flesh 

of the sacrifice on the third day shall 
be burnt with fire. 

18. And if any of the flesh of the 

sacrifice of his peace offerings be 
eaten on the third day, it shall not be 
accepted, neither shall it be imputed 
to him that offers it: it shall be an 
abomination, and the soul that eats 
of it shall bear his iniquity. 

be received from the Lord, the result being that 
pure heavenly good is appropriated by him, who 
conjoins truth with good in such worship.

15. Also this particular good of worship from gratitude
is appropriated only under the state of celestial 
love, and such good is not appropriated if 
contaminated with selfish love on the one hand, or 
separated from the new state of regeneration on the
other.

16. But in free worship proceeding from spiritual love 

or charity, under a desire that the Lord may 
provide, or from natural love, good shall be 
appropriated in each case, not only under that 
particular state, but, through remains, perpetually 
afterwards.

17. Nevertheless, in the process of judgement, when 
the state of good is completed, all merely selfish 
good shall be dissipated, through victory in the last
temptations.

18. But if, in this process, selfish good is appropriated,
it does not give conjunction with the Lord, nor can
it be imputed as heavenly good; for it is utterly 
opposed to such good; and he who is in it must 
remain in his evil state conjoining it with falsity.

19. And the flesh that touches any 

unclean thing shall not be eaten; it 
shall be burnt with fire. And as for 
the flesh, every one that is clean 
shall eat thereof: 

19. Neither is it lawful to appropriate any good that is 
contaminated with evil: it must be purified by 
temptations, or be overcome by heavenly love; but
good may be appropriated by every one who is 
purified from evil.

20. But the soul that eats of the flesh of 
the sacrifice of peace offerings, that 
pertain to the LORD, having his 
uncleanness upon him, that soul 
shall be cut off from his people. 

20. And he who appropriates good in the worship of 

the Lord from freedom externally, when yet he has
not done the work of repentance by purifying 
himself internally, is thereby separated entirely 
from truth and good.

69

21. And when any one shall touch any 

unclean thing, the uncleanness of 
man, or an unclean beast, or any 
unclean abomination, and eat of the 
flesh of the sacrifice of peace 
offerings, which pertain to the LORD,
that soul shall be cut off from his 
people. 

21. Also he who allows himself, by contact with evil 
to be contaminated, either internally, interiorly, or 
externally, and yet presumes to appropriate good 
from the Lord by external worship only, is thereby 
separated from good and truth.

22. And the LORD spoke to Moses, 

22. Further, there is revelation from the Lord by 

saying, 

Divine Truth giving perception,

23. Speak to the children of Israel, 

saying, You shall eat no fat, of ox, or
sheep, or goat. 

24. And the fat of that which dies of 
itself, and the fat of that which is 
torn of beasts, may be used for any 
other service: but you shall in no 
wise eat of it. 

25. For whoever eats the fat of the beast,
of which men offer an offering made
by fire to the LORD, even the soul 
that eats it shall be cut off from his 
people. 

26. And you shall eat no manner of 
blood, whether it be of bird or of 
beast, in any of your dwellings. 

23. And instruction to the man of the Spiritual Church,
who thence perceives that it is impossible for him 
to appropriate celestial good either in the natural or
spiritual state, or in the state of truth leading to 
good, from himself.

24. Also affections in which there is no spiritual life, 
or those which are injured by lusts, may be made 
useful as means, but they cannot be appropriated 
by the spiritual man.

25. And if any one presumes to claim as his own 

absolutely the good which may be appropriated 
from the Lord in worship, he is thereby separated 
from the church.

26. Moreover, it is unlawful for the spiritual man to 
claim as his own absolutely the good that he 
receives from the Lord whether it may be 
intellectual or voluntary;

27. Whosoever it be that eats any blood, 
that soul shall be cut off from his 
people. 

27. And whoever presumes to do this hypocritically in 
external worship, is on that account separated from
the church.

28. And the LORD spoke to Moses, 

28. And there is revelation from the Lord by Divine 

saying, 

Truth giving perception,

29. Speak to the children of Israel, 

saying, He that offers the sacrifice of
his peace offerings to the LORD shall
bring his oblation to the LORD out of
the sacrifice of his peace offerings: 

29. And instruction to the man of the Spiritual Church,
that in states of the worship of the Lord from 
freedom, he shall be inwardly in pure good, and 
shall act from that good as from himself.

70

30. His own hands shall bring the 

offerings of the LORD by fire; the fat 
with the breast shall he bring, that 
the breast may be waved for a wave 
offering before the LORD. 

31. And the priest shall burn the fat upon
the altar: but the breast shall be 
Aaron's and his sons'. 

32. And the right thigh shall you give to 

the priest for an heave offering out 
of the sacrifices of your peace 
offerings. 

33. He among the sons of Aaron, that 
offers the blood of the peace 
offerings, and the fat, shall have the 
right thigh for a portion. 

30. By the exercise of his own will and understanding 
shall he inwardly devote himself to the Lord from 
pure love; and from celestial in spiritual good shall
he worship, in order that spiritual good may be 
vivified from the Lord, and may thus become 
perfect.

31. And by celestial good shall he be immediately 
conjoined with the Lord in worship; but by 
spiritual good in the celestial degree of his 
conscious life, he realizes the holy principle of 
charity.

32. But inmost celestial good and truth conjoined in 
the heavenly marriage must be ascribed solely to 
the Lord in worship from a state of freedom, that 
good may be received, and rendered active, 
externally in uses.

33. And inmost celestial truth from good, by which the

conjunction of truth with good, and of good with 
truth is effected in worship which, in externals, is 
relatively imperfect, is that which appropriates 
immediately the life of good from the Lord.

34. For the wave breast and the heave 

34. For spiritual good and celestial good, which are 

thigh have I taken of the children of 
Israel out of the sacrifices of their 
peace offerings, and have given them
to Aaron the priest and to his sons as 
a due for ever from the children of 
Israel. 

the sources of all activity, must be ascribed by the 
spiritual man entirely to the Lord in worship from 
freedom and joy on account of deliverance from 
evil; and yet are to be appropriated by the celestial 
and spiritual man, as if they were his own, to 
eternity, and are derived from the exercise of his 
innate powers.

35. This is the anointing portion of 

35. And thus conjunction with the Divine life is 

Aaron, and the anointing portion of 
his sons, out of the offerings of the 
LORD made by fire, in the day when 
he presented them to minister to the 
LORD in the priest's office; 

effected in the inmost celestial degree, in the will 
and understanding there, when the Lord is 
worshiped sincerely although imperfectly, from 
love; and when man thus inmostly acknowledges 
that all life is from the Lord in the genuine worship
of Him.

36. Which the LORD commanded to be 
given them of the children of Israel, 
in the day that he anointed them. It is
a due for ever throughout their 
generations. 

36. And every man of the Spiritual Church by influx 
from the Lord, is enabled to acknowledge that 
inmost life is from Him in worship by conjunction 
with Him. And thus must the spiritual man 
perpetually acknowledge the Lord in every state of
the regenerate life in heaven.

71

37. This is the law of the burnt offering, 

of the meal offering, and of the sin 
offering, and of the guilt offering, 
and of the consecration, and of the 
sacrifice of peace offerings; 

37. These are the laws of Divine Order in relation to 
the acknowledgement of the Lord, and His 
worship in all its degrees as to the reception of 
celestial and spiritual good, and as to deliverance 
from evil internally and externally as to 
conjunction with the Lord, and as to the worship of
the Lord from freedom in relatively imperfect 
states.

38. Which the LORD commanded Moses 
in mount Sinai, in the day that he 
commanded the children of Israel to 
offer their oblations to the LORD, in 
the wilderness of Sinai. 

38. And these, indeed, commence in a state of 

instruction in Divine Truth from a principle of 
good, when the Divine Life flows down even to 
ultimates in the obscurity of such a state of 
instruction.

References and Notes

1. This is evident, because the guilt offering signifies worship from the truth of faith, 9156; it 

also signifies deliverance from exterior evils, 3400; and its being most holy signifies that such 
worship and such deliverance are derived from the inmost state as to good, 10129.

2. Killing the animal offered denotes preparation for such worship, 10024; in the place where 
they kill the burnt offering denotes that such worship is similar to the worship of the Lord 
from pure love, and is grounded therein, 10053, 2625; and sprinkling the blood on the altar 
round about denotes that by this worship and deliverance the conjunction of truth with good is 
effected in every mode and degree, 10047.

3. Offering all the fat denotes that all the good of such worship Is to be ascribed to the Lord, 
10033; the fat tail denotes exterior natural good, 10071; and the fat that covers the inwards 
denotes external natural good, 10029, 10030, 9632.

4. The two kidneys and the fat that is upon them denote the discrimination or purification of 

truth, and the good thereof, 10032, 10074; the loins denote the conjunction of truth with good, 
3915; the long lobe upon the liver, with the kidneys, denote interior natural good promoting 
the discrimination of truth, 10031; and these being taken away or separated denote separation 
from selfish good, and consequently consecration to the service of the Lord, as is evident.

5. The priest burning these things upon the altar for an offering made by fire to the Lord, denotes 

that all these varieties of good are to be ascribed to the Lord, and are to be devoted to Him in 
worship from pure love, 10052, 10055; and it being a guilt offering denotes that this is the 
worship by which there is deliverance from exterior evil, 3400, 10042, III.

6. Every male among the priests eating thereof denotes that all those who are in the truth of faith 
derived from the good of charity shall appropriate good in this worship, 725, 9946, 2187; a 
holy place denotes a holy state, 2625; and it being most holy denotes that it is the outward 
expression of inmost good,. 10129.

7. As is the sin offering so is the guilt offering, denotes that this worship is one with the worship 
of the Lord from the good of faith, and thence man's deliverance from interior evil, 9156, 
10042; there being one law for them denotes the same law for deliverance from evil in 

72

general, as is evident; and the priest that makes atonement having it, denotes that those who 
are in good by which there is deliverance from evil and reconciliation with the Lord, shall 
appropriate the good of this worship, 9946, 10042, II., 2187.

8. By the priest is denoted the good from which any one worships, 9946; by the burnt offering is 
denoted full devotion to the Lord, 8680; by the skin is denoted what is external, 3540; and by 
the priest having the skin is denoted appropriation only as to the external, or as if from 
himself, 2187.

9. The meal offering denotes a state of spiritual worship when the burnt offering signifies a state 
of celestial worship, and therefore it here denotes an intermediate state, 2177; the oven, the 
frying-pan and the baking-pan denote diversities of good in the natural or external man, 7356; 
and baking denotes preparation, which takes place in the natural man by conjoining truth with 
good there, the fine flour denoting truth and the heat good, 8496, 2177, 934.

10. The meal offering denotes a sincere act of worship celestial or spiritual, 4581, 2177; mingled 
with oil denotes consciously from good, or affection, 2177; dry denotes apparently without 
affection, 8185; and all the sons of Aaron having it denotes appropriation only externally, 
since sons denote truths which are relatively external, and Aaron, as the high priest, denotes 
good which is relatively internal, 9946.

11. By the law of the sacrifice of the peace offering are denoted the laws of Divine Order in 
relation to the worship of the Lord from freedom in every individual case, 3880, 10097, 
10137.

12. Here unleavened cakes mingled with oil, unleavened wafers anointed with oil, and cakes 

mingled with oil of fine flour soaked, denote truth conjoined with good, uncontaminated with 
falsity, in its three degrees, such truth being derived from good and leading thereto, 3880, 
7906, 9993, 9994, 9995.

13. Cakes of leavened bread offered with the sacrifice of peace offerings for thanksgiving denote 
that he who worships the Lord freely from gratitude grounded in celestial love acknowledges 
that of himself he is only evil, and has been purified by the Lord through temptations, 7906.

14. Offering one out of each oblation for a heave offering denotes good received from the Lord 

alone, 10097; and it being the priest's denotes that pure heavenly good is appropriated by him 
who conjoins truth with good in such worship, 9946, 10047.

15. The flesh being eaten on the day of the oblation denotes that this particular good of worship 
from gratitude is appropriated only under that preparatory state, 2187, 487; and not leaving 
any of it until the morning, denotes non-appropriation if contaminated with selfish love on the 
one hand, or separated from the new state of regeneration on the other, 10114-17, 7860, 8480-
3.

16. This is evident from the signification of a vow as denoting worship from spiritual love, and a 
willingness that the Lord may provide, 3880; of a free-will offering as denoting worship from 
freedom, 10097; of eating as denoting appropriation, 2187; of day as denoting state, 487; and 
of the morrow as denoting perpetually afterwards, 3998, 8788. 

73

17. That which remains of the sacrifice until the third day being burnt with fire, denotes that in the
process of Judgement, when the state of good is completed, all merely selfish good shall be 
dissipated, 8480-3, 10115, 900.

18. In this verse the flesh of the sacrifice, which properly denotes heavenly good, denotes the 

opposite, that is, selfish good, because of abuse, 10114; not being accepted evidently denotes 
non-conjunction with the Lord; and its not being imputed denotes that it cannot be imputed as 
heavenly good, 9713, 1813; while by its being an abomination, and by iniquity being borne, 
are denoted that it is utterly opposed to such good, and that he who is in it must remain in his 
evil state conjoining it with falsity, 6052, 7454, 9937.

19. This is true because by the flesh here is evidently denoted good, 10114; by touching is denoted
contact spiritually, 4404, 10199; by an unclean thing is denoted an evil affection, 10130; by 
not being eaten is denoted non-appropriation, 2187; by being burnt with fire is denoted 
purification by temptations, or overcoming by the power of heavenly love, 7861, 934; and by 
every one who is clean eating thereof is denoted that good may be appropriated by every one 
who is purified from evil, 2187, 10130.

20. The soul that eats of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace offerings having his uncleanness upon 
him being cut off from his people, denotes that he who appropriates good in the worship of the
Lord from freedom externally, when yet he has not done the work of repentance by purifying 
himself internally, is thereby separated entirely from truth and good, 2187, 3880, 10097, 
10130, 5302, 3294-5.

21. Touching an unclean thing denotes contact with evil, 4404, 10199 10130; man, beast, and 

abomination denote internally, interiorly, and externally respectively, 7523, 6052; to eat the 
flesh of the sacrifice, in such a case, is to presume to appropriate good externally, 2187; and to 
be cut off from his people is to be separated from truth and good, 5302, 3294-5.

22. This is evident, because by Jehovah is denoted the Divine Being as to His love, 2001; by 

speaking is denoted influx, 2951; by Moses is represented Divine Truth, or the Word, 7010, 
6752; and by saying is denoted perception, 1791, 1822.

23. Speaking to the children of Israel and saying, denotes instruction to the man of the Spiritual 
Church who thence perceives, 7063, 3654, 1791; to eat denotes to appropriate, 2187; fat 
denotes celestial good, 10033; and ox, and sheep, and goat denote respectively natural and 
spiritual good, and the state of truth leading to good, 5913, 6126, 4169.

24. By the fat of that which dies of itself is denoted affection in which there is no spiritual life, and
by the fat of what was torn is denoted injury by lusts, 4171; by being used for any other 
service is denoted that such affections may be made useful as means, 2541, 5148; and by their 
not being eaten is denoted that they cannot be appropriated, 2187.

25. The soul that eats the fat of the beast of which men offer an offering made by fire to the Lord, 
being cut off from his people, denotes that if any one presumes to claim as his own absolutely 
the good which may be appropriated from the Lord, he is separated from the church, 2187, 
10055, 5302, 3294-5.

74

26. Eating no manner of blood, whether it be of bird or of beast, in any of your dwellings, denotes 
that it is unlawful for the spiritual man to claim as his own absolutely the good, intellectual or 
voluntary, which he receives from the Lord, 2187, 10033, 40, 46.

27. Whatever soul eating blood being cut off from his people, signifies that whoever presumes to 
appropriate good hypocritically in external worship is on that account separated from the 
church, 10033, 2187, 5302, 3294-5.

28. This is evident, because by Jehovah is denoted the Divine Being as to His love, 2001; by 

speaking is denoted influx, 2951; by Moses is represented Divine Truth, or the Word, 7010, 
6752; and by saying is denoted perception, 1791, 1822.

29. This is true, because speaking to the children of Israel saying, denotes instruction to the men 
of the Spiritual Church, giving perception, 7063, 3654, 1791; peace offerings denote the 
worship of the Lord from freedom, 10097; bringing his oblation to the Lord denotes that he is 
inwardly in pure good, 2001; and out of the sacrifice of his peace offerings denotes acting 
from that good as from himself, 10097.

30. His own hands bringing the offering of the Lord made by fire, denotes that by the exercise of 
his own will and understanding he shall inwardly devote himself to the Lord from pure love, 
8066, 10062, 10055; the fat with the breast denotes that he shall worship from celestial in 
spiritual good, 10033, 10087; and the waving denotes vivification from the Lord, 10083, 
10093.

31. The priest burning the fat upon the altar denotes conjunction with the Lord by celestial good in
worship, 10033, 10052; and the breast being for Aaron and his sons denotes conjunction with 
the Lord by charity, 10087.

32. The right thigh being given to the priest for a heave offering out of the sacrifices of the peace 
offerings, denotes that inmost celestial good and truth conjoined in the heavenly marriage 
must be ascribed solely to the Lord in worship from a state of freedom, that good may be 
received and rendered active externally in uses, 10092-3, 10097.

33. He among the sons of Aaron that offers the blood of the peace offerings and the fat having the 

right thigh for a portion, denotes that inmost celestial truth from good by which the 
conjunction of truth with good and of good with truth is effected in worship which in externals
is relatively imperfect, is that which appropriates immediately the life of good from the Lord, 
9946, 10047, 10033, 10092-3, 2187.

34. The wave breast and the heave thigh denote spiritual and celestial good, 10087, 10092-3; 

taken from the children of Israel out of the sacrifices of peace offerings, denotes that they are 
from the Lord as the sources of all activity, 10087, 10092-3; out of their sacrifices of peace 
offerings denotes when worship is from freedom, 10097; given to Aaron and his sons denotes 
that they must be ascribed to the Lord who is Divine Good and Divine Truth, 10277, 9946, 
10093; and the Lord giving them to Aaron the priest and his sons as a due, or a statute, for 
ever, denotes that they are appropriated by the celestial and spiritual man as if they were their 
own to eternity, and are derived from the exercise of his innate powers, 9946, 7884, 7931, 
1712.

75

35. This is true because anointing portions denote what gives conjunction with the Divine life, 

9954; Aaron and his sons denote Divine Good and Divine Truth, and thus the inmost celestial 
degree as to the will and understanding, 9946; the offerings of the Lord made by fire denote 
the worship of the Lord sincerely, though, imperfectly, from love, 10055; and the day when he 
presented them, to minister to the Lord in the priest's office, denotes when man thus inwardly 
acknowledges that all life is from the Lord in the genuine worship of Him, 10097.

36. Which the Lord commanded to be given them of the children of Israel in the day that he 

anointed them, denotes that every man of the Spiritual Church, by influx from the Lord, is 
enabled to acknowledge that inmost life is from Him in worship by conjunction with Him, 
5486, 10227, 3654, 10097; and a due, or statute, for ever throughout your generations, denotes
that thus must the spiritual man perpetually acknowledge the Lord in every state of the 
regenerate life in heaven, 7884, 7931, 9845, 1712.

37. The law of the burnt offering, of the meal offering, of the sin offering, of the guilt offering, of 
the consecration, and of the peace offerings, denotes the laws of Divine Order in relation to the
acknowledgement of the Lord, and His worship in all its degrees as-to the reception of 
celestial and spiritual good, as to deliverance from evil internally and externally, as to 
conjunction with the Lord, and as to the worship of the Lord from freedom in relatively 
imperfect states. This appears from the explanation of the whole series as here given with the 
various proofs.

38. By the Lord commanding Moses in Mount Sinai is denoted commencement in a state of 

instruction in Divine Truth from a principle of good, 7010, 6752, 8753, 5486; by the Lord 
commanding Moses is denoted influx from the Lord even to ultimates, 5486; and by offering 
oblations to the Lord in the wilderness of Sinai is denoted the worship of the Lord in the 
obscurity of such a state of instruction, 349, 922, 8753.

Discussion

Having now completed the proofs of each verse in this chapter, we pursue our plan by such comments 
as may be useful in illustrating the various laws of Divine Order concerning worship, which come 
successively before us. Every one, surely, in the present day is willing to believe that the External of 
the universe is governed by laws, and to admit that were it not so, or did man remain ignorant of those 
laws, confusion would be the result in the universe, or man would appear out of joint with every other 
created thing or being. Hence, then, we find that man is endowed with the capacity to understand 
natural law, and to provide for his material comfort and happiness by bringing himself into harmony 
with it.

But this being the case, we are led to reflect that, certainly also, the Internal of the universe, which must
be the cause of the External, is also governed by laws; and that it is equally necessary that man should 
become acquainted with them, and live according to them. For if, by obedience to natural law, the 
natural man is so greatly benefited, how much more will he be so by obedience to spiritual law as well!
Nay, further, does it not appear reasonable that without the knowledge and practice of spiritual law, 
obedience to natural law merely, valuable as it is, does not accomplish all that is desirable for man? 
Need we wonder, then, at the Lord's words in the Gospel, where He counsels His disciples to seek 
FIRST the kingdom of God, and His righteousness?

76

But how "are the laws which regulate the Internal of the universe to be discovered and understood? Not
by any merely natural process of investigation, but by revelation. The natural man cannot discover and 
verify spiritual laws because they are above his capacity. And the spiritual man, although he can 
understand spiritual laws when revealed, cannot, by himself, discover them, because they have their 
origin in the Lord who is Infinite; and since no one can comprehend the Infinite, but only what 
proceeds from the Infinite, when that proceeding is successively and adequately accommodated (John 
1:18), therefore revelation has been given which is the Word, and indeed has always been given (John 
1:1). And in the Word, on this account, are contained the laws of spiritual life made manifest through 
the correspondences, by means of which spiritual truth is conveyed to man, and could not be conveyed 
in any other way (Matt 13:34; Ps 78:2). Let us then reverently and lovingly consider the laws set before
us in our chapter.

Now the first law governing the worship of those who are in the truth of faith is, that such worship 
proceeds from the inmost state as to good. The worshiper, however, is not aware, consciously, of the 
operation of this law, for he does not even know what his inmost state as to good is, nor does he 
perceive that the Lord is operating upon him through it. But it is there nevertheless, 1555. The next law 
is that preparation for this worship is similar to preparation for worship from pure love. What is this 
preparation? It is the denial of self, the shunning of evils as sins, and the acknowledgement of the Lord.
The old life must be rejected, its delights must be relinquished, and a determination to act according to 
the truth must be exercised, this last necessarily involving the acknowledgement of the Lord and of 
responsibility to Him. And these result in worship from the truth of faith, of which every one may be 
conscious when he acts according to the truth, although only on the principle or rule that the truth must 
be obeyed because the Lord has so commanded. But the third law in this case is, that truth must be 
conjoined with good, or faith with love, according to the state. And this, as far as the worshiper is 
concerned, is effected by a life of obedience; but as far as the Lord's operation is concerned by an 
arrangement of truth under the state of good at this stage realized. For by his obedience the worshiper 
confirms the conjunction, and by the Lord's secret operation an elevation of state is produced in 
preparation for a higher degree of worship. The fourth Jaw, which is described in verses 3-5, is that all 
the good of this worship, denoted by the fat, and all the truth thereof denoted by the kidneys, both 
exterior and interior, shall be ascribed to the Lord and devoted to His service; and then it follows that 
all who are in truth derived from good will appropriate good, that is (according to a law afterwards 
explained), only externally, or as if from self, because the flesh in relation to the fat and the blood 
denotes what is external. The fifth law is that the worship of the Lord from the truth of faith and from 
the good of faith are identical, since they both relate to the removal of evil, arid both classes of 
worshipers can appropriate good according to the law, which is described in verses 8-10, and is shown 
to be applicable to appropriation under different states of worship, namely, that it is only external, or as 
if good belonged to man as his own. And this general law is here stated evidently to show that even the 
angels of the superior heavens, as well as those of the ultimate heaven, cannot appropriate life or love 
as their own absolutely, the reason being that the Lord only has self-existent life. Thus is man every 
moment dependent on the source of life; and all evil arises from the abuse of his free determination 
under the delusion that life really appertains to himself. But this sixth law, which may be called the 
general law of appropriation, requires a little further consideration. In the sixth verse it is said, 
concerning the flesh of the sacrifice, "every male among the priests shall eat thereof," meaning, 
spiritually, that all in truth derived from good not as yet realized will appropriate good; but in the eighth
verse it is also said the priest shall have to himself the skin of the burnt offering, meaning that good 
will appropriate its own ultimate truth, as well as that good is only appropriated by men, even in 
celestial worship, externally; and another aspect of this correspondential statement is, that when man is 

77

fully in good internally, he will not only appropriate good externally, which is specifically represented 
by eating the fleshy but ultimate truth also, denoted by having the skin. Now all these three aspects of 
the internal sense of this Mosaic law are legitimate interpretation, and cohere. For fullness of 
appropriation involves three things: first, the consciousness that we are recipients of good and truth 
continually; secondly, that the internal appropriates what is external; and thirdly, that the more we are 
filled with love to the Lord and the neighbour internally, the more full and complete, ultimately, will be
our external enjoyment of life. And now, further, we may see how the spiritual sense of verses 9-10 
show the working of this law in fullness with spiritual and natural men as well as with the celestial. 
Observe that "the sons of Aaron" here include those who are in truth from good natural as well as 
spiritual, and that this is the reason why it is said, "one as well as another"; also that when we state the 
spiritual sense in ordinary language, as is necessary in expositions, we cannot express more than one 
aspect of the truth involved when writing a series.

But proceeding, we have now to make some remarks on the internal sense as far as verse 21. The 
various laws concerning the peace offerings, as the references show, denote the laws of Divine Order in
relation to man's worship of the Lord from freedom in every individual case. Simply to read over this 
description in the literal sense is enough to prove that the directions here given must involve more than 
appears on the surface. Who can tell, for example, from the literal sense, why the flesh of the sacrifice 
of confession, or thanksgiving, was only to be eaten on the day when offered, when yet that of the 
votive and retributory offerings was permitted to be eaten on the second day as well? But the internal 
sense shows us why. There is only one thing which really constitutes true worship in any degree of 
man's life, and that is, the love of the object of worship for his own sake, and not for any less interior 
motive or reason. To love and worship the Lord for what He is, is a great deal more important than to 
love and worship Him on account of the benefits He has conferred, or is likely to confer upon us. 
Hence, then, worship merely from gratitude is decidedly inferior to worship from genuine love in any 
degree of our life. Of course it is natural that we should be grateful for blessing's bestowed upon us by 
anybody, and it has been said that ingratitude is a crime so shameful that no one could be found who 
would acknowledge himself guilty of it. But still, does not the Lord want us to love Him for His own 
Name's sake, rather than because His kindness constrains us? To love His kindness is good, but to love 
Himself, and thus imitate His kindness is better. Hence, then, we see why an offering of thanksgiving is 
inferior to an offering from love, and why the former, distinguished from the latter, must be involved in
the latter to constitute real thanksgiving; or, in the words of the literal sense, why we must eat of the 
flesh of the sacrifice of thanksgiving only on the day when it is offered, that is, spiritually, our gratitude
must not be apart from our genuine love to the Lord. Now this is really the sum and substance of the 
internal sense of vers. 11-15. But besides the sacrifices of thanksgiving, the peace offerings included 
vows; and consulting 3880, we find numerous passages of scripture quoted to show that they 
represented spiritual worship as distinguished from celestial, or worship from charity to the neighbour 
as distinguished from love to the Lord. And it therefore follows that the free-will offerings named along
with the vows, denote natural worship from freedom. Now to worship the Lord from freedom is to 
worship Him from love; and therefore it is said concerning all the peace offerings that they were "not 
so much for purification and sanctification as the rest, but that they might eat together in the holy place,
and testify joy of heart from Divine worship" (10114). Evidently, then, they represented worship from 
the freedom of love after victory in temptation, and also in the fully regenerated state; and the 
appropriation of good, under such conditions, was denoted by eating of the sacrifices; and that such 
appropriation was and is continual, is denoted by eating on the "morrow," or on the second day, what 
was left on the first. For to eternity man will require to be nourished with heavenly good, and during 
regeneration he is nourished by the appropriation of good successively in states of peace and rest after 

78

temptations. And, moreover, whereas in the celestial state, described in ver. 12, he has reached the third
heaven, beyond which he cannot go, and which is the third day, or final new state, 10114, he can only 
appropriate good in that day, on the other hand, the spiritual man, in his state of appropriation, or in his 
states of the realization of good, is looking forward to the "morrow" of the celestial state, and the 
natural man to the "morrow" of the spiritual and celestial states, from all which we see another reason 
why the law of appropriation is differently described in the fifteenth and sixteenth verses. There are, 
however, other laws regarding this appropriation of good which now require attention.

The first of these is expressed in the seventeenth verse, and it is that, in the process of Judgement, all 
merely selfish good will be dissipated. This the references given clearly show; and this is applicable, of
course, to those who are in genuine good. But the next verse gives another law which concerns the 
wicked. Selfish good may be appropriated in the process of Judgement, and when it is, it not only 
causes separation from the Lord and the heavenly life, but the confirmation and perpetual continuance 
of evil; for the Last Judgement with every one in particular follows immediately after his departure 
from the natural world, and then, since a man is no longer in liberty of choice between good, and evil 
(H.H. 480) and will not admit of instruction, it follows that he must remain in evil to eternity; and, we 
may add, it is better for himself that it should be so, since it provides for his entire separation from 
good and truth which, to such persons, only cause torment. And the third law, which is contained in the 
two following verses, is that the appropriation of good must be preceded by purification from evil, 
while the fourth, which ends the series, declares that merely outward righteousness combined with 
inward impurity, which is hypocrisy and profanation, also necessarily causes separation from good and 
truth. And finally all these laws show that good is not appropriated or realized by man during states of 
instruction or during states of conflict, but after instruction and after conflict, when the Lord is truly 
worshiped with freedom and joy.

And now follow two more important subdivisions of the general subject of the appropriation of good in
worship from freedom, the former teaching that no one can appropriate good or truth as his own 
absolutely, and the latter that, nevertheless, man must act in the matter as if all depended upon himself, 
at the same time acknowledging that all the power of doing so is from the Lord, the chapter concluding 
with a general summary of the laws of worship in all cases from the earliest state of man's instruction in
truths with a view to their implantation in good. And all this will be found in harmony with the teaching
concerning worship from freedom in chapter the third; but this account is more particular, for it is said 
not only that it is impossible for man to appropriate any good or truth from himself, but also that 
affections merely natural, and therefore without spiritual life, and the affections that have been injured 
by lusts, may be useful as means, but cannot be appropriated. Hence we see therefore the proper use of 
the selfish and perverted life of man before regeneration, and how the Divine Providence may lead man
by that life into the higher life. And indeed, were this not the case, it is difficult to see how we are 
brought out of the old and corrupted life into that which is heavenly. Moreover, it is according to all 
human experience that the natural life precedes and the spiritual life follows; and, although it may seem
like a paradox, yet it is equally true that regeneration also precedes and purification follows. Thus man 
in the world lives a chequered life, and hardly knows, notwithstanding his determination to do right, 
whether his real bias is for heaven or hell. However, let him "trust in the Lord and do good, for so shall 
he dwell in the land; and verily he shall be fed." And a word may now be said, therefore, on the other 
aspect of the subject as contained in the internal sense of verses 29-36. The law is that a man cannot be 
saved except by worshiping the Lord entirely as from his own power. His own hands bringing the 
offering denotes action from his own power; the fat with the breast denotes celestial good inwardly in 
spiritual good; and waving denotes vivification from the Lord. We do not, however, see or feel these 

79

interior operations in ourselves, only perhaps experiencing an obscure satisfaction in doing our duty, 
this being the effect of the Lord's hidden work. And still further in this connection, how elevating is the 
spiritual teaching of the thirty-first verse! For it shows that the appropriation of good, or the realization 
of charity, denoted by the breast, depends upon the sincere acknowledgement that inmost good, 
signified by the fat, is entirely from the Lord, and must be consecrated to his service in the life of 
charity. And it follows that this truth is emphasized in the following verse, the heaving of the right thigh
denoting that acknowledgement, and also conjunction with the Lord, while by Aaron and his sons 
having it, is denoted appropriation and the consequent life of uses; for good is not really appropriated 
unless it is expressed in words and deeds. But now two remarks made in giving the internal sense of 
verses 33 and 34 may require explanation. It is said in the former that worship from inmost celestial 
truth is, in externals, relatively imperfect, and this Is true of all external worship as compared with what
is internal, and is illustrated by what is said in 9946 at the end, and in 10047 in these words: "As the 
Lord glorified His Human, so also He regenerates man: for the Lord with man flows in with good 
through the soul which is by an internal way, and with truth through hearing and sight, that is by an 
external way, and so far as man desists from evils, so far the Lord conjoins good with truth, and the 
good becomes the good of charity towards the neighbour and of love to God, and the truth becomes the 
truth of faith." Also in verse 34 it is said that spiritual good and celestial good "are derived from the 
exercise of man's innate powers." By "innate powers" are meant powers received from the Lord, as, for 
example, the power to use the new will and understanding, 1555, and power to act as from himself, 
1712. Thus, too, it is said in verse 35, "The Lord is worshiped sincerely, though imperfectly, from 
love"; and in verse 36 that man is enabled to acknowledge that inmost life is from the Lord." And in 
short, the anointing portion of Aaron and his sons is nothing else, with regard to man generally, than 
the power given to him to acknowledge that his highest good is from the Lord, by conjunction with 
Him, and thence by the appropriation of that good.

Leviticus Chapter 8

Summary of the Spiritual Sense

1. The general subject of the whole chapter is the glorification of the Lord, and, at the same time, 

the regeneration of man, vers. 1-5. 

2. And first, with regard to the Lord, there is the putting off of the Human from the mother, and 

with regard to man purification from actual evil by repentance, ver. 6. 

3. Then it follows that there is the reception of Divine Truths in successive order, and the 

conjunction of truth with good giving wisdom and enlightenment, vers. 7-13. 

4. Also the natural affections must be purified, in order that they may be brought into harmony 

with the higher affections, vers. 14-17. 

5. Moreover, the spiritual affections must be wholly consecrated to the Lord, and thus the good of 

innocence must be realized internally as well as externally, vers. 18-21. 

6. And now, therefore, the regenerated man is fully inaugurated into the realization of good, and 

thus into a life of good acting by truth, and consequently into the active life of charity followed 
by the reciprocal conjunction of truth with good, vers. 22-30. 

7. After which there is the full and perpetual appropriation of good without any admixture of evil; 
and thus is accomplished the glorification of the Lord and the regeneration of man, first by 
complete separation from all evil, and secondly by the reception of all good and truth embodied 
in perfect obedience, according to the laws of Divine Order by influx from the Lord and by co-
operation on the part of man, vers. 31-36. 

The Contents of each Verse

1. And the LORD spoke to Moses, 

1. There is revelation from the Lord by Divine Truth 

saying, 

giving perception.

2. Take Aaron and his sons with him, 
and the garments, and the anointing 
oil, and the bullock of the sin 
offering, and the two rams, and the 
basket of unleavened bread; 

3. And assemble you all the 

congregation at the door of the tent 
of meeting. 

2. Concerning celestial good and the truths thence 

derived; concerning spiritual truths to be conjoined
with celestial good; concerning natural good and 
spiritual good to be purified from evil, or 
concerning the purification of the external and 
internal man; and concerning celestial good free 
from falsity in all its degrees, and the Sensual 
which is a receptacle;

3. And thus concerning the glorification of the Lord 
and the regeneration of man as to all his powers, in
order that he may enter into the enjoyment of the 
heavenly life.

81

4. And Moses did as the LORD 
commanded him; and the 
congregation was assembled at the 
door of the tent of meeting. 

5. And Moses said to the congregation, 
This is the thing which the LORD has
commanded to be done. 

6. And Moses brought Aaron and his 
sons, and washed them with water. 

4. And this is effected by Divine Truth, into which 

there is the influx of Divine Good, in order that the
Human of the Lord may be glorified even to its 
ultimates, and that man may be regenerated as to 
all his powers, as a preparation for the heavenly 
life, beginning with the acknowledgement of the 
Lord.

5. Also there is perception in particular with the man 
of the church, by means of Divine Truth or the 
Word, with respect to the glorification of the Lord 
and the regeneration of man.

6. And first that there is, with regard to the Lord, the 
putting off of the Human from the mother, and 
with regard to man purification from actual evil by
repentance.

7. And he put upon him the coat, and 
girded him with the girdle, and 
clothed him with the robe, and put 
the ephod upon him, and he girded 
him with the cunningly woven band 
of the ephod, and bound it to him 
therewith. 

7. Also there is the reception of inmost truths the 
uniting medium of the celestial and spiritual 
heavens; of the common bond of love which unites
these truths, and distinguishes them; of the interior
truths of the spiritual kingdom; of ultimate truths 
therefrom; and of the common bond conjoining 
these.

8. And he placed the breastplate upon 
him: and in the breastplate he put the
Urim and the Thummim. 

9. And he set the mitre upon his head; 
and upon the mitre, in front, did he 
set the golden plate, the holy crown; 
as the LORD commanded Moses. 

10. And Moses took the anointing oil, 
and anointed the tabernacle and all 
that was therein, and sanctified them.

8. Also there is the revelation of Divine Truth shining
forth from Divine Good, and filling the mind of 
the man of the church even to ultimates with clear 
perceptions of good and truth.

9. Besides which there is wisdom from the Lord in 

the inmost, and thence, in ultimates, enlightenment
from that wisdom, or from the Divine Human, 
according to the influx of Divine Good into Divine
Truth.

10. And further, Divine Truth in the inmost is 

conjoined with Divine Good, and thence sanctifies 
the interiors of those in the middle heaven, or the 
interiors of the mind of the regenerating man 
corresponding thereto.

82

11. And he sprinkled thereof upon the 
altar seven times, and anointed the 
altar and all its vessels, and the laver 
and its base, to sanctify them. 

12. And he poured of the anointing oil 

upon Aaron's head, and anointed 
him, to sanctify him. 

13. And Moses brought Aaron's sons, 
and clothed them with coats, and 
girded them with girdles, and bound 
caps upon them; as the LORD 
commanded Moses. 

14. And he brought the bullock of the 

sin offering: and Aaron and his sons 
laid their hands upon the head of the 
bullock of the sin offering. 

11. Also good is conjoined with truth in the worship of
the Lord from love in all fullness and holiness, and
this not only by the devotion of the soul to the 
Lord by such conjunction, but also by the 
consecration of all recipient truths interior, 
exterior, and external, which are thereby rendered 
pure and holy.

12. But especially must Divine Good itself flow in and
vivify the Human of the Lord, and the soul of man,
with good conjoined to truth, from the highest 
degree even to the lowest.

13. And again by the instrumentality of Divine Truth, 
or the Word, the spiritual man, as well as the 
celestial, must be instructed in truths, must be 
invested with the common bond of affection, and 
must be endowed with heavenly wisdom, 
according to the influx of Divine Good into Divine
Truth, that is, according to Divine Order.

14. Also the natural man must be purified to have 
conjunction with the celestial and with the 
spiritual, and thus with the Lord; and there must 
be, therefore, the reception of Divine Good and 
Divine Truth with power, in the Natural, from the 
Celestial and Spiritual.

15. And he slew it; and Moses took the 
blood, and put it upon the horns of 
the altar round about with his finger, 
and purified the altar, and poured out
the blood at the base of the altar, and
sanctified it, to make atonement for 
it. 

15. And thus preparation must be made; Divine Truth 
accommodated to the natural man must operate 
with power in the worship of the Lord according to
the state, and thus the natural man must be 
purified; this purification must extend even to the 
sensual life of man; and thus the natural man must 
be brought into harmony with the spiritual.

16. And he took all the fat that was upon
the inwards, and the long lobe of the 
liver, and the two kidneys, and their 
fat, and Moses burned it upon the 
altar. 

16. Also all good even of the lowest degree; interior 

natural good; and the natural power of 
discriminating truths, conjoined with its good, 
must be ascribed to the Lord and must be devoted 
to Him.

17. But the bullock, and its skin, and its 
flesh, and its dung, he burnt with fire
without the camp; as the LORD 
commanded Moses. 

17. But the merely natural man, with its falsity, its 
selfish affections and everything evil which by 
discrimination has been separated from good, is to 
be rejected from the heavenly life, and consumed 
by self-love, because opposed to the influx of 
Divine Good into those who are in Divine Truths.

purified and devoted to the Lord; and for this 
purpose there must be the communication of 
power from the Lord through celestial good and its
truths.

19. And he killed it: and Moses

conjunction of Divine Good with Divine Truth 
must be effected in the Internal.

20. And he cut the ram into its pieces; 
and Moses burnt the head, and the 
pieces, and the fat. 

21. And he washed the inwards and the 
legs with water; and Moses burnt the
whole ram upon the altar: it was a 
burnt offering for a sweet savour: it 
was an offering made by fire to the 
LORD; as the LORD commanded 
Moses. 

22. And he presented the other ram, the 
ram of consecration: and Aaron and 
his sons laid their hands upon the 
head of the ram. 

20. Also there must be a proper arrangement of good 

affections and truths with the regenerating man; 
and these must be ascribed to the Lord and 
devoted to Him from pure love, as to inmost 
things, as to exterior things, and as to all celestial 
good.

21. Moreover, all sensual and natural affections must 
be purified by the application of the truths of the 
Word; and thus the internal man must be wholly 
consecrated to the Lord; for by such consecration, 
heavenly peace and rest are realized; it is indeed 
the worship of the Lord from pure love, by influx 
from Him and by co-operation with Him through 
obedience to the truths of the Word.

22. But secondly now, Divine Truth must proceed 
from Divine Good in the heavens in order that 
good may act by truth; and into this truth there 
must be the influx of Divine Good and Divine 
Truth with power.

23. And he slew it; and Moses took of

from the fullness of Divine Truth in its power

24. And he brought Aaron's sons, and

same order with him who is being prepared for the 
inferior heavens; in both cases involving the 
conjunction of good and truth in worship in every 
mode and degree.

84

25. And he took the fat, and the fat tail, 
and all the fat that was upon the 
inwards, and the long lobe of the 
liver, and the two kidneys, and their 
fat, and the right thigh: 

25. But all celestial-spiritual good, exterior, external, 

and interior; all spiritual truth serving for 
discrimination, or purification, and conjoined with 
its good; and all interior truth conjoined with its 
good in the heavenly marriage;

26. And out of the basket of unleavened 
bread, that was before the LORD, he 
took one unleavened cake, and one 
cake of oiled bread, and one wafer, 
and placed them on the fat, and upon
the right thigh: 

27. And he put the whole upon the hands
of Aaron, and upon the hands of his 
sons, and waved them for a wave 
offering before the LORD. 

28. And Moses took them from off their 
hands, and burnt them on the altar 
upon the burnt offering! they were a 
consecration for a sweet savour: it 
was an offering made by fire to the 
LORD. 

26. All inmost celestial good; all interior celestial 

good; and all ultimate celestial good in the Sensual
as their receptacle, must be acknowledged to have 
their origin from the Divine Good through the 
heavenly marriage;

27. And thus to be communicated to all in the celestial
and spiritual heavens, and to be vivified, or 
rendered active from the Lord.

28. And by the instrumentality of Divine Truth, or the 
Word, must all these powers be consecrated to the 
Lord in the worship of a good life, bringing joy 
and peace, because they proceed from the worship 
of the Lord from pure love.

29. And Moses took the breast, and

the ram of consecration; as the LORD
commanded Moses. 

spiritual heavens, live the active life of charity 
from the Lord; for charity is the essential of the 
spiritual man, and of the spiritual heavens, by 
influx from the Lord into Divine Truth there.

30. And Moses took of the anointing oil,
and of the blood which was upon the
altar, and sprinkled it upon Aaron, 
upon his garments, and upon his 
sons, and upon his sons' garments 
with him; and sanctified Aaron, his 
garments, and his sons, and his sons' 
garments with him. 

31. And Moses said to Aaron and to his 
sons, Boil the flesh at the door of the
tent of meeting: and there eat it and 
the bread that is in the basket of 
consecration, as I commanded, 
saying, Aaron and his sons shall eat 
it. 

30. Moreover, by the instrumentality of Divine Truth, 
a reciprocal conjunction of truth with good in the 
superior and inferior heavens must take place, so 
that the whole man may be sanctified, as to 
celestial good and truth and as to spiritual good 
and truth.

31. Also there is perception by Divine Truth with the 
celestial man and with the spiritual man, that 
preparation must be made for the appropriation of 
good by the acknowledgement of the Lord and His
influx through the heavens, even for the 
appropriation of all spiritual and celestial good, in 
their receptacles with the regenerated man, 
according to Divine Order.

85

32. And that which remains of the flesh 
and of the bread shall you burn with 
fire. 

32. And all good that is not appropriated from the 
Lord, is of self-love, and must be rejected and 
dissipated.

33. And you shall not go out from the 
door of the tent of meeting seven 
days, until the days of your 
consecration be fulfilled: for he shall
consecrate you seven days. 

33. And so the regeneration of man, like the 

glorification of the Lord, must be full and 
complete in every respect; and thus the 
regenerated man must enjoy the heavenly life to 
eternity.

34. As has been done this day, so the 

LORD has commanded to do, to 
make atonement for you. 

35. And at the door of the tent of 

meeting shall you abide day and 
night seven days, and keep the 
charge of the LORD, that you die not:
for so I am commanded. 

34. For every state of regeneration is a representation 
of the whole process in an image, so that man may 
be delivered from all evil, and may he reconciled 
to the Lord, by the entire consecration of all his 
powers to His service.

35. Moreover, the regenerated man will never cease to 
acknowledge the Lord, and His operation through 
the heavens for man's salvation by His 
glorification; and this in every state of brightness 
and obscurity, that he may fulfill the law of the 
Lord, and be delivered from spiritual death by co-
operation with Him.

36. And Aaron and his sons did all the 
things which the LORD commanded 
by the hand of Moses. 

36. And thus is the Lord glorified, and thus is man 

regenerated, entirely, according to influx and 
correspondence as described in the Divine Word.

truths, interior, exterior, and external, which are thereby rendered pure and holy, 9954, 10274, 
10275, 9820.

12. Pouring of the oil on the head of Aaron to sanctify him, denotes that especially must Divine 
Good itself flow in and vivify the Human of the Lord, and the soul of man with good

15. Slaying the bullock denotes preparation, 10024; Moses represents Divine Truth, 7010; 

accommodation to the natural man is denoted by the blood of the bullock, 10026; the putting 
of the blood upon the horns of the altar denotes operation with power in the worship of the 
Lord, 10027, 9964; the finger also denotes power, 7430; the bullock as a sin offering denotes 
the purification of the natural man, 10024; the blood on the horns of the altar also denotes 
purification even to ultimates or to the sensual life, 10186; and pouring the blood at the base of

Moses denotes according to the influx of Divine Good into Divine Truths, 2001, 5486, 7010.

18. The ram denotes the good of innocence in the internal man, or spiritual good which is charity, 
10042; as a burnt offering denotes full devotion to the Lord, or plenary regeneration, and thus 
purification, 10053; and Aaron and his sons laying their hands upon the head of the ram 
denotes the communication of power from the Lord through celestial good and its truths, 9946,
10023.

19. Killing the ram denotes preparation, 10024; and the blood being sprinkled on the altar round 
about denotes that the conjunction of Divine Good with Divine Truth must be effected in the 
Internal, 10047.

20. Cutting the ram into pieces denotes a proper arrangement of goods and truths with the 

regenerating man, 10048; and Moses burning the head, and the pieces, and the fat, denotes that

Lord commanded Moses denotes influx from the Lord and co-operation with Him through 
obedience to the truths of the Word, 2001, 5486, 7010.

88

22. This appears from the signification of the second ram as denoting Divine Truth proceeding 

from Divine Good in the heavens, in order that truth may act from good, 10057; and of Aaron 
and his sons laying their hands upon the head of the ram, as denoting the influx of Divine 
Good and Divine Truth with power, 10058.

23. By the slaying of the ram is denoted preparation, in this case, for the performance of uses from
the consecrated soul, or from the fullness of Divine Truth in its power, because the second ram
was called the ram of consecration, or of the filling of the hand, 10059, 10060; by the blood is 
denoted the Divine Truth proceeding from the Divine Good of the Lord in the heavens, 10060;

intelligence in the spiritual degree, 10062; and by its being put on the great toe of his right foot
is denoted intelligence in the ultimate or natural degree of him who is in the course of 
regeneration, or in the celestial heavens, 10063.

24. This is demonstrated from the signification of Aaron's sons as denoting those in the inferior 
heavens, 9946, 10099; from what is said in the previous verse; and from the sprinkling the 
blood on the altar round about as denoting the conjunction of good and truth in worship in 
every mode and degree, 10047.

25. The fat denotes all celestial, spiritual good, 10033; the fat tail denotes the good of truth, or 

exterior good, 10071; the fat of the inwards denotes external good, 10030; the long lobe upon

inmost celestial good, 10077; one cake of oiled bread denotes all interior celestial good, 
10078; one wafer denotes all ultimate celestial good, 10079; and their being placed upon the 
fat and the right thigh denotes that these things are from the Divine Good through the heavenly
marriage, 10033, 10075.

27. Putting the whole upon the hands of Aaron, and upon the hands of his sons denotes 

acknowledgement in the heavens that those things are of the Lord, and thus that they are 
communicated from Him, 10082; and their being waved as a wave offering before the Lord 
denotes vivification from the Lord, 10083.

28. Here by Moses is denoted Divine Truth, 7010; burning all upon the altar of burnt offering 

denotes consecration to the Lord in the worship of a good life, 10052; a consecration to the 
Lord for a sweet savour, or an odour of rest, denotes a state of joy and peace, 10054; and an 
offering made by fire to the Lord denotes the worship of the Lord from pure love, 10055.

29. Moses taking the breast and waving it for a wave offering before the Lord denotes that all in 
Divine Truths in the spiritual heavens live the active life of charity from the Lord, 10087, 
10089, 10090; Moses' portion of the ram of consecration, or fillings of the hand, denotes that 
charity is the essential of the spiritual man, and the spiritual heavens, because Moses denotes 
those in the heavens who are in Divine Truths, 10090; the breast denotes charity, 10087, and 
the ram of fillings denotes the state of the fully regenerated spiritual man in its activity and 

89

power, 10057; and as the Lord commanded Moses, denotes by influx from the Lord into 
Divine Truth, 7010, 5486, 2001.

30. By Moses is denoted Divine Truth, 7010; by Aaron and his garments are represented Divine 
Good and Divine Truth in the superior heavens, 10067; by his sons and their garments are 
denoted Divine Good and Divine Truth in the inferior heavens, 10068; by sprinkling is 
denoted conjunction, 10067; by the blood and the oil both being used together, the one 
representing Divine Truth and the other Divine Good, is denoted reciprocal conjunction, 
10065, 10066, 10067; and thus there is sanctification as to celestial good and truth and as to 
spiritual good and truth, 10069.

31. Here, saying denotes perception, 1791, 1822; Moses denotes Divine Truth, 7010; Aaron and 

his sons denote the celestial and spiritual man, because they denote good and truth 
respectively, 9946; boiling the flesh at the door of the tent of meeting, or in the holy place, 
denotes preparation for appropriation of good by the acknowledgement of the Lord and His 
influence through the heavens, 10105, 2356, 35403; eating denotes appropriation, 2187; the 
flesh denotes spiritual good and the bread celestial good, 10106, 10107; the basket denotes the
receptacle, or the external Sensual, 10107; Aaron and his sons having it denotes appropriation 
with the celestial and spiritual man, 9946; and as I commanded denotes according to Divine 
Order, 7010, 5486, 10119.

32. That which remains of the flesh and the bread being burnt with fire denotes that all good 

which is not appropriated from the Lord is of self-love and must be rejected and dissipated, 
10114, 10115.

33. Not going out from the door of the tent of meeting seven days until the days of consecration be
fulfilled, denotes that the glorification of the Lord and the regeneration of man must be full 
and complete in every respect, 2356, 35403, 10102, 10103; and for he shall consecrate you 
seven days, denotes that the regenerated man shall enjoy the heavenly state to eternity, 10360.

34. As has been done this day so the Lord has commanded to do, to make atonement for you, 

denotes that every state of regeneration is a representation of the whole process in an image, 
because the same ceremonies of consecration were performed on each day of the seven, and 
the number seven denotes "an entire period from beginning to end greater or less," 10127, 
1040.

35. The door of the tent of meeting denotes the acknowledgement of the Lord and of His operation
through the heavens, 2356, 35403; abiding there day and night seven days denotes full and 
complete and therefore perpetual acknowledgement, 10102, 10103; day and night denotes in 
every state of brightness and of obscurity, 936; keeping the charge of the Lord evidently 
denotes fulfilling the law of the Lord, 9149; not dying denotes deliverance from spiritual 
death, 81; and "so I have commanded," denotes co-operation with the Lord, because it denotes
acting according to influx from consent and not from compulsion, which is truly to keep the 
charge or commandments of the Lord, 6105.

36. Aaron and his sons doing all the things which the Lord commanded by the hand of Moses, 

denotes that thus the Lord is glorified and thus man is regenerated, namely by influx and co-
operation through correspondence, 5486, 6105.

Discussion

As this whole chapter is, generally speaking, similar, in the series of the internal sense, to Exodus xxix.,
of course the exposition given is similar, both chapters describing the glorification of the Lord and the 
regeneration of man. But still there are some differences as to particulars, which may be noticed as we 
proceed.

Observe, therefore, that each chapter commences with an introduction or preface, that in Exodus 
covering the first three verses, and that in Leviticus the first five. Also in both prefaces the general truth
is involved that the Lord was glorified, and that man is regenerated by the operation of the Lord 
through interior things, and the co-operation of man in externals, the former being represented by the 
bullock, the two rams and the unleavened bread, and the latter by the basket. Thirdly, we see that, in 
both cases, the things offered in sacrifice denote the higher affections of man received from the Lord, 
and named according to the order of regeneration as it appears to man, from externals to internals, and 
that the whole congregation assembled at the door of the tent of meeting represent the lower affections 
of man united in acknowledgement of the Lord, in the first instance, as the beginning of the way to the 
heavenly life. And lastly, we may notice that Aaron and his sons sustain the double representation of 
Divine Good and Divine Truth proceeding immediately from the Lord, and of the man of the church as 
receptive of those principles; while the doing of the Lord's will is in both prefaces emphasized, as the 
grand means of ascending from the lower life to the higher, or of expressing the higher life in the lower,
this obedience being mentioned first in Exodus and last in Leviticus, the differences in arrangement 
being due to the fact that it is first as a means leading to love, and last as the effect of a state of love.

Coming now to the particulars, we learn from each of these chapters that purification from evil and 
error is the first work both in the glorification of the Lord and in the regeneration of man, this being 
denoted by the washing of Aaron and his sons. The Lord, however, had no evil of His own from which 
He needed to be cleansed, but only tendencies to evil from the maternal life, and hence the washing, in 
His case, denotes the entire removal of those tendencies, and of that maternal life, the final 
consequence being that the very Divine Life itself descended into the ultimate plane of the Body, which
could not "see corruption" as man's body does, because of its Divine origin and formation; for 
substance which, in the first place, is produced by the Divine Being, and in the second is formed or 
organized by His life is, on these accounts, imperishable. And these considerations will enable us to 
see, in some respects, the character, so to speak, of what is Divine substantial, as distinguished from 
what is material (Doct. of the Lord, 35). But man, on the other hand, has actual evil, as well as 
hereditary tendencies to evil from both his parents, and therefore from these he requires to be 
continually purified by the application of the external truths of the Word, to which water corresponds, 
before he can become fully receptive of the heavenly life. Every one, indeed, must first "cease to do 
evil" before he can truly or perfectly "learn to do well." And let it be here noted also, that in man's case 
evil and error are not actually abolished, but remain with him to eternity, 868, the effect of sincere 
repentance being, not the absolute destruction of evil, but its removal so as no longer to appear.

But the effect of the removal of evil by repentance, we next learn, is the reception and 
acknowledgement and love of heavenly truths from the Lord, through the Word, and these are 
represented by the garments of Aaron and his sons, which require some attention; for in respect to them
the account in Leviticus varies from that in Exodus; and as no statement of the literal sense of the Word
is without a definite purpose with regard to the internal sense, it is legitimate to look for the 
signification of these variations. It is, we believe, grounded in the circumstance that, while the chapter 
in Exodus describes the glorification of the Lord and the regeneration of man in reference to those 

91

under instruction, or in a state of truth leading to good, that in Leviticus describes it in reference more 
particularly to those who are in the act of being inaugurated into the state of good. And because of this 
we find that especially in regard to the naming of the garments, or spiritually, in regard to the 
arrangement of truths, the account in Leviticus is, respectively, more precise and full than that in 
Exodus. For example, in Leviticus we have, in regular order, the coat with the girdle thereof, the robe, 
the ephod, and the girdle of the ephod, followed by the breastplate, the Urim and Thummim, the mitre 
and the golden plate; but in Exodus the order is, the coat, the robe, the ephod, the breastplate and the 
girdle of the ephod, followed by the mitre and the holy crown. Why, then, is the inner girdle omitted; 
and why is the breastplate here named before the girdle of the ephod, and not after it? Now the inner 
girdle denotes the inmost bond of love in the spiritual kingdom, 9945, and the girdle of the ephod 
denotes the external bond of love there, 9895, and therefore the omission of the inner girdle, while yet 
the outer girdle is mentioned, indicates that the spiritual man, in his early experiences, is more under 
the influence of external affections and less under the influence of things internal; and the naming of 
both girdles in their proper order in Leviticus, indicates that, in his more advanced state, he is more led 
by internal bonds than by external, because then the internal rules more completely. And with regard to 
the breastplate, which denotes Divine Truth shining forth from Divine Good, whereas the girdle 
denotes the common bond of love, it is named first in Exodus, to denote that in early stages of 
regeneration truth is the leading principle, and second in Leviticus to denote that, later, love is the 
ruling power. For truly it is love, and especially love as expressed in ultimates, or in the actions, which 
unites and binds together good and truth from the lowest degree of the life even to the highest. And 
indeed when love rules, another effect follows, namely, that the revelation of truth also is more 
resplendent; and this explains why the Urim and Thummim are particularly mentioned in Leviticus but 
omitted in Exodus. But in both the chapters under consideration the mitre and the golden plate are last 
mentioned, and denote respectively Divine Wisdom and intelligence, and enlightenment from the 
Divine Human. And it is said, ''according to the influx of Divine Good into Divine Truth," because, in 
our chapter, the golden plate is also called the holy crown, whereas in the parallel passage in Exodus, it 
is only called the holy crown, showing that the enlightenment is not so great during the state of 
instruction in truth leading to good as in the state of actual inauguration into good. We may notice also 
that, in the Hebrew, and according to the correspondence of each word, the expression "plate of gold" 
indicates truth derived from good, and the expression "crown of holiness," good derived from truth, the
former, therefore, being peculiar to the more perfect state of good, and the latter to the less perfect state
of instruction; while the use of the two expressions combined, as in our chapter, will indicate, 
appropriately, the conjunction of truth with good in fullness. But lastly, it is remarkable that in the 
exposition of the internal sense, in series, in Exodus, there is what appears to be a singular omission. 
For after quoting verses 4-9 of the chapter according to his method, quite correctly, the author proceeds
to give the spiritual meaning of each sentence, but does not give the meaning of the last sentence of 
verse 5, namely, "and you shall gird him with the girdle of the ephod," which signifies, according to 
9837, the "general bond, by which interior things are held together in connection"; and "an outward 
bond, because the ephod signifies the External of the spiritual kingdom." Now why is this omission 
made, both in giving the internal sense in series, 9999, and in giving the proof and explanation of the 
meaning of each term, 10006, 10007, when yet, since the sentence, under consideration occurs, in the 
literal sense, at the end of verse 5, it must cohere, in its spiritual sense, with what precedes, and with 
what follows? For there can be nothing superfluous, and nothing wanting, in the literal sense of the 
Word. What, then, is the explanation? It is that in speaking of the ephod in 10006, the girdle of the 
ephod is evidently included, as will appear from a careful perusal of 9824, which is given as a 
reference; besides which, the mention of the girdle of "Aaron and his sons" again in verse 9, may also 
have contributed to the omission of a particular exposition of the last sentence of verse 5. Moreover, the

92

last period of 9824, to which number the author refers in 10006, clearly shows that the omission could 
not have been inadvertent, since it is this last sentence of Exodus 29:5, and Leviticus 8:7 which is 
mentioned to show the derivation of the Hebrew word for ephod from an expression, meaning 
"enclosing all interior things." Thus, the girdle being considered in this case as a part of the ephod, its 
internal sense is involved in what is said of the ephod.

Continuing now our comparison of the different sections of these two chapters, we next observe that 
the anointing is much more fully described in Leviticus than in Exodus; and that the reason of this is 
because the inauguration into the state of good involves the sanctification of every degree of the life 
from the highest to the lowest, this indeed being signified in Exodus by anointing the head of Aaron, 
expressing the great truth in the highest sense, that the Human of the Lord was from His conception 
and birth, essentially, wholly Divine in all its degrees, but that, as described in Leviticus, it only 
became actually and fully Divine by the process of glorification, involving the conjunction of good 
with truth in successive order, as denoted by anointing the tabernacle and all that was therein, the altar 
and all its vessels, and the laver and its base; and in simultaneous order by pouring of the anointing oil 
on Aaron's head to sanctify him. See also a variation of the description of the same process in 10250.

But noting, in passing, the distinction between the signification of the garments of Aaron himself and 
the garments of his sons, as signifying the Divine Spiritual proceeding from the celestial, and spiritual 
truths in a lower degree, respectively, we come to the consideration of the sacrifices. And here we 
observe that the purification of the natural man is described in similar order in both chapters by the 
sacrifice of the bullock and the various circumstances attending it; and that the same remark is 
applicable to the purification of the internal man denoted by the first ram as a burnt offering. Hence, 
then, there is no necessity to dwell upon the particulars. But the offering of the second ram demands 
more attention; and first it may appear strange that two rams were offered; for the ram in both cases 
will have the same general correspondence. It was because two distinct states of man were to be 
represented, namely, by the first ram the state of truth leading to good, and by the second the state of 
truth proceeding from good; or, in other words, the life of man in the course of regeneration, and his 
life in consequence of regeneration, when he is inaugurated into the state of acting from good by means
of truth. Hence this second ram is called the ram of fillings, of the filling of the hand, or the ram of 
consecration. And here, indeed, an important thought is worth mentioning. It is not sufficient in order to
understand and interpret the spiritual sense of the Word correctly, simply to know the correspondence 
and signification of each term in the literal sense, or even to have a tolerably clear perception of 
spiritual things in general. For there appear to be some particular instances in which a higher 
inspiration is necessary. And this is manifest in the case before us. Unless the Writings had pointed out 
the distinction of which we are speaking, indeed, or unless the general expositor continually receives 
help from the Lord enlightening him, and in some special cases, unless revelation were given, by 
inspiration which is not perceived because it is influx, internally, it would seem impossible to discern 
the hidden meaning of a passage. Hence some persons have imagined that no one but a person specially
appointed by the Lord, as Swedenborg was (TCR 779), ought to presume to interpret, in series, whole 
books of the Word according to the internal sense; but experience has proved the contrary; and, truly, 
there is no reason why an ordinary student of the Word should not be privileged to do this in the 
ordinary way by devout and careful study, and in humble dependence upon the Lord, Who, we are 
assured, teaches every one by the Word. No doubt, however, that when a distinction like that of which 
the series here treats is made known it can be seen how all the particulars combine to confirm the truth. 
Thus in verse 23 we have described the second general effect of action from good, namely, the 
perception of truths, and a more powerful operation of truths in ultimates for the performance of uses. 

93

We say here "of him who is in the course of regeneration, as well as of one who is in the celestial or 
spiritual heavens," because the former certainly do occasionally enjoy a foretaste of the delight of 
acting from good, or of the delight of doing good without any admixture of selfish motives. And then 
we see in the following verses as far as to the end of verse 29, how the full realization of the delight of 
good is described, its full acknowledgement and reception from the Lord by the celestial man, and its 
acknowledgement and increased activity with the spiritual man, these things being denoted by the 
heave thigh and the wave breast respectively, with the rest of the things named in those verses, which 
were wholly consecrated to the Lord.

We now come to a point which is especially interesting. In verse 30 of our chapter is described the 
reciprocal union of Divine Truth with Divine Good in the Divine Human, in the superior heavens, and 
in the inferior heavens; and consequently this verse also describes the reciprocal conjunction of truth 
with good with the man who is being regenerated, to whatever heaven he may belong. As far as the 
Lord was concerned the Divine united itself to the Human, and the Human united itself to the Divine 
mutually and reciprocally; and this the Lord, in the world, effected by His own proper power because 
the Divine was in Him and constituted His very soul or life, 2004. But so far as man is concerned this 
reciprocal union is called conjunction to distinguish it, because man has no life in himself as the Lord 
had; and therefore, when it is said, as it sometimes may be, that man conjoins himself with the Lord, 
which is the outward appearance, 20042 at the end, thereby must be understood, that the Lord, by 
means of sciences, knowledges, and truths, conjoins man to Himself, or, in other words, good conjoins 
truth with itself, and truth is conjoined with good reciprocally in the man who is being regenerated. The
knowledge of this mystery, however, need cause no one to hang down his hands and wait idly for the 
Divine operation. Every man must still act as of himself in accepting truths and in shunning evils; for 
only under these conditions can the Lord effect the conjunction of truth with good in him mutually and 
reciprocally, as is described, in the verse under consideration, by Moses taking both the blood and the 
oil and sprinkling them upon Aaron and his garments, and upon his sons and their garments. But now it
may be asked, "When does this reciprocal conjunction-commence with man?" And a careful perusal of 
6047 will, we think, show that it begins as soon as man, from his own consciousness, affirms truth in 
general, and from that affirmation decides for himself concerning truths in particular, and thence begins
to lead a new life. Hence, therefore, we need not be surprised to find that, in our chapter, as compared 
with that in Exodus, which we have been studying along with it, the reciprocal conjunction holds a 
different position. For it is perpetual with the regenerating man; but all the same it will vary in its 
character as regeneration proceeds, and this, we think, may be one reason why the account of it is 
placed before the offering of the second ram in Exodus, and after it in Leviticus. At any rate there are 
reasons for this, grounded in the internal sense; and the explanation given so fully in 10067, where this 
reciprocal conjunction is declared to be perpetual with man, strongly tends to confirm the thought that 
the Lord conjoins truth with good in man exactly in proportion as man, as of himself, willingly abstains
from his evils and errors. This tends to prove then, that reciprocal conjunction, as described in Exod 
29:21, is inferior in fullness and perfection to that described (Levit 8:30).

But the rest of this chapter, which speaks of the appropriation of good by man as a natural result of the 
reciprocal conjunction on which we have just reflected, need not detain us, except to remark that this 
appropriation is the crowning act, so to describe it, of the regenerate life, as well as the continual 
experience of the angels, as denoted by the seven days of the consecration; and to point out that the 
injunction to "keep the charge of the Lord that you die not," in verse 35, involves the same general truth
as the injunction in Exodus, ver. 36, to offer a bullock for a sin offering on every one of the seven days 
of the propitiation, namely, the continual purification of man in heaven and the church even to eternity.

Leviticus Chapter 9

Summary of the Spiritual Sense

1. Instruction to him who is in the new state of good that he should be prepared to worship the 
Lord from various affections, natural, spiritual and celestial, in order that the Divine may be 
manifested in the Human, vers. 1-4. 

2. Obedience for this purpose as to the understanding and as to the will with further perception, as 

to action, vers. 5-6. 

3. Worship accordingly in due order and sequence, vers. 7-21. 
4. The effect, namely, closer conjunction with the Lord; full reciprocal conjunction on the part of 
man; the manifestation of the Divine Love in all fullness even to ultimates, and consequently 
full revelation, producing a state of profound humility, vers. 22-24. 

The Contents of each Verse

1. And it came to pass on the eighth 

1.

day, that Moses called Aaron and his 
sons, and the elders of Israel; 

It happens also in the new state, when man is in 
good, that Divine Truth from the Lord operates 
upon him as to his celestial, spiritual, and natural 
degrees.

2. And he said to Aaron, Take you a 

bull calf for a sin offering, and a ram
for a burnt offering, without blemish,
and offer them before the LORD. 

2. And then it is perceived from celestial good, that 
the Lord is to be worshiped from the good of 
innocence in the natural man, conjoined with truth,
in acknowledgement that man of himself is 
nothing but evil; and from the pure good of 
innocence in the internal or spiritual man, in 
acknowledgement that all good is from the Lord.

3. And to the children of Israel you 

3. Also instruction is given to the spiritual-natural 

shall speak, saying, Take you a he-
goat for a sin offering; and a calf and
a lamb, both of the first year, without
blemish, for a burnt offering; 

man, through which it is perceived, that the Lord is
to be worshiped from the truth of faith conjoined 
with good, in acknowledgement that man of 
himself is nothing but evil, and from the good of 
innocence in all fullness and purity both in the 
External and Internal, in acknowledgement that all 
good is from the Lord;

4. And an ox and a ram for peace 
offerings, to sacrifice before the 
LORD; and a meal offering mingled 
with oil: for today the LORD appears 
to you. 

4. And that there is also to be the worship of the Lord
from a state of external peace as to natural good 
and as to spiritual good; and through the 
conjunction of spiritual good with celestial good, 
because in the new state the Lord is to be 
manifested;

95

5. And they brought that which Moses 
commanded before the tent of 
meeting: and all the congregation 
drew near and stood before the 
LORD. 

5. And that this actually takes place when man 

acknowledges the Lord and His operation through 
heaven, according to Divine influx; and thus all 
the subordinate powers of the regenerated man are 
united.

6. And Moses said, This is the thing 
which the LORD commanded that 
you should do: and the glory of the 
LORD shall appear to you. 

6. And still more, definite perception is given, 
through Divine Truth, that such worship is 
acceptable to the Lord, and that through it the Lord
is to be manifested.

7. And Moses said to Aaron, Draw near
to the altar, and offer your sin 
offering, and your burnt offering, 
and make atonement for yourself, 
and for the people: and offer the 
oblation of the people, and make 
atonement for them; as the LORD 
commanded. 

8. So Aaron drew near to the altar, and 
slew the calf of the sin offering, 
which was for himself. 

9. And the sons of Aaron presented the 
blood to him: and he dipped his 
finger in the blood, and put it upon 
the horns of the altar, and poured out
the blood at the base of the altar: 

10. But the fat, and the kidneys, and the 
long lobe from the liver of the sin 
offering, he burnt upon the altar; as 
the LORD commanded Moses. 

7. And hence there is perception, with those who are 
in celestial good, that the Lord is to be approached;
while at the same time there is the 
acknowledgement that man is unworthy because of
himself he is nothing but evil, and that all good is 
from the Lord; in order, with regard to the Lord, 
that the Human may be acknowledged as one with 
the Divine, and with regard to man, that 
reconciliation may be established with the Lord, 
through the remission of evil, both as to the will 
and understanding, or as to the internal and 
external man, according to Divine influx.

8. And thus those who are in celestial good approach 
the Lord, by preparing to worship Him from the 
good of innocence in the natural man; and by the 
acknowledgement that of themselves they are only
evil.

9. While those who are in charity acknowledge that 

Divine Truth is from the Lord through celestial 
love; and then by the power of truth from good, 
the conjunction of truth with good is confirmed in 
worship; and the natural man also thus receives the
influx of truth from good in the ultimate.

10. But all this good, and the truth conjoined 

therewith, both internal and external, are fully 
acknowledged to be from the Lord, and are 
devoted to His service, according to the influx of 
good into truth in worship.

11. And the flesh and the skin he burnt 

11. And everything evil and false in the natural 

with fire without the camp. 

affections and powers, is separated and conjoined 
with self-love, with those not in the realization of 
the heavenly life.

96

12. And he slew the burnt offering; and 
Aaron's sons delivered to him the 
blood, and he sprinkled it upon the 
altar round about. 

13. And they delivered the burnt 

offering to him, piece by piece, and 
the head: and he burnt them upon the
altar. 

14. And he washed the inwards and the 
legs, and burnt them upon the burnt 
offering on the altar. 

12. Also those who are in celestial good prepare to 
worship the Lord from that good, by the 
acknowledgement that all good is from Him; and 
those in charity acknowledge that spiritual truth is 
from Him through celestial love; and thus the 
conjunction of truth with good is confirmed and 
established in every mode and degree.

13. And by Divine Truth a distinct arrangement of 
goods and truths is effected from ultimates to 
inmost things; and all is fully devoted to the Lord 
by the acknowledgement that all good is from 
Him.

14. But lowest good which is sensual and corporeal, 

and exterior good which is natural, are purified by 
the acknowledgement from the heart that they are 
from the Lord; and therefore they are ascribed to 
Him, and are devoted to His service.

15. And he presented the people's 

15. Also through celestial good in the inmost those

offering which was for the people, 
and slew it, and offered it for sin, as 
the first. 

who are in the truth of faith worship the Lord from
the good of innocence which belongs to them, by 
preparing themselves and acknowledging that of 
themselves they are nothing but evil as in the 
former case.

16. And he presented the burnt offering, 
and offered it according to the 
ordinance. 

16. And they are wholly devoted to the Lord by the 
acknowledgement that all good is from Him, 
according to Divine Order.

17. And he presented the meal offering, 
and filled his hand therefrom, and 
burnt it upon the altar, besides the 
burnt offering of the morning. 

17. Also through celestial good the Lord is worshiped 
from the conjunction of spiritual good with 
celestial good; and this is done with all fullness 
and power; and such conjunction is acknowledged 
to be from the Lord in worship, in addition to the 
worship of the Lord, from celestial good and from 
spiritual good distinctly, in the new heavenly state.

18. He slew also the ox and the ram, the 

18. Also through celestial love the Lord is worshiped 

sacrifice of peace offerings, which 
was for the people: and Aaron's sons 
delivered to him the blood, and he 
sprinkled it upon the altar round 
about, 

in a state of peace and freedom as to the natural 
and spiritual degrees; those who are in spiritual 
truth acknowledging that it is from the Lord 
through celestial good; and thus the conjunction of
truth with good in this worship is effected and 
established.

97

19. And the fat of the ox; and of the ram,
the fat tail, and that which covers the
inwards, and the kidneys, and the 
long lobe of the liver: 

19. And all the good of the natural man and of the 
spiritual man; all exterior and external natural 
good; all interior natural truths; and all interior 
natural good;

20. And they put the fat upon the

breasts, and he burnt the fat upon the
altar: 

21. And the breasts and the right thigh 

Aaron waved for a wave offering 
before the LORD; as Moses 
commanded. 

22. And Aaron lifted up his hands 

toward the people, and blessed them;
and he came down from offering the 
sin offering, and the burnt offering, 
and the peace offerings. 

devoted to the Lord from pure love.

21. But all holy charity, and all things relating to the 
heavenly marriage, thus all good together, is 
acknowledged by the celestial man to be from the 
Lord, and is vivified by Him according to influx 
and co-operation.

22. And thus with Divine Power is the conjunction of 
the internal man with the external effected; and 
still the latter enjoys life in heaven as if it were his 
own, even preservation to eternity from all evil; 
the power to worship the Lord from good; and a 
state of perfect peace and rest.

23. And Moses and Aaron went into the 

tent of meeting, and came out, and 
blessed the people: and the glory of 
the LORD appeared to all the people. 

23. And thus Divine Truth and Divine Good proceed 
from the Lord through the heavens; thus there is 
reciprocal conjunction of the external man with the
internal; and thus the Lord is manifested.

24. And there came forth fire from 
before the LORD, and consumed 
upon the altar the burnt offering and 
the fat: and when all the people saw 
it, they shouted, and fell on their 
faces.

man, 10031; burning upon the altar denotes full acknowledgement that all good is from the 
Lord, and that it is to be devoted to His service, 10053, 10055; and as the Lord commanded 
Moses denotes according to the influx of good into truth in worship, 2001, 5486, 7010.

11. Burning the flesh and the skin with fire without the camp denotes that everything evil and 
false in the natural affections and powers is separated and conjoined with selfish love, with 
those not in the realization of the heavenly life, 1003510036, 10038.

12. Aaron denotes those in celestial good, 9946; slaying the burnt offering denotes preparation to 
worship the Lord from that good, 10024; the burnt offering denotes the acknowledgement that 
all good is from the Lord, 10053, 10055; Aaron's sons delivering to him the blood denotes that
those in charity acknowledge that spiritual truth is from the Lord through celestial love, 9946, 
10047; sprinkling the blood upon the altar round about denotes the confirmation of the 
conjunction of truth with good in every mode and degree, 10047. 

13. Delivering the burnt offering to Aaron piece by piece, and the head, denotes that by Divine 

Truth a distinct arrangement of goods and truths is effected, from ultimates to inmost things, 
because the sons of Aaron denote Divine Truth, 9946; the pieces, including the head, denote 
what is from ultimates to inmost things, 10049-51, and cutting in pieces denotes a distinct 
arrangement, 10048; and burning upon the altar denotes that all is fully devoted to the Lord by
the acknowledgement that all good is from Him, 10053, 10055.

14. Washing the inwards and the legs, and burning them upon the burnt offering on the altar, 

denotes that lowest good which is sensual and corporeal, and exterior good which is natural, 
are purified by the acknowledgement from the heart that they are from the Lord; and therefore 
they are ascribed to Him, and are devoted to his service, 10049-51, 10055.

15. Aaron denotes celestial good in the inmost, 9946; the goat, the oblation of the people, denotes 
those who are in the truth of faith, 4169, 725; slaying it denotes preparation, 10024; offering it 
for sin denotes worship involving the acknowledgement that of themselves they are nothing 
but evil, 3400, 10042; and as at the first evidently denotes as in the former case.

16. Presenting the burnt offering and offering it according to the ordinance denotes that those who
are in the good of faith are wholly devoted to the Lord by the acknowledgement that all good 
is from Him according to Divine Order, 10055, 7995.

17. Aaron denotes celestial good, 9946; the meal offering denotes worship from the conjunction of

spiritual good with celestial good, 2177; filling the hand denotes with all fullness and power, 
10019; burning it upon the altar denotes that such conjunction is acknowledged to be from the 
Lord in worship, 10053, 10055 5 and besides, the burnt offering of the morning denotes in 
addition to the worship of the Lord from celestial good and from spiritual good distinctly in 
the new heavenly state, 10134, 10136, 9299.

18. Aaron denotes celestial love, 9946; slaying the ox and the ram denotes preparation to worship 
as to the natural and spiritual degrees, 10024, 2180, 10042; peace offerings denote worship 
from freedom, 10097; Aaron's sons denote those who are in spiritual truth, 9946; presenting 
the blood to Aaron denotes the acknowledgement that it is from the Lord through celestial 

100

good, 9293, 9946, 10047; and sprinkling the blood on the altar round about denotes the 
conjunction of good with truth in this worship effected and established, 10047.

19. The fat of the ox and the ram denotes all the good of the natural man and the spiritual man, 
10033, 2180, 10042; the fat tail, and that which covers the inwards, denote all exterior and 
external natural good, 10071, 10029, 10030; the kidneys denote all interior natural truths, 
10032; and the long lobe upon the liver denotes all interior natural good, 10031.

20. The fat put upon the breasts denotes the conjunction of celestial good with the good of charity,
10033, 10087; and burning upon the altar denotes devotion to the Lord from pure love, 10053,
10055..

21. Here the breast denotes all holy charity, 10087; the thigh denotes all things relating to the 

heavenly marriage, thus all good together, 10075; Aaron waving them denotes 
acknowledgement by the celestial man that all good is from the Lord, 9946; and their being 
waved denotes vivification by Him, 10089.

22. Aaron lifting up his hands toward the people and blessing them denotes that, with Divine 

Power, the conjunction of the internal man with the external is effected, 5328, 3514; and his 
coming down from offering the sin offering and the burnt offerings and the peace offerings 
denotes that still the external man enjoys life in heaven as if it were his own, 6451, 4964, 
4969; while the sin offering, the burnt offerings and the peace offerings denote respectively 
preservation to eternity from all evil, 3400, the power to worship the Lord from good, 10053, 
and a state of perfect peace and rest, 10097, 10054.

23. Moses and Aaron going into the tent of meeting and coming out denotes that thus Divine Truth
and Divine Good proceed from the Lord through the heavens, 7010, 9946, 35403, 9927; Moses
and Aaron both blessing the people denotes reciprocal conjunction as to the external man with 
the internal, as is evident from the signification of the two, 3514; and the glory of the Lord 
appearing evidently denotes that thus the Lord is manifested, 8427.

24. Fire coming forth from before the Lord denotes the descent of Divine Love, 934, 6499; 

consuming or devouring denotes full conjunction, when no injury is done by the influx, 6834, 
10533, 2187, 5149; the burnt offering and the fat denote the mind and heart of the regenerated 
man filled with good and its delight, 10053, 10055, 10033; the people seeing it denotes clear 
revelation from the Lord, 2150; and shouting and falling on their faces denote a state of 
profound humility, 8815, 19991.

Discussion

In this chapter we have an interesting description of the initiatory heavenly state, signified by the eighth
day. And it will, therefore, be profitable for us to reflect upon this first realization of good which 
constitutes that state. But it is difficult, naturally, for every one who-is only passing through 

101

regeneration to conceive what a state can be which he has never experienced. Still, however, some 
conception may be formed of it from considering what it is not. And first of all we are assured from all 
we have learned in the Word that man then? no longer suffers temptation, because he has no longer a 
divided mind. For his outward man is now not only in subjection to his inward man, but is in harmony 
with it, and there is a state of peace and rest which is properly denoted in this account by the peace 
offering. 

Again, we are well instructed from the Word also that in heaven there is no night. There are, indeed, 
changes of state with all variety, corresponding to the changes of the day from morning to evening; but 
there is no night, neither is there any winter in heaven. On the contrary, there is an increase of spiritual 
light and heat, for our chapter teaches us that then the Lord is manifested. 

How delightful, then, must this new state be only in consequence of its freedom from positive evil and 
error, and how we do long for the time to come when we shall enter into it! 

But let us take the description in its order, and then we shall clearly see other important things. That 
there should be the worship of the Lord, denoted by the burnt offerings and sacrifices, does not surprise
us. For the permanent state of good is the perpetual worship of Him in a life of usefulness; but in this 
worship the very remarkable thing we notice is that there is first the sin offering which precedes. Now 
why is this, when people do not sin in heaven? It is because, although they do not sin, they still 
acknowledge that of themselves they are nothing but evil; and, indeed, we are told that without such 
acknowledgement no one can be in heaven, 868. And, therefore, even in heaven this necessarily comes 
first. But no one can truly worship except from good, and except there be innocence conjoined with 
truth, and this is denoted by the calf, because it is the good of innocence in the natural degree, now 
made harmonious with the higher degrees; besides which, we observe that the essence of this worship 
is good, since the fat only was burnt upon the altar, while the flesh and the skin were burnt with fire 
without the camp, to denote that all evil and falsity are rejected in this heavenly worship.

But the fully regenerated celestial man in heaven worships the Lord also from celestial love itself, that 
is, he worships the Lord for the sake of the Lord, and acknowledges in that worship that all good is 
from Him. We see, therefore, in this account what it is that constitutes heaven with the celestial man, 
and also, from another point of view, with the internal man generally. It is the love of the Lord, 
signified by Aaron's burnt offering and sin offering, and thus the good of innocence externally and 
internally. It is the good of innocence, indeed, but it is from wisdom, and not from ignorance.

And next, in reflecting upon this inspired description, we consider the state of the spiritual-natural man,
as well as that of the celestial; and we find that their states correspond, although they are not identical, 
the difference being denoted by the animals offered; for the sin offering is a goat, and the burnt offering
a calf and a lamb. Now notice that the external good of innocence of the celestial man is identical with 
what is the interior with the spiritual-natural man, thus indicating the way in which the two degrees are 
connected by overlapping; and then it is not a little remarkable that whereas the celestial have a ram for
a burnt offering, the spiritual man has not only this calf, but a lamb as well. And yet the lamb 
corresponds properly to the innocence of the celestial, and the ram to the innocence of the Spiritual. 
How do we reconcile this apparent inconsistency? By discerning that the inmost good of the celestial 
man is involved and expressed in his spiritual degree; thus the "ram" involves and expresses the 
"lamb"; and also that the good of the spiritual-natural man involves the good of the celestial, but does 
not express it; and thus, in this case, the thing involved is mentioned. That is, the "calf" involves the 
"lamb," but is not its proper external, because the "ram" is this.

102

But now we find another difference between the celestial man and the spiritual-natural man, for the 
former offers no meal offering, and no peace offering. It is because those that are offered by the 
spiritual-natural man involve in their signification the unity of all the heavens and of the whole man 
regenerated. But in giving instruction the meal offering is after the peace offering, while in performing 
the ceremony it follows the burnt offering. This is because in the state of instruction the uniting 
medium between the Internal and External is not as yet applied; but when experience comes it takes its 
proper place; for what is signified by the meal offering is, in the case of the Lord's glorification, a 
uniting medium, as appears from the respective significations of the meal and the oil; and in the case of
man it is a conjoining medium. We see, therefore, from these things mentioned in this brief review how
particularly and exactly the literal sense of the Word is arranged to meet the requirements of the 
internal sense; and also other points in the description might have been enlarged upon. But the 
reflecting reader will be able to see some of these for himself, and we have yet to say a few words on 
the blessing of Aaron, and the blessing of Moses and Aaron together on coming out of the tent of 
meeting.

Now Aaron lifting up his hands and blessing the people clearly represents the Lord Himself conjoining 
the church and the individual member thereof with Himself when He is truly worshiped. But Moses 
and Aaron together going into the tent of meeting, coming out, and again blessing the people symbolize
appropriately the reciprocal conjunction of man with the Lord, because in this case the Lawgiver and 
the High Priest, as leaders, denote the whole church as to the reception of Divine Truth and Divine 
Good, and the blessing repeated denotes reciprocal conjunction.

And surely our last verse is a most appropriate text for an eloquent sermon on this whole chapter. In the
first place, we are here strongly reminded of the great sacrifice of Elijah on Mount Carmel. "There 
came forth fire from before the Lord." It is Divine Love that in reality is always proceeding from before
the Lord, and affecting every one in the universe. For Divine Love is Life from Him continually, and 
therefore no human being ever perishes to eternity. Divine Life cannot be the cause of spiritual death; 
and he who is simply capable, because he is a human being, of receiving that Divine Life, according to 
his state and his constitution as a human being, cannot perish (HH 39). And if we should dwell upon 
this fact, and consider that every human being is at last brought necessarily into order on his own plane 
of life, though he may be the worst of evil spirits, and for ever remains so (Matt 25:46, HH 480), yet is 
he brought into order and remains in a state of order, because life from the Lord is in him, although he 
cannot reciprocate the Lord's love which he receives.

But what shall we say of the angels who do reciprocate that love, and thence offer acceptable sacrifices 
to the Lord? The sacrifices are consumed in the best sense, that is, not in the sense of being destroyed, 
but of being grateful and acceptable to the Lord, because they are the evidences of reciprocal love.

"But when the people saw it, they shouted, and fell on their faces." So it always is in heaven. It is 
impossible there not to see the glory of the Lord, and impossible also not to be filled with humility. 
"Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God."

Leviticus Chapter 10

Summary of the Spiritual Sense

1. Those who are in doctrine without a good life profane their worship by the lusts of selfish love, 
and are consequently vastated; but the good are instructed that worship ought to be internal as 
well as external; that external worship merely ought to be removed; and that with them the two 
should not be separated, lest profanation occur, vers. 1-7. 

2. The celestial man is instructed that worship must be from good, and not from truth, that a 

distinction may be made between true worship and false, and that the celestial may flow in with 
the spiritual, in order that the latter may receive instruction in Divine Truths, vers. 8-11. 
3. Concerning the appropriation of good with the celestial and spiritual man, and how it is 

connected with perception on the part of the former and acknowledgement on the part of the 
latter that all life is from the Lord, vers. 12-15. 

4. Further instruction as to the non-appropriation of good in profane worship, in consequence of 

there being no conjunction with the Lord by the good of innocence, and therefore no 
deliverance from evil, vers. 16-20. 

The Contents of each Verse

and put fire therein, and laid incense 
thereon, and offered strange fire 
before the LORD, which he had not 
commanded them. 

doctrine of truth from the Word without the life 
thereof, although all doctrine which is true is from 
celestial good, contaminate their worship of the 
Lord with the lusts of evil and the persuasions of 
falsity, and thus they worship from self-love, 
which is contrary to Divine influx.

2. And there came forth fire from 
before the LORD, and devoured 
them, and they died before the 
LORD. 

2. And therefore the lusts of self-love, the torments 
from which the wicked attribute to the Lord, 
entirely consume them, and they are fully vastated 
as to all good and truth.

3. Then Moses said to Aaron, This is it 

3. And perception is given, by Divine Truth, to those 

that the LORD spoke, saying, I will 
be sanctified in them that come near 
me, and before all the people I will 
be glorified. And Aaron held his 
peace, 

who are in good, that what thus happens is 
according to the laws of order in relation to the 
wicked and to the good; and also that those who 
approach the Lord in worship ought to do so 
internally as well as externally, and this with 
regard to truths as well as good, or with regard to 
the man of the external church as well as the 
internal. And those in genuine good are 
acquiescent, and cannot defend perverted worship.

104

4. And Moses called Mishael and 
Elzaphan, the sons of Uzziel the 
uncle of Aaron, and said to them, 
Draw near, carry your brethren from 
before the sanctuary out of the camp.

4. But according to Divine Truth it is the office of 

ultimate truths and affections derived from charity 
in its most external form to remove all opposing 
hypocritical worship beyond the limits of genuine 
worship by a good life,

5. So they drew near, and carried them 
in their coats out of the camp; as 
Moses had said. 

5. And this actually happens, all impure worship with
its corrupted truths being removed accordingly.

6. And Moses said to Aaron, and to 

6. Also it is perceived by those who are in celestial 

Eleazar find to Ithamar, his sons, Let
not the hair of your heads go loose, 
neither rend your clothes; that you 
die not, and that you be not angry 
with all the congregation: but let 
your brethren, the whole house of 
Israel, bewail the burning which the 
LORD has kindled. 

and spiritual good and truth in the church, that the 
removal of profane worship, which outwardly 
appears holy, pr the removal of mere 
representative worship, ought not to cause 
mourning either inwardly or outwardly lest the 
separation of the External from the Internal should 
take place, and aversion from the Lord should 
follow; but nevertheless, those in the external 
church, are permitted to grieve on account of the 
loss, apparently, of true worship.

7. And you shall not go out from the

door of the tent of meeting, lest you 
die: for the anointing oil of the LORD
is upon you. And they did according 
to the word of Moses. 

be separated therefrom, for this would be spiritual 
death, and would cause intense profanation with 
such as had loved the truth and had conjoined it 
with good; and therefore it is of Divine 
Providence, through the laws of order, that such 
profanation should not occur.

8. And the LORD spoke to Aaron, 

8. Moreover, there is revelation, and thence 

saying, 

perception with the celestial man,

9. Drink no wine nor strong drink, you,
nor your sons with you, when you go
into the tent of meeting, that you die 
not: it shall be a statute for ever 
throughout your generations: 

9. That the worship of the Lord should not be from 

truths either spiritual or celestial, but entirely from 
good, because this also would cause spiritual death
with them; and that, therefore, this law of celestial 
worship must be eternally observed,

10. And that you may put difference 

between the holy and the common, 
and between the unclean and the 
clean; 

10. In order that not only a true distinction may be 
made between holy external worship conjoined 
with internal and that which is separated, but also 
between the celestial and spiritual heavens, the 
latter being respectively imperfect.

11. And that you may teach the children 
of Israel all the statutes which the 
LORD has spoken to them by the 
hand of Moses. 

11. And also, that the celestial heavens may flow into 
the spiritual with good and truth adapted to the 
state of the latter, which is worship from charity by
means of faith, and is relatively imperfect.

105

12. And Moses spoke to Aaron, and to 

Eleazar and to Ithamar, his sons that 
were left, Take the meal offering that
remains of the offerings of the LORD 
made by fire, and eat it without 
leaven beside the altar: for it is most 
holy: 

12. But it is according to the laws of Divine Order that
the celestial man should appropriate good from the
Lord in all the degrees of his life, which is the 
result of the worship of the Lord from pure love, 
because such worship and such good are inmost 
worship and good.

13. And you shall eat it in a holy place, 
because it is your due, and your sons'
due, of the offerings of the LORD 
made by fire: for so I am 
commanded. 

13. And good is appropriated in this holy state by both
the celestial and spiritual churches or heavens, 
because it properly belongs to them to worship 
from good and not from truth, this being the result 
of the Divine influx.

14. And the wave breast and the heave 
thigh shall you eat in a clean place; 
you, and your sons, and your 
daughters with you: for they are 
given as your due, and your sons' 
due, out of the sacrifices of the peace
offerings of the children of Israel. 

15. The heave thigh and the wave breast 
shall they bring with the offerings 
made by fire of the fat, to wave it for
a wave offering before the LORD: 
and it shall be your, and your sons' 
with you, as a due for ever; as the 
LORD has commanded. 

14. And by such influx, both the intellectual principle 
and the voluntary principle of the celestial man are
vivified, and good is appropriated without falsity 
and imperfection as to the thoughts and affections 
in externals; and these are the pure principles of 
man internally, even when his external worship 
from states of peace and freedom is comparatively 
imperfect, as is the case with the spiritual man.

15. For the vivification of the holy worship of the 
spiritual man is by means of charity and the 
conjunction between the spiritual and celestial 
heavens, being from pure love and from celestial 
good; and such worship must be acknowledged to 
be from the Lord through the celestial heavens, 
both as to good and truth for ever according to 
Divine Order.

16. And Moses diligently sought the 

16. But when man profanes worship by self-love, it is 

goat of the sin offering, and, behold, 
it was burnt: and he was angry with 
Eleazar and with Ithamar, the sons of
Aaron that were left, saying, 

17. Wherefore have you not eaten the sin
offering in the place of the sanctuary,
seeing it is most holy, and he has 
given it you to bear the iniquity of 
the congregation, to make atonement
for them before the LORD? 

according to Divine Order that the good of 
innocence in the natural man perishes through that 
self-love; and consequently, in this case, the 
external man as to truth and good is averted from 
Divine Truth, and then there is perception,

17. That the good of worship on account of 

deliverance from evil is to be appropriated in a 
holy state thence resulting, because this good is 
most holy; and through celestial truth and good the
Lord fights for man against evil, that man may be 
reconciled with Him, or in other words, that the 
external man may be brought into harmony with 
the internal by genuine repentance.

106

18. Behold, the blood of it was not 

18. But in the case of profane worship there is no 

brought into the sanctuary within: 
you should certainly have eaten it in 
the sanctuary, as I commanded. 

19. And Aaron spoke to Moses, Behold, 

this day have they offered their sin 
offering and their burnt offering 
before the LORD; and there have 
befallen me such things as these: and
if I had eaten the sin offering today, 
would it have been well-pleasing in 
the sight of the LORD? 

20. And when Moses heard that, it was 

well-pleasing in his sight. 

References and Notes

conjunction of Divine Truth with Divine Good, 
and consequently no harmony between the 
external and internal man; and yet there should be 
according to Divine Order.

19. Therefore it is perceived from Divine Good by 
Divine Truth that, indeed, false representative 
worship for deliverance from evil and for the 
communication of good had been offered, which 
gave no external conjunction with the Lord, even 
when the External was separated from the Internal;
for in the case of profane worship, even such 
external conjunction was impossible; and hence, 
therefore, the external appropriation of good was 
impossible in that state of profanity.

20. And this perception from Divine Good by Divine 
Truth is therefore exactly according to the real 
state of the case in profane worship.

1. By Nadab and Abihu the sons of Aaron are denoted the doctrines of the Word in both senses 

the internal and external, and thus the doctrine of good and the doctrine of truth, here without 
the life thereof, as the context shows, 9375; Nadab means free and voluntary gift, or prince, 
and thus denotes, by correspondence, the good and truth thence derived of the Internal of the 
Word; and Abihu means my father is he, and thus indicates the good and truth thence of the 
External of the Word, 9670, 1482, 37033; the sons of Aaron denote, generally, truths from 
good, 9946; by fire and strange fire are denoted the lusts of evil, 934; incense in this case 
denotes persuasions of falsity, 9965; fire also denotes selfish love, 934; and by what the Lord 
had not commanded is denoted what is contrary to the Divine influx, 5486.

2. Fire coming forth from before the Lord and devouring Nadab and Abihu denotes that the lusts 
of selfish love, the torments from which the wicked attribute to the Lord, entirely consume 
them, 934, 2447, 5149; and their dying before the Lord denotes that the wicked are fully 
vastated as to all good and truth, 7699.

3. By Moses saying to Aaron is denoted that perception is given by Divine Truth to those who 

are in good, 1791, 7010, 9946; what the Lord speaks is evidently what is according to Divine 
Order, 1728; the Lord being sanctified in them that come near to Him denotes that those who 
approach the Lord in worship ought to do so internally as well as externally, 9820; His being 
glorified before all the people denotes that this should be so with regard to those in truths 
ostensibly as well as to those in good ostensibly, or with regard to those of the external church 
as well as those of the internal, 1259, 3295, 6864; and by Aaron holding his peace is denoted 
that those in genuine good are acquiescent, and cannot defend perverted worship, 8176.

4. Moses represents Divine Truth, 7010; calling signifies influx, 6840, also presence, influx and 
afflux, 7955; Mishael and Elzaphan mean respectively "one who is asked for," and "one whom

107

God protects," and thence denote ultimate truths and affections, 3385, 8960, 8964; Uzziel 
means "the strength of God," and thus again denotes the power of good by truth, 6343, also 
"the kid of God," and thus the power of truth from good in innocence, 3519, 7840; the uncle of
Aaron denotes celestial good, or charity in its most external form, or, in other words, collateral
celestial good, either as corrupted by the predominance of selfish love, or as modified or 
influenced temporarily by selfish love, and in this case the latter, as appears from the fact that 
it was under the influence of the Divine Truth, represented by Moses, that those in ultimate 
truths so acted, 3129, 3796, 3803, 9946; "saying to them" denotes perception on the part of 
those in ultimate truth and good, 1822; "draw near" denotes that there should be harmony of 
state, 9378; and carrying their brethren from before the sanctuary out of the camp denotes the 
removal of all opposing hypocritical worship beyond the limits of genuine worship by a good 
life, 4236. Hence we may learn that the celestial good, or love to the Lord, represented by 
Aaron, may assume various forms according to the degree of the mind in which it is 
manifested; also that those in the genuine ultimate truths and goods of the literal sense of the 
Word minister to higher good by contributing to the removal of false worship.

5. By their going near, and doing as Moses said, is denoted that it actually happens according to 
the dictate of Divine Truth, 9378, 7010; and by their being carried in their coats out of the 
camp is denoted that all impure worship, with its corrupted truths, is removed, 4236, 99429.

6. Here again, by saying is denoted perception, 1822; Aaron, and Eleazar and Ithamar his sons, 

denote those who are in celestial and spiritual good and truth in the church, because, although 
these sons of Aaron are shown to signify natural good, 9812, seeing that Nadab and Abihu, in 
their integrity, signified spiritual good, 9810, 9811, yet when the representation by the elder 
sons ceased, 10244, then the younger sons took on their representation, and because evidently 
in the passage before us the "whole house of Israel" denotes those in external or natural good, 
4286; the hair of the head not going loose, and the clothes not being rent, denote no mourning 
inwardly or outwardly, 9960, 4763; death denotes the separation of the External from the 
Internal, and thus death spiritually, 272, 9965; the Lord not being angry with the whole 
congregation denotes no aversion from the Lord, 5798; and the whole house of Israel being 
permitted to mourn for the burning denotes that those in the external church are allowed to 
grieve on account of the loss, apparently, of true worship, 4286. Notice in this verse that the 
Hebrew word translated "uncover" in A.V., and "let go loose" in R.V., is rendered "not shave" 
in 9960, and means, according to the lexicon, to uncover.

7. By Aaron and his two sons are denoted those in internal worship, ver. 6; by not going out from
the door of the tent of meeting is denoted not to be separated therefrom, 2356, 35403; by dying
is denoted the separation of the External from the Internal, and of man from the Lord, 10244; 
by the anointing oil being upon them is denoted inauguration into representation, the 
conjunction of truth with good, and thus conjunction with the Lord, 9954, the violation of 
which would be profanation, 3398; and by their doing according to the word of Moses is 
denoted obedience to the laws of Divine Truth, 7010, by which the Lord preserves man from 
profanation.

8.

Jehovah denotes the Divine Being as to His love, 2001; speaking denotes influx, 2951; Aaron 
represents Divine Good, 9946; and saying denotes perception, 1791, 1822.

108

9. This is evident, because to go into the tent of meeting denotes the worship of the Lord from 

love, charity and obedience, 2356, 3540, 9812; not to drink wine nor strong drink denotes not 
to worship the Lord from truths, whether spiritual or celestial, 1072; observe here that in 
double expressions like wine and strong drink, one has relation to what is spiritual and the 
other to what is celestial, 683, both in a good and a bad sense, as in this verse and in Isaiah 
5:22 respectively; Aaron and his sons denote the Celestial and Spiritual, 9946; not dying 
denotes not being separated from the Lord, 10244; and a statute for ever throughout your 
generations denotes an external law of Divine Order, 7884, 7931, 1041.

10. To put a difference evidently denotes that a distinction ought to be made; between the holy and
the common denotes between holy external worship conjoined with internal, and that which is 
separated, as appears from the series, and also from the signification of holy and common, or 
holy and profaned, according to the derivation of the Hebrew word for common, 2146, 2434, 
2190, 3899, 10307, 10309, 10310; unclean and clean denote respectively what is contaminated
with selfish love, and what is pure from such love in worship, and also in the appropriation of 
truth denoted by drinking wine, 987, 994, 10130; and it is said "between the celestial and 
spiritual heavens," because the Celestial are particularly distinguished from the Spiritual by 
"not drinking wine," 1072, 2187, that is, not separating truth from good.

11. To teach the children of Israel, when spoken of the Celestial, denotes influx giving a 

disposition to learn and remember what is received into the understanding by an external way, 
7007, and see also in this connection TCR 8; the children of Israel denote the Spiritual, 3654; 
statutes denote external rituals and truths flowing from the order of heaven, and adapted to the 
state, 7884; and what the Lord has spoken by the hand of Moses denotes what has relation to 
worship from charity by means of faith, because the Lord or Jehovah denotes the Divine Being
as to His love, which, with the Spiritual, takes the form of charity, 2001, 9812, and because 
Moses represents Divine Truth, 7010, which in a lower degree takes the form of faith, 4448.

12. As Moses represents Divine Truth, 7010, and Aaron, Eleazar and Ithamar represent celestial 
good in successive degrees, or those in such good, 9812, Moses speaking to these three 
denotes what is according to the laws of Divine Order, or according to influx and 
correspondence, 1728, 295,1, 1831, 1832; those that were left, and the meal offering that was 
left denote the remnant of those in the church, and the remains of good after it has been 
corrupted, showing the continuity of the series in the whole chapter, 468; eating the meal 
offering denotes the appropriation of good, 2187; of the offerings of the Lord made by fire 
denotes the result of worship from pure love, 10055; without leaven denotes free from falsity, 
2342; beside the altar denotes in a state of worship from good, 9964; and most holy denotes 
inmost worship and inmost good, 3210.

13. By eating in a holy place is denoted appropriation in a holy state, 2187, 3652; the meal 

offering being the due of Aaron and his sons denotes that the good signified by it properly 
belongs to the celestial and spiritual churches, who worship the Lord from good and not from 
truth, 45,81, 2177, 9946, 7884, 7931; the offerings of the Lord made by fire denotes also 
worship from pure love or good, 10055; and "so I am commanded" denotes the result of 
Divine influx, 5486.

14. The wave breast and the heave thigh denote respectively the intellectual and voluntary 

principles of the man of the celestial church or state, 10087, 10090, 10092, 10093, for the 
intellectual principle is charity, and the voluntary principle is love to the Lord; waving denotes

109

vivification by acknowledgement, and heaving denotes perception from celestial love in 
activity, 10093; to eat in a clean place denotes appropriation without falsity and imperfection, 
2187, 4545, 2625; sons denote thoughts, and daughters denote affections externally, while 
"you" evidently denotes what is internal, since it was Aaron, 489, 9946, 5912; Aaron and his 
sons, as priests, denote the pure principles of man internally, 9946; what is due, or a statute, 
denotes what is according to Divine Order, 7884, 7931; and out of the sacrifices of peace 
offerings of the children of Israel denotes even when external worship from a state of peace 
and freedom is comparatively imperfect, as is the case with the spiritual man, because by 
peace offerings are denoted worship from peace and freedom, 10097; the children of Israel, in 
respect to Aaron and his sons, denote what is external in the Spiritual Church, 4286; and what 
is external, as is the worship of the spiritual man compared with the celestial, is relatively 
imperfect.

15. The offerings of the children of Israel denote the holy worship of the spiritual man, 922, 3654; 
waving denotes vivification, 10093; the breast denotes charity, and the thigh the conjunction of
good and truth, or the heavenly marriage, and thus the conjunction between the spiritual and 
celestial heavens, 10087, 10075; offerings made by lire denote worship from pure love, 10055;
fat denotes celestial good, 10033; its being Aaron's and his sons' denotes that such worship is 
to be acknowledged as from the Lord through the celestial and spiritual heavens, 10106; and a 
due for ever as the Lord has commanded denotes according to Divine Order, 7884, 2951.

16. Moses diligently seeking the goat of the sin offering and its being burnt denotes that, 

according to Divine Order, when man profanes worship by selfish love, the good of innocence 
in the natural man perishes through that selfish love. For by Moses is represented Divine 
Truth, 7010, and Divine Truth is Divine Order, 1728; seeking diligently, when said of Divine 
Truth, denotes foresight and omniscience, 4718, 4719; the goat denotes the good of innocence 
in the natural man, 4169, 725, because it denotes the truth of faith conjoined with good; there 
is no worship without good, and in all good there is innocence, 2526, 7840; and the goat being
burnt denotes that the good of innocence perishes through that selfish love, 9055. And by 
Moses being angry with Eleazar and Ithamar is denoted the aversion of the external man from 
Divine Truth, 5798; that is, when the church has been corrupted, and when worship has been 
profaned by those in selfish love, denoted by Nadab and Abihu, then the simple good in the 
external church suffer distress and temporary aversion from interior truths. Hence it is said 
"that were left," meaning, spiritually, those with whom there were remains, 468, while 
"saying" denotes their perception, 1791, 1822.

17. To eat the sin offering in the place of the sanctuary denotes that the good of worship on 

account of deliverance from evil should be appropriated in a holy state, 3400, 2187, 3652; 
most holy denotes that such worship is from inmost good, 3210; what was given to the sons of 
Aaron denotes that all good is from the Lord through celestial truth and good, 5619; and 
bearing the iniquity of the congregation to make atonement before the Lord denotes that the 
Lord fights for man against evil, that man may be reconciled with Him, or that the external 
man may be brought into harmony with the internal by genuine repentance, 9937, 10042 II.

18. By the blood not being brought into the sanctuary within is denoted that, in the case of profane
worship, there is no conjunction of Divine Truth with Divine Good, chap. iv. vers. 5-7; by the 
goat not being eaten in the sanctuary, that is, in the court of the tent of meeting, chap 6:26, is 

110

denoted no harmony between the external and internal man, 9741; and by "as I commanded" is
denoted what is according to Divine Order, 1010, 1728, 2951.

19. Here speaking denotes perception, like saying, 1791, 1822; Aaron denotes Divine Good, 9946,

and Moses Divine Truth, 7010; offering the sin offering and the burnt offering denotes 
representative worship for deliverance from evil, 3400, and for the communication of good, 
8680, but then these offerings were made, not by Aaron according to order, and gave no 
external conjunction with the Lord by representatives, 665; this day denotes in that state, 487; 
"there have befallen me such things as these" denotes, because it implies, the impossibility of 
conjunction by profane worship, ver. 2; and eating the sin offering in such a case would 
represent the appropriation of evil, instead of good and truth, 2187, and thus what was not well
pleasing to the Lord, or good in the eyes of the Lord, 2572.

20. Moses hearing denotes perception by Divine Truth from Divine Good, 3163, 7010, 9946; and 
it being well pleasing in his sight or good in his eyes denotes that it is exactly according to the 
real state of the case in profane worship, because it denotes exactly according to Divine Good 
united with Divine Truth, or according to Omniscience, 2572.

Discussion

The very first verse of this chapter, in its internal sense, sets before us a fact which is far too common 
among men. They worship the Lord on selfish principles; for selfish love is the "strange fire" here 
spoken of. And they are like Jacob, who, when "he went into Syria to escape from the vengeance of his 
brother Esau, said, "If God will be with me, and will keep me in this way that I go, and will give me 
bread to eat, and clothing to put on, so that I come again to my father's house in peace, then shall the 
Lord be my God." But such worship only belongs to the merely natural man, whom Jacob here 
represents, and is accepted from him provisionally, in order that it may lead to real Christian worship, 
and not that it may be confirmed, and cause the state here signified by the false worshipers symbolized 
by Nadab and Abihu. Unless, therefore, "Jacob" becomes "Israel," or the truly spiritual man by 
regeneration, he will finally become totally selfish, and will have to be controlled on merely selfish 
principles. And this is what is represented in our chapter, as the series shows, by the fire coming forth 
from the Lord and consuming Nadab and Abihu, and by their dying before the Lord.

But now thoughts arise from the consideration of the words of Moses and the silence of Aaron. Moses 
as Divine Truth confirms the law by which the wicked are vastated, and Aaron as Divine Good 
acquiesces. That which happens exactly according to requirements of Order cannot be contrary to the 
Divine Benevolence. Do not let us imagine that any human being is irretrievably in torment; for the 
Lord rules the hells.

We contemplate next the process of the separation of the wicked from the good. Vastation does not 
mean the destruction of anybody. On the contrary, it involves the eternal preservation of everybody, and
the preservation of the universe as a whole, and of the equilibrium between good and evil in the 
probationary state of man. This is all included in the removal of the offending priests beyond the camp. 
And the meaning, and thence the correspondence, of the names of the persons employed is very 
suggestive. It is truth, as it were, separated from good in the Judgement, and afterwards with the 
wicked, that ministers and conduces to the final result. This is denoted by Uzziel and his sons. Also the 
dead bodies were removed in their coats, aptly signifying the conjunction of corrupted truths, or 
falsities, with their kindred evils in vastation. The bad man loves falsities, and the good man loves 
truths. No one either in heaven or in hell can have a divided mind, willing good and thinking falsity, or 

111

willing evil and thinking truth; but to him who has goodness in heaven shall the truth be given which 
agrees with his good, while from him who has not goodness in the hells will the truth be removed with 
which he would otherwise do injury to the good (Matt 25:29), for He who spoke the words of the 
gospel also inspired the words of Moses.

But as with the wicked, so with the good, as what follows shows. For not only are the evil separated 
from the good in the perfect state of man, but the different kinds and degrees of good (and of evil as 
well, although this is not here mentioned) are accurately distinguished, nor can the good of the celestial
become the good of the spiritual man. The degrees of man's life are here well defined, and also the 
distinction of the Internal and External. And this is because the happiness of those in the heavens 
depends very much on accurate distinctions, which, in the complex and mixed states of men on earth, 
are not capable of realization. But does it not seem strange that the internal men should be forbidden to 
mourn for the lost brethren, while yet the external might mourn? Is it because the internal men have no 
sympathy with the evil who suffer the consequences of their profanation of the worship of the Lord, 
while the external men have such sympathy? By no means. For in proportion to a person's advance in 
goodness according to its degrees will his real human sympathies be more extensive and genuine, 
because the Lord, who is the Highest and Holiest, is Sympathy itself (John 11:33-39). The cause, 
therefore, of this prohibition to Aaron and his sons, and permission to the Israelites in general, to mourn
was not because the internal and celestial men have no sympathy, but because, having a more abundant 
sympathy, they at the same time perceive how far short the outward signs and symbols of mourning for 
the dead come of the genuine knowledge, as well as the genuine love and sympathy, of those who most 
inwardly love the Lord, and who are signified by Aaron and his sons. Let us beware, therefore, of 
misunderstanding the sense here. The meaning of Aaron and his sons not mourning as the whole house 
of Israel did is that those in the good and truth of a higher state ought not to go back to the conditions 
of the lower state as to the understanding, as the correspondence of the hair of the head and of the 
garments shows; while their not going out from the door of the tent of meeting denotes that neither 
should they do so as to the will, the door of the tent of meeting here signifying the limits of the 
voluntary life of the celestial, or more generally of the internal men.

But what now immediately follows concerns the same general truth, and exhibits it in relation to states 
more interior and under another aspect. It is, specifically, the worship of the celestial and spiritual 
heavens, or of the celestial and spiritual man, that is the subject. But we may also include the worship 
of the natural man as we study, because there is no worship at all apart from good or love, nor can any 
worship be from truths, but only by them as means. This, however, may seem inconsistent with Exod 
20:22, as explained in 8940; but it is not so, since even there the good of truth is implied, and merely 
intellectual worship is condemned. And, moreover, when it is said that the spiritual man worships from 
a principle of truth, or because worship is commanded, that is, when he obeys the truth, the word 
principle implies some affection, since affection is the motive power here also. But the celestial and 
spiritual man par excellence never, in worship, "drinks wine," or worships from truths. The rest of what
is said in this connection is evident; but the function of the Celestial in relation to the Spiritual is very 
interesting, inasmuch as it shows how even instruction in truths is properly from good, and is not 
successful unless it be so, both as regards him who is instructed, as well as the instructor. And in 
everyday life the successful teacher is the man who loves to teach.

On considering what is said of Aaron's sons that were left, and of the meal offering that was left, we see
that they signify, the former those in good in the church when it has been corrupted, and the latter good 
appropriated; and also that this appropriated good is from the Lord through spiritual and celestial love, 
denoted by "the wave breast and heave thigh," and in the following verse by "the heave thigh and the 

112

wave breast," the alteration in the arrangement and the apparent repetition indicating procedure from 
external states to such as are internal in the first instance, and the activity of the perfected state of good 
from what is internal to what is external in the second. For the two processes occur simultaneously in 
regeneration, as well as successively, since at the same time that man is outwardly advancing from 
Externals to Internals, the Lord is operating upon him through the heavens from Internals to Externals: 
see 1555, concerning the different planes formed in man by the Lord.

But with regard to the loss of the sin offering in connection with the whole subject of this chapter, two 
points merit special attention. In a corrupted church the wicked cannot worship the Lord from the good 
of innocence in the natural man, which is denoted by the goat; and the good are hindered more or less 
from doing this on account of the general state of corruption. For the falsities of a profane and selfish 
worship cause the truth concerning repentance and deliverance from evil by good from the Lord to be 
violated. This is what is signified by the goat being burnt, and by the anger of Moses with Eleazar and 
Ithamar. But now let us notice that while Divine Truth, considered by itself, justly condemns the non-
appropriation of good because repentance has only been the shunning of evil upon false principles and 
from selfish motives, Divine Good, on the other hand, while recognizing the truth, perceives, from its 
very nature, that those who are really in good in the external church do repent inwardly, even though 
they profess to do so on false principles, because these prevail in the corrupted church; and hence that 
there cannot be the appropriation of good outwardly, as there should be, this only becoming possible in 
the future state of Judgement, when opposing falsities are seen to be falsities, and are rejected. We 
ought, therefore, to note the difference here between those represented by Nadab and Abihu, who 
would not repent because of an evil heart combined with false doctrine, and those signified by Eleazar 
and Ithamar, who were only led astray by false doctrine which they supposed to be true. Hence we see 
how the shunning of evils as sins against God, or against truth and good, causes the genuine 
appropriation of good in the work of repentance as a habit; and how Divine Truth and Divine Good 
agree in caring for the salvation of man in every state of the church.

Leviticus Chapter 11

Summary of the Spiritual Sense

1. Instruction concerning good affections that may be appropriated by the man of the church, and 

evil affections that may not be appropriated on account of their impurity, vers. 1-8. 

2. Also concerning the truths of the Word in the memory that may be appropriated or not, vers. 9-

12. 

3. The evil thoughts that ought not to be appropriated are next particularized, vers. 13-19. 
4. Then the appropriation of sensual and corporeal things is considered, vers. 20-23. 
5. Certain other causes of spiritual impurity are specified which ought to be avoided, vers. 24-28. 
6. And sensual and corporeal affections of the lowest kind, which are causes of impurity, ought not

to be appropriated, vers. 29-38 and 41-43. 

7. Also every affection which, in its orderly state, may be appropriated, becomes impure if it be 

vastated of good and truth, and contact therewith produces impurity which must be removed by 
a change of state, vers. 39-40. 

8. For the Lord is holiness and purity in themselves, and by delivering mankind has made it 

possible for every one who chooses to become holy and pure, vers. 44-45. 

9. These are the laws of Divine Order relating to purity and impurity in the feeling's and thoughts; 

and also to the appropriation or non-appropriation of good or evil, vers. 46-47. 

The Contents of each Verse

1. And the LORD spoke to Moses and 

1. There is influx from the Lord into Divine Truth 

to Aaron, saying to them, 

and Divine Good giving perception,

2. Speak to the children of Israel, 

saying, These are the living things 
which you shall eat among all the 
beasts that are on the earth. 

3. Whatsoever parts the hoof, and is 
clovenfooted, and chews the cud, 
among the beasts, that shall you eat. 

4. Nevertheless these shall you not eat 
of them that chew the cud, or of 
them that part the hoof: the camel, 
because he chews the cud but parts 
not the hoof, he is unclean to you. 

2. And revelation to the man of the Spiritual Church 
concerning good to be appropriated by him in the 
External;

3. Namely, every natural affection which is in 

correspondence with spiritual affection external, or
internal; and every natural affection of truth 
acquired by due reflection.

4. Nevertheless, there are certain affections which 
cannot be appropriated, although they are 
associated with truths by reflection, or are in 
correspondence with spiritual affections, as for 
example the merely selfish love of knowledge, 
because this is associated with truth by reflection, 
but is not in correspondence with spiritual love, 
and therefore it is impure.

114

5. And the coney, because he chews the
cud but parts not the hoof, he is 
unclean to you. 

5. Also the love of knowledge merely intellectual, 
which indeed reflects, but lacks correspondence 
with spiritual love, and is therefore impure.

6. And the hare, because she chews the 
cud but parts not the hoof, she is 
unclean to you. 

7. And the swine, because he parts the 
hoof, and is clovenfooted, but chews
not the cud, he is unclean to you. 

6. Also the merely sensual love of knowledge, for the

same reasons, is impure.

7. And, lastly, the greedy love of acquiring wealth, 

which is avarice, or covetousness simply 
corporeal, because although it may be brought into
correspondence with spiritual love, yet it does not 
reflect upon truths for this purpose, and is 
therefore impure.

8. Of their flesh you shall not eat, and 

8. Therefore none of these affections can be 

their carcases you shall not touch; 
they are unclean to you. 

9. These shall you eat of all that are in 
the waters: whatever has fins and 
scales in the waters, in the seas, and 
in the rivers, them shall you eat. 

appropriated by the spiritual man, neither is he to 
allow himself to indulge them in the least, because 
they are impure.

9. Again, the spiritual man may appropriate truths 

from the Divine Word provided they are cultivated
with a view to progress in spiritual life, and are 
embodied, or expressed in ultimates, or in good 
works. And this is true in regard to external truths, 
interior truths, and inmost truths.

10. And all that have not fins and scales 

in the seas, and in the rivers, of all 
that move in the waters, and of all 
the living creatures that are in the 
waters, they are an abomination to 
you, 

10. But truths that are not cultivated with a view to 
spiritual progress, and that are embodied in 
ultimates for that purpose, whether they are 
interior, inmost or external, or only sensual and 
corporeal, are thereby rendered infernal and 
defiled.

11. And they shall be an abomination to 
you; you shall not eat of their flesh, 
and their carcases you shall have in 
abomination. 

12. Whatsoever has no fins nor scales in 
the waters, that is an abomination to 
you. 

11. Indeed, they must be perpetually so; they cannot 

be appropriated; nor is the spiritual man allowed to
indulge them in the least degree.

12. And, in short, whatever is acquired in the external 
memory, whether it be true or false, without regard
to spiritual progress, and to the uses of life, cannot 
be appropriated.

13. And these you shall have in 

abomination among the birds; they 
shall not be eaten, they are an 
abomination: the eagle, and the gier 
eagle, and the ospray; 

13. Also the following things are to be considered 
infernal and defiled in the thoughts, neither can 
they be appropriated, namely, inmost falsities 
arising from the abuse of the rational faculty, as to 
will, understanding, and action;

115

14. And the kite, and the falcon after its 

14. Interior falsities of the same kind as to the will: 

kind; 

and as to the understanding according to their 
nature;

15. Every raven after its kind; 

15. And ultimate falsities of the same kind according 

16. And the ostrich, and the night hawk, 
and the sea-mew, and the hawk after 
its kind; 

17. And the little owl, and the 

cormorant, and the great owl; 

18. And the horned owl, and the pelican,

and the vulture; 

19. And the stork, the heron after its 

kind, and the hoopoe, and the bat. 

20. All winged creeping things that go 
upon all four are an abomination to 
you. 

to their nature.

16. Also whatever relates to the abuse of the natural 

powers, namely, inmost falsities from evil; interior
falsities from evil; and external falsities from evil, 
of the first degree there; inmost falsities from evil 
according to their nature;

17. Interior falsities from evil; and external falsities 

from evil of the second degree there; also ultimate 
or lowest falsities of the third degree there;

18. Also whatever relates to the abuse of the sensual 
affections, namely, falsities inmost, interior, and 
external of the first degree there;

19. Falsities, inmost, interior according to their nature,
and external, of the second degree there; and 
falsities of the lowest kind of the third degree 
there.

20. And every thought and feeling of the unregenerate 
will, having the appearance of spiritual life, but yet
degraded and active from the conjunction of falsity
with evil, is infernal and defiled, and cannot be 
appropriated.

21. Yet these may you eat of all winged 
creeping things that go upon all four,
which have legs above their feet, to 
leap withal upon the earth; 

21. But yet there are some affections and thoughts 
apparently of this kind, which can be elevated 
above what is merely sensual and corporeal in the 
natural man, and these may be appropriated.

22. Even these of them you may eat; the 
locust after its kind, and the bald 
locust after its kind, and the cricket 
after its kind, and the grasshopper 
after its kind. 

23. But all winged creeping things, 
which have four feet, are an 
abomination to you. 

22. And such, for example, are lowest good affections 
of the will and understanding interior and exterior, 
each according to its nature.

23. But all sensual and corporeal delights and 

pleasures which are not in subordination to the 
spiritual life, because there is with them the 
conjunction of falsity with evil, are to be regarded 
with horror as things infernal and abominable.

116

24. And by these you shall become 

unclean: whoever touches the 
carcase of them shall be unclean 
until the even. 

25. And whoever beareth aught of the 
carcase of them shall wash his 
clothes, and be unclean until the 
even. 

24. Also the following practices are impure; and hence
the least indulgence therein causes impurity, which
can only be removed by a change of state:

25. And, moreover, the very thought of such evils 

makes the purification of the externals necessary; 
and renders the state impure until its close.

26. Every beast which, parts the hoof, 
and is not clovenfooted, nor chews 
the cud, is unclean to you: every one 
that touches them shall be unclean. 

26. Every affection which has correspondence with 
spiritual things externally, but not internally, and 
which, therefore, does not lead to reflection upon 
Divine Truths with a view to good, is impure.

27. And whatever goes upon its paws, 

among all beasts that go on all four, 
they are unclean to you: whoso 
touches their carcase shall be 
unclean until the even. 

27. And every affection which is merely natural, and 
does not admit of conjunction with spiritual 
affection in the course of life, is also impure, and 
the least indulgence of such affections, void of 
spiritual life, causes impurity, which can only be 
removed by a change of state.

28. And he that bears the carcase of 

28. Besides which, merely thinking of such evil 

them shall wash his clothes, and be 
unclean until the even: they are 
unclean to you. 

affections in the ordinary course of life, renders 
purification necessary as to externals, and also a 
change of state, because of the inevitable impurity.

29. And these are they who are unclean 
to you among the creeping things 
that creep upon the earth; the weasel,
and the mouse, and the great lizard 
after its kind, 

30. And the gecko, and the land-

crocodile, and the lizard, and the 
sand-lizard, and the chameleon. 

29. Also these things are impure among sensual and 
corporeal affections: wilful ignorance of truth 
through sensual love; avarice; and the delights of 
merely corporeal affections from their very nature;

30. With various evils and falsities thence derived, 
namely, the perversion of good by falsities 
interiorly; the corruption of truth by evils 
interiorly; the perversions of good exteriorly; the 
corruptions of truth exteriorly; and the delusions of
the senses arising from fallacious appearances.

31. These are they who are unclean to 
you among all that creep: whoever 
does touch them, when they are 
dead, shall be unclean until the even.

31. For these are all impure affections of the lowest 
character; and the slightest contact therewith 
produces a state of impurity, which can only be 
removed by a change of state.

117

32. And upon whatever any of them, 

32. And in their state of complete vastation, even the 

when they are dead, does fall, it shall
be unclean; whether it be any vessel 
of wood, or clothing, or skin, or 
sack, whatever vessel it be, with 
which any work is done, it must be 
put into water, and it shall be 
unclean until the even; then shall it 
be clean. 

least accidental indulgence therein causes 
impurity, whether such indulgence affects the will 
or understanding as receptacles of good or truth 
inwardly or outwardly; and any such receptacle 
that can be applied to use, must be brought under 
the influence of the truth, and remain impure until 
a change of state, so that it may serve its appointed
purpose.

33. And every earthen vessel, whereinto 
any of them falls, whatever is in it 
shall be unclean, and it you shall 
break. 

34. All food therein which may be eaten,
that on which water comes, shall be 
unclean: and all drink that may be 
drunk in every such vessel shall be 
unclean. 

33. Also every receptacle defiled by falsity and 

cohering with good, and which is contaminated by 
these lowest evils, the good of that receptacle is 
thence impure; and the receptacle itself must be 
separated.

34. And all good in such receptacles which may be 

appropriated, but which is contaminated with the 
falsity of such evil, is impure; and all truth, which 
may be appropriated thence, is impure.

35. And every thing whereupon any part

35. Also everything external, which is contaminated 

of their carcase falls shall be 
unclean; whether oven, or range for 
pots, it shall be broken in pieces: 
they are unclean, and shall be 
unclean to you. 

36. Nevertheless a fountain or a pit 

wherein is a gathering of water shall 
be clean: but that which toucheth 
their carcase shall be unclean. 

even slightly by such evils is impure; whether it be
what serves for the preparation of good, or for the 
preparation of truth for appropriation, it is to be 
separated; it is impure, and must continue to be so.

36. Nevertheless, a general receptacle of good or truth,
as, for example, the interior or exterior memory, or
the Word in its literal sense, is pure from such 
contamination; however, every truth having the 
slightest contact with what is void of spiritual life, 
is impure.

37. And if aught of their carcase fall 

upon any sowing seed which is to be
sown, it is clean. 

37. Again, if the man of the church is in a state of 
instruction, and these evils contaminate his 
thought, yet the truth inseminated is pure.

38. But if water be put upon the seed, 
and aught of their carcase fall 
thereon, it is unclean to you. 

38. But if falsity be mixed with truth, in a state of 

instruction, and a man from this evil is disposed to 
favour such falsity, then there is impurity.

39. And if any beast, of which you may 
eat, die; he that touches the carcase 
thereof shall be unclean until the 
even. 

39. Also if any affection, which may be appropriated, 
be vastated as to good and truth, the slightest 
indulgence of that dead affection is impurity until 
a change of state takes place.

118

40. And he that eats of the carcase of it 
shall wash his clothes, and be 
unclean until the even: he also that 
bears the carcase of it shall wash his 
clothes, and be unclean until the 
even. 

40. And he who appropriates that affection in its dead 
state, is impure until a change of state takes place, 
and his external man must be purified; and even 
when he allows himself to think with favour of 
that dead state, he is impure until a change.

41. And every creeping thing that creeps
upon the earth is an abomination; it 
shall not be eaten. 

41. And thus, in general, all merely sensual and 

corporeal affections are impure, and may not be 
appropriated.

42. Whatsoever goes upon the belly, and
whatever goes upon all four, or 
whatever has many feet, even all 
creeping things that creep upon the 
earth, them you shall not eat; for 
they are an abomination. 

43. You shall not make yourselves 

abominable with any creeping thing 
that creeps, neither shall you make 
yourselves unclean with them, that 
you should be defiled thereby. 

42. Every merely sensual affection; every sensual 

affection disposed, in the progress of life, to the 
conjunction of falsity with evil; every sensual 
affection intensely such; and every sensual 
affection, in fact, that is separated from the higher 
life, cannot be appropriated because it is infernal 
and defiled.

43. Nor must the spiritual man corrupt himself by 
indulgence in any merely sensual affection 
deliberately; nor must he deliberately render 
himself impure with it, and thus become defiled.

44. For I am the LORD your God: 

44. For the Lord is good itself and truth itself united; 

sanctify yourselves therefore, and be
you holy; for I am holy: neither shall
you defile yourselves with any 
manner of creeping thing that moves
upon the earth. 

and therefore man should be holy by the 
conjunction of these in himself, since the Lord is 
holiness itself by that union; neither should the 
spiritual man defile himself with any sensual 
affection separated from the higher life.

45. For I am the LORD that brought you 
up out of the land of Egypt, to be 
your God: you shall therefore be 
holy, for I am holy. 

46. This is the law of the beast, and of 

the bird, and of every living creature 
that moves in the waters, and of 
every creature that creep-eh upon the
earth: 

45. Moreover, the Lord, by the work of Redemption, 
delivered the Spiritual from the bondage of the 
merely natural man, that they might have power to 
serve Him; and on this account also he can be holy
in his degree, even as the Lord is holiness itself.

46. And these are the laws of Divine Order concerning
natural affections of the will and understanding, 
and concerning sensual and corporeal affections.

119

47. To make a difference between the 

unclean and the clean, and between 
the living thing that may be eaten 
and the living thing that may not be 
eaten. 

47. And these are the laws of Divine Order concerning
natural affections of the will and understanding 
and concerning sensual and corporeal affections, 
for the purpose of making a distinction between 
what is impure and pure, and between what may 
be appropriated and what may not be appropriated.

References and Notes

1. This is evident, because by Jehovah is denoted the Divine Being as to His love, 2001; by 

speaking is denoted influx, 2951; by Moses is represented Divine Truth, or the Word, 7010; by
Aaron is denoted Divine Good, 9946; and by saying is denoted perception, 1791, 1822.

2. Speaking to the children of Israel denotes revelation to the man of the Spiritual Church, 
10355, 3654; the living things and beasts to be eaten denote good affections to be 
appropriated, 44, 2187; and the earth denotes the external man, 27, 913.

3. Whatsoever parts the hoof denotes affections having correspondence with spiritual affections, 

because the animals signify affections, 44, the hoof denotes lowest affections of truth, 7729, 
and parting, or dividing, denotes correspondence with higher affections, 1832; what is cloven-
footed denotes natural affections having correspondence with spiritual affections, because the 
foot denotes natural affections, 2162, and being cloven also means division, 1832, 4171, chap 
1:17; what is lowest, or the sensual, and what is natural, are respectively as what is external 
and internal; and what chews the cud, or brings it up, denotes every natural affection of truth 
appropriated by due reflection, 3171, 76072, 6183, 6844, 3661, 5508, 2187. We see here that 
three things are really involved, correspondentially, in "chewing the cud," namely, the 
elevation of knowledge or truth from the external memory into the understanding, denoted by 
"bringing up the cud "; its reconsideration by reflection upon it denoted by the remastication of
the food; and its full appropriation, denoted by again eating what was thus remasticated.

4. Some of those animals that chew the cud or part the hoof not being eaten, denote certain 

affections which cannot be appropriated, either because they are not associated with truths by 
reflection, or are not in correspondence with spiritual affection, ver. 3; the camel denotes the 
merely selfish love of knowledge, or the love of knowledge for the sake of reward, 3048, 
3816, 3956; and being unclean denotes impurity in consequence of not corresponding with 
spiritual affection, 10130.

5. By the coney, or according to the now prevailing opinion, by the Hyrax Syriacus, or rock-
badger (in the Hebrew Shaphan), is denoted the merely intellectual love of knowledge, 
because it follows, in order, the merely selfish love of knowledge; and by chewing the cud, but
not parting the hoof, is denoted that it indeed reflects, but lacks correspondence with the 
Spiritual, ver. 3; while by its being unclean is denoted that such love of knowledge is impure, 
10130.

6. By the hare is denoted the merely sensual love of knowledge, because it is the third in the 

series; by its chewing the cud, but not parting the hoof, is denoted that this love of knowledge 
indeed reflects but is not in correspondence with spiritual love, ver. 3; and by its being unclean
is denoted that it is impure, 10, 130. But a difficulty is presented in this verse and that 
preceding which needs to be removed. It is that neither the rock-badger nor the hare are 

120

ruminating animals, or chew the cud like the camel, and yet we are here told that they both do 
so. The explanation, however, is that, in all probability, the term "bringing up the cud" is 
applied to these animals as well as the camel, because they have the habit of remasticating 
some small portion of the food reserved in the hollow of the cheek, and also, when in repose, 
of working their incisor teeth one upon another, through which they are kept fit for the purpose
of nibbling; and that therefore they were reckoned, by the sacred writer, among animals that 
really chew the cud, all of which, we are told, with the exception of the camel, are bisulca, or 
have the hoof divided. Nor does this supposition at all weaken the literal statement in the 
Word, as we know that its ultimate sense contains appearances of truth, and also that the 
correspondential value of an expression is not any the less because the literal statement is not 
historically true, as, for example, when it is said that the sun stood still, or that the Lord, in His
temptations, was carried to an exceedingly high mountain to see all the kingdoms of the world 
in a moment of time. But see, for further particulars, Kitto's Encyclopedia, under the articles 
"Shaphan" and "Hare," and then this matter will be more fully understood.

7. The swine denotes the greedy love of acquiring wealth, which is avarice, or covetousness, 
simply corporeal, 1742; parting the hoof and being cloven-footed denotes the capacity for 
being brought into correspondence with spiritual love; and not chewing the cud denotes not 
reflecting upon truths, ver. 3; while being unclean denotes spiritual impurity, 10130.

8. Not eating of their flesh denotes that the spiritual man may not appropriate such affections, 

2187; not touching their carcases denotes not the least indulgence in them, 4404, 10199, 3900;
and being unclean denotes spiritual impurity, 10130.

9. All that are in the waters denote the truths of the Word, 2702; eating denotes appropriation, 
2187; fishes denote scientifics, 40, 991; the fins of fishes, like the feet and legs of man or of 
animals, denote the natural powers by which progress in spiritual life is made, 4381, 4382, 
4383; the scales denote those things which are only external, and in this case ultimate truths 
expressed in good works, 6693; and inmost truths respectively, 2702.

10. All that have not fins and scales denote truths that are not cultivated with a view to spiritual 

progress, and that are not embodied in ultimates for that purpose, ver. 9; in the seas, rivers and 
waters denotes whether interior, inmost or external, ver. 9; those things that move in the 
waters, and the living creatures that are in the waters, denote things sensual and corporeal, 40, 
41; and their being an abomination denotes that they are infernal and defiled, 6052, 7454.

11. Their being an abomination, repeated, denotes that such things are perpetually infernal and 

defiled, 618, 5253; not eating of their flesh denotes not to be appropriated, 2187; and to have 
their carcases in abomination denotes non-indulgence in the least, 3900, 6052.

12. Not having fins nor scales denotes not having regard to spiritual progress and to the uses of 
life, ver. 9; being an abomination denotes that such things are infernal and defiled, and 
therefore cannot be appropriated, 6052; and it is said "acquired in the external memory," 
because the two verses immediately preceding clearly have reference, respectively, in the 
spiritual sense, to what is interior and internal.

13. By birds or birds are denoted what has relation to things rational and intellectual, and thus to 
the thoughts, 40; an abomination is what is infernal and defiled, 6052; by not being eaten is 
denoted non-appropriation, 2187; by the eagle are denoted inmost falsities arising from the 

121

abuse of the rational faculty as to the will, 3901; by the gier-eagle are denoted similar falsities 
as to the understanding, 3901; and by the ospray are denoted similar falsities as to life or 
action, because it also was an eagle, 3901. Kitto, art. "Ozniyah."

14. The kite denotes interior falsities of the same kind, because it is a bird of prey of an inferior 

order compared with the eagles; and the same remark may be applied to the falcon, the former 
denoting what is of the will and the latter what is of the understanding, 778, 866, 988; Job 
28:7.

15. And every raven after its kind, denotes ultimate falsities in the interior degree of the mind, 

866, "after its kind" evidently denoting, in this verse and the preceding, "according to its 
nature" spiritually, that is, there are various species of affections and thoughts, even as there 
are various species of animals and birds, Gen 1:11, 12; 775.

16. As the previous three verses refer to whatever has relation to the abuse of the rational powers, 
so this and the following verse describe abuses of the natural powers, while verses 18 and 19 
treat of the abuses of the sensual powers, as is clear from the series, there being really three 
divisions of birds named, each consisting of seven, both here and in Deut 14:12-18, with the 
exception that in this series, in ver. 14, only two are named instead of three in the parallel 
passage of the latter book; but of this we shall speak further on, now merely observing that 
three sevens, or twenty-one, correspond to completeness and holiness in the best sense, and to 
completeness of vastation and profanity in the opposite sense, 2788, 433, 5268. Hence, then, 
the ostrich denotes inmost falsities from evil in the natural mind, Sum. Exp. under Lam 4:3, 
the night-hawk denotes interior falsities from evil, and the sea-mew denotes external falsities 
from evil, all of the first degree there, according to the series; and the hawk denotes inmost 
falsities from evil, Job 39:26.

17. The little owl denotes interior falsities from evil, 866, 4967, and the cormorant denotes 

external falsities from evil, of the second degree there, according to the series; and the great 
owl denotes ultimate or lowest falsities, of the third degree there, according to the series, 866, 
4967, Isaiah 34:11.

18. The horned owl, 866, 4967, the pelican, Ps 102:6, and the vulture, denote falsities inmost, 

interior and external respectively in the first degree of the sensual affections, according to the 
series.

19. The stork, Zec 5:9, the heron and the hoopoe denote falsities inmost, interior and external 

respectively in the second degree there, according to the series; and the bat denotes falsities of 
the lowest kind in the third degree there, according to the series, Isaiah 2:20, 8932, 10582.

20. All winged creeping things denote every thought and feeling of the unregenerate will, having 
the appearance of spiritual life, 9331, 8764; going upon all four denotes what is degraded and 
defiled, 247, 248; and an abomination denotes the same degraded and defiled state confirmed, 
6052.

21. Winged creeping things that go upon all four, here denote lower affections which can be 
elevated above what is merely sensual, and corporeal, 994; having legs above their feet 
denotes communication with higher good and truth than the merely natural, 10050; leaping 
upon the earth, like walking, denotes activity and progress in spiritual life, 8420; and to eat 
denotes to appropriate, 2187.

122

22. By the various kinds of locusts here named are signified the lowest good affections of the will 
and understanding, interior and exterior, each according to its nature, 7643, 775. But see Kitto,
Encyclopaedia, art. "Chagab."

23. All winged creeping things which have four feet, denote sensual and corporeal delights and 
pleasures which are not in subordination to the spiritual life, because there is with them the 
conjunction of falsity with evil, 9331, 1686; and an abomination denotes what is infernal and 
defiled, 6052.

24. "By these you shall become unclean" evidently denotes certain practices that are impure, 

10130; touching denotes contact or indulgence spiritually, 10130; and until evening denotes 
until the end of one state and the commencement of another, 7844.

25. Hence by bearing of the carcase is denoted to think from what is void of spiritual life, that is, 
from evil, 8764, 3900; by washing the clothes is denoted the purification of the external, 3147,
1073; and by being unclean until the evening is denoted impurity until a change of state, 
10130, 7844.

26. Beasts parting the hoof denote affections corresponding with spiritual affections externally, 44,
7729, 1832; not cloven footed denotes not corresponding with spiritual affections internally, 
2162, 1832, 4171, ver. 3; not chewing the cud denotes not leading to reflection upon truth with
a view to good, ver. 3; what is unclean denotes what is impure spiritually, 10130; and touching
denotes contact spiritually, 10130.

27. Whatsoever goes upon its paws denotes every affection which is grossly natural, 2162, 4403; 
animals going upon all four denote affection which conjoin evil with falsity, and therefore do 
not admit of conjunction with spiritual affections in the course of life, 9331, 1686, 8420; what 
is unclean denotes spiritual impurity, 10130; and touching the carcase denotes contact with 
affections void of spiritual life, 10130, 3900; while being unclean until evening denotes 
impurity until a change of state, 7844.

28. Bearing or carrying the carcase denotes merely thinking of such evils in the ordinary course of
life, 8764, 3900; washing the clothes denotes the purification of the external man, 3147, 1073; 
being unclean until the evening denotes impurity until a change of state, 10130, 7844; and 
"they are unclean to you" denotes evidently confirmation of the truth concerning the things 
impure both as to the internal and external of the Natural, and as to the will and under-
standing, 3388, 6663. Observe also that the states of contact with the "carcases" of the old and 
dead states continues, with the good, through life, and more or less through the process of 
judgement; and that this also is denoted by being unclean until the evening, the washing of the 
clothes denoting the continual course of purification.

29. Creeping things that creep upon the earth denotes sensual and corporeal affections, 9231; the 
weasel or mole denotes wilful ignorance of the truth through sensual love, Kitto, art. "Choled 
Weasel," 1994; the mouse denotes avarice, 938, 954; and the great lizard denotes the delights 
of merely corporeal affections, according to their nature, 994, 775. Kitto, art. "Isab."

30. The animals here named denote various evils and falsities derived from corporeal affection, 

since four of them are supposed to have been lizards of some kind, and the chameleon is a 
lizard. Hence the interpretation given, namely, the perversion of good by falsities interiorly; 
the corruption of truth by evils interiorly; the perversion of good exteriorly; the corruption of 

123

truth exteriorly; and the delusions of the senses arising from fallacious appearances, 994. 
Kitto, arts. "Anakah," "Coach," "Letaah," "Chomet" and "Tinshemeth," or "Chameleon."

31. Unclean creeping things denote impure affections of the lowest character, 994, 10130; 

touching denotes contact spiritually, 10130; a carcase, or what is dead denotes what is void of 
spiritual life, 3900; and being unclean until the evening denotes impurity until a change of 
state, 7844.

32. In this verse and the previous, being dead also denotes complete vastation, 6119; a dead thing 
therefore falling upon another thing denotes accidental indulgence in evil, because it is 
accidental contact, 10130; uncleanness denotes spiritual impurity, 10130; a vessel of wood 
denotes the will as a receptacle, 643; clothing denotes the understanding as a receptacle, 2189;
skin denotes, like clothing, also truth as a receptacle, 9215, and sack also denotes the same, 
5489, and thus again the former has relation to the understanding and the latter to the will, 
683, while the first pair of terms denotes what is relatively external, and the second what is 
relatively internal, 9215; whatever vessel by which any work is done denotes a receptacle that 
can be applied to some use, 1472; putting it into water denotes purification by the truth, 3147; 
being unclean until the evening denotes impurity until a change of state, 10130, 7844; and 
being then clean denotes, evidently, a state in which the external faculty, signified by the 
vessel, can serve its appointed use, because it is brought into harmony with the internal, 1487.

33. Here an earthen vessel denotes a merely natural receptacle defiled by falsity not cohering with 

good, 10105; "whereinto any of them falls" denotes what is contaminated by sensual 
affections, vers. 29, 30; being unclean denotes spiritual impurity, because the good or use of 
that receptacle is vitiated, 10130; and the vessel being broken denotes that the receptacle is to 
be separated, 9163.

34. Food therein which may be eaten denotes the good of the receptacle which may be 

appropriated, 1480, 2187; water here denotes falsities, 10130; drink denotes truth, 3168; and 
what is unclean denotes spiritual impurity, 10130.

35. By "everything" is denoted what is external, as is clear from what follows, and a carcase 

denotes what is void of spiritual life, 3900; what is unclean denotes impurity, 10130; by an 
oven is denoted natural or external delight or love, good or bad, 7356; to be broken in pieces 
denotes separation, 9163; and "shall be unclean" evidently denotes the continuance of 
impurity.

36. By a fountain or a pit, wherein is a gathering of water, is denoted a general receptacle of good 
or truth, namely the memory, or the Word, 3424, 679; and to be clean denotes purity, as is 
evident, while the water touching a carcase denotes truth brought into contact, or 
contaminated, with what is void of spiritual life, 2702, 3900, and therefore unclean.

37. Seed which is to be sown denotes a state of instruction in truths, 932; a carcase, or a part of it, 
falling upon it, denotes the contamination of truth by evil in the thought, 3900, ver. 32; and 
being clean denotes freedom from impurity, 10130.

38. Here by water being put upon the seed is denoted falsity mixed with truth deliberately, 10130, 
ver. 34, 932; a carcase denotes evil also defiling the truth, 3900; and uncleanness denotes 
impurity, 10130.

124

39. A beast that may be eaten denotes an affection that may be appropriated, 44, 2187; dying 

denotes spiritual death, or vastation, 6119; touching the carcase denotes indulgence in that 
dead affection, 10130, 3900; being unclean denotes impurity, 10130; and until evening denotes
until a change of state, 7844, ver. 28, note.

40. Eating of the carcase denotes the appropriation of that affection in its dead state, 2187, 3900; 

being unclean until the evening denotes impurity until a change of state, 10130, 7844; washing
the clothes denotes the purification of the external man, 3147, 1073; and bearing the carcase 
denotes to think with favour of that dead state, 8764, 3900.

41. The creeping thing that creeps upon the earth denotes a sensual and corporeal affection, 9331; 
an abomination denotes what is infernal and defiled, thus what is impure, 6052; and its not 
being eaten denotes that it may not be appropriated, 2187.

42. What goes upon its belly denotes a merely sensual affection, 247, 248; what goes upon all 

four, what is disposed, in the course of life to the conjunction of falsity with evil, 1686; having
many feet clearly denotes what is intensely natural or sensual, 2162; not eating denotes non-
appropriation, 2187; and an abomination is what is infernal and defiled, 6052.

43. Not making oneself abominable with any creeping thing denotes not deliberately indulging in 

merely sensual affections, 6052, 9331; rind not making oneself unclean denotes not 
deliberately becoming impure and defiled, 10130.

44. " I am the Lord your God" denotes that the Lord is good itself and truth itself united, 2001; to 

be sanctified and to be holy denotes I hat the man of the church should be holy by the 
conjunction of these in himself, since the Lord is holiness itself by that union, 4211, 8887; and
not being defiled with the creeping thing denotes that the spiritual man should not defile 
himself with any sensual affections separated from the higher life, 9331, 10130.

45. The Lord God bringing the children of Israel from Egyptian bondage, denotes the deliverance 
of the spiritual from the bondage of the merely natural man, 8866; and the outward holiness of
the Israelites denotes genuine holiness from the Lord, 8788.

46. The law of the beast and the bird, and of every living creature that moves in the waters and on 
the earth, denotes the laws of Divine Order concerning natural affections of the will and 
understanding, and concerning sensual and corporeal affections, 44, 40, 991, 9331

47. To make a difference between the unclean and the clean is to distinguish what is impure from 
what is pure in man's affections and thoughts, 10130; and to make a difference between the 
living thing that may be eaten and the living thing that may not be eaten, is to distinguish 
between good affections from the Lord that may be appropriated, and evil affections from 
man, or from the hells, that may not be appropriated, 2187. 

Discussion

This interesting chapter, regarded as a whole, clearly demonstrates the absolute necessity of particular 
and continual purification from evil and falsity in the course of regeneration. And it also shows 
especially that good and truth cannot be appropriated from the Lord through the internal man in the 
natural man in all fullness without such purification. Well, therefore, may the spiritual man exclaim in 

125

the language of the Word, "Search me, O God, and know my heart: try me, and know my thoughts; and 
see if there be any wickedness in me, and lead me in the way everlasting" (Ps 139:23, 24).

But the Lord knows the particular state of every man without any searching. It is we ourselves who 
require to search our affections, our thoughts and our actions every day by the light of truth from the 
Word, in order that we may see ourselves and co-operate with the Lord in the process of our 
purification. And how very precise we must be is evident not only from the words just quoted, but from
all the particulars of the internal sense of this part of the Word.

In reviewing it, therefore, we may be, at the same time, examining ourselves. And first of all it is 
remarkable that this description of what we are to appropriate, and of what we are not to appropriate, 
follows what is said on this subject at the close of the previous account of corrupted worship where the 
loss of the good of innocence in the natural man, and of worship from that good, are considered. And 
why? Because unless we are purified in the particular ways now described we cannot receive the 
kingdom of God as little children, and appropriate that good of innocence in all fullness.

To appropriate is to incorporate in our life what comes from another source, as in eating and drinking 
we make those things a part of our bodies which are supplied by natural laws. And as we cannot eat and
drink anything not properly adapted as food, so we cannot appropriate discordant affections. That is, 
the spiritual man cannot do this. We see from the series that two things are necessary for us in this 
respect. As regards the affections we may make our own, they must be in harmony with what comes 
from the Lord, and must be the result of due reflection at the same time. For example, a disposition 
naturally kind agrees with love to the Lord and love to the neighbour, but if it is simply natural, and 
acts without discrimination and reflection, it cannot, and ought not, to become a substantial part of our 
life. And on the other hand, we may cultivate an affection by very careful thought, and yet it may not 
be good for us because it does not agree with genuine good from the Lord. Hence, then, we learn how 
important it is in taking our spiritual food to combine good with genuine truth, and truth with genuine 
good. Thoughtless charity is very bad for us, and deliberated selfishness is a great deal worse; for the 
former does not spiritually "chew the cud," and the latter does not "divide the hoof."

Hence, then, as the series shows, a selfish love of knowledge, an intellectual love of knowledge merely,
and still worse a sensual love of knowledge, do not truly nourish the man, nor, on the other hand, does 
covetousness, which is altogether opposed to the life of good from our heavenly Father.

And the same thing holds good in respect to truths even acquired from the Word. The Word is the great 
ocean of spiritual truth, which is without limit because it is from a Divine source; and the living 
principles of truth are the fishes therein. But they must be acquired for the sake of spiritual progress, 
and for the sake of usefulness, that is, for the sake of truth and goodness. But the study of the Word for 
any other reason results in impurity.

Also as it is with the great ocean of merely natural knowledge in the Word, so it is with those things to 
which the birds of the air correspond. We are not indeed told so in this account, but nevertheless it is 
true that of all clean birds we may eat (Deut. xiv. n). That is to say, we may appropriate freely the pure 
truths of the Word. But falsified truths of all kinds, and falsities merely we may not assimilate, because 
they are impure.

The next paragraph is very important, as relating to the sensual affections, and as indicating a 
distinction most carefully to be observed in actual life. It is often erroneously thought that the lowest 
affections of man, called sensual and corporeal, are altogether to be rejected in order to live truly the 

126

higher life. But a just consideration of this matter shows that man is not really endowed with any 
faculty or function by the reception of life which is evil in itself, but that it only becomes evil by abuse.
For to eternity man, as an angel, will not be without those ultimate affections and delights which are 
necessary to make up the perfect human life. Hence, then, the particular distinction in regard to the 
creeping things going upon all four, or having four feet. Wherever in sensual delights, therefore, there 
is the conjunction of evil with falsity there is impurity; but if, on the contrary, there is due 
subordination, and the harmony of sensual and corporeal delights with celestial and spiritual delights, 
there is the true appropriation of ultimate truth and good which renders man full and perfect. For is it 
not written, "Seek you first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things shall be 
added to you"? (Matt 6:33).

Then from what immediately follows we learn that there may be external correspondence without 
internal and without proper reflection, that is, there may be the outward appearance of good without 
good and truth internally; and it must be evident that this is hypocrisy and deceit. Hence, therefore, the 
very particular caution to avoid the slightest impurity from contact with such wickedness, which is 
signified by touching the carcase; and also, if such contact should be even accidental, impurity would 
follow, which could not be removed until evening, that is, until a change of state. Consider now, in this 
connection, how evil thoughts are stirred up in us by evil spirits, and how necessary it is, in 
regeneration, to reject such thoughts at once as no part of our life, lest by the encouragement we accord
to them greater evil and impurity should be the result; for although we are not responsible for having 
such evil thoughts, which are, as it were, like the dead bodies of past evil states, yet we are responsible 
for the attitude we assume towards them. And we know, besides, that both the tares and the wheat in us 
are to grow together until the harvest, which is the evening in reality of our probationary state; and (hat 
then only will they disappear before the glorious dawn of the heavenly life in its freedom and its peace.

And now, lastly, let us very carefully reflect upon the nice distinctions that are made in the spiritual 
sense of the latter part of this description of what may, and what may not, be incorporated in our eternal
spiritual life. For very truly genuine good and truth cannot be contaminated; nor can real wickedness 
and profanity be converted into what is holy and pure, while yet this may appear to be the case in the 
individual who is not, as yet, so fully purified that he can realize the angelic life. And let us remember 
with gratitude, and not with fear, that of every idle word that man shall speak he shall give an account 
thereof in the day of Judgement (Matt 12:36). And also let us not forget that even to eternity, in heaven 
itself, will there be left some room for the improvement of our state, and thus for the extension of our 
usefulness, although we shall never depart from our allotted function in the Grand Man, 1276, 1377.

Leviticus Chapter 12

Summary of the Spiritual Sense

1. Instruction is given to the man of the church that in the insemination, conception and birth of 

truth with him there is impurity in the proprium, and purity internally, even as is the case in the 
course of regeneration, vers. 1-2. 

2. But when the state of regeneration is completed there is purity even in the ultimate; and this 

state of purification is accomplished according to the laws of Order, vers. 3-4. 

3. Also in the reception and acknowledgement of good the state of purification involves the 

conjunction of good with truth, and is according to the laws of Order, ver. 5. 

4. And when the state of purification and regeneration is completed, then the Lord will be 

worshiped from the good of innocence; there will be reconciliation with the Lord, or of the 
External with the Internal; and this takes place both with celestial and spiritual men, vers. 6-8. 

The Contents of each Verse

1. And the LORD spoke to Moses, 

1. There is revelation from the Lord by Divine Truth 

saying, 

giving perception,

2. Speak to the children of Israel, 

saying, If a woman conceive seed, 
and bear a man child, then she shall 
be unclean seven days; as in the days
of the impurity of her sickness shall 
she be unclean. 

3. And in the eighth day the flesh of his
foreskin shall be circumcised. 

4. And she shall continue in the blood 
of her purifying three and thirty 
days; she shall touch no hallowed 
thing, nor come into the sanctuary, 
until the days of her purifying be 
fulfilled. 

2. To the man of the Spiritual Church, and instructing
him, that when, in the church, universal, general or
particular, truth from the Lord is inseminated, and 
conceived and born, then there is a state of 
impurity in the proprium or External, and of 
holiness from the Lord in the Internal, even as, in 
the course of regeneration, when good is, as yet, 
separated from truth, there is impurity.

3. But when the state of regeneration is completed, 
and the new state of spiritual life commences, all 
impurity is removed, even in the ultimate of the 
Natural, or in the natural degree.

4. And the state of purification following the 

reception and acknowledgement of truth, must be 
completed according to order; nor can truth be 
fully realized or good be fully enjoyed until 
purification from evil is perfect.

128

5. But if she bear a maid child, then she
shall be unclean two weeks, as in her
impurity: and she shall continue in 
the blood of her purifying threescore
and six-days. 

6. And when the days of her purifying 
are fulfilled, for a son, or for a 
daughter, she shall bring a lamb of 
the first year for a burnt offering, and
a young pigeon, or a turtledove, for a
sin offering, to the door of the tent of
meeting, to the priest: 

5. But in the case of the reception and 

acknowledgement of good the state of purification 
must involve the conjunction of good with truth; 
and the process of purification following must also
be completed according to, order.

6. And when purification from evil is completed for 
the reception and acknowledgement of truth or of 
good, then the worship of the Lord from the good 
of innocence will be complete and perpetual, and 
the remission or removal of falsity and evil by a 
state of innocence accordingly will take place; or 
the Lord will be worshiped from the good of 
innocence internally and externally, by the 
acknowledgement of Him and of His operation 
through the heavens from a state of good.

7. And he shall offer it before the 

7. And in his state of worship the reconciliation or 

LORD, and make atonement for her; 
and she shall be cleansed from the 
fountain of her blood. This is the law
for her that beareth, whether a male 
or a female. 

8. And if her means suffice not for a 
lamb, then she shall take two 
turtledoves, or two young pigeons; 
the one for a burnt offering, and the 
other for a sin offering: and the priest
shall make atonement for her, and 
she shall be clean. 

agreement of man with the Lord, or of the External
with the Internal, will be effected, because all 
impurity will be removed. And this is the law of 
regeneration with regard to the reception, 
acknowledgement, and realization of truth and of 
good.

8. But if the regenerating member of the church is 
unable in completing life's work to worship the 
Lord from celestial good, and thus to become an 
angel of the third heaven, he shall do so from 
spiritual good, and become an angel of the second 
or of the ultimate heaven, by the worship of the 
Lord from charity, and by the removal of evil 
according to that state. And thus also there will be 
complete purification.

Discussion

A consideration of this short chapter necessarily involves a consideration of the process of regeneration
or of the new birth, spoken of by the Lord in so interesting a manner in John 3:1-15. "Except a man be 
born again he cannot see the kingdom of God"; and "Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit he
cannot enter into the kingdom of God." Here there is an emphatic repetition with a peculiar difference. 
It is now generally understood in the Christian Church what these words imply spiritually. We can all 
clearly discern what is meant when it is said, "That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is 
born of the Spirit is spirit," and also how perfectly distinct, and even antagonistic, are "the flesh" and 
"the spirit."

But this ought not to be; and truly this state of opposition is really caused by man himself, when he 
chooses the "old" life and rejects the "new" life. And yet when, on the other hand, he chooses the "new"
life, that new life is grounded in the old; for the church is formed in the proprium or proper life of man, 
and cannot be otherwise formed, 252. This is the initial teaching of our chapter. It is the woman who 
conceives seed. But the woman here, as the church in the proprium, denotes affection. In order, 
therefore, that the church may be formed in us there must be the love of the truth, even the love of the 
truth for its own sake. In order to be regenerated we must love the truth. And when we consider the 
character of the proprium which thus loves we can understand what follows. The affection in which the
church is formed in us at first is not a pure affection, or a pure love of the truth.

For, observe, during the whole of regeneration there is impurity more or less until it is completed. This 
is what the Word teaches; and it is according to the experience of him who is regenerated. And even the
Lord in His glorification continued to be affected by the hereditary life derived from the mother until 
His resurrection. Now it may cause sadness to think of our impurity in this way; but, on the other hand, 
let us receive consolation from the thought that in the end this state of impurity will be certain to cease, 
notwithstanding the fact that in heaven itself there is not absolute purity. That is, we can never become 
so pure that greater purity is not possible.

And in proceeding we notice next the difference between the conception of a son and the conception of 
a daughter. There is first in regeneration the realization of the love of truth, and afterwards good is 
realized. And on the surface it may appear a strange thing that there should be such a difference in the 
state of legal impurity here indicated. Why should the period of uncleanness and of the remains of 
impurity have been doubled when the maid child was born? Correspondentially two weeks, or twice 
seven days, have the same general signification, and so also have sixty-six and thirty-three. But the 
doubling indicates an important process. It denotes, as we have seen, that when good is conceived there
is the conjunction of good with truth. A man has no conjunction with the Lord by truth merely, but only
communication in this way. But still the love of the truth prepares the way. The practical truth, 
therefore, which is here taught by this doubling is that perfect regeneration is conjunction with the Lord
through the conjunction of good and truth. But what is our part in this matter? It is that we should 
consistently obey the truth, or live according to it, in order that this conjunction may be effected. Truth 
and good may, indeed, be potentially conjoined in us through the love of the truth; but good and truth 
are not actually-conjoined except by obedience. "If you love me," said the Lord, "keep my 
commandments." And thus we may see how it is that the church is really and fully formed in the 
proprium of man. It is because the conjunction here spoken of is not only the marriage of good and 
truth internally, but is also the marriage of good internally with truth externally, or it is the conjunction 
of the external or natural man with the internal or spiritual man, by the removal of impurity through the
practice of the truth.

131

And now we have to consider the result of regeneration. It is a law of Divine Orders that regeneration 
precedes, and that purification follows, 10239. It may, indeed, appear to some that purification should 
precede and regeneration follow, because outwardly man must be reformed before he is regenerated. 
But evidently, unless a man "be first born anew he has no spiritual life, and how can one who is 
spiritually dead be purified? The truth is, then, that although external purification precedes complete 
regeneration, yet all through life regeneration comes first and purification follows successively; and 
this purification is represented in our chapter by circumcision on the eighth day, and by the sin offering.
But here again we are to note that the offerings which represent the genuine worship of the Lord are 
mentioned in due order, for the burnt offering precedes the sin offering. The result of regeneration, 
therefore, is that there is the pure worship of the Lord from a state of heavenly good grounded in 
innocence both internally and externally, followed by complete purification, namely, that state of 
purification in heaven which precludes further temptations. For no one in heaven can be tempted, 
although he does continue to be more and more purified even to eternity. How, then, can we conceive 
what our perfect state in heaven shall be when two thousand years of earthly time shall have passed 
away? Surely, however, we shall be the same persons as we are now by regeneration, and shall be 
delighted in the performance of our heavenly function in the Grand Man, with an increase and intensity
of wisdom and love of which now we can form no adequate idea. And, therefore, even now, while we 
are so far below in the valley, and while we are awaiting our Judgement, let us take courage, and run 
with patience and indomitable perseverance the race set before us. For we may depend upon it that— 
"All's for the best, be a man but confiding, Providence tenderly governs the rest, And the frail barque of
His creature is guiding Wisely and warily, all for the best. All's for the best; then fling away terrors; 
Meet all your friends and your foes in the van; And, in the midst of your dangers or errors. Trust like a 
child, while you strive like a man."

The Contents of each Verse

1. And the LORD spoke to Moses and 

1. There is revelation from the Lord to those who are 

to Aaron, saying, 

in truth and in good giving the perception.

2. When a man shall have in the skin of
his flesh a rising, or a scab, or a 
bright spot, and it become in the skin
of his flesh the plague of leprosy, 
then he shall be brought to Aaron the
priest, or to one of his sons the 
priests: 

3. And the priest shall look on the 

plague in the skin of the flesh: and if 
the hair in the plague be turned 
white, and the appearance of the 
plague be deeper than the skin of his 
flesh, it is the plague of leprosy: and 
the priest shall look on him, and 
pronounce him unclean. 

2. That when, in the external man derived from the 
internal, evil affections or lusts from sensual, 
worldly, or selfish love are active, and cause there 
the profanation of truth, then the person in such a 
state is brought under the influence of Divine 
Good, or of Divine Truth thence proceeding.

3. And from Divine Good by means of Divine Truth, 
examination is made of the state of the external 
man derived from the internal, as to profanation; 
and if the falsities from those affections have 
corrupted the truths there, and at the same time this
corruption is from the internal man where also 
there is the acknowledgement of the Lord and faith
in Him, then there is profanation; and this is 
perceived and revealed from Divine Good to be 
impurity.

133

4. And if the bright spot be white in the
skin of his flesh, and the appearance 
thereof be not deeper than the skin, 
and the hair thereof be not turned 
white, then the priest shall shut up 
him that has the plague seven days: 

4. But if the lusts of self-love have corrupted the 
truths of the external man derived from the 
internal, and this corruption is only external, and 
falsities from those lusts have not perverted those 
truths, then by the influence of good operating in 
those truths, there is a holy state of self-restraint.

5. And the priest shall look on him the 
seventh day: and, behold, if in his 
eyes the plague be at a stay, and the 
plague be not spread in the skin, then
the priest shall shut him up seven 
days more: 

5. On the completion of which the influence of good 
is more strongly felt; and if then evil is controlled, 
and the truths of the external man are not further 
corrupted, a second state of restraint under the 
influence of good occurs.

6. And the priest shall look on him 

6. And on its completion the influence of good is still

again the seventh day: and, behold, 
if the plague be dim, and the plague 
be not spread in the skin, then the 
priest shall pronounce him clean: it 
is a scab: and he shall wash his 
clothes, and be clean. 

more powerful, and then if the tendency to 
corruption is further weakened, and the truths of 
the External are not vitiated, there is no 
profanation, although there is corruption through 
worldly love, and purification as to truths must 
follow.

7. But if the scab spread abroad in the 
skin, after that he has shown himself 
to the priest for his cleansing, he 
shall show himself to the priest 
again: 

7. But if corruption from worldly love continues, 
notwithstanding the influence of restraint from 
good for purification in successive states in all 
completeness, that influence is again exerted;

8. And the priest shall look, and, 

behold, if the scab be spread in the 
skin, then the priest shall pronounce 
him unclean: it is leprosy. 

8. And if, on examination, corruption continues and 
extends, then profanation is the result, and there is 
impurity, since the influence of good in the course 
of regeneration has been fully opposed.

9. When the plague of leprosy is in a 

9. And again, when man is in profanation, he is even 

man, then he shall be brought to the 
priest; 

then under the influence of Divine Good;

10. And the priest shall look, and, 

10. And then there is examination from good by truth, 

behold, if there be a white rising in 
the skin, and it have turned the hair 
white, and there be quick raw flesh 
in the rising, 

and if the truths in the external man be corrupted 
by sensual lust, and falsities from that lust have 
also perverted truths, and there are also at the same
time acknowledgement of the Lord and faith in 
Him;

134

11. It is an old leprosy in the skin of his 
flesh, and the priest shall pronounce 
him unclean: he shall not shut him 
up; for he is unclean. 

11. It is a state of the confirmed profanation of truths 
in the external man derived from the internal, and 
it is the testimony of truth from good that there is 
impurity in consequence; one in such a state 
cannot be further restrained; and he is impure 
internally as well as externally.

12. And if the leprosy break out abroad 
in the skin, and the leprosy cover all 
the skin of him that has the plague 
from his head even to his feet, as far 
as appears to the priest; 

12. Again, if any one be in the profanation of truth in 
the external man completely, from the love of self, 
which is inmost, to sensual love which is the 
ultimate, according to the testimony of truth from 
good.

13. Then the priest shall look: and, 

behold, if the leprosy have covered 
all his flesh, he shall pronounce him 
clean that has the plague: it is all 
turned white: he is clean. 

13. Then also examination takes place, and if the 
profanation is entire, but arises only from the 
knowledge of the truth, and from no internal 
acknowledgement and faith, then Divine Good by 
Divine Truth perceives that such a person is pure 
from profanation inwardly.

14. But whenever raw flesh appears in 

14. But if there be internal acknowledgement and faith

him, he shall be unclean. 

there is then impurity;

15. And the priest shall look on the raw 
flesh, and pronounce him unclean: 
the raw flesh is unclean: it is leprosy.

16. Or if the raw flesh turn again, and be
changed to white, then he shall come
to the priest, 

17. And the priest shall look on him: 

and, behold, if the plague be turned 
into white, then the priest shall 
pronounce him clean that has the 
plague: he is clean. 

18. And when the flesh has in the skin 
thereof a boil, and it is healed, 

15. And Divine Good by Divine Truth perceives and 

declares that this is so; for the corruption of the 
truth, when there is acknowledgement and faith, is 
genuine internal profanation.

16. But if a person in this profanation ceases to 

acknowledge the Lord and to have faith in Him, so
that profanation is then only external, he must 
come again under the influence of Divine Good;

17. And if, by Divine Truth, it is perceived that there 
is no longer acknowledgement and faith, then, 
from good, it is declared that such a person is pure 
from internal profanation.

18. And when the life of the spiritual man, as to the 
external, where are truths in the memory, is 
vitiated by the filthiness and impurity of merely 
sensual love, and this is outwardly cured by the 
influence of the truth,

19. And in the place of the boil there is a

white rising, or a bright spot, 
reddish-white, then it shall be 
showed to the priest; 

19. Whilst that life remains inwardly, and the truth is 
corrupted by that love, or by selfish love, so that 
good appears as if combined with falsity, Divine 
Good will influence that state.

135

20. And the priest shall look, and, 

20. And if investigation by Divine Truth from good 

behold, if the appearance thereof be 
lower than the skin, and the hair 
thereof be turned white, then the 
priest shall pronounce him unclean: 
it is the plague of leprosy, it has 
broken out in the boil. 

21. But if the priest look on it, and, 
behold, there be no white hairs 
therein, and it be not lower than the 
skin, but be dim, then the priest shall
shut him up seven days: 

22. And if it spread abroad in the skin, 
then the priest shall pronounce him 
unclean: it is a plague. 

shows that there is really some acknowledgement 
and faith, and, in addition, the corruption of the 
truth by falsities; then there is impurity, and the 
profanation of truth is caused by the predominance
of sensual love.

21. But if examination from good shows that falsities 

from the evil of sensual love have not corrupted 
the truth, and that there is no acknowledgement 
and faith, but only outward impurity, then must the
spiritual man be restrained by a state of external 
holiness in the course of regeneration.

22. And if there is an extension of the corruption 

wilfully, then from good by truth it is proved that 
there is the profanation of truth with a strong 
tendency to the destruction of remains.

23. But if the bright spot stay in its 

place, and be not spread, it is the scar
of the boil; and the priest shall 
pronounce him clean. 

23. But if the influence of corruption by selfish love is 
checked, there are only the remains of the impurity
of sensual love; and from good it is declared that 
there is no impurity.

24. Or when the flesh has in the skin 
thereof a burning by fire, and the 
quick flesh of the burning become a 
bright spot, reddish-white, or white; 

25. Then the priest shall look upon it: 

and, behold, if the hair in the bright 
spot be turned white, and the 
appearance thereof be deeper than 
the skin; it is leprosy, it has broken 
out in the burning: and the priest 
shall pronounce him unclean: it is 
the plague of leprosy. 

24. And again, when the life of the spiritual man as to 
the external, where truths are in the memory, is 
vitiated by the ardour of worldly love from selfish 
love, and thus there is the appearance as if good 
were combined with falsity from either of these 
loves.

25. Then still examination is made from Divine Good; 
and if falsity from selfish and worldly love has 
corrupted the truth, there being, nevertheless, some
acknowledgement and faith, there is certainly the 
profanation of truth from the predominance of 
worldly love; it is impurity; and it tends to the 
destruction of remains.

26. But if the priest look on it, and, 

26. But if when examination is made from Divine 

behold, there be no white hair in the 
bright spot, and it be no lower than 
the skin, but be dim; then the priest 
shall shut him up seven days: 

Good by Divine Truth, falsity has not corrupted 
the truth, and there is no acknowledgement and 
faith, but only outward impurity; then again must 
the spiritual man be restrained by a state of 
outward holiness in the course of regeneration.

136

27. And the priest shall look upon him 
the seventh day: if it spread abroad 
in the skin, then the priest shall 
pronounce him unclean: it is the 
plague of leprosy. 

27. And if, at the conclusion of this state further 

examination is made, and there is an extension of 
corruption wilfully, then there is impurity, and the 
truth is profaned.

28. And if the bright spot stay in its 

28. But if selfish and worldly love are checked, and 

place, and be not spread in the skin, 
but be dim; it is the rising of the 
burning, and the priest shall 
pronounce him clean: for it is the 
scar of the burning. 

there is no wilful extension of corruption, but only 
some outward impurity; then, although worldly 
love may be active, Divine Good declares that 
there is no internal impurity, but only the remains 
of the state of selfish and worldly love.

29. And when a man or woman has a 
plague upon the head or upon the 
beard, 

29. And again, when the spiritual man has a tendency 
to destroy remains of truth and good in himself 
from intensely selfish love and its falsities;

30. Then the priest shall look on the 
plague: and, behold, if the 
appearance thereof be deeper than 
the skin, and there be in it yellow 
thin hair, then the priest shall 
pronounce him unclean: it is an itch, 
it is leprosy of the head or of the 
beard. 

30. Then also examination is made from Divine Good 
as to this tendency; and if, in this case, there are 
some acknowledgement and faith, and falsity from
infernal selfish love has intensely corrupted the 
truth, there is certainly impurity, and profanation 
of the truth from a state of depravity arising from 
this love and its falsity.

31. And if the priest look on the plague 

31. But if examination from Divine Good by Divine 

of the itch, and, behold, the 
appearance thereof be not deeper 
than the skin, and there be no black 
hair in it, then the priest shall shut up
him that has the plague of the itch 
seven days: 

Truth shows that there is really no 
acknowledgement and faith, and that truth is not 
utterly vastated, then there is from Divine Good a 
state of restraint and holiness in the course of 
regeneration.

32. And in the seventh day the priest 
shall look on the plague: and, 
behold, if the itch be not spread, and 
there be in it no yellow hair, and the 
appearance of the itch be not deeper 
than the skin, 

32. But at the conclusion of this state, examination is 
again made from Divine Good, and then if there is 
no wilful extension of the corruption, and intense 
falsity from selfish love has not corrupted the 
truth, while there is no acknowledgement and 
faith,

33. Then he shall be shaven, but the itch 
shall he not shave; and the priest 
shall shut up him that has the itch 
seven days more: 

33. Then falsities from selfish love are to be rejected, 
but that love itself is not entirely abolished, and a 
further state of restraint and holiness in the course 
of regeneration is necessary.

137

34. And in the seventh day the priest 

34. And again, at the conclusion of this state, 

shall look on the itch: and, behold, if
the itch be not spread in the skin, and
the appearance thereof be not deeper 
than the skin; then the priest shall 
pronounce him clean: and he shall 
wash his clothes, and be clean. 

examination is made; and then, if the corruption 
from selfish love is not extended where there are 
truths in the External, and at the same time there is
no acknowledgement and faith, then from Divine 
Good it is declared that there is no internal 
profanation; purification externally takes place; 
and there is no impurity.

35. But if the itch spread abroad in the 

skin after his cleansing; 

35. But if, on the other hand, there is, notwithstanding 
some purification, still a wilful extension of the 
corruption,

36. Then the priest shall look on him: 

36. Then from good by truth there is further 

and, behold, if the itch be spread in 
the skin, the priest shall not seek for 
the yellow hair; he is unclean. 

37. But if in his eyes the itch be at a stay,
and black hair be grown up therein; 
the itch is healed, he is clean: and the
priest shall pronounce him clean. 

examination, and if the corruption is wilfully 
extended, the presence of intense falsities from 
selfish love is ignored, and there is impurity by the
conjunction of evil with its falsity.

37. And if then it is clear from Divine Truth that the 

corruption is forcibly restrained from fear, because
now the vastation of all truth has taken place, then 
there is the removal of impurity outwardly; and 
Divine Good by Divine Truth declares that there is
no profanation of truth, seeing there is such 
vastation.

38. And when a man or a woman has in 

the skin of their flesh bright spots, 
even white bright spots; 

38. Again, when there is in the understanding or in the
will of any member of the church, the influence of 
selfish love, and thence the corruption of the truth;

39. Then the priest shall look: and, 

behold, if the bright spots in the skin 
of their flesh be of a dull white; it is 
a leukoderma, it has broken out in 
the skin; he is clean. 

40. And if a man's hair be fallen off his 
head, he is bald; yet is he clean. 

39. Then also is there the influence of good by truth, 
and if such corruption is only external, arising 
from the force of natural loves without evil 
intention, there is no radical impurity.

40. And if also, without evil intention, there is with 

man an incapacity to understand truth arising from 
an unknown corrupt state of the affections, this is 
not impurity.

41. And if his hair be fallen off from the 
front part of his head, he is forehead 
bald; yet is he clean. 

41. Also, if this occurs with regard to more interior 

affections, from some similar defect there, there is 
no impurity.

138

42. But if there be in the bald head, or 
the bald forehead, a reddish-white 
plague; it is leprosy breaking out in 
his bald head, or his bald forehead. 

42. But on the other hand, if one who, either as to 

interior or inmost affections, is deficient in truths, 
also has his life corrupted by a state of good 
combined with falsity, this tending to the 
destruction of remains, then also he is in the 
profanation of the little truth which remains with 
him.

43. Then the priest shall look upon him: 
and, behold, if the rising of the 
plague be reddish-white in his bald 
head, or in his bald forehead, as the 
appearance of leprosy in the skin of 
the flesh; 

43. Then such a person is brought unconsciously 
under the influence of Divine Good by Divine 
Truth; and if his state is caused by good combined 
with falsity as to interior or inmost affections, and 
thus there is the outward appearance of truth 
profaned,

44. He is a leprous man, he is unclean: 

44. He has really profaned the truth, and is impure; 

the priest shall surely pronounce him
unclean; his plague is in his head. 

45. And the leper in whom the plague is,
his clothes shall be rent, and the hair 
of his head shall go loose, and he 
shall cover his upper lip, and shall 
cry, Unclean, unclean. 

and Divine Good by Divine Truth perceives this, 
and also that his state arises from prevailing selfish
love.

45. And the man who is guilty of profanation must 

mourn on account of the loss of truth through this 
cause; for truths in his memory are not arranged in 
an orderly manner under good; he has not power to
embody the truth in his speech; and he is impure 
both as to the will and understanding.

46. All the. days wherein the plague is in

him he shall be unclean; he is 
unclean: he shall dwell alone; 
without the camp shall his dwelling 
be. 

46. Yea, he must continue impure so long as this state 
of profanation lasts; he is impure internally as well
as externally; he cannot be associated in heaven 
with the good; and he must inevitably be 
associated with the wicked in hell.

47. The garment also that the plague of 
leprosy is in, whether it be a woollen
garment, or a linen garment; 

47. Also doctrine wherein is truth mixed with falsity is
profane; and this whether it relates to good or to 
truth;

48. Whether it be in warp, or woof; of 
linen, or of woollen; whether in a 
skin, or in any thing made of skin; 

48. To interior truth or good; to exterior truth or good; 

or to ultimate truth or good.

49. If the plague be greenish or reddish 
in the garment, or in the skin, or in 
the warp, or in the woof, or in any 
thing of skin; it is the plague of 
leprosy, and shall be showed to the 
priest: 

49. Moreover, if the doctrine is corrupted by falsities 
of the understanding or will, that is, from the love 
of the world as from selfish love; whether it is 
inmost, interior or ultimate, it is profane doctrine; 
and it must be brought under the influence of 
Divine Good.

139

50. And the priest shall look upon the 
plague, and shut up that which has 
the plague seven days: 

51. And he shall look on the plague on 
the seventh day: if the plague be 
spread in the garment, either in the 
warp, or in the woof, or in the skin, 
whatever service skin is used for; the
plague is a fretting leprosy; it is 
unclean. 

52. And he shall burn the garment, 

whether the warp or the woof, in 
woollen or in linen, or any thing of 
skin, wherein the plague is: for it is a
fretting leprosy; it shall be burnt in 
the fire. 

53. And if the priest shall look, and, 

behold, the plague be not spread in 
the garment, either in the warp, or in 
the woof, or in any thing of skin; 

50. And by Divine Truth from Divine Good it must be 

tested; and he who is in it must be brought into a 
state of holiness and restraint thence, in the course 
of regeneration.

51. And when that state is completed, if the corruption
has extended either as to good or truth, internally 
or externally; whatever may be its quality or its 
use, it is profaned doctrine and is certainly impure.

52. And such doctrine must certainly be rejected, 
whether it may be of good or truth; inmost, 
interior, or external, it is truth profaned, and must 
be rejected by both the will and the understanding.

53. But if, by the light of truth from good, doctrine 
with any one does not continue to be corrupted 
either as to good or truth, internally or externally;

54. Then the priest shall command that 
they wash the thing wherein the 
plague is, and he shall shut it up 
seven days more: 

54. Then under the influences of good from the Lord it
must be purified; and there shall be a second state 
of restraint, and a state of holiness in the course of 
regeneration.

55. And the priest shall look, after that 

the plague is washed: and, behold, if 
the plague have not changed its 
colour, and the plague be not spread, 
it is unclean; you shall burn it in the 
fire: it is a fret, whether the bareness 
be within or without. 

55. And from good again examination is to be made 
when purification has taken place; and if the 
quality of the corruption tending to the destruction 
of remains is still the same both as to appearance 
and essence, it is impure, and is to be rejected; it is
truth profaned in the natural man exterior or 
interior.

56. And if the priest look, and, behold, 
the plague be dim after the washing 
thereof, then he shall rend it out of 
the garment, or out of the skin, or 
out of the warp, or out of the woof: 

57. And if it appear still in the garment, 
either in the warp, or in the woof, or 
in any thing of skin, it is breaking 
out: you shall burn that wherein the 
plague is with fire. 

56. But on the contrary, if, after purification, the 

corruption be only external, then there must be 
mourning on account thereof, of whatever quality 
or degree it may be.

57. And if still the impurity and corruption persist, 
inmostly, interiorly or externally, it is external 
corruption from internal; and it must be entirely 
rejected as being the effect of selfish love.

140

58. And the garment, either the warp, or 
the woof, or whatever thing of skin it
be, which you shall wash, if the 
plague be departed from them, then 
it shall be washed the second time, 
and shall be clean. 

59. This is the law of the plague of 

leprosy in a garment of woollen or 
linen, either in the warp, or the woof,
or any thing of skin, to pronounce it 
clean, or to pronounce it unclean. 

References and Notes

58. And doctrine of whatever quality or degree which 
is purified, if it be intellectually pure, must also be 
purified as to the motive from which it is held; and
then it is wholly pure.

59. And these are the laws of Divine Order with 
regard to doctrine either as to good or truth, 
internal, interior, or external, which is to be 
purified from falsity that causes it to be profaned.

1. This is evident, because by Jehovah is denoted the Divine Being as to His love, 2001; by 

speaking is denoted influx, 2951; by Moses is represented Divine Truth, or the Word, 7010; by
Aaron is represented Divine Good, 9946; and by saying is denoted perception, 1791, 1822.

2. This is proved from considering that the skin of the flesh signifies the external man derived 
from the internal, 9215, 780; that risings, scabs and bright spots denote evil affections from 
sensual, worldly and selfish love respectively, 7524, 2240, and it is said "sensual, worldly or 
selfish love respectively," because the Hebrew words indicate a descending series in the 
internal sense, that is, evils successively more and more intense, 7408, 9394; that the plague of
leprosy denotes the profanation of truth tending to the destruction of remains, 6963, 10219; 
and that to be brought to Aaron the priest, or to one of his sons the priests, denotes to be 
brought under the influence of Divine Good, or of Divine Truth thence proceeding,

3. The priest looking on the plague in the skin of his flesh, denotes that from Divine Good, by 

means of Divine Truth, examination is made of the state of the external man derived from the 
internal as to profanation, 2245, 2246, 9215, 780; the hair in the plague turning white denotes 
ultimate truth corrupted by falsities, 3301, 8459, 4007, Two Books of Kings Explained, p. 427, 
on 2 Kings 5:27; the appearance of the plague being deeper than the skin of the flesh denotes 
that the corruption is from the internal man, where also there is the acknowledgement of the 
Lord and faith in Him, because by the skin is denoted what is external, and by the flesh what is
relatively internal, 9215, 780, and because living flesh, which is here involved and implied, 
denotes acknowledgement and faith, 6963; leprosy denotes the profanation of truth, 6963; the 
priest looking on him denotes perception and revelation from Divine Good, 9946, 2245, 2246; 
and uncleanness denotes spiritual impurity, 10130.

4. By the bright spot is signified the lusts of selfish love, ver. 2; by white in the skin of his flesh 
is denoted the corruption of truths by falsities, ver. 3; by the appearance thereof not deeper 
than the skin, is signified only external corruption, 9215; by the hair not turning white is 
denoted no internal corruption of truths by falsities, from selfish love, ver. 3; by the priest is 
denoted good operating, 9946; and by shutting up seven days is denoted a holy state of self-
restraint, 784, 68543, 716.

5. The priest looking on him on the seventh day denotes the influence of good more strongly felt 
on the completion of the state of restraint, 2245, 2246, 9946, 2044; "if in his eyes" denotes the 

141

perception of truth from good, 9946, 5304; the plague being at a stay denotes that evil is 
controlled, 10219; its not being spread in the skin denotes that evil has not further corrupted 
the truths of the external man, 10219, 9215, 4035; and the priest shutting him up seven days 
more denotes that a second state of restraint under the influence of good occurs, 784, 68545, 
716, 9946.

6. The priest looking on him again the seventh day denotes that the influence of good is still 

more powerful at the completion of this second state of restraint, 2245, 2246, 9946, 2044; the 
plague being dim denotes the tendency to corruption still further weakened, 10219; the plague 
not spread in the skin denotes that the truths of the External are not vitiated, 10219, 9215, 
4035; the priest pronouncing him clean denotes no impurity internally, 4545; it is a scab 
denotes impurity externally, 7524, 2240; and washing the clothes and being clean denotes 
purification as to truths following, 3147, 4545.

7. The scab spreading abroad in the skin denotes the continuance of corruption from worldly 
love, 7524, 2240, 4035; after showing himself to the priest for his cleansing, denotes 
notwithstanding the influence of restraint from good for purification in successive states in all 
completeness, vers. 5, 6; and his showing himself to the priest again denotes that the influence 
of good is again exerted, 2245, 2246, 9946, 9215, 780.

8. The priest looking denotes further examination from good, 2245, 2246, 9946; the scab now 

being spread in the skin denotes the continuance and extension of corruption, and at the same 
time the acknowledgement and faith involved and implied in the states of restraint, 7524, 
2240, 4035, 6963; and the priest pronouncing him unclean denotes impurity arising from 
opposition to good in the course of regeneration, 6963, 10130.

9. The man being brought to the priest when the plague of leprosy is in him, denotes that when 

any one is in a state of profanation, he is still under the influence of Divine Good, 6963, 9946.

10. The priest looking denotes examination from good by truth, 9946, 2245, 2246; a white rising 
in the skin denotes the corruption of the truths of the external man by sensual lust, ver. 2; the 
hair also turned white denotes the corruption of truths by falsities more interiorly, ver. 3; and 
quick raw flesh in the rising denotes acknowledgement of the Lord and faith in Him, 6963.

11. An old leprosy in the skin of his flesh denotes a state of the confirmed profanation of truths in 
the external man derived from the internal, 2348; the priest pronouncing him unclean denotes 
the testimony of Divine Truth from good to a state of impurity, 9946, 10130; not shutting him 
up denotes that one in such a state cannot be further restrained, 784, 68543, and "he is 
unclean" denotes impurity by the profanation of truth internally as well as externally, 10130.

12. The leprosy breaking out abroad in the skin, and covering all the skin, denotes profanation in 

the external man completely, 6963, 9215, 9632; and from his head even to his feet, as far as 
appears to the priest, denotes from the love of self which is inmost to sensual love which is the
ultimate, according to the testimony of truth from good, 7442, 2245, 2246, 9946.

13. The priest looking denotes examination from Divine Good by Divine Truth, 9946, 2245, 2246;
the leprosy covering all the flesh denotes that profanation is entire, 6963, 9632; covering all 
the flesh, but not affecting it, denotes arising only from the knowledge of the truth, but from 
no internal acknowledgement and faith, 9215, 780; the priest pronouncing him clean that has 

142

the plague denotes that Divine Good by Divine Truth perceives that such a person is free from 
profanation inwardly, 9946, 4545; all turned white denotes falsity from evil prevailing 
externally, ver. 3; and being nevertheless clean denotes no profanation internally, 4545.

14. Raw flesh appearing in him anywhere denotes acknowledgement and faith internally, 780, 

6963; and being unclean denotes impurity on account of profanation, 6963, 10130.

15. The priest looking on the raw flesh and pronouncing him unclean, denotes that Divine Good 
by Divine Truth perceives the impurity, 9946, 2245, 2246, 10130; and the raw flesh being 
unclean, and there being leprosy, denotes that the corruption of the truth, when there is 
acknowledgement and faith, is genuine internal profanation, 10130, 6963.

16. The raw flesh turning again into white denotes a person in this profanation ceasing to 

acknowledge the Lord and to have faith in Him, 6963; all white denotes profanation only 
externally, ver. 13; and coming again to the priest denotes coming again under the influence of
Divine Good, 9946.

17. The priest looking denotes perception by Divine Truth from Divine Good, 2245, 2246, 9946; 
the plague being all turned white denotes no longer acknowledgement and faith, 6963, 9632; 
the priest pronouncing him clean that has the plague denotes that from good it is declared that 
such a person is pure from internal profanation, 9946, 4545.

18. The flesh having in the skin a boil and it being healed, denotes the life of the spiritual man as 
to the External where are truths in the memory, vitiated by the filthiness and impurity of 
merely sensual love, and yet outwardly cured by the influence of the truth, 7524, 9215, 780, 
8365. 

19. In the place of the boil a white rising, or a bright spot reddish-white, denotes that the vitiated 
life remains inwardly, since a white rising signifies the truth corrupted by sensual love, a 
bright spot signifies the truth corrupted by selfish love, and reddish-white signifies good 
combined with falsity, ver. 2, 6402, 3300, 8459, 4007; and being shown to the priest denotes 
that Divine Good will influence that state, 2245, 2246, 9946, ver. 3.

20. The priest looking denotes investigation by Divine Truth from Divine Good, 2245, 2246; the 

appearance thereof being lower than the skin denotes that there is also some acknowledgement
and faith, 9215, 780, 6963; the hair thereof turning white denotes that there is the corruption of
the truth by falsities, ver. 3; the priest pronouncing him unclean denotes that there is impurity, 
10130; the plague of leprosy denotes the profanation of truth tending to the destruction of 
remains, 6963, 10219; and breaking out in the boil denotes that it has arisen from the 
predominance of sensual love, 7524.

21. The priest looking denotes examination from good, 9946, 2245, 2246; no white hairs therein 
denotes that falsities from the evil of sensual love have not corrupted the truth, ver. 3; not 
lower than the skin denotes no acknowledgement and faith, 9215, 780, 6963; the plague being 
dim, or weak, denotes impurity only external, 10219, 3493, "dim" here denoting the 
comparative weakness of evil; and the priest shutting him up seven days denotes a holy state 
of self-restraint externally, 784, 68545, 716, 9946.

22. The rising or the bright spot spreading in the skin denotes an extension of the corruption

Discussion

In reflecting upon the contents of this whole chapter in its spiritual sense, as relating to the profanation 
of truth, we are first led to consider how universal this evil is. For what person is there who has had any
experience of regeneration, who will not confess that he has been guilty of it more or less? In fact, we 
all have profaned the truth, that is, we have deliberately applied it to selfish purposes, while yet we 
have, at the same time, acknowledged the Lord, and that the truth continually proceeds from Him. And 
from a certain point of view this profanation appears to be inevitable. For indeed we must use the truth 
as if it were our own, and we cannot seem to help applying it for our own advantage. Of what use 
would it be otherwise, we think? And if it were no use to us, should we trouble about it at all ?

Hence, then, we see at once the difficulty of deciding when we are in profanation and when we are not. 
But, all the same, the Lord knows our state in this respect better than we do ourselves, and it is the Lord
alone Who can save us and teach us to distinguish between apparent and real profanation. Let us 
therefore consider well the various divisions of our subject, and grasp first the general law.

We do not use the truth for selfish purposes, although we may appear to do so when selfish, worldly or 
sensual love ceases to be our leading or ruling motive; and this is explained in the first section. Our first
lesson in this connection is one of humility, and our second is therefore one of confidence in the Lord, 
Who, in the supreme sense, is represented by the priest who examines. After all, the evil may not be 
deeper than the skin of our flesh, and in the Divine sight we may be clean. But let us well consider here
also the process of our examination. It involves a double state of self-restraint. That is, both our natural 
understanding and our natural will must be devoted or consecrated to the Lord, which is represented by 
twice being shut up seven days. Here also we observe that the whole of regeneration is described, and 
involved even in one part of a long description, for the number seven indicates this. And also the 

148

process of the Judgement is involved in the priest looking a third time, in the case where the symptoms 
continue, which shows that there is confirmation in evil, and consequently the necessity of entire 
separation from good; for the third examination implies this, since the good are then made perfect and 
the wicked are utterly vastated, so that, with them, profanation may no longer be possible (Luke 13:32).
It is better that the wicked man should be entirely separated from good and truth than that he should 
remain in an intermediate state.

But there are some peculiarities in the second and third sections that ought to be carefully noted. The 
text speaks of an old leprosy, thereby indicating the confirmed state of evil; and it is said that a person 
thus afflicted shall not be shut up because such a confirmed state cannot be removed by regeneration, 
but by vastation, since he who is vastated as to truth and good cannot profane them. Now this state, as 
here described, may be profitably compared with the explanation of Matt 12:31-33 in 9013. There is no
state of profanation which cannot be removed by genuine repentance, as we learn from vers. 16-17, so 
long as man is in the liberty of choosing between good and evil; but a confirmed state of badness 
precludes this, and it is the man himself who decides, and not the Lord, for He is never unwilling to 
forgive, or to remit evil. Our great lesson here, therefore, is to take heed that we do not so profane the 
truth as to confirm ourselves by hypocrisy against it.

Another peculiarity in these sections, however, is that he who was leprous all over was pronounced 
clean, because such a case represents entire external profanation without any acknowledgement and 
faith internally. And such a state of profanation may be cured, that is, removed, because it is only 
external. But where there is hypocrisy even in this case, a confirmed state of evil is the result (2 Kings 
5:27). There is a point, moreover, in this connection that requires to be explained. How can he with 
whom there is no acknowledgement and faith be pronounced clean or spiritually pure? The answer is, 
that he is only pure because he is without internal profanation; but he is not in the purification that 
follows regeneration; and he can only become so by being regenerated, and thus acquiring 
acknowledgement and faith, and at the same time doing the work of repentance. And we are to note 
finally, therefore, that although there can be no internal profanation without acknowledgement and 
faith, and none external without a knowledge of the truth, yet neither acknowledgement and faith, nor 
the knowledge of the truth, is the cause of profanation, but that the sensuality, worldliness of 
selfishness of man is the real cause. And this is to be seen in what follows.

For from this place to the end of ver. 37 the profanation of truth from these loves is particularly 
described under the images of leprosy, from a boil, from a burning, and in the head and beard. It is not 
necessary, however, to enter into the consideration of all the particulars mentioned as the chief of them 
have been already explained, and the rest are sufficiently clear from the references, besides which, what
is said in the latter part of 6963 affords another reason for not dwelling upon these particulars. Let it 
suffice therefore to reflect that falsities, as well as evil affections, take their part in these various kinds 
of the profanation of truth, and that these falsities are properly denoted by the white, and yellow, and 
black hairs named in the series. Also the particular character of the evil loves spoken of, which is 
known to the man of the church from experience in spiritual conflicts, is a sufficient indication of the 
nature of the profanations to which all are liable, of their universality, of their insidiousness, and of 
their depravity. No wonder, therefore, that the evil, and error, and sin of profanation are included in the 
Decalogue and are coupled with a warning which every one should diligently heed all through his life, 
8882.

But there now follows further instruction concerning leprosy in the head, from which we learn, in the 
internal sense, that there may be in us the outward appearance of the profanation of the truth without 

149

the reality, both with respect to the will and the understanding, and even under the influence of selfish 
love; and also that there may be real profanation which does not seem to be such. And we ourselves are
not able to decide concerning this. Yet here we see that the Lord knows our real state, and also that He 
will reveal it to us; for we may be quite sure that no evil state will be remitted or removed from us 
without our own co-operation. Not, however, that all the hidden enormity of an evil to which we are 
prone may be openly manifested, but only sufficient to ensure our willingness to have it removed. It is, 
therefore, our duty to follow the Lord in our regeneration by being willing to be enlightened in this 
respect, and to pray that we may be cleansed even from our secret faults by repenting of some 
manifested evil which involves much more depravity in our unregenerate life than we can conceive (Ps 
19:12).

And then again, how impressive are the truths made known in the internal sense, under the figure of the
leper's wretched and forlorn condition! The profaner must acknowledge his guilt both in mind and in 
heart; he must see that his life is disorderly; he must feel his inability to really utter the truths, or to 
embody in his life the truths he outwardly approves, for selfish love within contaminates them; and he 
must really, for the time being, be separated from that heavenly life of which he is internally capable. 
He feels that he cannot purify himself; and yet he sees that he must obey the Divine law in order to be 
purified (2 Kings 5:10-14), even as Naaman the Syrian obeyed the prophet and washed himself in 
Jordan seven times and was clean.

But the latter part of our chapter is also exceedingly interesting in the internal sense. There can be 
leprosy in the garments as well as in the skin of the flesh. That is, doctrine may be profaned as well as 
truth itself. Now some people seem to think that doctrine is not of much consequence provided the life 
be pure. But this is a great fallacy, because only true doctrine unmixed with falsities and not 
contaminated with evil loves can really make us pure. It is not surprising therefore that the Word 
teaches this. "The words of the Lord are pure words, as silver tried in a furnace on the earth purified 
seven times" (Ps 12:6). There are no false doctrines in the Word, but the truth is falsified by 
misinterpretations under the influence of selfish and worldly love, and hence comes profanation in 
doctrine. This is what is greenish or reddish, as the references show. And notice now the process of 
examination, how it resembles the previous descriptions. The reason is because it is the man that 
requires to be purified, and not the doctrine. For if the man be purified, he will reject falsities, but if not
he will cling to them and confirm his evil state; and this is to be burnt with fire spiritually. And that it is
the man and not the doctrine merely is evident from the last clause of ver. 57, which speaks of the head,
or the forehead according to the Hebrew. Hence, then, we see that there is no better way of getting rid 
of false doctrine than by having the heart or the affections purified, this being indeed the method of the 
Judgement, when to him who has goodness, truth in agreement therewith will be given, but from him 
who has not goodness shall be taken away the truth that he appears to have. And hence, too, we see 
how important is the work of the weaver in this description. It is good, or the celestial principle that is 
denoted by the work of the weaver and by the woof, and only the operation of good upon truth, of the 
will upon the understanding, or of the Internal upon the External, can produce the beautiful garments of
the heavenly Jerusalem, free from all. evil and falsity, when the time of the marriage comes, and the 
man of the church is both inwardly and outwardly eternally conjoined with the Lord.

truth conjoined with good, actuated thereby, and 
pure from falsity; also he shall acquire from the 
Word interior truth conjoined with good, exterior 
truth conjoined with good, and external truth for 
purification as if from himself.

5. Also, from good, it is perceived by means of the 

Word, or by means of the truth of the Word active 
from good, that the affection of truth apart from 
the affection of good is without spiritual life in its 
receptacle in the natural mind, rendering 
preparation necessary.

6. As for the living bird, he shall take 
it, and the cedar wood, and the 
scarlet, and the hyssop, and shall dip 
them and the living bird in the blood 
of the bird that was killed over the 
running water: 

7. And he shall sprinkle upon him that 
is to be cleansed from the leprosy 
seven times, and shall pronounce 
him clean, and shall let go the living 
bird into the open field. 

6. And consequently there must be the conjunction of
good with truth through the affection of good 
flowing in from the Lord being conjoined with the 
interior truth of good, the exterior truth of good, 
and external truth from the Word, and through the 
reciprocal conjunction of truth with good in the 
natural man, when there is self-denial through the 
influence of the truth of the Word.

7. And when this conjunction, in him that is purified 
from profanation, is confirmed from Divine Good 
in the holy state of regeneration, then there is 
perfect purity, and at the same time perfect 
freedom in the enjoyment of the heavenly life of 
the love of good.

8. And he that is to be cleansed shall 
wash his clothes, and shave off all 
his hair, and bathe himself in water, 
and he shall be clean: and after that 
he shall come into the camp, but 
shall dwell outside his tent seven 
days. 

8. Also, in addition to this, the external man must 
independently, or as from himself, be purified 
from falsities of every degree, internal, interior, 
and ultimate, if he would be pure; and then he will 
become receptive of the heavenly life provided 
that he put on a holy state of regeneration by 
abstaining from selfish love completely.

9. And it shall be on the seventh day, 

9. And then, when this first state is ended, a second 

that he shall shave all his hair off his 
head and his beard and his eyebrows,
even all his hair he shall shave off: 
and he shall wash his clothes, and he
shall bathe his flesh in water, and he 
shall be clean. 

10. And on the eighth day he shall take 
two he-lambs without blemish, and 
one ewe-lamb of the first year 
without blemish, and three tenth 
parts of an ephah of fine flour for a 
meal offering, mingled with oil, and 
one log of oil. 

follows, in which exterior falsities of every degree 
are removed, yea, most completely, and 
purification is full as to every degree.

10. And afterwards, in the new state of the heavenly 
life, this double guarantee is to be succeeded by 
the worship of the Lord from the truth of 
innocence conjoined with the good thereof and 
free from falsity in the celestial degree, and in 
fullness from the truth of good conjoined with 
celestial good, and thus from celestial good itself, 
as adapted, in the spiritual degree.

11. And the priest that cleanses him 
shall set the man that is to be 
cleansed, and those things, before 
the LORD, at the door of the tent of 
meeting: 

11. And under the influence of Divine Good, the man 
of the church is to be purified by the genuine 
worship of the Lord; first of all by acknowledging 
Him, and that He operates through the heavens for 
his regeneration and salvation.

152

12. And the priest shall take one of the 
he-lambs, and offer him for a guilt 
offering, and the log of oil, and wave
them for a wave offering before the 
LORD: 

12. Also, consequently, the Lord is worshiped from 

the truth of innocence in the internal man, whereby
is the remission of evil, and from celestial love, 
when it is acknowledged that all the activity of 
these affections is from Him.

13. And he shall kill the he-lamb in the 
place where they kill the sin offering
and the burnt offering, in the place of
the sanctuary: for as the sin offering 
is the priest's, so is the guilt offering:
it is most holy: 

14. And the priest shall take of the blood
of the guilt offering, and the priest 
shall put it upon the tip of the right 
ear of him that is to be cleansed, and 
upon the thumb of his right hand, 
and upon the great toe of his right 
foot: 

13. But preparation for this worship from the truth of 
innocence is by the removal of evil, and the 
reception of celestial good internally, yea, even in 
the inmost degree of the mind; for as the removal 
of actual evil is from the Lord in this way, even so 
it is with evil committed in a state of the innocence
of ignorance; worship with a view to its removal is
essentially holy.

14. And the holy truth involved in such worship 
proceeds from the Lord through the good of 
innocence, communicating power to shun evil by 
obedience from a principle of truth internally; 
from the same interiorly; and in every action 
externally.

15. And the priest shall take of the log of

15. For, indeed, Divine Good operating through the 

oil, and pour it into the palm of his 
own left hand: 

16. And the priest shall dip his right 
finger in the oil that is in his left 
hand, and shall sprinkle of the oil 
with his finger seven times before 
the LORD: 

will, flows into the understanding with power;

16. And this not only in general, but also in particular; 

and hence there is with the man of the church the 
reception of good with power by means of truth, 
and the acknowledgement in all fullness and 
holiness that the conjunction of truth with good in 
him is entirely from the Lord.

17. And of the rest of the oil that is in 

17. Whence it follows that not only is truth received 

his hand shall the priest put upon the
tip of the right ear of him that is to 
be cleansed, and upon the thumb of 
his right hand, and upon the great toe
of his right foot, upon the blood of 
the guilt offering: 

from the Lord communicating power, but good 
also, when man is purified from profanation, being
the essential of power in the will by obedience 
from a principle of good; in the understanding 
from the conjunction of truth with good interiorly; 
and in the life by the conjunction of truth with 
good in every action; and this even in worship 
from the innocence of ignorance.

153

18. And the rest of the oil that is in the 
priest's hand he shall put upon the 
head of him that is to be cleansed: 
and the priest shall make atonement 
for him before the LORD. 

19. And the priest shall offer the sin 

offering, and make atonement for 
him that is to be cleansed because of 
his uncleanness; and afterwards he 
shall kill the burnt offering: 

18. But not only so. For in consequence of such 

worship, good is also established in the Inmost, 
and thus in the whole man, when he is purified 
from profanation. And thus is effected the 
reconciliation of the external with the internal 
man, and complete deliverance from evil by the 
Lord

19. And all this is humbly acknowledged by him who 
is thus reconciled to the Lord. He confesses his 
impurity, and he is now prepared to worship the 
Lord from pure love.

20. And the priest shall offer the burnt 
offering and the meal offering upon 
the altar: and the priest shall make 
atonement for him, and he shall be 
clean. 

20. And this now follows. For all celestial good, and 

all spiritual good are, from the heart, 
acknowledged to be from the Lord and are devoted
to His service. Also evil is remitted, and there is 
complete purification.

21. And if he be poor, and cannot get so 
much, then he shall take one he-lamb
for a guilt offering to be waved, to 
make atonement for him, and one 
tenth part of an ephah of fine flour 
mingled with oil for a meal offering, 
and a log of oil; 

22. And two turtledoves, or two young 

pigeons, such as he is able to get; 
and the one shall be a sin offering, 
and the other a burnt offering. 

21. But if the man who has profaned the truth is not of 
the internal church but of the external, and thus 
cannot be receptive of good and truth in so great a 
degree, still he can worship the Lord from the 
good of innocence in ignorance on a lower plane, 
which can be vivified from the Lord, and can be 
reconciled to the Lord by the removal of evil; and 
also, he can, in his degree, worship the Lord from 
truth conjoined with good, which is from, celestial 
good in the inmost.

22. Also he can worship the Lord from the good and 
truth of faith according to his state both in regard 
to the removal of evil and the reception of good.

23. And on the eighth day he shall bring 

23. And in the new state of his life, in order to his 

them for his cleansing to the priest, 
to the door of the tent of meeting, 
before the LORD. 

purification, he will ascribe that life to the Lord, 
acknowledging that it is from Him through the 
heavens.

24. And the priest shall take the lamb of 
the guilt offering, and the log of oil, 
and the priest shall wave them for a 
wave offering before the LORD. 

24. And also he will acknowledge that all the good of 
the innocence of ignorance, and all the good of 
inmost celestial love, are vivified, with him, from 
the Lord in his worship.

154

25. And he shall kill the lamb of the 
guilt offering, and the priest shall 
take of the blood of the guilt 
offering, and put it upon the tip of 
the right ear of him that is to be 
cleansed, and upon the thumb of his 
right hand, and upon the great toe of 
his right foot: 

25. And then he will prepare himself to worship the 

Lord from the good of innocence in ignorance, and
will acknowledge that the holy truth involved in 
such worship proceeds from the Lord, 
communicating power to shun evil by obedience 
from the principle of truth internally, of truth 
interiorly, and in every action externally.

26. And the priest shall pour of the oil 
into the palm of his own left hand: 

26. For again, indeed, Divine Good operating from the
Lord will flow into the understanding with power;

27. And the priest shall sprinkle with his
right finger some of the oil that is in 
his left hand seven times before the 
LORD: 

27. And this not only in general, but also in particular; 
and hence there is, with this man of the church, the
reception of good with power, by means of truth, 
and the acknowledgement in all fullness and 
holiness, that the conjunction of good with truth in
him is entirely from the Lord.

28. And the priest shall put of the oil 

28. Whence it follows, that not only is truth received 

that is in his right hand upon the tip 
of the right ear of him that is to be 
cleansed, and upon the thumb of his 
right hand, and upon the great toe of 
his right foot, upon the place of the 
blood of the guilt offering: 

from the Lord communicating power, but good 
also, when man is purified from profanation; being
the essential of power in the will by obedience 
from a principle of good; in the understanding by 
the conjunction of truth with good interior; and in 
the life by the conjunction of truth with good in 
every action.

29. And the rest of the oil that is in the 
priest's hand he shall put upon the 
head of him that is to be cleansed, to 
make atonement for him before the 
LORD. 

29. But not only so. For in consequence of such 

worship, good is also established in the inmost and
thus in the whole man, when he is purified from 
profanation. And thus is effected the reconciliation
of the external with the internal man, and complete
deliverance from evil by the Lord.

30. And he shall offer one of the 

turtledoves, or of the young pigeons,
such as he is able to get; 

30. And the Lord is truly worshiped from the good of 
faith or from the truth of faith according to the 
state of man,

31. Even such as he is able to get, the 

31. Even according to his state in the worship of the 

one for a sin offering, and the other 
for a burnt offering, with the meal 
offering: and the priest shall make 
atonement for him that is to be 
cleansed before the LORD. 

Lord for the removal of evil, or for the reception of
good both internally and externally; and thus the 
reconciliation between the external and internal 
man is effected by the Lord with him who is to be 
purified.

155

32. This is the law of him in whom is the
plague of leprosy, who is not able to 
get that which pertains to his 
cleansing. 

32. And this is the law of Divine Order for him who is
to be purified from profanation, who is not of the 
internal church but of the external, and therefore is
not so fully receptive of the heavenly life.

33. And the LORD spoke to Moses and 

33. Also there is revelation from the Lord to those 

to Aaron, saying, 

who are in truth and in good giving the perception,

34. When you be come into the land of 

Canaan, which I give to you for a 
possession, and I put the plague of 
leprosy in a house of the land of 
your possession; 

34. That when they have realized the heavenly state by
the reception of life in the internal man and also in 
the external, which it is the will of the Lord to 
impart, and yet there is in the ultimate receptacle 
of their souls some slight degree of profanation:

35. Then he that owns the house shall 
come and tell the priest, saying, 
There seems to me to be as it were a 
plague in the house: 

35. Then he who is in the reception of spiritual life 
thus, will perceive from his prevailing state of 
good, the tendency in himself to the destruction of 
that life;

36. And the priest shall command that 

they empty the house, before the 
priest go in to see the plague, that all
that is in the house be not made 
unclean: and afterward the priest 
shall go in to see the house: 

36. And will be led to confess that he is void of any 
good or truth as his own, in order that he may be 
enlightened concerning his state, and that the good
and truth which he has from the Lord may be 
preserved in him from the impurity of profanation 
through such enlightenment.

37. And he shall look on the plague, and,
behold, if the plague be in the walls 
of the house with hollow strakes, 
greenish or reddish, and the 
appearance thereof be lower than the
wall; 

38. Then the priest shall go out of the 

house to the door of the house, and 
shut up the house seven days: 

37. And then, from Divine Good, examination shall be
made, and if it is evident that there is a tendency to
profanation in the external receptacle as to good, 
even to the profanation of holy truths there by 
ultimate falsities appearing as truths, but void of 
good because there is in them thought from the 
impulse of self-exaltation, even when there is full 
enjoyment of faith in the Lord;

38. Then Divine Good is, as it were, withdrawn from 
that receptacle; and a state of restraint follows, in 
order that purification by a holy state of 
regeneration may be induced.

39. And the priest shall come again the 
seventh day, and shall look: and, 
behold, if the plague be spread in the
walls of the house; 

39. And, after this state, further examination takes 
place; and if still there is an extension of the 
tendency to the profanation of truth in that 
receptacle,

156

40. Then the priest shall command that 

they take out the stones in which the 
plague is, and cast them into an 
unclean place without the city: 

40. Then influx from Divine Good through Divine 
Truth reveals that impure falsities are to be 
rejected from that receptacle; are to be 
acknowledged to be from the hells whence is all 
impurity; and thus are to be separated from the 
doctrine of faith.

41. And he shall cause the house to be 

41. Also that receptacle, by the influence of good, is to

scraped within round about, and they
shall pour out the mortar that they 
scrape off without the city into an 
unclean place: 

be purified from all admixture of falsity from the 
proprium or from selfish love, even completely; 
and the evil affection itself which causes these 
falsities to cohere, is to be rejected to the hells 
whence is all impurity.

42. And they shall take other stones, and
put them in the place of those stones;
and he shall take other mortar, and 
shall plaster the house. 

42. Also into this receptacle pure truths from the Word
are to be inserted; and these are to be caused to 
cohere by the genuine affection for truth, good 
thus appearing as formed in truths.

43. And if the plague come again, and 
break out in the house, after that he 
has taken out the stones, and after he
has scraped the house, and after it is 
plastered; 

44. Then the priest shall come in and 
look, and, behold, if the plague be 
spread in the house, it is a fretting 
leprosy in the house: it is unclean. 

43. And further, if there should be a recurrence of the 
evil of profanation, even though falsity has been, 
so far, removed by discipline for that purpose, and 
truths have been made to cohere from good;

44. Then Divine Good will flow into its receptacle 
more strongly, and if there be still a tendency to 
the profanation of truths, or the actual profanation 
thereof in the slightest degree, it is productive of 
irritation where good rules; and there is impurity.

45. And he shall break down the house, 
the stones of it, and the timber 
thereof, and all the mortar of the 
house; and he shall carry them forth 
out of the city into an unclean place. 

45. And, in this case, that receptacle of good is to be 

rejected as to its falsities and its evils, and as to 
any coherence by their conjunction; yea, to be 
rejected to the hells, and so separated from true 
doctrine.

46. Moreover he that goes into the house
all the while that it is shut up shall be
unclean until the even. 

46. And moreover, all who allow their life to be 
manifested in such an impure receptacle, are 
impure until a change of state is brought about.

47. And he that lies in the house shall 

47. Every one who takes his ease and rests among 

wash his clothes; and he that eats in 
the house shall wash his clothes. 

such impurity, even for a time, must be purified by
the truth of the Word; and every one who essays to
appropriate good in that state, must be purified in 
the same way.

157

48. And if the priest shall come in, and 
look, and, behold, the plague has not
spread in the house, after the house 
was plastered; then the priest shall 
pronounce the house clean, because 
the plague is healed. 

49. And he shall take to cleanse the 

house two birds, and cedar wood, 
and scarlet, and hyssop: 

50. And he shall kill one of the birds in 
an earthen vessel over running 
water: 

48. Also if Divine Good flows in and by Divine Truth 

examination is made, and it happens that 
profanation has not extended itself in that 
receptacle after truths were made to cohere from 
good, then good reveals, by truth, that it is pure, 
because purification has been effected by 
discipline.

49. And therefore the means of purification, namely, 
the affection of good and truths active from good, 
and interior truth, and exterior truth conjoined with
good, are to be applied.

50. Also from good it is perceived by means of the 

Word, or by means of truth active from good, that 
the affection of truth apart from the affection of 
good is without spiritual life, and must be 
prepared, in its receptacle, in the natural mind to 
receive good.

51. And he shall take the cedar wood, 

51. And consequently, that there must be the 

and the hyssop, and the scarlet, and 
the living bird, and dip them in the 
blood of the slain bird, and in the 
running water, and sprinkle the 
house seven times: 

conjunction of good with truth through the 
affection of good flowing in from the Lord being 
conjoined with the interior truth of good, and with 
exterior truth and good from the Word; and that 
this conjunction, in him that is to be purified, is to 
be confirmed from Divine Good in the holy state 
of regeneration.

52. And he shall cleanse the house with 

52. And thus the receptacle of good is to be purified 

the blood of the bird, and with the 
running water, and with the living 
bird, and with the cedar wood, and 
with the hyssop, and with the scarlet:

by the holy affection of external truth, by holy 
truth from the Word, by the affection of good, and 
by interior and exterior truth specifically from the 
Word and conjoined with good.

53. But he shall let go the living bird out
of the city into the open field: so 
shall he make atonement for the 
house: and it shall be clean. 

54. This is the law for all manner of 
plague of leprosy, and for a itch; 

55. And for the leprosy of a garment, 

and for a house; 

53. While, lastly, the affection of good is left perfectly 
free in the full enjoyment of heavenly life and 
happiness internal and external; and thus external 
good is reconciled with internal, and complete 
purity prevails.

54. And these are the laws of Divine Order with 

regard to the profanation of truth, and to the evil 
affections which are active in the course of 
regeneration and tend to such profanation;

55. Also with regard to those evil affections by which 
true doctrine is profaned; and by which receptacles
of good in the external man are profaned;

158

56. And for a rising, and for a scab, and 

56. And, in short, with regard to the removal of evil 

for a bright spot: 

affections tending to profanation from sensual 
love, the love of the world, and the love of self 
successively,

57. To teach when it is unclean, and 

57. So that the man of the church may thence know 

when it is clean: this is the law of 
leprosy. 

how to discriminate between impurity and purity, 
both with respect to the will and the 
understanding, concerning the profanation of truth,
according to Divine Order.

7837, 7838; in the place where they kill the sin offering and the burnt offering denotes a state 
of worship for the removal of evil, and the reception of celestial good internally, 2625, 3400, 
10053; in the place of the sanctuary denotes even in the inmost degree of the mind, 36523, 
3210; the guilt offering being the priest's, like the sin offering, denotes that as the removal of 
actual evil is from the Lord, even so it is with evil committed in a state of the innocence of 

160

ignorance, 10042; and its being most holy denotes that worship for the removal of such evil is 
essentially holy, 3210, 10129.

14. The priest taking of the blood of the guilt offering denotes that the holy truth involved in such 
worship proceeds from the Lord through the good of innocence, ver. 12, 10060, 9946; putting 
it upon the tip of the right ear denotes communicating power to shun evil by obedience from a 
principle of truth internally, 10061; upon the thumb of his right hand denotes the same 
interiorly, 10062; and upon the great toe of his right foot denotes the same in every action 
externally, 10063.

15. The priest taking of the log of oil and pouring it into the palm of his own left hand denotes 

that, indeed, Divine Good operating through the will flows into the understanding with power, 
9946, 2177, 10062.

16. The priest dipping his right finger into the oil that is in his left hand denotes power 

communicated, not only in general, but also in particular, each part of the hand denoting power
like the whole hand, 7430; using the right hand and the left hand denotes good operating by 
truth, 10062; the oil denotes good, 2177; and sprinkling of the oil with his finger seven times 
before the Lord denotes the acknowledgement in all fullness and holiness that the conjunction 
of truth with good in him is entirely from the Lord, 10047, 2044, 716.

17. The oil denotes good, 2177, while the blood denotes truth, 10060; putting the oil upon the 

blood of the guilt offering denotes, that power is from good by truth; putting it upon him that is
cleansed from leprosy denotes with those who are purified from the profanation of truth, 6963,
4545; upon the tip of the right ear denotes in the will by obedience from good, 10061; upon 
the thumb of the right hand denotes in the understanding by the conjunction of truth with good
interiorly, 10062; and upon the great toe of the right foot denotes in the life by the conjunction 
of truth with good in every action, even in worship from the innocence of ignorance, 10063, 
3400, 2542.

18. The rest of the oil put upon the head of him that is to be cleansed denotes good established in 
the inmost, 257, 7859; the head also signifies the whole man, 10011; and the priest making 
atonement before the Lord denotes the reconciliation of the external man with the internal, and
complete deliverance from evil by the Lord, chap 1:3, 10042 II.

19. The priest offering the sin offering, and making atonement for him that is to be cleansed from 
his uncleanness, denotes that all this is humbly acknowledged by him who is reconciled to the 
Lord, 9939, 10042; and killing the burnt offering afterwards denotes preparation in 
consequence to worship the Lord from pure love, 10024, 10053.

20. The priest offering the burnt offering upon the altar, making atonement, and the leper being 

clean, denotes the acknowledgement that all celestial good and all spiritual good are from the 
Lord, and are devoted to His service, when evil is remitted and there is complete purification, 
10042, 2177, 4545.

21. The man being too poor denotes one not of the internal church, but of the external, 9209; not 
getting so much evidently denotes not being receptive of good and truth in so great a degree, 
4372; taking one he-lamb for a guilt offering denotes the worship of the Lord from the good of
innocence in ignorance on a lower plane, 7837-9, 3400; waving denotes vivification from the 
Lord, 10083; making atonement denotes reconciliation with the Lord by the removal of evil, 

161

chap 1:3, 10042 II.; and taking one tenth part of an ephah of fine flour mingled with oil for a 
meal offering, and one log of oil, denotes the worship of the Lord, in his degree, from truth 
conjoined with good, which is from celestial good in the inmost, 2177, 10136-7.

22. Taking two turtledoves or two young pigeons such as he is able to get denotes the worship of 
the Lord from the good and truth of faith, according to his state both in regard to the removal 
of evil and the reception of good, 1826, 1827, 3400, 10053.

23. The eighth day denotes a new state, 9227; and bringing the offerings to the priest to the door 
of the tent of meeting before the Lord, for his cleansing, denotes ascribing his life, after 
purification, to the Lord by acknowledging that it is from Him through the heavens, 10042, 
2356, 35403.

24. The priest taking the lamb of the guilt offering and the log of oil and waving them for a wave 

offering before the Lord denotes the acknowledgement that all the good of the innocence of 
ignorance, and all the good of inmost celestial love, are vivified with him during his worship 
from the Lord, 7837, 7838, 3400, 2177, 10083.

25. Killing the lamb of the guilt offering denotes preparation to worship the Lord from the good of
innocence in ignorance, 10024; the priest taking the blood denotes the acknowledgement that 
the holy truth involved in such worship proceeds from the Lord, ver. 12, 10060, 9946; and 
putting it upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed, upon the thumb of his right 
hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot, denotes the communication of power to shun 
evils by obedience from the principle of truth internally, interiorly and externally in every 
action, 10061-3.

26. The priest pouring of the oil into the palm of his own left hand denotes that again, indeed, 
Divine Good operating from the Lord will flow into the understanding with power, 9946, 
2177, 10062.

27. The priest sprinkling with his right finger some of the oil that is in his left hand seven times 

before the Lord denotes that this is done not only in general, but also in particular; and hence 
that there is, with the man of the church, the reception of good with power by means of truth, 
and the acknowledgement, in all fullness and holiness, that the conjunction of good with truth 
in him is entirely from the Lord, ver. 16.

28. The priest putting of the oil that is in his hand upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be 
cleansed, upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot, in the 
place of the blood of the guilt offering, denotes that not only is truth received from the Lord 
communicating power, but good also when man is purified from profanation, being the 
essential of power in the will by obedience from a principle of good; in the understanding by 
the conjunction of truth with good interior, and in the life by the conjunction of truth with 
good in every action, ver. 17.

29. The rest of the oil that is in the priest's hand being put upon the head of him that is to be 

cleansed, to make atonement for him before the Lord, denotes that, in consequence of such 
worship, good is also established in the inmost, and thus in the whole man, when he is purified
from profanation; and that thus is effected the reconciliation of the external with the internal 
man, and complete deliverance from evil by the Lord, ver. 18.

162

30. Offering one of the turtledoves or of the young pigeons such as he is able to get denotes that 
the Lord is truly worshiped from the good of faith or from the truth of faith, according to the 
state of the man, 1826-7.

31. The one for a sin offering and the other for a burnt offering denotes even according to his state
in the worship of the Lord for the removal of evil and for the reception of good, 3400, 10053; 
with the meal offering denotes externally as well as internally, ver. 10; and the priest making 
atonement for him before the Lord denotes that thus the reconciliation between the external 
and the internal man is effected by the Lord with him who is to be purified, 10042, 4545.

32. This is the law of him in whom is the plague of leprosy who is not able to get that which 

pertains to his cleansing, denotes the law of Divine Order for him who is to be purified from 
profanation who is not of the internal church, but of the external, and therefore is not so fully 
receptive of the heavenly life, 2634.

33. This is evident because by Jehovah is denoted the Divine Being as to His love, 2001; by 

speaking is denoted influx, 2951; by Moses is represented Divine Truth, 7010; by Aaron is 
represented Divine Good, 9946; and by saying is denoted perception, 1791, 1822.

34. By coming into the land of Canaan, which the Lord gives for a possession, is denoted here 
"when men have realized the heavenly state by the reception of life in the internal man, and 
also in the external, which it is the will of the Lord to impart," 1413, 2658; and by putting the 
plague of leprosy in a house of the land of your possession is denoted "when there is in the 
ultimate receptacle of their souls some slight degree of profanation," 10219, 6963, 1488, 
because the Lord is said to put leprosy in a house only according to the appearance, 696.

35. This is clear from the signification of the owner of the house as denoting the man who is in the

reception of spiritual life thus, 6690; of coming to tell the priest, saying, as denoting 
perception from his prevailing state of good, 3209, 9946; and of "there seems to me to be as it 
were a plague in the house," as denoting the perception of the tendency in himself to the 
destruction of that life, 10219, 6963, 1488.

36. The priest commanding denotes influx from good giving perception, and thus being led by the 
Lord, 2951; emptying the house denotes the confession that he is void of any good and truth as
his own, 17; the priest going in to see the plague denotes enlightenment concerning his state 
from good by truth, 9946, 2150, 10219; and all that is in the house not being made unclean 
denotes good and truth which he has from the Lord being preserved in him from the impurity 
of profanation, 10219, 6963, 10130.

37. The priest looking on the plague denotes that from Divine Good examination shall be made, 
9946, 2245, 2246; the plague being in the walls of the house with hollow strakes greenish or 
reddish denotes a tendency to profanation in the external receptacle as to good, even the 
profanation of ultimate truths there by falsities appearing as truths, but void of good, because 
there is in them thought from the impulse of self-exaltation, 10219, 6963, 6419, 2233, 996, 
3300, 17; and the appearance being lower than the wall denotes even when there is full 
enjoyment of faith in the Lord, the wall here representing the same as the skin, 9215, 780.

38. The priest going out of the house to the door denotes that Divine Good is, as it were, 

withdrawn from that receptacle, 2356; and shutting up the house seven days denotes a state of 

163

restraint in order that a holy state of regeneration may be induced by purification, 784, 68545, 
716.

39. The priest coming again the seventh day and looking denotes that after this state further 

examination takes place, 2044, 2245, 2246; and the plague being spread in the walls of the 
house denotes an extension of the tendency to profanation in that receptacle, 10219, 4035-

40. The priest commanding denotes influx from Divine Good revealing through Divine Truth, 
2951; taking out the stones in which the plague is denotes that impure falsities are to be 
rejected from that receptacle, 643, 10219; and casting them into an unclean place without the 
city denotes that these falsities are acknowledged to be from the hells whence is all impurity, 
10130, 47443, 402.

41. The house being scraped within round about denotes that the receptacle, by the influence of 
good, is to be purified from all admixture of falsity from the proprium or from selfish love 
completely, 9946, 1488, 6669; and pouring out the mortar that is scraped off without the city 
into an unclean place denotes that the evil affection itself which causes these falsities to cohere
is to be rejected to the hells Whence is all impurity, 6669, 47443, 402.

42. Taking other stones and putting them in the place of those stones, and other mortar, and 

plastering the house, denotes that into the receptacle pure truths are to be inserted from the 
Word, and that these are to be caused to cohere by the genuine affection for truth, good thus 
appearing as formed in truths, 643, 6669.

43. By the plague coming again is denoted the recurrence of the evil of profanation, 10219, 6963; 
and after the stones have been taken out, after the house has been scraped, and after it has been
plastered, denotes "even though falsity has been so far removed by discipline for the purpose, 
and truths have been made to cohere with good," 643, 6669. Observe here that scraping the 
walls of the house within, and thus removing the old plaster, has the same correspondential 
value as removing the skin, and at the same time what causes the adherence of the skin to the 
flesh, of a sacrificed animal, 10036; and that this, of course, implies the rejection of ultimate 
falsity and its evil, and thus the discipline involved in such rejection.

44. The priest coming to look denotes the influx of Divine Good into its receptacle more strongly, 
and consequent examination, 9946, 2245, 2246; the plague being spread in the house denotes 
the extension of the tendency to profanation, or actual profanation in the slightest degree, 
10219, 6963, 4035; a fretting leprosy denotes, in this case, irritation where good rules, 6963; 
and unclean denotes spiritual impurity, 10130.

45. Breaking down the house as to the stones thereof and as to the timber thereof denotes the 

rejection of that receptacle as to its falsities and evils, 10643, 1488, 643; all the mortar thereof 
denotes as to any coherence by their conjunction, 6669; and carrying them forth out of the city
to an unclean place denotes rejection to the hells and separation from true doctrine, 47443, 
402.

46. He that goes into the house all the while it is shut up, being unclean until the evening, denotes 
that all who allow their life to be manifested in such an impure receptacle are impure until a 
change of state is brought about, 1488, 68545, 10130, 7844.

164

47. He that lies in the house washing his clothes denotes that every one who takes his ease and 

rests among such impurity must be purified by the truth of the Word, 3696, 3147, 1073; and he
that eats in the house washing his clothes denotes that every one who essays to appropriate 
good in that state must be purified in the same way, 2187, 3147, 1073, 1488.

48. The priest again coming in and looking denotes influx from Divine Good, and thence 

examination by Divine Truth, 9946, 2245, 2246; the plague not spreading in the house denotes
no extension of profanation, 4035, 10219, 6963; after he has plastered the house denotes after 
truths were made to cohere from good, 643, 6669; and the priest pronouncing the house clean 
because the plague is healed denotes that good reveals by truths that the receptacle is pure, 
because purification has been effected by discipline, 9946, 1488, 4545, 10219, 8365.

49. Taking to cleanse the house two birds and cedar wood and scarlet and hyssop denotes that the 
means of purification, namely, the affection of good, and truths active from good, and interior 
truth and exterior truth, are to be applied, 4545, 1488, 776, 91826, 39388, 5194.

50. Killing one of the birds in an earthen vessel over running water denotes that from good it is 
perceived by means of the Word, or by means of truth active from good, that the affection of 
truth apart from the affection of good is without spiritual life, and must be prepared, in its 
receptacle in the natural mind, to receive good, 3424, 10024, 6767, 5948, 10105, 3079, ver. 5.

51. Taking the cedar wood and the scarlet and the hyssop and the living bird, and dipping them in 
the blood of the slain bird and in the running water, and sprinkling the house seven times, 
denotes that consequently there must be the conjunction of good with truth through the 
affection of good flowing in from the Lord being conjoined with the interior truth of good, and
with the exterior truth and good from the Word; and that this conjunction in him that is to be 
purified is to be confirmed from Divine Good in the holy state of regeneration, 91826, 7918, 
94689, 7846, 3424, 92294, 10024, 6767, ver. 6, 10047, 716, 4545, 6963, 9946, ver. 7.

52. Cleansing the house with the blood of the bird and with the funning water denotes that the 

receptacle of good is to be purified by the holy affection of external truth, and by the holy truth
from the Word, 7846, 3424; and with the living bird, and the cedar wood, hyssop and scarlet, 
denotes with the affection of good, and by interior and exterior truth specifically from the 
word and conjoined with good, 91826, ver. 51.

53. Letting go the living bird out of the city into the field denotes that the affection of good is left 
perfectly free in the full enjoyment of heavenly life and happiness internal and external, 7439, 
3310, 99, 1869, 91826; and making atonement for the house and its being clean denotes that 
external good is reconciled with internal, and that complete purity prevails, 10042 II., 1488, 
4545.

54. This is the law for all manner of plague of leprosy and for a itch denotes that these are the laws
of Divine Order with regard to the profanation of truth, and to the evil affections which are 
active in the course of regeneration and tend to such profanation, 2634, 10219, 6963, 7524.

55. For the leprosy of a garment, and for a house, denotes also with regard to those evil affections 
by which true doctrine is profaned, and by which receptacles of good in the external man are 
profaned, 5006, 6963, 1488.

165

56. For a rising and for a scab, and for a bright spot, denotes with regard to the removal of evil 

affections tending to profanation from sensual love, from the love of the world, and from 
selfish love successively, 7524, 2240, ver. 2.

57. To teach when it is unclean and when it is clean, this being the law of leprosy, denotes that the 
man of the church may thence know how to discriminate between impurity and purity, both 
with respect to the will and understanding, 7007, 10130, 4545, 683, 2634, 6963.

Discussion

It is very evident from the whole contents of this chapter in the literal sense that it must contain some 
hidden meaning, for otherwise the particular ceremonials mentioned throughout it would not be capable
of any reasonable explanation. Let us, therefore, reverently consider it in the light of the law of 
correspondences, according to which we now know that the Word of the Lord is written.

It is remarkable, to begin with, that the priest, on going out of the camp, finds the leper healed. But 
surely to be healed means that the leprosy has been removed, and, therefore, that the man is already 
pure before the ceremony of cleansing commences. How is this? It is to show that the Lord alone 
delivers man from the sin of profaning the truth, and that no outward ceremonials nor any external 
worship can effect this. But still, in order to be purified the profaner must do those things which are 
represented by the ceremonials and the sacrifices, and he must do them as from himself. We are not to 
infer, therefore, that the man does his part after being healed by the Lord, but while he is being healed.

Now what are the means of deliverance from profanation internally? They are the affections of truth 
exterior and interior, or, in other words, the affections of truth and good given to man by the Lord; and 
they are represented by birds, because the new life of the spiritual man is formed in his understanding, 
and he is not regenerated through the corrupt will, 40; these birds are to be living and clean, because all
life is from the Lord, and because nothing but what is pure comes from Him; and one of them is to be 
killed in an earthen vessel over running, or living, water, to denote preparation by self-denial in the 
receptacle of the natural man, for being made pure, by means of the truth of the Word conjoined with 
good, or of faith conjoined with charity, which is denoted by the living water.

But not only so. For it is the duty of him who would be spiritually clean not to be satisfied with truth 
from the Word in general merely. He must also discriminate, and learn by experience that certain 
particular truths only are adapted for the purification of different degrees of the life of his affections, 
and these varying truths, as we have seen, are respectively signified by cedar wood, scarlet and hyssop. 
And then observe carefully how man's efforts for his own purification are assisted by the unseen 
operations of the Lord. For dipping the living bird and the other things named in the blood of the dead 
bird is an expressive symbol of the Divine operation. When we die as to the flesh, we live as to the 
spirit, but not otherwise. And, of course, this leads to conjunction with the Lord by love, and lastly to 
the state of freedom so aptly denoted by letting the living bird go away into the open field. This, 
therefore, is the first part of the process of our purification, which is going on even during our whole 
life, and which is denoted by the sprinkling of him who is to be cleansed from leprosy seven times. Let 
us now consider the second.

Purification as to the natural or external man is here specifically considered; and the symbol of it, 
namely, washing, and shaving, and bathing, are so well known that they scarcely need to be illustrated; 
and they are threefold, because each degree of man's life itself consists of distinct degrees, for we are 
taught that these degrees exist in the greatest and in the least of all created things. But the garments, 

166

and the hair, and the flesh are so named as to show that this part of the process proceeds from without 
inwards, corresponding to the Divine operation from within outwards. This, therefore, is in agreement 
with the law of regeneration, which requires that man must be born not only of water, but of the spirit. 
And now we are required to notice that the result of purification in the external man is his introduction 
into the heavenly state in general, although not as yet specifically. For the leper, being clean, was 
allowed to come into the camp, but not to enter his own house. The camp denotes the heavenly state as 
to the order by arrangement of truths under good; but the house, in the best sense, denotes the specific 
state as to good, and no one can realize this unless, by regeneration, which is signified by the period of 
seven days, he totally rejects his own selfish life, and thus is purified as to good as well as with regard 
to truth. Hence, then, the second washing, and shaving, and bathing, with a more particular rejection of 
falsities, as the expressions with respect to the shaving clearly show. Thus ends the second part of the 
ceremony; but we have yet to reflect on the third.

And it is evident that here the eighth day denotes the new and full state of the heavenly life, in which 
the Lord is truly worshiped from good in every degree, as denoted by the particular offerings, and 
especially by the application of the blood and the oil, as exactly as the text describes, which is a most 
expressive way of showing how fully and completely Divine Truth and Good now permeate the man or
the angel. But it is not necessary to repeat what has been already sufficiently explained when giving the
references to these sacrifices. Only let it be remembered that even in heaven there are still the guilt 
offering and the sin offering, or, in other words, the acknowledgement that man of himself is liable to 
error, is nothing but evil, and is continually kept in good by the Lord. For by the two he-lambs 
respectively are denoted the truth of innocence, by which acknowledgement is made, while by the ewe-
lamb is signified the good of innocence which, spiritually, constitutes the burnt offering, or entire 
consecration to the Lord. And thus we see, as we have formerly seen, but now in a more striking 
manner, how it is really good, or love, that makes the atonement, and yet how at the same time it is 
effected by truth. While, therefore, in our daily lives, we give the preference to love as a principle, let 
us not forget the necessity of truth as a means, and that truth from good must come into our actions in 
order that our reconciliation with the Lord may be thorough. For observe it is the right ear, the right 
hand and the right foot that are to be sprinkled with the blood and anointed with the oil; and not only 
so, but that it is the tip of the ear, the thumb of the hand and the great toe of the foot that are to be so 
dealt with, in order to show that goodness must be conjoined with our truth, and that these must both 
together appear in our actions, and so in the ultimates. This is the proper way of trusting in the Lord 
and doing good. But note the preliminary to this in vers. 15-16 before proceeding. There is an interior 
operation of the will upon the understanding. The will receives good from the Lord, just as the priest 
takes the log of oil and pours it into the palm of his own left hand. Now pouring denotes influx (2 
Kings 4:4, and 3728), the left hand denotes the understanding, and the oil in the palm of the left hand, 
therefore, good manifested in truth. And then the dipping of the finger of the right hand in the oil in the 
left hand show's how power comes to man, by the conjoined and reciprocal operation of the will and 
the understanding, before he can bring the good and the true into ultimates, as described by what 
immediately follows. For by an external way man receives the truth into his understanding, that is, by 
reading the Word and being taught; but by an internal way the good into his will, that is, by influx; and 
thus he is enabled, before he practises them, to have conjunction with the Lord by acknowledgement.

Let the man of the church, therefore, be greatly stimulated by these reflections in endeavouring to lead 
the heavenly life. But something more yet remains to be said on the rest of this chapter which may be 
useful in this way also.

167

A person may be, spiritually, too poor, even in the heavens, to be able to worship the Lord from the 
internal good of innocence, signified by a lamb, when he is delivered from profanation. But, 
nevertheless, he can do this on a lower plane, for there are three heavens. It is not possible, therefore, 
for one who is only fitted by regeneration for the ultimate heaven to ascend and to become either 
spiritual or celestial. And, indeed, neither do such desire to do so. Every one is content, at last, to 
remain in his own heaven to eternity; and there also is scope for eternal progress. Now the worship of 
such is signified by the substitution of two turtledoves or two young pigeons for the second he-lamb 
and the ewe-lamb, and by a proportionately less expensive meal offering, which in this chapter 
represents worship in a less degree than the sacrifices. But this matter of the meal offering has been 
previously explained, and need not detain us. Also, since the rest of this description is the same as 
before, it is only necessary to add that herein we learn in what respects the regeneration of all men is 
similar. This happens because all human beings are images and likenesses of the Lord by creation, and 
are on that account capable of becoming so by regeneration. Now the practical value of the knowledge 
thus drawn from the internal sense of the Word is that each of us should seek, by co-operation with the 
Lord, to develop his own capabilities, and not to be deluded with the fancy that he ought to become 
what he sees so many superior to himself become. Let each of us, in fact, rather learn to receive the 
kingdom of God as little children than to aspire beyond our possibilities, or to seek for greatness rather 
than for goodness.

But what shall we say, finally, about leprosy in our houses? It is quite easy to conceive of a disease 
affecting our bodies or our minds, but a disease in a house it is difficult to think of, especially as writers
on this subject are of the opinion that leprosy was not infectious. Spiritually, however, the case is 
different. The house denotes the ultimate receptacle of good in the mind; and, therefore, this may be 
liable to be affected by any interior impurity. For the law is that the Internal shall form the External; 
and we are all required to build our own spiritual houses, a good thing for us being that we shall 
establish them upon the rock, and not build upon the sand. Hence then is the importance of being 
cleansed spiritually even as to sensual and corporeal affections, which are not unlike garments and 
houses.

Even just here, therefore, we have a great work before us; and it is interesting to observe that the 
process of cleansing is outwardly the same as that for deliverance from profanation generally. But, 
indeed, how many of the kind words we speak, and of the good actions we do, with the best motives 
and from enlightened judgement, are yet tainted with the thought of self! And what can possibly purify 
us but genuine affections, living truths, close conjunction with the Lord, a death to sin, and the glorious
liberty of the heavenly life? It is a fact that we must live for ever in the continual exercise of our bodily 
functions and powers; and therefore in heaven, as upon earth, we shall need continual purification, lest 
we profane the truth we love and the good we love through the quite unavoidable and proper use of our 
heads, our hands and our feet, and also of the clothing we wear. This, then, justifies the description in 
the latter part of our chapter. Let us heed it well.

The Contents of each Verse

1. And the LORD spoke to Moses and 

1. There is revelation from the Lord to those who are 

to Aaron, saying, 

in truth and in good giving the perception,

2. Speak to the children of Israel, and 
say to them, When any man has an 
issue out of his flesh, because of his 
issue he is unclean. 

2. And thence instruction to the man of the Spiritual 
Church, whereby he perceives that when any one 
thinks from the senses, from worldly love, or from 
selfish love, on this account his thought is falsity 
from evil and he is impure.

3. And this shall be his uncleanness in 
his issue: whether his flesh run with 
his issue, or his flesh be stopped 
from his issue, it is his uncleanness. 

3. And this is the origin of falsity or impurity in 

thought: whether evil be conjoined with falsity, or, 
as it were, separated from it, it is the origin of 
falsity.

4. Every bed whereon he that has the 

4. And every natural affection or doctrine, 

issue lies shall be unclean: and every
thing whereon he sits shall be 
unclean. 

contaminated by thought from these degraded 
loves, is impure; also every affection, from these 
loves, which is confirmed by such thought is 
impure.

5. And whoever toucheth his bed shall 
wash his clothes, and bathe himself 
in water, and be unclean until the 
even. 

5. Also the slightest contact with such merely natural 
affection or thought makes purification, externally 
and internally, necessary, and causes impurity until
a change of state takes place.

169

6. And he that sits on any thing 

whereon he that has the issue sat 
shall wash his clothes, and bathe 
himself in water, and be unclean 
until the even. 

7. And he that touches the flesh of him 
that has the issue shall wash his 
clothes, and bathe himself in water, 
and be unclean until the even. 

8. And if he that has the issue spit upon
him that is clean; then he shall wash 
his clothes, and bathe himself in 
water, and be unclean until the even. 

9. And what saddle soever he that has 
the issue rides upon shall be unclean.

6. Also every one who is disposed to confirm himself
in an evil practice or false doctrine, because the 
corrupt church in general, or any individual, has 
done so, must be purified externally and internally,
or as to thought and affection, and cannot be pure 
until a change of state occurs.

7. And if any one conjoins himself by affection with 
another who is in falsity of doctrine arising from 
sensual, worldly, or selfish love, he must be 
purified externally and internally, and will be 
impure until a change of state occurs through such 
purification.

8. And still further, if any one in such falsity from 

evil wilfully corrupts the life of another who is not 
so, that other must be purified externally and 
internally; nor can he be pure without a change of 
state.

9. Also every receptacle of truth in the intellect 

which is contaminated by contact with such falsity 
from evil is impure;

10. And whoever touches any thing that 
was under him shall be unclean until 
the even: and he that bears those 
things shall wash his clothes, and 
bathe himself in water, and be 
unclean until the even. 

10. Every receptacle of good in the will which is, in 
the same way, contaminated, is impure until a 
change of state; and even the mere thought of such
contamination, although it may appear necessary, 
requires purification externally and internally, by a
change of state.

11. And whomsoever he that has the 

issue touches, without having rinsed 
his hands in water, he shall wash his 
clothes, and bathe himself in water, 
and be unclean until the even. 

12. And the earthen vessel, which he 
that has the issue touches, shall be 
broken: and every vessel of wood 
shall be rinsed in water. 

11. Also if he who is in falsity from evil comes into 
contact spiritually, by some affection common to 
both, with him who is pure, he must purify himself
outwardly; and such contact makes purification 
necessary externally and internally, and also 
thereby a change of state.

12. And even the lowest receptacles of truth which are
but slightly contaminated with such falsity from 
evil, must be rejected; and the lowest receptacles 
of good must, under the same circumstances, be 
purified through the truth.

170

13. And when he that has an issue is 

13. And he who is to be purified from the falsity of 

cleansed of his issue, then he shall 
number to himself seven days for his
cleansing, and wash his clothes; and 
he shall bathe his flesh in running 
water, and shall be clean. 

14. And on the eighth day he shall take 
to him two turtledoves, or two young
pigeons, and come before the LORD 
to the door of the tent of meeting, 
and give them to the priest: 

15. And the priest shall offer them, the 
one for a sin offering, and the other 
for a burnt offering; and the priest 
shall make atonement for him before
the LORD for his issue. 

16. And if any man's seed of copulation 
go out from him, then he shall bathe 
all his flesh in water, and be unclean 
until the even. 

17. And every garment, and every skin, 

whereon is the seed of copulation, 
shall be washed with water, and be 
unclean until the even. 

18. The woman also with whom a man 
shall lie with seed of copulation, 
they shall both bathe themselves in 
water, and be unclean until the even. 

19. And if a woman have an issue, and 
her issue in her flesh be blood, she 
shall be in her impurity seven days: 
and whoever toucheth her shall be 
unclean until the even. 

evil must pass through the process of regeneration,
purifying himself externally and internally by 
means of the truth rendered active from good, and 
then he will be made pure.

14. And in his new state he will worship the Lord 

from the good or truth of faith, and acknowledge 
that he receives these from the Lord through the 
heavens, and thus from his state as to good.

15. And from this state of good he will truly worship; 
first, in order that evil may be removed, and 
secondly that he may devote himself to the Lord; 
and in this way, from Divine Good, will falsity 
from evil be removed, and reconciliation between 
the external and the internal man will be effected.

16. Again, when in the course of regeneration, the 

seed of Divine Truth with any one is vitiated by 
not being conjoined to its own good, such a person
must be purified completely by the application of 
the truth to life from a principle of good until the 
state of truth leading to good is at its end.

17. And every state of truth with man, whether 
external or internal, wherein the affection of 
conjoining truth with its own good is perverted, 
must be purified, but is not completely so until the 
state of truth leading to good is at its end.

18. And every natural affection of good which is in the

process of receiving the seed of truth for 
conjunction therewith, from its corresponding 
spiritual affection, is relatively impure in the 
process; and both affections require to be purified 
by the truth until a change of state, by the full 
conjunction of truth with good, is effected.

19. Also when any natural affection is corrupted by 
falsity from the evil of selfish love in a state of 
undergoing regeneration, that natural affection 
must be regenerated; and the slightest indulgence 
therein is impurity until the end of the state of truth
leading to good.

171

20. And every thing that she lies upon in
her impurity shall be unclean: every 
thing also that she sits upon shall be 
unclean. 

21. And whoever toucheth her bed shall 
wash his clothes, and bathe himself 
in water, and be unclean until the 
even. 

20. Also every doctrine contaminated by that natural 
affection is impure; and every confirmed state of 
that affection by falsity is impure.

21. And every one who is influenced by that false 

doctrine in the slightest degree must be purified 
externally and internally until the end of that state.

22. And whoever touches any thing that 
she sits upon shall wash his clothes, 
and bathe himself in water, and be 
unclean until the even. 

22. Also every one who is disposed to confirm himself
in an evil practice or false doctrine thence derived, 
must be purified externally and internally until the 
termination of the state.

23. And if it be on the bed, or on any 

23. And if that falsity from evil should contaminate 

thing whereon she sits, when he 
touches it, he shall be unclean until 
the even. 

the doctrine of truth or of good with any one who 
comes under the influence of that natural affection,
he is impure until a change of state takes place.

24. And if any man lie with her, and her 
impurity be upon him, he shall be 
unclean seven days; and every bed 
whereon he lies shall be unclean. 

25. And if a woman have an issue of her 

blood many days not in the time of 
her impurity, or if she have an issue 
beyond the time of her impurity; all 
the days of the issue of her 
uncleanness she shall be as in the 
days of her impurity: she is unclean. 

26. Every bed whereon she lies all the 
days of her issue shall be to her as 
the bed of her impurity: and every 
thing whereon she sits shall be 
unclean, as the uncleanness of her 
impurity. 

24. And if any one who is in the truth conjoins himself
with that affection, and its falsity contaminates 
him, he must pass through the holy state of 
regeneration; and all his doctrine will be rendered 
impure thereby.

25. And if any natural affection is contaminated with 
falsity from evil, when not in a state leading to 
regeneration, or from failure in passing through 
that state; so long as this state lasts it is impure, 
even as is the state of undergoing regeneration; 
and indeed more intensely so.

26. Every doctrine contaminated by such natural 

affection, in its falsity, is impure; and every state 
of that natural affection confirmed by falsity is 
impure, even as in the state of undergoing 
regeneration.

27. And whoever touches those things 
shall be unclean, and shall wash his 
clothes, and bathe himself in water, 
and be unclean until the even. 

27. And every one who is but a little influenced by 
these falsified states is impure, and must be 
purified externally and internally until the end of 
the state.

172

28. But if she be cleansed of her issue, 
then she shall number to herself 
seven days, and after that she shall 
be clean. 

29. And on the eighth day she shall take 
to her two turtledoves, or two young 
pigeons, and bring them to the priest,
to the door of the tent of meeting. 

30. And the priest shall offer the one for 
a sin offering, and the other for a 
burnt offering, and the priest shall 
make atonement for her before the 
LORD for the issue of her 
uncleanness. 

31. Thus shall you separate the children 
of Israel from their uncleanness, that 
they die not in their uncleanness, 
when they defile my tabernacle that 
is in the midst of them. 

28. But if that natural affection is purified from falsity,

it is to be acknowledged as the result of 
regeneration; for purification follows regeneration.

29. And in the new state of that natural affection, or of
the person in whom it is active, he will worship the
Lord from the good and truth of faith; and will 
acknowledge the Lord, and His influence through 
the heavens.

30. Also from Divine Good will there be the removal 
of evil, and the realization of love to the Lord; and 
the reconciliation of the external man with the 
internal will be effected by the removal of falsity 
from evil, and of its impurity.

31. And thus must every member of the Spiritual 
Church be made pure, that evil may not cause 
spiritual death, while there is want of harmony 
between the external man and the internal, where 
heavenly principles from the Lord are to be 
established.

32. This is the law of him that has an 

issue, and of him whose seed of 
copulation goes from him, so that he 
is unclean thereby; 

32. This is the law of Divine Order for the removal of 
falsity derived from selfish love; to prevent the 
violation of the sanctity of the heavenly marriage 
of truth with good, which produces impurity;

33. And of her that is sick with her 
impurity, and of him that has an 
issue, of the man, and of the woman,
and of him that lies with her that is 
unclean. 

33. For the removal of falsity from those who are in 
preparation for the heavenly marriage; for the 
removal of falsity from evil generally from 
spiritual and natural affections; and for the 
removal of the impure conjunction of the spiritual 
with the natural affections.

References and Notes

1. This is evident, because by Jehovah is denoted the Divine Being as to His love, 2001; by 

speaking is denoted influx, 2951; by Moses is denoted Divine Truth, or the Word, 7010; by 
Aaron is denoted Divine Good, 9946; and by saying is denoted perception, 1791, 1822.

2. By speaking to the children of Israel and saying is denoted instruction to the man of the 

Spiritual Church, 7304, 3654; and by any man having an issue out of his flesh, and on that 
account being unclean, is denoted any one thinking from the senses, from worldly love, and 
from selfish love and thence falsity from evil and impurity, 10283, 10130. Note particularly in 
the first reference of the two just given the words: "There is in man his own will and his own 
intellect; his own will is evil and his own intellect is falsity thence derived. The former, 

173

namely, his own will is signified by the flesh of man, and his own intellect by the blood of that
flesh," and thence observe, from the second, that the issue or flux, named in speaking1 of this 
chapter, clearly denotes evil thoughts flowing from evil affections.

3. The uncleanness in his issue denotes the evil which is the origin of impurity in thought, or, in 
other words, of the impurity of falsity, 10130; and whether his flesh run, or be stopped with his
issue, denotes whether evil be conjoined with falsity, or, as it were, separated from it, because 
running, in this case, conveys the idea of flowing in, 10130, and being stopped of being 
restrained from flowing in, 843.

4. Every bed whereon he that has the issue lies being unclean denotes that every natural affection

or doctrine contaminated by thought from these degraded loves is unclean, 6188, 10360 end, 
10130; and everything whereon he sits being unclean denotes that every affection from these 
loves which is confirmed by such thought is impure, 9422, 10130.

5. Whosoever touches his bed, washing his clothes, bathing himself in water, and being unclean 
until the evening, denotes that the slightest contact with such merely natural affection or 
thought makes purification externally and internally necessary, and causes impurity until a 
change of state takes place, 10130, 6188, 10360 end, 3147, 5006, 7844.

6. He that sits on anything whereon he that has the issue sat, washing his clothes, bathing himself

in water, and being unclean until evening, denotes that every one who is disposed to confirm 
himself in an evil practice because the corrupt church in general, or any individual, has done 
so, must be purified externally and internally, or as to thought and affection, and cannot be 
pure until a change of state occurs, 6188, ver. 2, 3147, 10130, 7844.

7. He that touches the flesh of him that has the issue, denotes one who conjoins himself by 

affection with another, who is in falsity of doctrine arising from sensual, worldly or selfish 
love, 10130, 780, 10283, 10130; washing his clothes and bathing himself in water, denote 
purification externally and internally, 3147, 5006; and being unclean until the evening denotes 
impurity until a change of state, 10130, 7844.

8. He that has the issue spitting upon another denotes one who is in such falsity from evil 
wilfully corrupting the life of another, who is not so, by falsifications of truth, because 
spitting, in a good sense, and making clay of the spittle, signifies the conjunction of truth with 
good, thus producing the good of faith, 66606, and therefore, in the opposite sense, spitting 
upon another clearly denotes corrupting his life and doctrine with falsity, 48354; washing his 
clothes and bathing himself in water denotes purification externally and internally, 3147, 5006,
683; and being unclean until the evening denotes impurity until a change of state, 10130, 
7844.

9. What saddle soever he that has the issue rides upon being unclean denotes that every 

receptacle of truth in the intellect contaminated by contact with such falsity is impure, 5531, 
2761, 2762, 10283, 10130.

10. Whosoever touching anything that was under him, and that bears those things, denote, the 

former, contamination with receptacles in the will, and the latter, contamination by the mere 
thought of such things, 10130, 3079, 5948, 8764; washing his clothes and bathing himself in 

174

water denote purification externally and internally, 3147, 5006; and being unclean until 
evening denotes impurity until a change of state, 10130, 7844.

11. Whomsoever he that has the issue touches without having rinsed his hands in water denotes he
who is in falsity from evil spiritually, or he who falsifies the truth, coming into contact with 
another by some affection common to both, without external purification, 10283, 10130, 3147;
and that other washing his clothes, bathing in water, and being unclean until the evening, 
denotes purification externally and internally until a change of state, 3147, 7844. Observe here
that it is touching another that denotes contact by a common affection, and rinsing the hands 
only that signifies merely external purification. The first is demonstrated from the words "so 
far as the will of the other is in agreement and makes one," at the beginning of 10130, and the 
second from 74423, where washing the feet and hands have reference to the purification of the 
Natural and washing the head to the purification of the Spiritual.

12. The earthen vessel touched by him who has the issue denotes the lowest receptacle of truth 
without good contaminated by falsity from evil, 10105, 10130, 10283; the vessel of wood 
denotes the receptacle of good, 643; and being broken or rinsed with water denotes to be 
rejected or to be purified through the truth, 9163, 3147.

13. He who has the issue being cleansed from his issue denotes the purification of him who, from 

evil love, falsifies the truth, 10283, 4545; numbering to himself seven days for his cleansing 
denotes that he must pass through the process of regeneration (Gen. i. throughout), 716; 
washing his clothes and bathing his flesh in running water denotes purification externally and 
internally, 3147, 5006, 3424; and being clean denotes purity spiritually, 4545.

14. The eighth day denotes the new state, 9227; taking two turtledoves or two young pigeons 

denotes the worship of the Lord from the good or truth of faith, 1826, 1827; coming before the
Lord to the door of the tent of meeting denotes the acknowledgement that he receives these 
from the Lord through the heavens, 2356, 35403; and giving them to the priest denotes thus 
from his state as to good, 9946.

15. The priest offering them denotes that from this state of good he will truly worship, 9946; the 
one for a sin offering and the other for a burnt offering, denotes in order that evil may be 
removed, and that he may devote himself to the Lord, 3400, 10053; and the priest making 
atonement for him before the Lord for his issue, denotes that, in this way, from Divine Good, 
will falsity from evil be removed, and reconciliation between the external and internal man be 
effected, 10283, 10042, II.

16. Any man's seed of copulation going out from him denotes here, "when, in the course of 

regeneration, the seed of Divine Truth with any one is vitiated by not being conjoined to its 
own good," 880, 1798,

4837; bathing all his flesh in water, denotes purification completely by the application of the 
truth to life from a principle of good, 3147, 1798, 780; and being unclean until even, denotes 
impurity until the state of truth leading to good is at its end, 7844, 9274.

17. Every garment, and every skin wherein is the seed of copulation, being washed with water and
being unclean until the even, denotes that every state of truth with man, whether external or 
internal, wherein the affection of conjoining truth with its own good is perverted, must be 

175

purified, but is not completely so until the state of truth leading to good is at its end, 9215, 
880, 1798, 4837, 3147, 7844, 9274.

18. The woman, in this case, denotes the natural affection of good and the man the spiritual 

affection of truth, because the Hebrew word for man here used is ish, 915; seed denotes truth 
for conjunction with good, 880, 1798; the woman also denotes a natural affection and the man 
a spiritual affection, 39692, 155; and both bathing themselves in water and being unclean until
the even denotes purification until a change of state by the full conjunction of truth with good 
is effected, 7884, 9274, 3147.

19. A woman having an issue denotes a natural affection corrupted by falsity from the evil of 

selfish love, 3969, 155, 10283; her issue in her flesh being blood denotes a state of undergoing
regeneration, 10283, 4161; being in her impurity seven days denotes that the natural affection 
shall be regenerated (Gen. i. throughout), 716; and anybody touching her being unclean until 
even denotes that the slightest indulgence therein is impurity until the end of the state of truth 
leading to good, 10130, 7844, 9274.

contaminated by that natural affection is impure, 6188, 10360 end, 10130; and everything that 
she sits upon being unclean, denotes that every confirmed state of that affection by falsity is 
impure, 9422, 10130.

21. Whosoever touches her bed denotes every one who is influenced by that false doctrine in the 

slightest degree, 10130, 6188, 10360; washing his clothes and bathing himself in water denote 
purification externally and internally, 3147, 5006; and being unclean until the even denotes 
impurity until the end of that state, 10130, 7844.

22. Whosoever touches any thing that she sits upon denotes any one who is disposed to confirm 

himself in an evil practice, or false doctrine thence derived, 10130, 9422; washing his clothes 
and bathing himself in water denote purification externally and internally, 3147, 5006; and 
being unclean until the even denotes impurity until the termination of the state, 10130, 7844.

23. Its being on the bed, or on any thing whereon she sits, denotes if that falsity from evil should 
contaminate the doctrine of truth or of good, 39692, 155, 10283, 10360, 9422, 3552; touching 
denotes coming under the influence of, 10130; and being unclean until the even denotes 
impurity until a change of state, 10130, 7844.

24. Any man lying with her denotes if any one in the truth conjoins himself with that affection and
its falsity, 915, 4433; her impurity being upon him denotes contamination by that affection and
its falsity, 10283, 10130, ver. 2; being unclean seven days denotes passing through the holy 
state of regeneration, 716, 10130; and every bed whereon he lies being unclean denotes that 
doctrine will be rendered impure thereby, 10360, 10130.

25. A woman having an issue of blood many days not in the time of her impurity denotes if any 

natural affection is contaminated with falsity from evil when not in a state leading to 
regeneration, 10283, 4161; beyond the time of her impurity denotes from failure in passing 
through that state (Gen. i. throughout), 716, 487; all the days of her issue being as the days of 
her impurity denotes that as long as this; state lasts it is impure, as is the state of undergoing 

176

regeneration, 10130, 4161, 10283; and she is unclean denotes, indeed, more intensely so, 
10130.

26. Every bed whereon she lies all the days of her issue being to her as the bed of her impurity, 

denotes that every doctrine contaminated by such natural affection in its falsity is impure, 
10360, 10283, 10130; and everything whereon she sits being unclean, as the uncleanness of 
her impurity, denotes that every state of that natural affection confirmed by falsity is impure 
even as in the state of undergoing regeneration, 9422, 10130, 10283, 4161.

27. Whosoever touching those things being unclean denotes that every one who is but a little 

influenced by these falsified states is impure, 10130, 10283; washing his clothes and bathing 
himself in water denote purification externally and internally through the Word, 3147, 5006, 
2702; and being unclean until even denotes the continuance of impurity until a change of state,
10130, 7844.

28. If she be cleansed from her impurity, numbering to herself seven days, and then being clean, 

denotes that if that natural affection is purified from falsity, it is to be acknowledged as the 
result of regeneration; for purification follows regeneration, 4545 (Gen. i. throughout), 716, 
10239.

29. The eighth day denotes a new state of that natural affection, 9227; taking two turtledoves or 
two young pigeons denotes the worship of the Lord from the good or truth of faith, 1826, 
1827; and bringing them to the priest at the door of the tent of meeting, denotes the

30. The priest offering one for a sin offering, and the other for a burnt offering, denotes that, from 

Divine Good, there will be the removal of evil, and the realization of love to the Lord, 9946, 
3400, 10053; and the priest making atonement for her before the Lord for the issue of her 
uncleanness denotes the reconciliation of the external man with the internal by the removal of 
falsity from evil, and of its impurity, 10042 II., 10130, 10283.

31. Thus shall you separate the children of Israel from their unclean-ness denotes that thus must 

every member of the Spiritual Church be made pure, 3654, 10130, 10283; that they die not in 
their uncleanness, denotes that evil may not cause spiritual death, 129, 10130; and when they 
defile my tabernacle that is in the midst of them, denotes while there is want of harmony 
between the external man and the internal, where heavenly principles from the Lord are to be 
established, 10130, 3210, 6028.

32. The law of him that has an issue, and of him whose seed of copulation goes from him so that 
he is unclean thereby, denotes the law of Divine Order for the removal of falsity derived from 
selfish love, and to prevent the violation of the sanctity of the heavenly marriage of truth with 
good which produces impurity, 10283, 880, 1798, 4837, 2634, 10130.

33. Of her that is sick with her impurity denotes the law for the removal of falsity from those who 
are in the course of regeneration, 2634, 10283, 4161; of him that has an issue, the man and the 
woman, denotes for the removal of falsity from evil generally, from the spiritual and natural 
affections, 915, 10283; and of him that lies with her that is unclean denotes for the removal of 
the impure conjunction of the spiritual with the natural affections, 4433, 10283, 10130.

Discussion

Two thoughts are suggested in commencing the reconsideration of the foregoing particulars of Divine 
Truth, namely, first that the Lord teaches every individual of the church by influx and by instruction, 
and secondly, that this man with the issue is a type of a state to which each of us is subject. For we all 
have some light, or rather some enlightenment interiorly, from Divine Truth, and some instruction 
outwardly, and when we think of it we may discern that the latter is of very little use without the 
former. Oh blessed capacity, given to man alone of all living creatures, that he can see the spiritual 
light! And it is also a great blessing that, by its means he can know truths from the Word, and thence 
discover the extent to which he thinks what is false from his natural selfishness, which thinking is here 
denoted by the issue out of his flesh.

Out of the selfish heart of man proceed evil thoughts (Mark 7:21). But man cannot help it; nor is he 
responsible for it, except so far as he consents by indulgence, and by willing to act out such evil 
thoughts (TCR 658). Reflect on that. These bad thoughts flow into us, however, from wicked spirits, 
and the reason why they do so is because there is a root of evil in ourselves which attracts them. Now it
is just this root of evil that we require to see, and the Lord by the Word enables us to see it, so that we 
may be cleansed from our spiritual issue.

Note next the difference between the flesh running with the issue, and being stopped from it because 
the former shows the operation of the will, and the latter the non-consent of the will; and note also that 
both states are spiritual impurity, although the latter involves the restraining influence of the 
conscience. Purification, therefore, from evil thoughts is necessary, although they are "stopped" as the 
text says. Also, there are two states of evil thoughts respectively denoted by lying on a bed, or sitting on
a seat, and the one, of course, has reference to the understanding and the other to the will.

But now follow some cases showing that other people may suffer impurity on account of the evil 
thoughts which flow into us, and which we are disposed to encourage or to confirm. This, however, is 
not alone because we may utter such thoughts, but because they contaminate the spiritual atmosphere 
which surrounds us, and may be communicated surely, if silently, to others. Now it is worth while to 
repress such imaginations, that we may not even unconsciously do injury without intending it. And the 
cases must be considered. False doctrine is the deadly thing which, if the regenerating man drinks, it 
will not very seriously injure him, but it will produce impurity all the same, if there is spiritual contact 
therewith. Still more will there be danger, if one is disposed to confirm falsities by which he is 
influenced. And certainly he will injure himself, to a greater degree, who conjoins himself by affection 
with one who is in such falsities. Also much more will injury happen to one who is deliberately 
rendered impure by him who is in such a state. Thus much, then, for the affections generally. And we 
shall find similar results as to intellectual things, whether they be thoughts or feelings connected 
therewith; and these are aptly denoted by the saddle and those things which follow, as the interpretation
in its series shows; while purification can only come by means of the truth, and by the genuine worship 
of the Lord which follows the conclusion of the state called evening, and is represented by the eighth 
day. Now these are real experiences to the regenerating man; and by reflecting on them as here 
described in the correspondential language of the Word, we may promote our own progress; we may be
more watchful against all evil thoughts; and more prayerful lest we should enter into temptation.

We come now to the consideration of the heavenly marriage of goodness and truth, which is not only 
the consummation of Regeneration, but which also may be said to constitute regeneration all through 
the process. Nothing, therefore, can be more holy, and pure, and clean than this heavenly marriage, and 

178

therefore the conjunction of the Lord with His church is likened to a marriage (Rev 21:2), and indeed 
the true marriage of one man with one woman for which the Lord provides (Matt 19:4-6) derives its 
origin from this heavenly marriage, and is, in this way, equally holy, and pure and clean. But it must be 
observed, nevertheless, that during regeneration there is impurity, even in connection with marriage in 
both senses; and in the spiritual series before us this is the subject.

Now how is it that the seed of Divine Truth becomes vitiated by not being conjoined to its own good? 
Divine Truth as proceeding from the Lord is pure, and so is the truth proceeding from the good in us, so
far as it constitutes our regenerated individuality; but every human being is born with an unregenerated 
individuality, and both these, taken together, constitute the proprium of man, or the complex life of man
as distinct from the Lord, 155. And since the individuality into which man is born is nothing but evil, 
and thence error, we may see how falsity from this evil may contaminate the truth received from good 
in us, and actually become the origin of all impurity. If, then, in regard to marriage, we wish to be pure,
even as the angels are pure, we must evidently be regenerated internally and externally, and thus 
purified both as to the understanding and will (HH 367). And this is the sum and substance of the 
teaching before us, to which it may be added, that this grand purification must be effected altogether, as
it were, by ourselves; for no one can be in true and heavenly marriage love unless he is regenerated, 
and no one can be regenerated and thus conjoined with the Lord to eternity unless he reciprocates the 
Lord's great love for him. We love Him, in short, because He first loved us.

But the remainder of this chapter does not need particular consideration as to its details, since most of 
them are the same as those already commented upon. It is only necessary, therefore, to reflect upon the 
distinction made between a woman having an issue during the time of her impurity or separation, and 
another having an issue not in the time of her impurity or beyond it. And from this we learn that some 
may not be regenerated at all, while others may fail in the process. By which we are reminded of the 
statements that "every society in heaven has a society opposite to it in hell; and also that, in both, the 
societies are innumerable" (see HH 541, 588). Let us therefore "Strive" to enter in at the straight gate, 
and not merely "seek" to do so, according to the Lord's words (Luke 13:24).

Leviticus Chapter 16

Summary of the Spiritual Sense

1. There is revelation from the Lord when merely external worship has been rejected by man, 
concerning the manifestation of inmost good, namely, that it must be by the removal of evil 
externally and internally; by devotion to the Lord; and by the instrumentality of truths, vers. 1-4.

2. Also there shall be the removal of evil externally as well as internally, by acknowledging the 

Lord; by freedom of choice; by worship; and by the rejection of evil, vers. 5-10. 
3. The whole process of this purification is more accurately described, vers. 11-22. 
4. Then follow the genuine acknowledgement that all truths are from the Lord; a state of worship 
from pure love; the confession that man's highest good is from the Lord; and that continual 
purification is necessary in order to realize the heavenly state, vers. 23-28. 

5. And lastly there is, in consequence of this holy course of regeneration and purification, the full 

enjoyment of heavenly peace and rest, even to eternity, vers. 29-34. 

The Contents of each Verse

1. And the LORD spoke to Moses, after
the death of the two sons of Aaron, 
when they drew near before the 
LORD, and died; 

1. There is revelation from the Lord by Divine Truth,
when external worship from the loves of self and 
the world without internal is abolished, because it 
is hypocritical and profane.

2. And the LORD said to Moses, Speak
to Aaron your brother, that he come 
not at all times into the holy place 
within the veil, before the mercy-
seat which is upon the ark; that he 
die not: for I will appear in the 
cloud upon the mercy-seat. 

3. Herewith shall Aaron come into the 
holy place: with a young bullock for
a sin offering, and a ram for a burnt 
offering. 

2. And this revelation is not only external but 

internal, and teaches that, in the worship of the 
Lord from Divine Good, man cannot, in every 
state of the church, enter into the perception and 
realization of inmost good which is celestial, and 
is distinguished from spiritual good by 
intermediate good, and wherein the Lord is present
to hear and receive all worship, and to remove evil
from man by his reception of the Divine Law in 
his heart; and the reason is, because, in this case, 
he would perish; but that still the Lord reveals 
Himself in the obscurity of man's states, which 
happens from the Divine Mercy.

3. And by this means is the man who is in good, and 
the Lord Himself in His glorification, led into his 
inmost life: he must be purified from evil in the 
external man, or in the natural degree, and also in 
the internal man, or in the spiritual degree, by the 
good of innocence; and in the spiritual degree he 
must worship the Lord by full devotion from the 
good of love.

180

4. He shall put on the holy linen coat, 
and he shall have the linen breeches 
upon his flesh, and shall be girded 
with the linen girdle, and with the 
linen mitre shall he be attired: they 
are the holy garments; and he shall 
bathe his flesh in water, and put 
them on. 

4. Also such purification is effected by truths from 
good, that is, by the truths of the exterior natural; 
by the doctrine of the conjunction of truth with 
good externally; by the common bond conjoining 
truths with good internally; and by the intelligence 
of truth inmostly; for by these man is made pure 
and holy when he does the work of repentance by 
the application of external truths to life.

5. And he shall take of the 

congregation of the children of 
Israel two he-goats for a sin 
offering, and one ram for a burnt 
offering. 

6. And Aaron shall present the bullock
of the sin offering, which is for 
himself, and make atonement for 
himself, and for his house. 

5. Moreover, the external man must be purified from 
falsities by the application of the truths of faith 
through which evil is removed, and by devotion to 
the Lord from charity.

6. And the interior natural must be purified by the 

removal of evil through the acknowledgement of 
the Lord from good, whereby the reconciliation of 
the natural with the spiritual man is effected both 
as to good and truth.

7. And he shall take the two goats, and
set them before the LORD at the 
door of the tent of meeting. 

7. While the truths of faith shall thereby be 

acknowledged to be from the Lord and His 
operation through the heavens.

8. And Aaron shall cast lots upon the 
two goats; one lot for the LORD, and
the other lot for Azazel. 

8. For by the Divine Providence, man must choose 
for himself between good and evil, and thus 
between truth and falsity.

9. And Aaron shall present the goat 
upon which the lot fell for the 
LORD, and offer him for a sin 
offering. 

10. But the goat, on which the lot fell 

for Azazel, shall be set alive before 
the LORD, to make atonement for 
him, to send him away for Azazel 
into the wilderness. 

9. And then from a principle of good, he must 
worship the Lord in order that evil may be 
removed and rejected.

10. And it must be acknowledged before the Lord that 
man of himself is really in falsity from evil, so that
the External may be reconciled to the Internal by 
the complete rejection of such falsity.

11. And Aaron shall present the bullock
of the sin offering, which is for 
himself, and shall make atonement 
for himself, and for his house, and 
shall kill the bullock of the sin 
offering which is for himself: 

11. But first and above all things, must he who is in 

good acknowledge that he receives that good from 
the Lord, so that evil may be removed, and the 
reconciliation of the natural man, as to good may 
be effected both internally and externally, and that 
thus he may be prepared to worship the Lord.

181

12. And he shall take a censer full of 
coals of fire from off the altar 
before the LORD, and his hands full 
of sweet incense beaten small, and 
bring it within the veil: 

12. And then by the reception of good from the Lord, 
and truth from the Word, which is grateful and 
acceptable in worship, and which is carefully 
arranged and distinguished under good, he shall 
have a perception of inmost good.

13. And he shall put the incense upon 
the fire before the LORD, that the 
cloud of the incense may cover the 
mercy-seat that is upon the 
testimony, that he die not: 

14. And he shall take of the blood of the
bullock, and sprinkle it with his 
finger upon the mercy-seat on the 
east; and before the mercy-seat shall
he sprinkle of the blood with his 
finger seven times. 

15. Then shall he kill the goat of the sin 

offering, that is for the people, and 
bring his blood within the veil, and 
do with his blood as he did with the 
blood of the bullock, and sprinkle it 
upon the mercy-seat, and before the 
mercy-seat: 

16. And he shall make atonement for 
the holy place, because of the 
uncleannesses of the children of 
Israel, and because of their 
transgressions, even all their sins: 
and so shall he do for the tent of 
meeting, that dwells with them in 
the midst of their uncleannesses. 

13. And then also, from Divine Good shall the 

conjunction of truth with good take place, that thus
the Divine Love and Mercy may be manifested 
obscurely in appearances according to the state of 
the worshiper, lest spiritual death follow from too 
full a manifestation of Divine Love.

14. And then too, truth from purified natural good 

shall be conjoined with Divine Truth proceeding 
from Divine Good; and this shall be done with 
power in the natural man, from the holy state 
acquired by regeneration from the Lord.

15. Also the external of the natural man, or he who is 
in the good of faith, must be prepared in the same 
way, because the truth of this good is alike from 
the Lord by celestial good, and must be conjoined 
therewith internally and externally.

16. For, indeed, even celestial good, or those in that 
good, must be reconciled with Divine Good, 
because man of himself is altogether impure, as to 
the exterior, and as to the interior, and is nothing 
but evil; and so must it be also with spiritual good,
or those in that good, and with natural good, or 
those in that good, in order that the Lord may be 
present with man from inmost things to lowest 
things by the acknowledgement, on his part, that of
himself he is only evil.

17. And there shall be no man in the 

17. And yet, truly, the worship of the Lord by man 

tent of meeting when he goes in to 
make atonement in the holy place, 
until he come out, and have made 
atonement for himself, and for his 
household, and for all the assembly 
of Israel. 

from inmost good, for the reconciliation of his life 
with the Lord's life, must be entirely as from 
himself without any admixture of evil or falsity, 
with inmost good, with interior good, or with good
most external.

182

18. And he shall go out to the altar that 
is before the LORD, and make 
atonement for it; and shall take of 
the blood of the bullock, and of the 
blood of the goat, and put it upon 
the horns of the altar round about. 

19. And he shall sprinkle of the blood 
upon it with his finger seven times, 
and cleanse it, and hallow it from 
the uncleannesses of the children of 
Israel. 

20. And when he has made an end of 
atoning for the holy place, and the 
tent of meeting, and the altar, he 
shall present the live goat: 

21. And Aaron shall lay both his hands 
upon the head of the live goat, and 
confess over him all the iniquities of
the children of Israel, and all their 
transgressions, even all their sins; 
and he shall put them upon the head
of the goat, and shall send him away
by the hand of a man that is in 
readiness into the wilderness: 

18. And as a consequence of this, celestial good from 
Divine Good, will then flow down to ultimates 
with man, and the conjunction of truth with good 
in holy worship will then be effected there 
mutually and reciprocally with fullness and power 
by means of the Divine Truths of the literal sense 
of the Word.

19. And this shall be accomplished, indeed, in the holy
state of regeneration, through the exercise of 
power by man according to his state, by 
purification and by worship, that there may be 
deliverance from all the impurity to which the man
of the church is inclined in his unregenerate state.

20. And now, therefore, when the state of regeneration
is fully completed by the reconciliation of the 
internal, interior, and external man with the Lord, 
he will acknowledge before the Lord how full of 
evil he is by the influx of falsity from evil in the 
natural man from the hells;

21. And from his state of inmost good, with all the 
power of the will and understanding, he will 
perceive and confess that, as to the whole and 
every part, with regard to offences against the 
good of faith, against the truth of faith, and against
holy charity itself, he is guilty; but that 
nevertheless he is enabled by the Lord to reject 
evil, and to separate it from himself, through the 
power of the Divine Human, to the hells from 
which it flows in;

22. And the goat shall bear upon him all
their iniquities to a solitary land: 
and he shall let go the goat in the 
wilderness. 

22. And this shall be done by the Lord through the 

work of redemption, falsity also being separated 
with evil, and remaining with those only who are 
without good and truth.

23. And Aaron shall come into the tent 
of meeting, and shall put off the 
linen garments, which he put on 
when he went into the holy place, 
and shall leave them there: 

23. And then he who is in good shall come into the 
enjoyment of the heavenly life, and shall 
acknowledge that all the holy truths by which 
regeneration is, and has been effected, are from the
Lord, and not from himself, although he is, and has
been required to use them as from himself.

183

24. And in that holy state he shall 

24. And he shall bathe his flesh in water in a holy

states of worship from pure love,

external man which are now both

each other.

and offer his burnt offering and the burnt offering

Azazel shall wash his clothes, and 
bathe his flesh in water, and 
afterward he shall come into the 
camp. 

27. And the bullock of the sin offering, 
and the goat of the sin offering, 
whose blood was brought in to 
make atonement in the holy place, 
shall be carried forth without the 
camp; and they shall burn in the fire
their skins, and their flesh, and their 
dung. 

influx from the Divine Human, has thus rejected 
falsity from evil, shall acknowledge that he needs 
continual purification externally and internally, in 
order that he may enter into and remain in the 
heavenly state.

27. But the good of the natural man which is 

obedience, and the truth thereof which is the truth 
of faith, as realized by the spiritual man during 
regeneration, and consequent purification, are to 
be separated from the heavenly state also, and are 
to be entirely rejected by the power of pure 
heavenly love, with every seeming truth or good, 
and all evil and falsity therewith connected in the 
process of regeneration.

28. And he that burns them shall wash

water, and afterward he shall come

who thus, as from himself rejects appearances, 
with evils and falsities of all kinds, is to be 
purified externally still further, before fully 
realizing the heavenly state.

29. And it shall be a statute for ever to 
you: in the seventh month, on the 
tenth day of the month, you shall 
afflict your souls, and shall do no 
manner of work, the native, or the 
stranger that sojourns among you: 

29. And this is the eternal law of Divine Order as to 

the purification of the external man in the holy 
state of faith and charity, in the course of 
regeneration, when remains of good and truth are 
to be fully implanted there, through victory in 
temptations and thence the realization of heavenly 
peace and rest. And this is applicable alike to the 
man of the internal church and the man of the 
external.

184

30. For on this day shall atonement be 
made for you, to cleanse you; from 
all your sins shall you be clean 
before the LORD. 

30. For only in this way can the reconciliation of the 

Human with the Divine in the Lord's glorification, 
of man with the Lord in regeneration, and of the 
external with the internal man be accomplished. 
And the result of the whole process is the full 
deliverance of man, in the heavenly state, from all 
actual evil and falsity and impurity.

31.

It is a Sabbath of solemn rest to you,
and you shall afflict your souls; it is 
a statute for ever. 

31. And surely this heavenly state is a state of peace 
and rest derived from victory in temptations; 
moreover, it is an eternal state.

of the church; and reconciliation with the Lord 
shall be effected by the instrumentality of the 
exterior truths of the natural man, and a state of 
holiness; for those truths are holy from good.

assembly. 

34. And this shall be an everlasting 

statute to you, to make atonement

Moses.

spiritual man both as to good and truth, since Aaron himself denotes good, and his sons who 
constitute his house denote truth, 9946.

7. Aaron taking the two goats and setting them before the Lord at the door of the tent of meeting,
denotes that the truths of faith shall thereby be acknowledged to be from the Lord, and His 
operation through the heavens, 96706, 4169, 725, 2456, 35403.

8. By casting lots, when said by Aaron, is denoted dependence upon Divine Providence, 9946, 

6494, 3239, 90935; by one lot for the Lord is denoted man's free choice of good, 2001; and by 
one lot for Azazel, which means "dismissal," is denoted man's free rejection of evil, 10023. It 
is said "man must choose for himself between good and evil, and thus between truth and 
falsity," that is, must exercise a free choice, because this is involved in the obedience of Aaron 
to the instruction of Moses, dependence upon the Divine Providence at the same time being 

186

involved in the casting of lots. When man, in every action of his life, does what he does from a
principle of good, he is depending upon Divine Providence (Ps 37:3).

9. By Aaron presenting the goat upon which the lot fell for the Lord and offering him for a sin 

offering is denoted that then from a principle of good man must worship the Lord in order that 
evil may be removed and rejected, 9946, 96706, 4169, 725, 3400.

10. The goat on which the lot fell for Azazel, being set alive before the Lord to make atonement 

for him to send him away for Azazel into the wilderness, denotes that it must be acknowledged
before the Lord that man of himself is really in falsity from evil, so that the External may be 
reconciled with the Internal by the complete rejection of such falsity, 96706, 10042 II.

11. Aaron presenting the bullock of the sin offering which is for himself denotes that, first and 
above all things, must he who is in good acknowledge that he receives that good from the 
Lord, 5619; the bullock denotes the good of innocence in the Natural, 9990; a sin offering 
denotes worship for the removal of evil through that good of innocence, 3400; Aaron making 
atonement for himself and for his house denotes the reconciliation of the natural with the 
spiritual man both as to good and truth, or internally and externally, since Aaron himself 
denotes good, and his sons who constitute his house denote truth, 9946, and also because 
Aaron denotes good and the congregation truth, 45744; and killing the bullock of the sin 
offering which was for himself denotes preparation to worship the Lord, 10024.

The careful reader will here note that this verse is a repetition of ver. 6, and also that the first 
ten verses of the chapter form a general Introduction and summary of the whole. The reason is 
because the whole subject is concerning the perpetual removal of evils and falsities, 10211, 
and the summary, in the internal sense, shows that this is foreseen and provided for by the 
Lord, and that the internal man, or more strictly, the internal of the natural man, is potentially 
delivered from evil when regeneration has commenced, so that, if man perseveres to the end, 
he will be fully delivered so far as any temptation from evil is implied, when he is initiated or 
inaugurated into his own prevailing state of good. But it must be remembered also that 
purification is perpetual also in heaven itself, and is involved in the perpetual progress in the 
heavenly life which there goes on.

12. Taking a censer full of coals of fire from off the altar before the Lord denotes the reception of 
good from the Lord in genuine worship, this good being embodied in truth and contained in its
receptacle, 5531, 934, 9714; incense denotes truth from the Word which is grateful and 
acceptable in worship from good, 9475; the incense being sweet and beaten small denotes 
truths carefully arranged and distinguished under good, 5620, 10303; and bringing these things
within the veil denotes thence the perception of inmost good, 96706.

13. By Aaron is denoted Divine Good, 9946; by putting the incense upon the fire is clearly 

denoted the conjunction of truth with good, 9475, 934; by the cloud of incense covering the 
mercy-seat is denoted that the Divine Love and Mercy are manifested obscurely in 
appearances according to the state of the worshiper, 96706; by the mercy-seat being upon the 
testimony is denoted that Divine Love flows into the truths of the Word, 9506, 9503; and not 
dying denotes lest spiritual death follow from too full a manifestation of Divine Love, 7699. 
7738.

187

14. The blood of the bullock, denotes truth from purified natural good, 10026; sprinkling it 
denotes conjunction, 10047; upon the mercy-seat on the east denotes with Divine Truth 
proceeding from Divine Good, 9506, 9503, 1250; the finger denotes power, 7430; it is said in 
the natural man, because it was the blood of the bullock; and before the mercy-seat seven 
times denotes from the holy state acquired by regeneration from the Lord, 716 (Gen. i. 
throughout).

15. His killing the goat of the sin offering that is for the people, denotes that the external of the 
natural man, or he who is in the good of faith, must be prepared in the same way, 10024, 
9670°, 4169, 725, 45744; bringing the blood within the veil denotes that the truth of this good 
is alike from the Lord by celestial good and is adapted to the state of man, 96706; and 
sprinkling the blood upon the mercy-seat and before the mercy-seat denotes that it must be 
conjoined therewith internally and externally, 10047, 95°6-

16. Making atonement for the holy place denotes that, indeed, even celestial good, or those in that 
good, must be reconciled with Divine Good, 3210, 10042 II., because of the uncleanness of 
the children of Israel, and because of their transgressions, even all their sins, denotes because 
man of himself is altogether impure as to the exterior and as to the interior, and is nothing but 
evil, 10130, 9156; and doing this also for the tent of meeting that dwells in the midst of 
uncleanness, denotes that so it must be also with those in spiritual good or those in natural 
good, in order that the Lord may be present with man from inmost things to lowest things, by 
the acknowledgement on his part that he is nothing but evil, 35303, 10153, 10130.

17. No man being in the tent of meeting when Aaron went into the most holy place, denotes that 
the worship of the Lord by man from inmost good must be entirely as from himself, without 
any admixture of evil or falsity, 9946, 3210, 7424; and making atonement for himself and for 
his household, and for all the assembly of Israel, denotes the reconciliation of man's life with 
the Lord's life as to inmost good, as to interior good and as to good most external, 10042 II., 
9946, 45744.

18. Aaron going out to the altar that is before the Lord denotes that celestial good from Divine 
Good will then flow down to ultimates with man, 9946, 5337, 10001, 10242; making 
atonement denotes the reconciliation of the external man with the internal, 10042 II.; and 
taking the blood of the bullock and the blood of the goat and putting it upon the horns of the 
altar round about, denotes that the conjunction of truth with good in holy worship will then be 
effected there mutually and reciprocally with fullness and power by means of Divine Truths of
the literal sense of the Word, vers. 14, 15, 10027.

The reason why it is said here, "fullness and power by means of the Divine Truths of the literal
sense of the Word," is because there were four horns to the altar at the four corners, this 
denoting completeness, 9720; and Divine Truth is complete and full in the literal sense of the 
Word, 6943, 9349.

19. Sprinkling the blood upon the altar with his finger seven times, and cleansing and hallowing it 
from the uncleanness of the children of Israel, denotes that this shall be accomplished, indeed, 
in the holy state of regeneration, through the exercise of power by man according to his state, 
by purification and by worship, that there may be deliverance from all impurity to which the 

188

man of the church is inclined in his unregenerate state, 10047, vers. 14, 15, 10027, 716, Gen. 
i., 4545, 10130.

20. Making an end of atoning for the holy place, and the tent of meeting and the altar, and 

presenting the live goat, denotes that when the state of regeneration is fully completed by the 
reconciliation of the internal, interior and external man with the Lord, man will acknowledge 
before the Lord how full of evil he is by the influx of falsity from evil in the natural man from 
the hells, 10042 II., 3210, 35403, 10001, 96706.

21. Aaron laying both his hands upon the head of the live goat denotes that from his state of 

inmost good man will act with all the power of the will and the understanding, 9946, 8066, 
10061-2, 10023; confessing over him all the iniquities of the children of Israel, and all their 
transgressions, even all their sins, denotes to perceive and confess that as to the whole and 
every part, with regard to offences against the good of faith, against the truth of faith, and 
against holy charity itself he is guilty, 9156; putting them upon the head of the goat denotes 
power from the Lord to reject evil and separate it from himself, 10023; sending him away to 
the wilderness denotes rejection to hell, 10023; and by the hand of a man who is in readiness 
denotes by the power of the Divine Human, because the hand denotes power, and all power to 
deliver man and enable him to reject evil and error proceeds from the Divine Human, and the 
Lord is ever ready to deliver him, 878, 6280-1.

22. The goat bearing upon him all their iniquities into a solitary land denotes that this shall be 
done by the Lord through the work of redemption, 99378; and letting go the goat into the 
wilderness denotes the removal of falsity with evil, the solitary land, in this case, denoting 
evil, and the wilderness falsity, 683, while by the land, or the wilderness, being called solitary 
is denoted that evil and falsity remain separated from good and truth.

23. By Aaron coming into the tent of meeting is denoted that he who is in good shall come into the
enjoyment of the heavenly life, 35403; and by his putting off the linen garments and leaving 
them there is denoted the acknowledgement that all holy truths by which regeneration is and 
has been effected are from the Lord and not from himself, although he is and has been 
required to use them as from himself, 96706, ver. 4.

24. Bathing himself in water in a holy place denotes the continuation of purification in that holy 
state, 3147, 3210; putting on his garments denotes being invested with truths, ver. 4; coming 
forth, in this case, denotes the activity of the new life, 1853; offering his burnt offering and the
burnt offering of the people denotes worship from pure love both as to the internal and 
external man, 10053, vers. 4, 5; and making atonement for himself and the people denotes 
reconciliation with the Lord, and of the external man with the internal, 10042 II.

25. Burning the fat of the sin offering upon the altar denotes ascribing from the heart all celestial 

good to the Lord, 10033.

26. As he that lets go the goat for Azazel denotes the Lord, in the supreme sense, so he denotes 
every man who, as from himself, through influx from the Divine Human rejects falsity and 
evil, in a lower sense, 99378; washing his clothes and bathing himself in water denotes 
purification externally and internally, 3147, 5006, 9215; and coming into the camp denotes in 
order that he may enter into and remain in the heavenly state, 4236.

189

27. The bullock of the sin offering, and the goat of the sin offering, denote the good of the natural 
man which is obedience, and the truth thereof which is the truth of faith as realized during 
regeneration, 9990, 4169, 725; their blood being brought in to make atonement in the holy 
place denotes the conjunction of truth with good and consequent purification, 10047, 10042 
II..; being carried forth without the camp denotes separation from the heavenly state, 4236; 
being burned in the fire denotes rejection by the power of pure heavenly love, or 
condemnation because of contamination with selfish love, 934, 10055; and their skin and their 
flesh and their dung denote every seeming truth or good, with what is impure, 10035-7.

28. He who burns them washing his clothes and bathing himself in water and afterwards coming 
into the camp, denotes that even after this process of rejection the man who thus, as from 
himself, rejects appearances with evils and falsities of all kinds, is to be purified externally 
still further before fully realizing the heavenly state, 934, 10055, 3147, 4236.

29. An eternal statute denotes an eternal law of Divine Order, 7884; in the seventh month on the 
tenth day of the month you shall afflict your souls, denotes as to the purification of the 
external man in the holy state of faith and charity in the course of regeneration when remains 
of good and truth are to be fully implanted there, 851,

576, 1947; doing no manner of work, or a Sabbath, denotes a state of victory in temptations 
and thence the realization of heavenly peace and rest, 8889-90; and the home-born and the 
stranger that sojourns among you, denotes that this is applicable alike to the man of the 
internal church and the man of the external, 7908.

30. "On this day shall atonement be made for you to cleanse you," denotes that only in this way 
can the reconciliation of the Human with the Divine in the Lord's glorification, of man with 
the Lord in regeneration, and of the external with the internal man be accomplished, 10042 II.,
4545; and "from all your sins shall you be clean before the Lord," denotes that the result of the
whole process is the full deliverance of man in the heavenly state from all actual evil and 
falsity and impurity, 4545.

31. It being a Sabbath of solemn rest for man, the afflicting of his soul, and a statute for ever, 
denotes that surely this heavenly state is one of peace and rest derived from victory in 
temptations, and is an eternal state, 8889, 8890, 7884.

32. The priest who shall be anointed, and who shall be consecrated to be priest in his father's stead
making the atonement and putting on the linen garments, even the holy garments, denotes that 
this is to be effected entirely from celestial good by conjunction with truth in successive states 
of the church, and that reconciliation with the Lord will be effected, by the instrumentality of 
the exterior truths of the natural man and a state of holiness because those truths are holy from 
good, 9946, 9954, 10076, 5912, 10042 II., 7601, 2146.

33. Making atonement for the holy sanctuary, for the tent of meeting, for the altar, for the priests 

and for all the people of the assembly, denotes that by this means is man brought into harmony
with all the heavens celestial, spiritual and natural, and this both as to good and as to truth, 
10042 II., 35403, 9946, 1259.

34. This being an everlasting statute denotes that it is an eternal law of Divine Order, 7884; 

making atonement for the children of Israel because of all their sins once in the year, denotes 

190

reconciliation with the Lord, on account of man's state as to evil, and that it is perpetual, 10042
II., 10211; and doing as the Lord commanded Moses denotes that in this work good always 
acts according to truth from the Lord, 9946, 7010, 2001.

Discussion

This chapter may properly be called a chapter on the Atonement par excellence, and is accordingly well
worthy of a practical application; and there are lessons for us in the beginning of it. Revelation to the 
man of the church is successive, and depends very much upon the state of the man. It is quite true that 
we have the Word always in our midst; but we do not always see its familiar truths in the same light. 
Now we have previously seen that the death of Aaron's sons, Nadab and Abihu, represents the rejection 
of merely external worship, and we may be sure that whenever this takes place in our case the spiritual 
atmosphere will be clearer, that the Sun of Heaven will shine upon us, and that we shall see the truth, 
even the old truth that we thought we fully knew before, in a new light. We may labour by intellectual 
means to store our minds with truths in great abundance, and it is right that we should do so; but we 
only come to realize their glory when we are lifted out of mere externalism. Do not let us be afraid 
then, as perhaps we sometimes are, of rejecting what is wrong while we retain what is right in our 
worship of the Lord, for thereby we shall have a new revelation.

Now Aaron here represents a state of good, but it is relatively external good enlightened by Divine 
Truth higher than itself. And, strange to say, that truth instructs this good, first of all, that it cannot enter
into inmost things, and remain in them all at once, or in every state. How true is this! And the reason is,
because the foundations and the lower storeys of our spiritual houses must be first well laid. He who 
cannot live a good natural life will not be able to live a good spiritual life. And we must first learn 
natural truths, which are as clouds, before we can comprehend spiritual truths in their glory. But how 
shall man enter into that higher life which is denoted by the holy place? Surely by the work of 
repentance, and by the devotion of all the affections to the service of the Lord, and by making a proper 
use of all the precious truths of the Word in due order and subordination by means of the common bond
of love combined with an enlightened intelligence. And this must be done first internally from good 
and then externally from truth. This-carries us through the first half of our introduction, or of our 
introductory state by which we have a perception and a slight foretaste, as it were, of what we long to 
realize.

And then the second half carries us a step further, but our attention1 is drawn meanwhile to the two 
goats, and we wonder why there are to be two, and yet only one ram, as in the case of the priest. Two 
goats for the people and one bullock for the priest as a sin offering, but one ram for each as a burnt 
offering! We pause to reflect. And if our memory carries us back to the time when we were seriously 
taught that "Christ the heavenly lamb bore all our sins away," and that it was by His vicarious sacrifice 
on the cross that He made atonement for all mankind, actually bearing the punishment due to men by 
suffering death in their stead, we wonder very much indeed why He is called the lamb of God taking 
away the sin of the world, and yet in this great chapter on the atonement it is two goats which figure so 
prominently in the ceremony, and not a lamb at all. And besides this, we wonder too, in considering this
old comparison, why the goat that was for the Lord, according to the lots, was offered for a sin offering,
and that which was for Azazel was sent away alive into the wilderness. We notice also that atonement 
was made particularly by the sprinkling of the blood of the bullock and the goat that were killed, while 
concerning the goat for Azazel it is only said atonement was made for him, or over him (R.V.), or with 
him (A.V.). Let us look into these things. According to opinions which have been far too common, a 
sacrificed animal has been considered as representing the sacrifice of the Lord on the cross as a 

191

substitute bearing punishment for mankind; but a little careful reflection will show that this is not the 
case, because the burnt offerings are called a sweet savour to the Lord, or an odour of rest, and the 
sacrifices are called His meat, besides which, even the sin offerings are called most holy. And from 
these considerations it is clear that they do not represent the punishment of sin. Did not Paul say, 
"Christ our passover is sacrificed for us; therefore let us keep the feast" (1 Cor 5:7, 8)? How much 
more reasonable is it then to regard the burnt offerings and sacrifices rather as the devotion to the Lord 
of man's best affections, and the lamb of God, therefore, as the Human of the Lord consecrated and 
united to the Divine in Him. In fact, a lamb denotes the highest degree of celestial good in its 
innocence, and in the Lord the Divine Good, or the Divine Human, which has redeemed all mankind 
from the absolute power of evil, and which removes evil, from every individual who is willing to have 
it removed through regeneration by faith in Him and love towards Him. In this way, therefore, and not 
in the other, is the Lord Jesus the true Lamb of God taking away the sin of the world.

But why then is He not represented in our chapter as a lamb, and not as a bullock and two goats? It is 
because certain particulars of Divine Truth are herein described which could not be so well represented 
only by a lamb. There was a bullock and two goats in order that, with regard to the Lord, the 
glorification of the Natural might be signified, as to its Internal, as to its External, and as to the Human 
derived from the mother which was entirely rejected; while by the ram for a burnt offering was denoted
the Spiritual. And all this further appears from AE 70343, because the regeneration of man is an image 
of the glorification of the Lord. Thus, then, if we take the lamb, and the ram, and the bullock and the 
goat that was offered as a sacrifice, we shall see how the glorified Human is represented in the Word, 
from the highest degree to the lowest, and also the good affections of the fully regenerated man in the 
same way, showing in a most convincing manner the signification of the two goats, and also how 
impossible it is that the animals offered in sacrifice, even when they were sin offerings, could represent 
and signify a victim suffering punishment.

And now this brings us to the study of the blood of the Lord which cleanses from all sin, and of the 
blood being sprinkled successively on the various parts of the tabernacle and the tent of meeting, taking
the latter first. A preliminary, however, is to be noticed. For the taking of the fire from off the altar and 
the sweet incense, and then going within the veil, show that man must be prepared by the previous 
reception of good and truth in the course of regeneration before he can have a perception of inmost 
good; that when he has this perception, this itself constitutes a relatively external and obscure 
conjunction of goodness and truth; and that afterwards there will be full conjunction in every respect. 
Let us be thankful to the Lord, therefore, for these preparatory and occasional experiences, the memory
of which is a constant stimulus, and fills us with joyful anticipation of our future state of perfection. 
And also let us remember the teaching in this connection, namely, that we must be introduced into a 
realization of the heavenly life by degrees, and might suffer spiritual injury or death if it were not so. 
But why? Not, certainly, because there is any danger that good or truth or the Lord can injure or destroy
us, but because our own state as to evil and error of which we are not aware would cause the mischief.

But the blood of the Lord, according to the references, signifies Divine Truth from Him, and His flesh 
signifies Divine Good; and thus the two together denote the life of the Lord. Hence He says, "Except 
you eat the flesh of the Son of Man, and drink His blood, you have no life in you" (John 6:53), and 
"The Son of man came not to be ministered to, but to minister, and to give His life a ransom for many" 
(Matt 20:28); and these two passages combined show that man is not only nourished spiritually by the 
reception of truth and good from the Lord, but that he is also delivered from evil, or what amounts to 
the same thing, cleansed from sin (Rev 1:5) by the same means. Whosoever, therefore, conceives that 
the actual death of the Lord, or anything that He suffered physically, or even His temptations, which 

192

were spiritual conflicts against all hell, can cleanse man individually from sin, is greatly deceived. But 
by His temptations and victories, as a means, mankind in the aggregate were delivered for ever from 
the absolute power of evil, and this is the work of Redemption; while, in consequence of this great 
work, every man who first purifies his life outwardly by means of the truth of the Word, which is meant
specifically, by the term "Son of man," 2814, and on that account receives the Lord's life of goodness 
and truth, signified not only by flesh and blood, but also by the bread and wine of the Holy Supper, 
thereby has conjunction with the Lord, and this as to all the degrees of his life, because, with him, there
is the conjunction of truth with goodness, denoted by the sprinkling of the blood of the animals 
sacrificed, and which constitutes the great work of ATONEMENT, which in the highest sense is the 
conjunction of the Divine with the Human, and the reciprocal conjunction of the Human with the 
Divine in the Lord, and in a lower sense the conjunction of the Lord with man and the reciprocal 
conjunction of man with the Lord, involving also the same conjunction as to the Internal and External 
of him who is thus made an angel by regeneration as the Lord's Human was made Divine by 
glorification.

Hence, then, we now see the full signification of this ceremony of making atonement by the sprinkling 
of the blood of the animals offered in sacrifice on all parts of the tent of meeting. But the points yet to 
be considered are, why was atonement made over the goat for Azazel after this ceremony? and why 
was the ceremony itself only, to take place once in every year on a certain day? We have seen in what 
the real atonement or reconciliation (2 Cor 5:19) consists, namely, in deliverance from evil and the 
reception of good from the Lord. What then is involved in the ceremony of dismissal? It means that the 
Lord, after man is regenerated, and thus even in heaven itself, still withholds him from evil, and keeps 
him in good, and this by an all-powerful influence through the prevailing and fixed state of good in 
which he is from the Divine Human; for this is now and for ever the great force which keeps evil in its 
own place; prevents it from preponderating in the slightest degree; and preserves each eternally in his 
own life of use. This in the best sense is the man who is in readiness always; in heaven it is the angel 
himself; and with regard to the man who is being regenerated, it is exhibited as the strong and fixed 
principle of good and truth in which he is. Now these remarks explain to a certain extent the repeated 
washings which follow the dismissal of the goat. In heaven the Lord purifies the angels more and more 
continually; and in the church on earth, too, He cleanses internally and externally the sincere worshiper 
who from a loving heart offers his spiritual burnt offering.

But lastly, the reason why the day of atonement was to be once in every year, in the seventh month and 
on the tenth day of the month, which was a Sabbath, clearly appears from the references. The 
purification of man is perpetual; it is effected in holy states of faith and charity; and it produces an 
eternal Sabbath of rest and peace, because in heaven all spiritual conflicts have ceased, and there is 
only that kind of continual purification which is necessary from the facts that each angel continues to 
act freely as from himself; that he passes through a variety of states corresponding to evening and 
morning, and spring and summer on earth; and that by these changes he becomes perpetually more and 
more free from the slight imperfections inseparable from a state of finiteness.

Leviticus Chapter 17

Summary of the Spiritual Sense

1. There is revelation from the Lord to those who are in good and truth of every degree, that if they

do not acknowledge that their power to worship is from Him through the heavens, they do 
violence to holy good and holy truth, because all genuine worship is really from good, in order 
that there may be harmony between the internal and external man, vers. 1-5. 

2. For such worship only, causes the conjunction of truth with good, removes worship from faith 

without charity, and is perpetual and eternal, vers. 6-7. 

3. And, therefore, any one who does not thus worship the Lord is separated from the church and 

from Divine truths, vers. 8-9. 

4. He who violates holy charity by mixing evils and falsities therewith averts himself from the 
Lord and separates himself from truths, because charity is the life of the church, and external 
worship ought to be in harmony with internal, vers. 10-12. 

5. Concerning the appropriation of good or truth from a principle of persuasion, from merely 

natural good, or from good contaminated by evil, vers. 13-16. 

The Contents of each Verse

1. And the LORD spoke to Moses, 

1. There is revelation from the Lord by Divine Truth 

saying, 

giving the perception,

2. Speak to Aaron, and to his sons, and 
to all the children of Israel, and say 
to them; This is the thing which the 
LORD has commanded, saying, 

2. That instruction is to be given to those who are in 
good and truth celestial, and in good and truth 
spiritual by influx and illumination, from which it 
is seen,

3. What man soever there be of the 

house of Israel, that kills an ox, or 
lamb, or goat, in the camp, or that 
kills it without the camp, 

3. That every one who prepares to worship the Lord 
from natural good, or from celestial good, or from 
spiritual good, whether within the church or 
without,

4. And has not brought it to the door of 

the tent of meeting, to offer it as an 
oblation to the LORD before the 
tabernacle of the LORD: blood shall 
be imputed to that man; he has shed 
blood; and that man shall be cut off 
from among his people: 

4. And it is not acknowledged that he receives power 
to do so by conjunction with the Lord through the 
heavens, since all good is from Him through 
inmost principles; that man does violence to holy 
good and holy truth, and thereby separates himself 
from heaven and the church.

194

5. To the end that the children of Israel 
may bring their sacrifices, which 
they sacrifice in the open field, even 
that they may bring them to the 
LORD, to the door of the tent of 
meeting, to the priest, and sacrifice 
them for sacrifices of peace offerings
to the LORD. 

5. For it is essential that the spiritual man should 

know and maintain that the delight and pleasure of
all good affections in worship, which appear to be 
separated from Divine Good, are really from the 
Lord by conjunction with Him through the 
heavens, and this by means of the principle of 
good, so that thereby the external man is 
harmonized with the internal in worship from 
perfect freedom.

6. And the priest shall sprinkle the 

6. And thus, from good, shall the conjunction of truth

blood upon the altar of the LORD at 
the door of the tent of meeting, and 
burn the fat for a sweet savour to the 
LORD. 

with good be effected, through such 
acknowledgement of celestial good, because it is 
grateful and acceptable to the Lord, and productive
of continual rest from all temptations.

7. And they shall no more sacrifice 

their sacrifices to the he-goats, after 
whom they go a whoring. This shall 
be a statute for ever to them 
throughout their generations. 

7. Neither shall the regenerated spiritual man worship
the Lord from the falsities of faith without charity, 
by which truth is continually falsified; and for ever
shall external worship, in the course of the 
heavenly life, be in perfect harmony with internal.

8. And you shall say to them, 

8. And further, there is perception, by Divine Truth 

Whatsoever man there be of the 
house of Israel, or of the strangers 
that sojourn among them, that offers 
a burnt offering or sacrifice, 

9. And brings it not to the door of the 
tent of meeting, to sacrifice it to the 
LORD; even that man shall be cut off 
from his people. 

10. And whatever man there be of the 
house of Israel, or of the strangers 
that sojourn among them, that eats 
any manner of blood; I will set my 
face against that soul that eats blood,
and will cut him off from among his 
people. 

with every man of the Spiritual Church, internal or
external, who engages, ostensibly, in the worship 
of the Lord either celestial or spiritual,

9. And thereby does not acknowledge that the power 
to do so is from the conjunction of man with the 
Lord through the heavens, through the principle of 
heavenly love, shall be separated from the church 
and be ignorant of Divine truths.

10. And every man of the Spiritual Church either 

internal or external who violates holy charity by 
mixing the evils and falsities of the merely natural 
life therewith; that man averts himself from the 
Lord, because he profanes the truth, and is 
consequently separated from all truths.

195

11. For the life of the flesh is in the 
blood: and I have given it to you 
upon the altar to make atonement for
your souls: for it is the blood that 
makes atonement by reason of the 
life. 

11. For external worship ought to be truly harmonious 
with internal; and in heavenly worship it is so, 
because therein is the conjunction of Divine Truth 
with Divine Good, whereby the external man is 
harmonized with the internal, since Divine Truth 
cleanses man from evil, because it is from Divine 
Good which is Life itself.

12. Therefore I said to the children of 
Israel, No soul of you shall eat 
blood, neither shall any stranger that 
sojourns among you eat blood. 

12. And it is for this reason that the spiritual man is 

taught from the Lord that it is unlawful to mingle 
the holy with the profane either in the internal man
or in the external.

13. And whatever man there be of the 

children of Israel, or of the strangers 
that sojourn among them, which 
takes in hunting any beast or bird 
that may be eaten; he shall pour out 
the blood thereof, and cover it with 
dust. 

13. And therefore every man of the Spiritual Church, 
internal or external, who, from a principle of 
persuasion, appropriates any affection of good or 
affection of truth, he shall separate the holy from 
the profane by the sincere acknowledgement that 
of himself he is nothing but evil, and is 
condemned.

14. For as to the life of all flesh, the 

blood thereof is all one with the life 
thereof: therefore I said to the 
children of Israel, You shall eat the 
blood of no manner of flesh: for the 
life of all flesh is the blood thereof: 
whoever eats it shall be cut off. 

14. For all the genuine life of the external man is from 
the Divine Life of the Lord in the internal man; 
and thence it is that man is taught that he profanes 
by appropriating life to himself; for good 
manifested in truth is the life of man from the 
Lord; and he who claims it as his own, separates 
himself from all good and truth.

15. And every soul that eats that which 
dies of itself, or that which is torn of 
beasts, whether he be native or a 
stranger, he shall wash his clothes, 
and bathe himself in water, and be 
unclean until the even: then shall he 
be clean. 

16. But if he wash them not, nor bathe 
his flesh, then he shall bear his 
iniquity. 

References and Notes

15. And every man of the Spiritual Church who 
appropriates to himself that which is merely 
natural and void of spiritual life; or that which has 
been injured by evil inadvertently, and who yet is 
essentially, in good, whether he be of the internal 
church or of the external, shall be purified, 
externally and internally, by means of the Word; 
and shall remain impure until a change of state is 
brought about by such purification.

16. But if he neglects to purify himself in this way, 

then evil must remain with him.

1. This is evident, because by Jehovah is denoted the Divine Being as to His love, 2001; by 

speaking is denoted influx, 2951; by Moses is denoted Divine Truth, or the Word, 7010; and 
by saying is denoted perception, 1791, 1822.

196

2. Moses speaking denotes instruction by Divine Truth, 7010, 10355; to Aaron denotes to those 
who are in good, 9946; to his sons denotes to those who are in truth, 9946; to all the children 
of Israel denotes to those in good and truth spiritual, 3654; and saying "This is the thing which
the Lord has commanded" denotes influx and illustration from which it is seen, 5486, 5732, 
1791, 1822.

3. Any one who kills an animal for sacrifice denotes any one preparing to worship, 10024; an ox,
or a lamb, or a goat, denotes natural, celestial or spiritual good respectively, 10024, 10132; and
in the camp or without the camp denotes whether within the church or without, because the 
camp denotes heaven, and thence the church, 10038.

4. By not bringing the sacrifice to the door of the tent of meeting is denoted not acknowledging 

that he receives power to worship by conjunction with the Lord through the heavens, 2356, 
35403; by offering it as an oblation to the Lord before the tabernacle of the Lord is denoted 
that all good is from the Lord through inmost principles, 349, 922, 9481; by blood being 
imputed to that man, and by his shedding blood, is denoted violence to holy good and holy 
truth, 374, 683; and by being cut off from his people is denoted separation from heaven and 
the church, 5302, 3294-5.

5. By the children of Israel are denoted the spiritual man, 3654; by bringing their sacrifices 

which they sacrifice in the open field to the Lord to the door of the tent of meeting is denoted 
acknowledgement that the delight and pleasure of all good affections in worship, which appear
to be separated from Divine Good, are really from the Lord by conjunction with Him through 
the heavens, 349, 368, 369, 2356, 35403; by being brought to the priest is denoted by means of
the principle of good, 9946; and by sacrificing them for peace offerings to the Lord is denoted 
so that thereby the external man is in harmony with the internal in worship from perfect 
freedom, 10097.

6. The priest sprinkling the blood on the altar before the Lord at the door of the tent of meeting 

denotes that thus from good shall the conjunction of truth with good be effected, 9946, 10047, 
2356, 35403; and burning the fat for a sweet savour to the Lord denotes "because it is grateful 
and acceptable to the Lord, and productive of continual rest from all temptations," being 
celestial good ascribed to the Lord, 10054, 10033.

7. No more sacrificing their sacrifices to he-goats denotes that the regenerated man will no 

longer worship the Lord from the falsities of faith without charity, 349, 922, 4169; after whom
they go a whoring denotes by which truth is continually falsified, 2466; and this being a 
statute for ever to them throughout their generations denotes that for ever shall external 
worship, in the course of the heavenly life, be in perfect harmony with internal, 7884, 9789.

8. Saying to them denotes further perception from Divine Truth, 1791, 1822, 7010; the man of 

the house of Israel denotes the man of the internal church, and the strangers sojourning among 
them denote the man of the external church, 3654, 7908; and offering a burnt offering or 
sacrifice denotes engaging, ostensibly, in the worship of the Lord either celestial or spiritual, 
923.

9. Not bringing it to the door of the tent of meeting denotes not acknowledging that the power to 
worship is by the conjunction of man with the Lord through the heavens, 2356, 35403; and that
man being cut off from his people denotes separation from the church and ignorance of Divine

197

truths, 5302, 3294-5; while by sacrificing before the Lord is evidently denoted the worship of 
the Lord from pure love, 2001.

10. Any man of the house of Israel or of the strangers that sojourns among them denotes the man 
of the Spiritual Church internal or external, 3654, 7908; eating any manner of blood denotes 
violating holy charity by mixing the evils and falsities of the merely natural life therewith, 
1001-1003; and the Lord setting Himself against that soul, and cutting him off from his 
people, denotes that that man averts himself from the Lord because he profanes the truth, and 
is consequently separated from all truths, 7599, 5302, 3294-5.

11. The life of the flesh being in the blood denotes that external worship ought to be truly 

harmonious with internal, 156, 870, 1001; the Lord giving blood upon the altar denotes that in 
heavenly worship it is so, because therein is the conjunction of Divine Truth with Divine 
Good, 10047; making atonement denotes the harmonizing of the external man with the 
internal, 10042 II.; and the blood making atonement by reason of the life or soul denotes that 
this is so, since Divine Truth cleanses man from evil because it is from Divine Good which is 
Life itself, 3704, 4180.

A careful study of the last references will enable us to understand how it is that blood viewed 
under one aspect denotes charity or good, and under another faith or truth. It is because that 
which proceeds from the Lord, and is called Divine Truth in one expression, has in it both the 
good and the truth which are the life of man.

12. The Lord saying, therefore, to the children of Israel denotes for this reason man is taught from 
the Lord, 3654, 7304; and neither they nor the strangers among them eating blood denotes that
it is unlawful to mingle the holy with the profane either in the internal or in the external man 
or church, 1001-1003, 7908.

13. Again, the children of Israel or the stranger denote every man of the Spiritual Church internal 
or external, 3654, 7908; to take in hunting denotes to acquire from a principle of persuasion, 
3309; a beast or a bird that may be eaten denotes good or truth that may be appropriated, 40, 
44, 2187; and pouring out the blood thereof, and covering it with dust, denotes to separate the 
holy from the profane by the sincere acknowledgement that of himself he is nothing but evil, 
and is condemned, 1001-3, 9127, 249.

14. As to the life of all flesh, the blood being one with the life thereof, denotes that all the genuine 
life of the external man is from the Divine life of the Lord in the internal man, 1001-1003, 
3704, 4180; saying to the children of Israel denotes that thence it is that man is taught, 3654, 
7304; not eating the blood of any manner of flesh denotes no profanation by the appropriation 
of life to himself, 1001-1003, 2187; the life of all flesh being in the blood thereof denotes that 
good manifested in truth is the life of man from the Lord, 3704, 4180; and whoever eating it 
being cut off denotes that he who claims life as his own separates himself from all good and 
truth, 5302, 3294-5.

15. Every soul that eats that which dies of itself denotes every man who appropriates to himself 
that which is merely natural and void of spiritual life, 2187, 4171; or that which is torn of 
beasts denotes that which has been injured by evil inadvertently, 2187, 4171; whether he be 
native or a stranger denotes whether he be of the internal church or of the external, 3654, 
7908; and washing his clothes, and bathing himself in water, and being unclean until even and 

198

then being clean, denotes being purified externally and internally by means of the Word, and 
remaining impure until a change of state is brought about by such purification, 3147, 5006, 
10130, 7844, 4545.

16. Not washing his clothes or bathing himself denotes neglecting to purify himself, 3147, 5006; 

and bearing his iniquity denotes that evil will remain with him, 9937.

Discussion

Who that reads thoughtfully over the beginning of this chapter does not perceive at once that there is a 
hidden or spiritual meaning in it? For cannot the Lord be truly worshiped by those who desire to 
worship Him in any place whatever? And yet we find in this account that a very severe punishment is 
denounced upon every person attempting to offer sacrifices anywhere but at the door of the tent of 
meeting. How, then, are we to know the internal meaning here involved? It can only be by 
understanding the correspondences according to which the Word is written; otherwise, indeed, we have 
no guide; and if each reader is allowed to draw his own conclusions from the historical sense only 
confusion and misinterpretation are sure to be the result. How thankful, therefore, ought the man of the 
church to be that it has pleased the Lord to give to him at the present day a knowledge of these 
correspondences! And the Word itself shows us, in general, the meaning of the sacrifices, for we read 
concerning the Lord: "You delight not in sacrifice; else would I give it: you have no pleasure in burnt 
offering. The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit: a broken and a contrite heart, O God, you will not 
despise" (Ps 51:16-17). That is to say, the real sacrifices involve the devotion of the affections to the 
Lord, these being denoted by the various animals, each, as we have already seen, denoting some 
particular affection, which certainly any one who chooses can consecrate to the service of the Lord at 
any time and place.

But again, seeing that such is the hidden meaning of the sacrifices, we are very anxious to know why 
they could not be offered anywhere but at the door of the tent of meeting. It was because not only 
animals, but places, correspond; and also buildings correspond, as well as all their parts. Different 
places represent different states, and motion from place to place denotes changes of state. This is quite 
obvious; and when we think of it in connection with our subject, we can recognize at once that 
although men may truly worship the Lord in any place, they cannot truly worship Him in any state. 
This, then, is the cause of the prohibition and of the limitation. We cannot worship the Lord in a merely
natural state, when our hearts and minds are full of selfishness, of worldliness, or of mere pleasure. 
This everybody knows; and it is commonly and rightly said that when we enter the house of the Lord 
we ought to put away the thought of such things. Hence, then, we may comprehend what is meant by 
killing an ox, or a lamb, or a goat in the camp, or out of the camp, or in the open field. Our good 
affections from the Lord may be contaminated in the church, or out of the church, by the outward 
appearance of worship without the reality.

But now consider the penalty attached to such seeming worship. "Blood shall be imputed to that man; 
and he shall be cut off from his people." That is, as the references show, a person who thus falsely 
worships does violence to the holy principles he professes, and so far is separated from them. And yet 
how very common is this external worship separated from internal! And, in truth, very few there are 
who have not been guilty in this respect; for we have been like the people of Sardis, who had a name to
live, while yet they were dead (Rev. iii. i). What, then, is the remedy? Our chapter tells us we must 
bring our offerings to the door of the tent of meeting and sacrifice them there. As a matter of fact, there 
is only one place, that is, one state, in which we can truly acknowledge the Lord and worship Him. And

199

it is a state of genuine good exhibiting itself through knowledge, through faith, or through love. Or, in 
other words, it is a state of truth introducing us to good, just as the door admits us into an earthly 
temple where we can — if we like — worship the Lord thus in sincerity and truth. And this true 
worship is what is signified by the priest sprinkling the blood and burning the fat for a sweet savour to 
the Lord, while the former false worship is thereby abolished, and is aptly denoted by the idolatry 
specified. Hence, therefore, let the man of the church take heed of his habits, and estimate at its proper 
value the Divine law concerning worship which immediately follows, and with which, notwithstanding 
his delinquencies, he is really tacitly acquainted; for who does not well know that there cannot be true 
adoration of the Lord apart from an honest and earnest endeavour to keep His commandments from a 
principle, and with a desire to be good?

For in the next place, although we may admit that the careless worshipers of whom this part of the 
Word has hitherto treated may not be profaners as yet, it is quite possible that many of them, by 
persistence in a wrong course, may actually become so. And also to eat blood with the flesh, which, in 
what now follows, is implied, is to mingle what is holy with what is profane. To profane good and truth
is to acknowledge and believe and love them, and yet to live contrary to them; and there are, as we 
have already seen, many degrees of this evil. A man may profane slightly, or he may profane deeply; 
his spiritual disease may be curable, or it may be uncurable; and it may be made very much worse by 
determined and deliberate hypocrisy; and, therefore, let us carefully guard against its beginnings; and 
when a person feels that he has within him some love of the truth, let him diligently cultivate it by first 
shunning the evil it condemns, and then earnestly practising the good of which it is the expression. For 
surely even our common perception may convince us that it is a greater advantage, in every way, to live
in harmony with the Divine Law than to make a mere profession of doing so, while we contaminate 
ourselves by indulgence in the selfishness, worldliness or sensuality that inevitably lead to ruin.

But now there is an aspect of this subject which yet remains to be considered, and it is one to which we 
shall all do well to take heed.

It is that we may add to our inadvertent or careless neglect of the good and the true, or to our deliberate 
violation of them, a principle of persuasion which intensifies them, and which is represented in what 
we are here studying, as well as in other parts of the Word, by hunting. "Nimrod," it is said, "was a 
mighty hunter before the Lord" (Gen 10:9), and concerning this we read, "it signifies that he persuaded 
many. This appears from the nature of faith separate from charity, which is thus persuasive; also from 
the signification of hunting in the Word. Faith separate from charity is such that it easily persuades. The
generality of mankind do not know what things internal are, but only things external, and the greater 
number live immersed in sensualities, pleasures and lusts; and they regard themselves and the world; 
therefore they are easily captivated by such a religion.... 'Behold, I am against your pillows to hunt the 
souls there, to make them fly away; and I will tear them from off your arms, and will let go the souls 
which you hunt, even the souls to make them fly away; and I will tear your kerchiefs, and deliver my 
people out of your hand; and they shall be no more in your hand for hunting' (Ezek 13:21). It is here 
explained what is meant by hunting, namely, that it is to deceive, by means of persuasions and by 
means of cognitions, which they pervert, and which they explain in their own favour, and according to 
the inclination of others," 1178. Hence we may see the nature of the persuasion of which our chapter 
speaks; and when we add that Nimrod means rebellious, or sleep of descent, or sleep of him that rules, 
we may still more clearly see it, and may be led by all means in our power to avoid falling into such a 
state as this, which aggravates our own unjust position, and takes away from others that precious liberty
which is so necessary to all spiritual progress.

200

But there are also other points in the remainder of this interesting description which might be 
advantageously enlarged upon, such as the fact that the life of the external man, in a state of perfection, 
is derived from that of the internal, and that for this reason especially should profanation be avoided, as
well as the other fact that he who is not cleansed from his impurity in this respect while he is still in the
probationary state must remain in it. But let what has been already said suffice for the present as a 
stimulus to the higher life, and as an incentive to the study of the Word of the Lord in its internal sense, 
with a view to the final attainment of that life. For the more we examine and reflect carefully upon the 
particulars of Divine Truth therein contained, the more shall we be enlightened and energized to run 
with patience the course yet before us.

Leviticus Chapter 18

Summary of the Spiritual Sense

1. The man of the church is instructed that he ought not to live according to the evils and falsities 
of the merely natural man, nor of the corrupted church; but that the Lord who is Good and Truth
conjoined, or rather united, ought to be worshiped, vers. 1-5. 

2. Therefore, generally, man is forbidden to profane good or truth by conjoining them with evil or 

falsity, ver. 6. 

3. Nor, in particular, ought he to profane them by any illegitimate conjunctions whatever, which 
are described in a series, and by which the corrupted church is defiled, and is incapable of 
properly realizing either good or evil, vers. 7-25. 

4. On the contrary, the man of the Spiritual Church must live according to the laws of Divine 

Order and avoid abominations, lest he too should become corrupt, be entirely separated from 
genuine good and truth, and be altogether incapable of that obedience to the Lord which is the 
result of the heavenly marriage of good and truth from Him, vers. 26-30. 

The Contents of each Verse

1. And the LORD spoke to Moses, 

1. There is revelation from the Lord by Divine Truth 

saying, 

giving the perception,

2.

Speak to the children of Israel, and 
say to them, I am the LORD your 
God. 

2. And instruction to the man of the Spiritual Church,
from which he learns that the Lord is the only 
God, and that from Him is all good and truth 
conjoined.

3. After the doings of the land of 

Egypt, wherein you dwelt, shall you
not do: and after the doings of the 
land of Canaan, whither I bring you,
shall you not do: neither shall you 
walk in their statutes. 

3. And that, therefore, he ought not to live according 
to the evils and falsities of the merely natural state 
into which he is born, nor the evils and falsities of 
the corrupted church which is to be succeeded by 
the Spiritual Church; nor is worship to be any 
longer only external and idolatrous.

4. My judgements shall you do, and 

my statutes shall you keep, to walk 
therein: I am the LORD your God. 

4. On the contrary, the Lord is to be worshiped by 
means of truths from the Word internal and 
external, and by obedience thereto in the daily life.
And this because the Lord manifests Himself as 
good and truth conjoined; as truth derived from 
good; and as the External in harmony with the 
Internal.

202

5. You shall therefore keep my 

5. And therefore man must, at first, engage in 

statutes, and my judgements: which 
if a man do, he shall live in them: I 
am the LORD. 

6. None of you shall approach to any 

that is near of kin to him, to uncover
their nakedness: I am the LORD. 

The nakedness of your father, even 
the nakedness of your mother, shall 
you not uncover: she is your 
mother; you shall not uncover her 
nakedness. 

The nakedness of your father's wife 
shall you not uncover: it is your 
father's nakedness. 

7.

8.

9.

external worship, leading to internal, by obedience
to the laws of which he will become internal, and 
thus acknowledge the Lord especially as Divine 
Good.

6. And consequently the spiritual man is forbidden to
profane holy truths by contamination with evils 
and falsities hereditary or actual through 
conjunction therewith. For Divine Good requires 
that good thence derived can alone be legitimately 
conjoined with truth.

7. Therefore it is contrary to Divine Order to profane 

good by contamination with hereditary evil 
directly, through conjunction with the essential 
falsity conjoined therewith, this falsity being the 
external origin of a new form of evil.

8. Also it is not lawful to profane good by 

contamination with falsity conjoined with 
hereditary evil in the external man, because such 
falsity is only another form of hereditary evil.

The nakedness of your sister, the 
daughter of your father, or the 
daughter of your mother, whether 
born at home, or born abroad, even 
their nakedness you shall not 
uncover. 

9. Neither is it lawful to profane the truth by 

contamination with falsity in the understanding, 
proceeding either from interior hereditary 
affection, or from exterior, which falsity has 
become active in the internal or external man 
spontaneously.

10. The nakedness of your son's 

10. Also it is not lawful to profane the truth by 

daughter, or of your daughter's 
daughter, even their nakedness you 
shall not uncover: for theirs is your 
own nakedness. 

contamination with evil affection springing from 
actual falsity or evil; for such affection is actual 
evil intensified.

11. The nakedness of your father's 

11. Also it is not lawful to profane the truth by 

wife's daughter, begotten of your 
father, she is your sister, you shall 
not uncover her nakedness. 

contamination with the affection of hereditary evil 
arising from the conjunction of that evil with 
falsity in the external man, for this is actual falsity 
in the understanding with which the truth cannot 
be legitimately conjoined.

203

12. You shall not uncover the nakedness

12. Neither is it lawful to profane the truth by 

of your father's sister: she is your 
father's near kinswoman. 

13. You shall not uncover the nakedness
of your mother's sister: for she is 
your mother's near kinswoman. 

14. You shall not uncover the nakedness

of your father's brother, you shaft 
not approach to his wife: she is your
aunt. 

15. You shall not uncover the nakedness
of your daughter in law: she is your 
son's wife; you shall not uncover 
her nakedness. 

contamination with falsity in the understanding 
allied with hereditary evil, but not directly 
conjoined therewith in the internal man, because 
this is falsity on the same plane with hereditary 
evil.

13. Nor is it lawful to profane the truth by 

contamination with falsity in the understanding 
allied with hereditary evil, but not directly 
conjoined therewith, in the external man, because 
again this is falsity on the same plane with external
hereditary evil.

14. Neither is it lawful for the spiritual man to profane 
good by contaminating it with collateral hereditary
evil, through the medium of the falsity conjoined 
with such evil, because it is the outward form of 
more remote hereditary life.

15. Nor is it lawful for him to profane good by 

contamination with falsity conjoined with his own 
evil, because this is the outward form of such evil.

16. You shall not uncover the nakedness
of your brother's wife: it is your 
brother's nakedness. 

16. Also it is not lawful to profane good by 

contamination with falsity conjoined to collateral 
evil, because it is the outward form of such evil.

17. You shall not uncover the nakedness

17. Neither is it lawful to profane the truth by 

of a woman and her daughter; you 
shall not take her son's daughter, or 
her daughter's daughter, to uncover 
her nakedness; they are near 
kinswomen: it is wickedness. 

contamination with evil from actual falsity; with 
evil from the falsity thence; or with evil from the 
evil thence; these are allied evils; and such 
contamination is the intensification of evil.

18. And you shall not take a woman to 
her sister, to be a rival to her, to 
uncover her nakedness, beside the 
other in her life time.

contamination with differing collateral falsities in 
the understanding at the same time, for this 
produces a conflict of falsities.

woman to uncover her nakedness, 
as long as she is impure by her 
uncleanness.

your neighbour's wife, to defile 
yourself with her.

superabundance of merely natural affection.

20. Neither is it lawful to profane by adulterating the 
good of the church, which is the greatest impurity.

21. And you shall not give any of your 
seed to make them pass through the 
fire to Molech, neither shall you 
profane the name of your God: I am
the LORD. 

22. You shall not lie with mankind, as 

with womankind: it is abomination. 

23. And you shall not lie with any beast
to defile yourself therewith: neither 
shall any woman stand before a 
beast, to lie down thereto: it is 
confusion. 

24. Defile not you yourselves in any of 
these things: for in all these the 
nations are defiled which I cast out 
from before you: 

21. Nor is it lawful to do so by falsifying the incipient 
truths of the church through selfish love; for the 
truth must always be held in reverence;, because it 
is the form of Divine Good.

22. Moreover, the contamination of the truth with 
falsities from sensual love is unlawful; it is 
contamination most degraded and detestable;

23. And so also, generally, is the contamination of the 
truth with evil, as well as the contamination of 
good with falsity.

24. And, indeed, the spiritual man must not render 

himself impure by any kind of profanation; for this
is the practice of those in the corrupted church, 
who are confirmed in evil, and who are to be 
rejected by the power of Divine Truth.

do visit the iniquity thereof upon it, 
and the land vomits out her 
inhabitants.

and suffers the consequences, of its corruption, 
becoming altogether profane, and incapable of 
properly realizing either good or evil.

26. You therefore shall keep my statutes

profanation, whether he belongs to the internal or 
to the external church.

27. (For these corruptions are common to those who 
are in selfish love and worldly love, which loves 
are first active with man from heredity, when man 
deliberately indulges and chooses actual evil.)

28. But he also becomes profane by wilfully 

corrupting the truth, as former perverted churches 
have done.

29. For all profaners must be deprived of the capacity

charge, that you do not any of these 
abominable customs, which were 
done before you, and that you defile

he too profane extremely like former corrupt 
churches, and thus become impure. And he must 
worship only the Lord in whom good and truth are
one.

not to live according to the evils and falsities of the merely natural state into which he is born, 
5755, 5276, 1293; not doing after the doing of the land of Canaan whither they were to be 
brought denotes not according to the evils and falsities of the corrupted church, which is to be 
succeeded by the Spiritual Church, 1868; and not walking in their statutes denotes that 
worship was not to be any longer external and idolatrous, 8420, 7884, 8357.

4. Doing the Lord's judgements, and keeping his statutes to walk therein, denotes to worship Him
by means of the Word, or by truths internal and external, and by obedience in the daily life, 
5755, 8357; and "I am the Lord your God" denotes because the Lord manifests Himself as 
good and truth conjoined; as truth derived from good; and as the External in harmony with the 
Internal, 2001.

5. Keeping, therefore, the Lord's statutes and judgements denotes that man must first engage in 
external worship leading to internal, 8357; doing them and living in them denotes that by 
obedience to the laws of which, he will become internal, 5755; and "I am the Lord" denotes 
that thus he will acknowledge the Lord especially as Divine Good, 2001.

6. Not approaching to any one that is near of kin to him to uncover nakedness denotes that 

consequently the spiritual man is forbidden to profane holy truths by contamination with evils 
and falsities hereditary or actual by conjunction therewith, 6348, 4434, 9960; and "I am the 
Lord" denotes that Divine Good requires that good thence derived can alone be legitimately 
conjoined with truths, and also the confirmation of that conjunction, 2001, 7192.

7.

"The nakedness of your father, even the nakedness of your mother you shall not uncover," 
denotes that it is contrary to Divine Order to profane good by contamination with hereditary 
evil directly, through conjunction with the essential falsity conjoined therewith, because by 
this adultery is denoted the profanation of good, 6348, by father is denoted hereditary evil, and
by mother is denoted the falsity conjoined therewith, 370320; "she is your mother" denotes that
this falsity is the external origin of a new form of evil, 1815, 1895; and "you shall not uncover 
her nakedness" denotes contamination and exposure, 996010.

206

8.

"The nakedness of your father's wife you shall not uncover," denotes that it is not lawful to 
profane good by contamination with falsity conjoined with hereditary evil in the external man,
since by this adultery is denoted also the profanation of good, 6348, by father is denoted 
hereditary evil, 370320, and by the father's wife is denoted the falsity conjoined therewith in 
the external man, 409, 1369; and "it is your father's nakedness" denotes that such falsity is 
only another form of hereditary evil, because as truth is the form of good, so falsity is the form
of evil, 9637.

9. A sister denotes falsity in the understanding, since in a good sense she denotes intellectual 
truth, 1475; the daughter of a father, or the daughter of a mother, denotes procedure either 
from interior hereditary evil or from exterior, 568, 1815, 1895; born at home, or born abroad, 
denotes activity in the internal or external man or church, because this case is similar to that of
a native and a sojourner, 8013; and not uncovering the nakedness of a sister denotes that 
falsification of truth and profanation of such a character are unlawful, 6348.

10. By the son's daughter, or the daughter's daughter, is denoted an evil affection springing from 

actual falsity or evil, as appears from the signification of a son as denoting falsity, and of a 
daughter as denoting evil, 568, and it is said, actual falsity and evil, because a man's own son 
or daughter, as distinguished from his father's or mother's children, evidently denotes this; not 
uncovering their nakedness denotes that it is not lawful to falsify and profane the truth by such
contamination, 6348; and by "for theirs is your own nakedness" is denoted that evil affections 
of this kind are the intensification of actual evil, 313, 494.

11. As the father's wife who is not the mother is not in such close relationship as the father's wife 
who is at the same time the mother, therefore it has been said that the former denotes falsity, 
conjoined with hereditary evil in the external man, ver. 8; and hence the father's wife's 
daughter will denote the affection of hereditary evil in the external man, arising from the 
conjunction of that evil with falsity there, 568; "she is your sister" denotes that this affection is
actual falsity in the understanding, ver. 9, 1475; and her nakedness not to be uncovered 
denotes that the truth is not to be falsified and profaned by contamination with such evil, 6348.

12. By the father's sister is denoted falsity in the understanding allied with hereditary evil in the 
internal man but not directly conjoined therewith, 370320, 1475; "she is your father's near 
kinswoman" denotes that this is falsity on the same plane with hereditary evil, 3160; and by 
nakedness not to be uncovered is denoted that the truth is not to be falsified and profaned by 
contamination with the affection of such falsity, 6348.

13. By the mother's sister is denoted falsity in the understanding allied with hereditary evil, but not
directly conjoined therewith, in the external man, 1815, 1895, 1475; by the mother's near 
kinswoman is denoted falsity on the same plane with external hereditary evil, 3160; and by 
nakedness not to be uncovered is denoted that the truth is not to be falsified and profaned by 
contamination with the affection of such falsity, 6348.

14. By the father's brother is denoted collateral hereditary evil, 3612; by the wife of the father's 

brother is denoted the falsity conjoined with such evil, 1369; by her being the aunt is denoted 
that this falsity is the outward form of more remote hereditary life, 3612, 4145; and by 
nakedness not to be uncovered is denoted that it is not lawful to profane good by 
contaminating it with such falsity, 6348.

207

15. By the daughter in law is denoted falsity conjoined with actual evil, 4843, 10490; her being 

the son's wife denotes the outward form of that evil, 3049, 5337, 94743; and nakedness not to 
be uncovered denotes that it is not lawful to profane good by contamination with such falsity, 
6348.

16. The brother denotes collateral evil, 3612; the wife denotes falsity conjoined with that evil, 

1369; the brother's nakedness denotes the outward form of that evil, 996018, 3049, 5337, 9474;
and nakedness not to be uncovered denotes that it is not lawful to profane good by 
contamination with such falsity, 6348.

17. The woman and her daughter denote falsity and the evil thence derived, 1369, 568; her son's 

daughter and her daughter's daughter denote evil from the falsity thence, and evil from the evil
thence, 568; that they are allied evils is denoted by their being near kinswomen, 3160; 
nakedness not to be uncovered denotes that it is not lawful to falsify and profane the truth by 
contamination with such evils, 6348; and its being wickedness denotes the intensification of 
evil, as is evident.

18. As a sister denotes falsity in the understanding, ver. 9, two sisters will denote collateral 

falsities with their affections, 3160; being a rival to her, or vexing her, denotes a conflict of 
falsities, 6420, 9308; and not uncovering nakedness denotes that it is unlawful to falsify and 
profane the truth by contamination with such falsities, 6348, while beside the other in her 
lifetime evidently denotes the activity of conflicting feelings and thoughts during regeneration,
43662.

19. A woman impure, or separated, for her uncleanness, denotes falsified truth caused by the 

superabundance of merely natural affection during the process of regeneration, 10130, 4161; 
and nakedness not to be uncovered denotes that it is not lawful to profane the truth by 
contamination with such falsifications, 6348.

20. Not to lie carnally with the neighbour's wife to defile yourself with her, denotes that it is not 
lawful to profane by adulterating the good of the church which is the greatest impurity, 6348.

21. Not giving any seed to pass through the fire to Molech denotes that it is unlawful to profane by
falsifying the incipient truths of the church through selfish love, 1610, 934, 246816; not 
profaning the name of your God denotes that the truth must always be held in reverence, and 
we may add especially the conjunction of the Human with the Divine in the Lord, or the 
Divine Human, 6280, 2001; and "I am the Lord" denotes that Divine Truth is the form of 
Divine Good, 2001.

22. Not lying with mankind as with womankind, and its being an abomination, denotes that the 
contamination of truth with falsities from sensual love is unlawful, being most degraded and 
detestable, 725, 2056, 6052, 6348.

23. Not lying with any beast to defile yourself therewith, and a woman not standing before a beast 

to lie down thereto, it being confusion, denotes that, generally, the contamination of the truth 
with evil as well as the contamination of good with falsity, is profanation, 46, 1326, 6348.

24. Not defiling oneself with any of these things denotes that the spiritual man must not render 

himself impure by any kind of profanation, 10130, 6348; and the nations which were cast out 

208

being thus defiled denotes that this is the practice of the corrupted church who are confirmed 
in evil, and are to be rejected by the power of Divine Truth, 1205, 2657.

25. The land being defiled denotes that the church rejected is utterly corrupted, 10130; visiting the

iniquity upon it denotes that it suffers the consequences of its corruption, 696, 9937; and the 
land vomiting out her inhabitants denotes that it is incapable of properly realizing either good 
or evil, 9527, 3705.

26. Keeping the Lord's statutes and judgements and not doing any of these abominations denotes 

that the truly spiritual man is obedient to Divine laws externally and internally, and abominates
all profanation, 8357, 6052; and neither the native nor the stranger that sojourns among you 
denotes whether he belongs to the internal or external church, 8013.

27. "All these abominations have the men of the land done which were before you" denotes that 
these corruptions are common to those who are in selfish and worldly love, 1205, 693; which 
were before you denotes spiritually prior states of the church as an individual and as a 
community, and hence states from heredity, 8550; and the land being defiled denotes the actual
evil derived from the perverted loves of self and the world, 8551, 10130.

28. "That the land vomit not you out as it vomited the nation which was before you, when you 
defile it," denotes that the spiritual man becomes defiled and profane by wilfully corrupting 
the truth as former perverted churches have done, 9527, 10130.

29. "Whosoever does these abominations" denotes all who profane the good and the true as 
described in the whole chapter, 6052; and their being cut off from the people denotes 
separation entirely from those who are in truths, 5302, 1259.

30. To keep the charge of the Lord evidently denotes to be obedient, 8830, 8513; not doing any of 
these abominable customs denotes lest there should be profanation extremely as in former 
corrupt churches, 6052, 8550, 8551; not defiling themselves denotes not becoming impure, 
10130; and "I am the Lord your God" denotes that the Lord only must be worshiped in Whom 
Good and Truth are One, 2001. 

Discussion

The introduction to the subject of this chapter is very significant, owing to the fact that the Divine 
proclaims Himself three times successively. The reason is, because the revelation of the Lord to man is 
successive. He first manifests Himself to the natural man as one Divine Being, in Whom love and 
wisdom are united. We ought, therefore, thus to think of Him naturally, as an infinitely glorious and 
Divine Man, since love and wisdom, or good and truth, or affection and intelligence, constitute finite 
man. And this must be the case, not only with the natural man, who thinks in simplicity without deep 
reflection, but also with the spiritual man, who distinguishes; and that is the reason why it is added, in 
the second instance, "as truth derived from good, and as the External in harmony with the Internal," 
ver. 4. For when the natural man is made spiritual, he proceeds by means of truths to the state of good, 
conjoining the natural with the spiritual in himself. But in the third instance it is only said, "I am the 
Lord," because by his obedience the spiritual man becomes celestial, thus uniting truth with good, and 
living then from good by truth. Now every one who is regenerated must pass through this process, and 
only by doing so can he overcome the tendency in himself to profane the truth, or to profane goodness, 
in the various ways specified in what follows.

209

The whole subject, however, is first presented in a few words, and in those the expression, "I am the 
Lord," is again repeated, confirming the general prohibition, and also showing, that with him who is 
regenerated, good and truth alone can be legitimately conjoined, as they are united in the Divine Being.
But let us consider next the profound truth involved in the fact that the fully regenerated man is 
preserved by the Lord from ever, spiritually, uncovering nakedness. That is, the hereditary and actual 
evils of his life, although they cannot be abolished, but remain for ever, yet are quiescent, and cannot 
be exposed. Compare 868 and 9960; and reflect on the character of the Divine Word, in its interiors, 
and thence in its ultimate expressions, as being most holy and pure, and that we may properly regard all
these prohibitions as a description of the exceedingly great perfection and purity of angelic life, which 
is free from all impurity, and especially from the possibility of profaning good and truth in any way 
whatever; at the same time that it may be acknowledged that, apart from the Lord, every man of the 
church on earth, and every angel in heaven is nothing but evil, and is disposed to profane good and 
truth by laying bare hereditary conditions and acquired states of evil, which love and charity from the 
Lord have covered up, and always will make atonement for, in those who, during the earthly life, 
renounce all evil and falsity, and love and practise all goodness and truth, the marriage of goodness and
truth being regeneration in every individual.

And this brings us to the consideration of another point here involved. It is that these unlawful 
connections, which are commonly called the forbidden degrees within which marriage may not be 
allowed, forcibly remind us that the heavenly marriage, which is the marriage of the Lord with His 
church, and thus the conjunction of goodness and truth in general, is also to be looked upon as the 
marriage of goodness and truth in particular. That is, not only has every good its opposite evil, and 
every truth its opposite falsity, with which the man of the church may not contaminate himself and thus
commit profanation, but also every good must be conjoined with its own truth, and every truth with its 
own good, and not with any other, because such is, evidently, not the true marriage. It follows, 
therefore, that, since each individual, whether man or woman, is really a distinct form of life, which 
cannot be repeated, and thus is a distinct form of good or truth which cannot be repeated, there is 
undoubtedly a true and eternal marriage of each individual, with his or her corresponding form of truth 
or goodness; and also that this marriage, if not effected in this life, is quite sure to be effected in 
heaven, according to the Lord's own words that two congenial minds of this kind ought not to be, and 
in fact cannot be separated. For He said, "What God has joined together, let not man put to pieces" 
(Matt 19:4-6). Hence, then, we see that the true marriage with every one goes hand in hand, so to 
speak, with his regeneration; and also that marriages on earth are holy as, under any circumstances, 
they assume to be, and therefore represent the true heavenly marriage.

But it is now to be observed that the internal sense, in dealing with the subject before us, in addition to 
stating what violations of the marriage of goodness and truth constitute profanation, also gives the 
reasons why. All these, however, may be included in one general statement, namely, that the hereditary 
life of man is nothing but evil. But it may be immediately thought by many that surely children inherit 
from their parents good dispositions as well as bad ones, and good capacities for acquiring truths as 
well as falsities. Is not this quite evident in families? How is it, then, that such good dispositions and 
capabilities notwithstanding, man is by birth nothing but evil? It is because no finite human being can 
possess inherent goodness, there being only one source of goodness, which is the Lord; because this 
good cannot be inherited by children from their parents; because it can only be received from the Lord 
through regeneration; and because the so-called good, which man receives by heredity, is contaminated 
by the evil so received. But see Matt 19:17; John 3:5, 6; 1 Kings 8:46,

210

From all these reflections it may now be more clearly seen why the terms father, mother, brother, sister,
etc., are here to be taken correspondingly as denoting various kinds of evils and falsities, although in 
the best sense they denote various kinds of goods and truths, which is the same thing as various forms 
of affection and intelligence from the Lord. Hence the Lord says to the unbelieving Pharisees: "You are
of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father you will do. He was a murderer from the beginning,
and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaks a lie he speaks of his own, 
for he is a liar and the father thereof" (John 8:44). Here, by "your father the devil," is not meant any 
personal devil, as is commonly supposed, but all hell in the aggregate, and also the principle of selfish 
love, which makes hell, the term father signifying that this love is the origin of all evil and the falsity 
thence derived. This text, therefore, justifies the signification given to the term father in our chapter, 
and thence justifies the signification given to all the other terms of relationship mentioned therein. We, 
therefore, as members of the Lord's church, must oppose ourselves earnestly, as from ourselves, to all 
the evils and falsities here symbolized; contend manfully against them, as manifested within ourselves; 
and by no means allow ourselves to profane heavenly things generally, and especially the holiness and 
purity of true marriage love, by such illegitimate spiritual or natural conjunctions. And that we may be 
stimulated to do so, let us recall these other words of the Lord where He says: "Think not that I came to
send peace on the earth: I came not to send peace but a sword. For I came to set a man at variance 
against his father, and the daughter against her mother, and the daughter in law against her mother in 
law; and a man's foes shall be they of his own household" (Matt 10:34-35). But refer to 4843 and 
10490 for a full explanation, observing that there is a difference in the application of the terms in the 
two cases, each interpretation being legitimate according to the state of perception at different times; 
both generally harmonious; and both showing the correspondence of the terms in the best sense and in 
the opposite.

We have now, therefore, only to conclude our meditations on this part of the Word by some additional 
remarks on hereditary evil as distinguished from actual evil, which distinction is involved in the words, 
"all these abominations," used in the last few verses. For it is to be carefully remembered, that just as 
no state of merely natural good inherited from parents and ancestors is really the good which saves a 
person by constituting a part of his angelic life, so no state of hereditary evil condemns a person. But 
why so? Evidently because no one can tell what the particular hereditary conditions of his children may
be; he cannot avoid those conditions; and much more are children free from responsibility in this 
matter. For every one is responsible only for the evil he adopts from hereditary tendencies and makes 
actual, and for every new form of evil which is the result of his own violation of the laws of order 
(Ezek 18:20). But in this connection the following statements are valuable: "A certain one, who died an
infant, but who became adult in heaven, was in this opinion, namely, that the good he had was from 
himself, and not from the Lord, wherefore he was sent back into the life of evils which was innate to 
him, and then it was given me to perceive from his sphere that he had a desire to rule over others, and 
that he made light of lasciviousness, which evils he derived hereditarily from his parents; but as soon as
he acknowledged that he was such, he was again received among the angels among whom he was 
before. No one ever suffers punishment in the other life on account of hereditary evil, because it is not 
his; consequently he is not blameable for it; but he suffers punishment on account of actual evil, which 
is his, consequently in proportion as by actual life he has appropriated to himself hereditary evil, as was
said above," 2307, 966. And also the use of merely natural good hereditary dispositions, in the course 
of regeneration, may be known from the following: "Natural good of truth is not spiritual good, that is, 
the good of faith and the good of charity, until it is reformed. Natural good is from a man's parents... 
but spiritual good is from the Lord. Wherefore a man must be regenerated in order that he may receive 
spiritual good. Whilst this is being effected, there are adjoined to him, at first, truths from another 

211

source than from genuine truth itself which are of such a nature that they do not adhere, but only serve 
as means of introducing genuine truths, and when these have been introduced, then truths not genuine 
are separated.... It is as with fruits, which are first filled with bitter juice, before they can receive sweet 
juice, the bitter juice which is not genuine being the means of introducing the sweet, and when the 
latter enters the former is dissipated. Thus also it is with man's Natural while it is being regenerated; for
natural good is such, that, of itself, it is not willing to obey and serve rational good, as a servant serves 
a master, but it wants to have the command. In order, therefore, that it may be reduced to a state of 
compliance and service, it is harassed by states of vastation and temptation, until its cravings become 
weakened, and then by an influx of the good of faith and charity, through the internal man from the 
Lord, it is tempered, until the good received hereditarily is by degrees extirpated, and a new good is 
implanted in its place, into which good the truths of faith are insinuated, which are like the fibres 
inserted into the heart of a man, through which fibres new juice is introduced, and a new heart has 
grown by degrees," 3470. Let us diligently and earnestly, therefore, take heed to our last verse both in 
its literal and spiritual senses, and thus reap the reward of a genuine state of the love of good and truth 
and usefulness for their own sakes, which is the true heavenly state, and is only attainable by 
regeneration, and the purification that follows it, from the Lord.

Leviticus Chapter 19

Summary of the Spiritual Sense

1. Instruction is given that man must conjoin good and truth in himself; reverence and love them; 
confirm himself in true worship; refrain from selfish and worldly love which is idolatry; love 
good as manifested in truth; worship in freedom; appropriate good; reject evil in the process of 
Judgement; and especially avoid profanation then, because this would be to confirm himself in 
evil, vers. 1-8. 

2. In the period of Judgement good and truth are to be devoted to the Lord in works of charity 

without any selfish motive, vers. 9-10. 

3. Various prohibitions involving important spiritual obligations, vers. 11-18. 
4. Concerning the illegitimate conjunction of good affections with evil in the course of 

regeneration, but not from deliberate wickedness; and concerning the remedy and its result, 
vers. 19-22. 

5. On the appropriation of good in the perfect state; its relative imperfection; its full realization; 

and its abundant increase by the implantation of remains, vers. 23-25. 

6. Concerning various prohibitions and duties which the truly spiritual man ought by no means to 

neglect, vers. 26-37.

worship of the Lord confirmed and established.

4. And therefore also he is forbidden to turn from the 

Lord and devote himself to the falsities and evils 
springing from worldly and selfish love; and he 
must worship the Lord only by loving good as it is 
manifested in truth.

213

5. And when you offer a sacrifice of 
peace offerings to the LORD, you 
shall offer it that you may be 
accepted. 

6.

It shall be eaten the same day you 
offer it, and on the morrow: and if 
aught remain until the third day, it 
shall be burnt with fire. 

5. And this worship must be in perfect freedom, 
because only such worship is acceptable to the 
Lord.

6. Also the good of such worship may be 

appropriated by the man of the church in its prime 
and continually; but no affection partaking of 
selfish love and worldly love, in such worship, is 
to be appropriated but rejected in the process of 
Judgement through victory in temptations;

7. And if it be eaten at all on the third 
day, it is an abomination; it shall not
be accepted: 

7. And indeed, if man appropriates to himself evil, as
well as good, in that process, he profanes good; 
and such profane worship cannot be accepted.

8.

But every one that eateth it shall 
bear his iniquity, because he has 
profaned the holy thing of the 
LORD: and that soul shall be cut off 
from his people. 

8. And all who do this confirm and establish 

themselves in evil; for it is the inevitable effect of 
such profanation by mixing evil with good, that 
such a person cannot become otherwise than 
vastated of all truth.

9. And when you reap the harvest of 

9. And again, when, in the Judgement, good is 

your land, you shall not wholly reap
the corners of your field, neither 
shall you gather the gleaning of 
your harvest. 

realized, it is no longer appropriated to selfish 
purposes, in its ultimate expression with full 
power, internally; nor is that good to be 
contaminated by selfish motives externally.

10. And you shall not glean your 

vineyard, neither shall you gather 
the fallen fruit of your vineyard; 
you shall leave them for the poor 
and for the stranger: I am the LORD 
your God. 

10. Moreover, as with spiritual good so with spiritual 
truth; it is not to be ascribed to self, nor is the good
thence resulting; which is holy charity, when it is 
fully realized externally, to be so contaminated. On
the contrary, these things are to be devoted to the 
Lord in works of charity and faith from charity 
without any selfish motive.

11. You shall not steal; neither shall you

11. For it is against Divine Order to ascribe to self 

deal falsely, nor lie one to another. 

12. And you shall not swear by my 

name falsely, so that you profane 
the name of your God: I am the 
LORD. 

what belongs to the Lord; to be in falsity and at the
same time in truth; or to be in evil and at the same 
time in good.

12. Nor is it lawful for the spiritual man who knows or
understands the truth, to confirm himself against it 
by hypocrisy; for this is the profanation of truth, 
which teaches that the Lord is essentially Divine 
Good.

214

13. You shall not oppress your 

neighbour, nor rob him: the wages 
of a hired servant shall not abide 
with you all night until the morning.

14. You shall not curse the deaf, nor put
a stumbling-block before the blind, 
but you shall fear your God; I am 
the LORD. 

15. You shall do no unrighteousness in 
judgement: you shall not respect the
person of the poor, nor honour the 
person of the mighty: but in 
righteousness shall you judge your 
neighbour. 

16. You shall not go up and down as a 
tale-bearer among your people: 
neither shall you stand against the 
blood of your neighbour: I am the 
LORD. 

17. You shall not hate your brother in 
your heart: you shall surely rebuke 
your neighbour, and not bear sin 
because of him. 

13. Neither shall the spiritual man violate charity, nor 
deprive his brother of the truths of his faith; and he
who does good in the natural man for the sake of 
reward, is not to confirm himself in such a state, 
for although it may be of use previous to 
regeneration, and in the obscurity of the natural 
life, it must be rejected when heavenly good is 
realized.

14. Neither shall the spiritual man avert himself from 
those who are deficient in the perception of good, 
or in the understanding of truth; on the contrary, he
must exercise love and charity towards such, and 
thus more strongly establish himself in good.

15. And indeed he is to avoid all injustice, and neither 
to do good without discretion, nor promote the 
truth by the exercise of great intellectual powers 
alone. But he must act with charity and truth 
conjointly in the support of all good.

16. Neither shall he violate charity by first assuming 

friendliness to others, and then descending into the
meanness of exposing their errors, when they are, 
as yet, in a state of truth leading to good; nor 
corrupt the spiritual life of those in good by 
preventing their reception of the interior truth they 
need for conjunction with their good, which they 
have from the Lord.

17. Yea, he must not be inwardly averted from good, 
while practising it outwardly; he shall not hesitate 
in condemning what is wrong from the love of 
what is true; nor shall he excuse evil from natural 
kindness, when he recognizes it in a brother.

18. You shall not take vengeance, nor 

bear any grudge against the children
of your people, but you shall love 
your neighbour as yourself: I am the
LORD. 

18. Nor shall the spiritual man return evil for evil or 
oppose the opinions of others, whether truths or 
falsities, from a selfish impulse; but he shall act in 
all things from charity; for the Lord is essential 
charity.

215

19. You shall keep my statutes. You 

shall not let your cattle gender with 
a diverse kind: you shall not sow 
your field with two kinds of seed: 
neither shall there come upon you a 
garment of two kinds of stuff 
mingled together. 

20. And whoever lies carnally with a 
woman, that is a bondmaid, 
betrothed to an husband, and not at 
all redeemed, nor freedom given 
her; they shall be punished; they 
shall not be put to death, because 
she was not free. 

21. And he shall bring his guilt offering 
to the LORD, to the door of the tent 
of meeting, even a ram for a guilt 
offering. 

22. And the priest shall make atonement
for him with the ram of the guilt 
offering before the LORD for his sin 
which he has sinned: and he shall be
forgiven for his sin which he has 
sinned. 

23. And when you shall come into the 
land, and shall have planted all 
manner of trees for food, then you 
shall count the fruit thereof as their 
uncircumcision: three years shall 
they be as uncircumcised to you; it 
shall not be eaten. 

19. Also the spiritual man must observe all the laws of
Divine Order in external things; he shall not 
profane the good of charity either natural or 
spiritual by mingling evil therewith; he shall not 
profane the truth by admixture with falsities; 
neither shall he be outwardly of a double character
by professing true doctrine and false at the same 
time.

20. For every one who conjoins the good affections of 

the spiritual man with the imperfect affections of 
the natural man, in the course of regeneration 
while these are, as yet, not fully delivered from 
evils, nor able to act from freedom entirely, will 
suffer the consequences of such errors, although he
is not condemned absolutely, since he has been 
under the influence of impulse, and has not acted 
from deliberate choice in spiritual freedom.

21. And such a person must worship the Lord with a 

view of removing his evil and errors, by 
acknowledging that all good is from Him through 
the heavens, whence there is conjunction with Him
by the good of innocence in the internal man.

22. And then, on account of good, shall the external 
man be reconciled with the internal, through 
repentance when he has sinned through weakness, 
and yet sincerely acknowledges the Lord; and thus 
evil will be remitted by the Lord.

23. And also on the realization of the heavenly life of 
good through repentance, when truth is exercised 
from good in various ways for the uses of life, it 
shall be acknowledged, that even man's best 
actions are, relatively, impure; and that not only 
during regeneration, but even in heaven itself, 
good is continually from the Lord, and is never to 
be appropriated by man nor by angel, as derived 
from selfish love.

24. But in the fourth year all the fruit 

24. But nevertheless in the state of the full conjunction

thereof shall be holy, for giving 
praise to the Lord. 

of good and truth, when the selfish life is 
quiescent, good is truly realized, and from the 
heart ascribed to the Lord.

216

25. And in the fifth year shall you eat of
the fruit thereof, that it may yield to 
you the increase thereof: I am the 
LORD your God. 

25. And then it will follow, that remains will be fully 

implanted in the external man, by the 
appropriation of good, in order that good and truth 
may be abundantly increased, because the Lord is 
fully acknowledged, and man is more strongly 
confirmed in love to Him.

26. You shall not eat any thing with the 

blood: neither shall you use 
enchantments, nor practise augury. 

26. Nor will the spiritual man profane good by mixing 
evil with it, or truth internal or external, by making
falsity appear as truth or evil as good.

27. You shall not round the corners of 
your heads, neither shall you mar 
the corners of your beard. 

27. For it is unlawful to corrupt good with evil 
internally, or truth with falsity externally.

28. You shall not make any cuttings in 

28. Nor shall the spiritual man imagine that by 

your flesh for the dead, nor print 
any marks upon you: I am the 
LORD. 

outward mortification he can remove evil, or by 
external worship only, promote permanent good; 
for all true worship is by genuine good from the 
Lord.

29. Profane not your daughter, to make 
her a harlot; lest the land fall to 
whoredom, and the land become 
full of wickedness. 

29. And therefore the affection of truth is not to be 
profaned by falsification, lest such falsifications 
increase and abound, and evil be confirmed 
thereby.

30. You shall keep my sabbaths, and 
reverence my sanctuary: I am the 
LORD. 

30. But, on the other hand, the state of heavenly good 
is to be perpetual, and the state of heavenly truth to
be always holy, because the Lord is holiness itself.

31. Turn you not to them that have 

31. Neither must the spiritual man endeavour to 

familiar spirits, nor to the wizards; 
seek them not out, to be defiled by 
them: I am the LORD your God. 

promote good by the perversion of order, either 
through making evil look like good or falsity like 
truth; for evil spirits who inject such thoughts are 
to be resisted, as they must produce impurity; and 
the conjunction of good and truth is to be 
confirmed by man.

32. You shall rise up before the hoary 

32. But let him acknowledge and reverence Divine 

head, and honour the face of the old 
man, and you shall fear your God: I 
am the LORD. 

wisdom in those with whom it is matured, and the 
intelligence of him who is advanced in the 
regenerate life; yea, let him reverence Divine 
wisdom itself, and become established in Divine 
Good.

33. And if a stranger sojourn with you 
in your land, you shall not do him 
wrong. 

33. Also the spiritual man will take particular care in 
regard to those who require instruction in the 
church, lest he should neglect to promote their 
good.

217

34. The stranger that sojourns with you 
shall be to you as the native among 
you, and you shall love him as 
yourself; for you were strangers in 
the land of Egypt: I am the LORD 
your God. 

34. For, indeed, those who need instruction are to be 

esteemed like those who are in good, and charity is
to be exercised towards them; for every one, at 
first, is under the bondage of the merely natural 
man, and needs instruction; and both good and 
truth are necessary for the perfection of man from 
the Lord.

35. You shall do no unrighteousness in 
judgement, in measure, in weight, 
or in measure. 

35. For strict justice is in the exercise of charity by and
according to truths, as regards internal, interior, 
and external things.

36.

Just balances, just weights, a just 
ephah, and a just hin, shall you 
have: I am the LORD your God, 
which brought you out of the land 
of Egypt. 

36. And therefore man must practise equity and justice
internally, and justice and equity externally, 
because for this purpose the Lord redeemed 
mankind.

37. And you shall observe all my 

37. And therefore also man must be entirely holy, 

statutes, and all my judgements, and
do them: I am the LORD. 

outwardly; inwardly; and in every action; and this 
can only be effected by the acknowledgement of 
the Lord as essentially Divine Good.

denotes that for this purpose the Lord redeemed mankind, 8864-6.

37. Observing all the Lord's statutes, and all his judgements, and doing them, denotes that 

therefore also man must be entirely holy outwardly, inwardly, and in every action, 8357, 5755;
and "I am the Lord" denotes that this can only be effected by the acknowledgement of the 
Lord as essentially DIVINE GOOD, 2001.

Discussion

By reading over the summary at the beginning of this chapter, it will be seen that, within the first eight 
verses, some things are mentioned that frequently recur in the course of the series of the internal sense, 
and that this may often seem like unnecessary repetition. There cannot be, however, any such 

222

repetitions in the Word of the Lord, and on this account wherever there seem to be such we may depend
upon it that there is a presentation of these things in some new light and in some new connections 
which it is important to notice. Observe, for example, that nine distinct points are named in those 
verses, and that each follows that which precedes in such a manner as to show, in the spiritual sense, 
the order and perfection of the series.

But the most interesting thing in this section is certainly what is said about the peace offering. For, 
taking these things as they stand, and thinking only of the literal sense, it is impossible to discover any 
very satisfactory reason for the directions given. It is easy to see that perhaps some sanitary conditions 
were involved, but this does not explain the severity of the sentence of excommunication pronounced 
against the offender. According to the inner sense, however, this is seen, and more things besides. For 
the first and second days denote the states in which man is preparing for his Judgement, and the third 
day denotes the state of that Judgement; the peace offering signifies the state of freedom in which man 
is, for worship and appropriation, during his probationary state; but in the process of Judgement, which 
consists in bringing the external man into perfect harmony with the internal, this state of freedom is not
the same as it was before. Then it was the free determination between good and evil, as well as the 
freedom of affection or love, but now it is the freedom of the established ruling love only (HH 480). 
Now we should mark this well, for it shows us why the peace offering remaining on the third day was 
to be burnt with fire. It is because the ruling love of good rejects all selfish love in the Judgement, 
while the ruling love of evil adopts it, and is bound to take the consequences, as the series describes; 
for fire corresponds to both loves, and we see how the Word in its internal sense confirms the statement
of the angels. It is the ruling love that decides in the course of Judgement. The lesson for us all is here 
obvious. If we would go to heaven we must work while it is called today, for the night comes in which 
no man who has not already done so can work out his salvation. For notice how the internal sense puts 
it. There is a perpetual peace offering in heaven for the good, but none at all for the wicked who have 
not chosen heaven. Compare the spiritual teaching of vers. 6 and 8, and observe well that of vers. 9 and
10, noting particularly the connection, and that the mention of the harvest, of the field and of the 
vineyard together show that the subject of the Judgement is continued in order to demonstrate how 
charity and faith now prevail with the good, and how the external will and understanding come into 
harmony with the internal.

We next observe that the moral teaching which now follows is very important in the literal sense, and 
hence that the internal sense of the Word sometimes seems to descend, and manifest itself more 
particularly in this way; and yet the perfect distinction between the two senses is still maintained. For 
example, it is not the same thing to ascribe to ourselves what belongs to the Lord, and to steal; and yet 
it is clear that a man who deliberately steals, and persists in doing so, practically claims his life as his 
own, and denies his responsibility to the Lord; while, on the other hand, he who truly acknowledges the
Lord will not steal or lie, or deliberately do any of the other things here forbidden. And we discern that 
it is, as it were, a shorter way to a good life to establish ourselves in good and true principles of action, 
than to keep the commandments either because we fear the consequences of not doing so, or because 
they are the Divine laws which it is our own interest to obey. For by so doing we cleanse first the inside
of the cup and of the platter, that the outside may be clean also (Matt 23:26). But still spiritually, as 
well as literally, internal cleansing and external cleansing are distinctly necessary, although it is only in 
the spiritual sense that internal purity is the cause of that which is external. And again, it is interesting 
to notice a point in connection with retaining the wages of a hired servant all night until the morning. 
For we see that, literally, not much harm, and in some cases no harm at all, would be done to the 
servant by paying him his wages in the morning after he had earned them. But, spiritually, to allow the 

223

wages of a hired servant to abide with us is to continue to do useful things, more for the sake of the 
reward than for the sake of being useful. This, of course, may be allowed as a preparatory state; but it is
clear that when a person realizes the love of being useful for its own sake, he will not any longer work 
for the reward, although he may still carefully see that he gets it, because he knows that this enables 
him, from his love of use, to provide for himself the means of performing other uses which, in a lower 
degree, are quite as necessary as the essential use of his life. For when we come to look into it, no one 
can be in the love of use as a ruling principle and in the love of reward as a ruling principle at the same 
time; and if he is in the love of use, therefore, which love is like the morning when the sun rises, he 
cannot continue to be in the love of reward, which is, comparatively, like the darkness of night. But we 
must omit further comment on these moral-spiritual laws, and consider what follows concerning 
illegitimate conjunctions.

For notwithstanding what has been shown just above, while man is in the course of regeneration the 
lower and preparatory states will almost unavoidably have some influence, while the higher states will 
yet be predominant; and it is this which causes illegitimate conjunctions, the tendency to which is 
certainly to be repressed. And hence we are not to allow our good affections, natural or spiritual, to be 
contaminated with evil, which is to let our cattle gender with a diverse kind. And what is true of the 
affections applies also to the intellectual powers internal and external. If we have adopted principles of 
truth, or have sown the seed of the Word in the ground of the honest and good heart, we must not also 
cultivate falsities; for we cannot realize a higher state and at the same time remain in the lower, nor 
equally believe in a true doctrine and a false one, or mingle the appearances of truth in which we have 
formerly been with the genuine truths of our more advanced life.

Now we may all feel and see the great value of this teaching, and how necessary it is that we should 
make a practical use of it. But still, how imperfect are we, and how liable to do the very things, as we 
journey through life, which our higher feelings and our better judgement condemn. And this is shown 
by the illegitimate conjunction with the betrothed handmaid. For she very clearly signifies the 
imperfect natural affections, which ought to serve the spiritual affections as a servant does her mistress;
and what is said about her is really quite interesting when considered spiritually. She is betrothed to a 
husband, that is, these natural affections of ours are not only subdued and kept in check by mere force 
or authority, but they are in a state of advancing towards the heavenly marriage, while yet at the same 
time they are not in the genuine freedom of good or in full deliverance from evil; and it is on this 
account that the spiritual man is decidedly wrong in contaminating himself unlawfully, or in conjoining
his life with the yet imperfect natural life. Now this is a true picture of what we all are apt to do in the 
course of our religious experience. Changing the figure for a moment, we, in fact, tamper with the 
enemy, and are captivated with the delights he makes us believe to be allowable (Num 25:1-3). 
However, the better nature asserts itself. We are degraded, but we are not lost. We repent and worship 
the Lord, and the superior good triumphs, as we see from what follows, on which we need not 
comment further, as the sacrifice of the ram, and the consequent atonement, are familiar as to their 
spiritual meaning.

But in regard to the rest of this chapter, we have only space to trace the connections, and show briefly 
why things succeed one another without apparently any reason, literally, for the arrangement. After we 
have been in temptation, as just described, our state is elevated, and we have a more correct and 
specific perception of what our heavenly state will be. And, strange to say, we learn that its first 
realization is not to be exactly what, perhaps, we have been anticipating. I once heard a clergyman 
preaching a sermon concerning his lately departed son. He first described his state when dying, and 
how the youth, as the last moments approached, when he could no longer speak, drew with his hand a 

224

circle round his head, to indicate a crown of glory in store for himself; and the father, as he mentioned 
this in his discourse to the congregation, suddenly exclaimed, "My poor dear boy is in heaven!" And 
possibly the conception was as if he had passed immediately to a state of angelic perfection. But we see
in this part of our lesson that even entrance into heaven will, in the beginning, be attended with a 
certain sense of our own imperfection, and of how much we are short of good, as we now think of it. 
But this is only a state preparatory to our full conjunction with the Lord, and the complete 
appropriation of remains, denoted respectively by the fourth and fifth year. Again, we notice that three 
or four things follow, the reason for which does not outwardly appear. But it is seen in the internal 
sense, and only the general truth that the commission of evils of many kinds will not occur in heaven is 
manifest, or may be inferred, from the literal sense. But notice the series, and it will be seen that three 
successive degrees of profanation are mentioned respectively as to will and understanding, resulting in 
the deliberate falsification of the truth so that evil is in danger of being confirmed. These are things, 
however, that cannot take place in heaven. On the contrary, the eternal Sabbath is there, where truth is 
conjoined with good, and the Lord alone is worshiped. But, indeed, all this is said of the inmost degree 
of man's life. And then we observe that something similar is said of the middle degree in vers. 31-32, 
followed by a very clear reference to the ultimate degree even to the end of the chapter; while what is 
said of each degree is appropriately concluded by the solemn affirmation and confirmation, "I am the 
Lord."

For in heaven all the degrees of angelic life are most accurately distinguished, not only in general, but 
particularly; and, moreover, all these degrees are in their fullness in the ultimate, as is shown by the 
contents of vers. 36-37 very emphatically. Let us remember, therefore, that our life in this world is what
prepares us for the heavenly life, and that consequently this series is also adapted to describe, in a lower
degree, the states of the true church on earth.

Leviticus Chapter 20

Summary of the Spiritual Sense

1. On the profanation of the truth by selfish love; and its consequences to those who are guilty of it

and to those who excuse it, vers. 1-5. 

2. The danger of unlawful exchange with spirits, ver. 6. 
3. The necessity of a holy life, internally and externally, and the consequences of aversion from 

Divine Good and Divine Truth, vers. 7-9. 

4. The consequences of the profanation of good and truth in various ways, vers. 10-21. 
5. The necessity of obedience, and the danger of disobedience to the spiritual laws of Divine 

Order, vers. 22-24. 

6. Also man must carefully distinguish between pure and impure affections and thoughts; he must 
be holy and pure, because he has been separated from evils and falsities; and he must remember 
that those who pervert good and truth by the abuse of the laws of order, internally or externally, 
totally vastate themselves, vers. 25-27. 

The Contents of each Verse

1. And the LORD spoke to Moses, 

1. There is revelation from the Lord by Divine Truth 

saying, 

giving the perception,

2. Moreover, you shall say to the 

2. That instruction is to be given to the man of the 

children of Israel, Whosoever he be 
of the children of Israel, or of the 
strangers that sojourn in Israel, that 
gives of his seed to Molech; he shall 
surely be put to death: the people of 
the land shall stone him with stones. 

Spiritual Church, that every one, whether he be of 
the internal or external church, who profanes the 
truth by devoting it to the service of selfish love, 
will be utterly vastated, that is, will be deprived of 
all truths, and suffer the punishments which evil 
and falsity carry with them.

3.

I also will set my face against that 
man, and will cut him off from 
among his people; because he has 
given of his seed to Molech, to defile
my sanctuary, and to profane my 
holy name. 

3. Also such persons deprive themselves of all 

conjunction with Divine Good, and all knowledge 
of Divine Truth, because the profanation of the 
truth of the church through selfish love corrupts all
holy good from the Lord, and all holy truth which 
is the expression of good.

4. And if the people of the land do any 
ways hide their eyes from that man, 
when he gives of his seed to Molech,
and put him not to death: 

4. And if the man of the church, in any way, excuses 
such enormity, and does not reject utterly this 
profanation,

226

5. Then I will set my face against that 
man, and against his family, and will
cut him off, and all that go a whoring
after him, to commit whoredom with
Molech, from among their people. 

5. Then also he himself will lose the perception of 
heavenly love from the Lord, both in particular 
and in general, and will be separated from the 
church, with all those who falsify the truth through
selfish love, nor will he be any longer able to 
perceive truths.

6. And the soul that turns to them that 
have familiar spirits, and to the 
wizards, to go a whoring after them, 
I will even set my face against that 
soul, and will cut him off from 
among his people. 

6. Also those who, by the abuse of order, endeavour, 
through unlawful exchange with the wicked in the 
spiritual world, to make evil look like good, or 
falsity appear as truth, thus falsifying the truth, 
will lose all perception of good, and will be unable
any longer to understand the truth.

7. Sanctify yourselves therefore, and be
you holy: for I am the LORD your 
God. 

8. And you shall keep my statutes, and 
do them: I am the LORD which 
sanctify you. 

7. And, therefore, let the spiritual man be on his 

guard, and live a pure and holy life, because only 
thus can he have conjunction with the Lord, who is
the source of all good conjoined with truth.

8. And this he must do not only internally, but 

externally, in understanding and will, because the 
external man can only be conjoined with the 
internal by good from the. Lord, or by love to the 
Lord and charity to the neighbour.

9. For every one that curses his father 
or his mother shall surely be put to 
death: he has cursed his father or his 
mother; his blood shall be upon him.

9. For every one who averts himself from Divine 

Good and Divine Truth totally vastates himself; he
deliberately rejects both; and he must therefore 
abide in his own falsity.

10. And the man that commits adultery 

with another man's wife, even he that
commits adultery with his 
neighbour's wife, the adulterer and 
the adulteress shall surely be put to 
death. 

11. And the man that lies with his 
father's wife has uncovered his 
father's nakedness: both of them 
shall surely be put to death; their 
blood shall be upon them. 

10. And not only so; but the man who adulterates the 
good of the church, either its external or its 
internal good, will also be fully vastated as to the 
knowledge of good and the perception of truth.

11. While he who, in addition, profanes good by 

contaminating it with selfish love, more intensely 
destroys good and truth in himself, because he 
mixes in himself good and evil.

227

12. And if a man lie with his daughter in
law, both of them shall surely be put 
to death: they have worked 
confusion; their blood shall be upon 
them. 

12. And further, if the man of the church profanes 

good by contamination with the falsity conjoined 
to his own evil, or, in other words, if he profanes 
the holy principle of charity in this way, vastation 
as to good and truth is certainly the result, because 
again good and evil are mixed, and such persons 
must abide in their own falsity.

13. And if a man lie with mankind, as 

with womankind, both of them have 
committed abomination: they shall 
surely be put to death; their blood 
shall be upon them. 

13. And yet again, even the man of the external church
who profanes the truth by conjoining it with falsity
from sensual love, it is infernal abomination; and 
such a person must be vastated entirely and abide 
in his own falsity.

14. And if a man take a wife and her 

14. Also if any one profanes by adulterating the truth 

mother, it is wickedness: they shall 
be burnt with fire, both he and they; 
that there be no wickedness among 
you. 

of the church adjoined to its good, by 
contamination with falsity adjoined to its evil, it is 
intense profanation; all such are consumed by 
selfish love; and must be thus separated from the 
church, that it may become pure and holy.

15. And if a man lie with a beast, he 

15. Also if he should do so by conjoining the truth 

shall surely be put to death: and you 
shall slay the beast. 

with the evil affections of the merely natural man, 
he will be vastated, and so also will those natural 
affections.

16. And if a woman approach to any 

16. And if good in the natural man be profaned by 

beast, and lie down thereto, you shall
kill the woman, and the beast: they 
shall surely be put to death; their 
blood shall be upon them. 

17. And if a man shall take his sister, his
father's daughter, or his mother's 
daughter, and see her nakedness, and
she see his nakedness; it is a 
shameful thing; and they shall be cut
off in the sight of the children of 
their people: he has uncovered his 
sister's nakedness; he shall bear his 
iniquity. 

contamination with falsity, vastation follows in the
same way; they are deprived of all good and truth, 
and must abide in falsity.

17. And again if the man of the internal church 

profanes the truth by means of falsity derived 
either from the will or the understanding, he 
causes the reciprocal aversion of truth and falsity 
which is abominable, and separation from the 
church is inevitable, because of such profanity, and
he must be confirmed in evil.

228

18. And if a man shall lie with a woman 
having her sickness, and shall 
uncover her nakedness; he has made 
naked her fountain, and she has 
uncovered the fountain of her blood: 
and both of them shall be cut off 
from among their people. 

18. Further, if the man of the church corrupts either 

good or truth by contaminating them with falsified 
truths, he is guilty of profanation interiorly and 
reciprocally; and such profanation causes 
separation from the church entirely.

19. And you shall not uncover the 

19. Also it is not lawful to corrupt the truth by 

nakedness of your mother's sister, 
nor of your father's sister: for he has 
made naked his near kin: they shall 
bear their iniquity. 

conjoining it with falsity in the understanding 
either external or internal which is adjoined to 
selfish love, for this is profanation, and produces 
confirmation in falsity.

20. And if a man shall lie with his 

20. And if the man of the church corrupts the good 

uncle's wife, he has uncovered his 
uncle's nakedness: they shall bear 
their sin; they shall die childless. 

thereof by conjoining it with the evil of collateral 
good, it is profanation; such persons confirm 
themselves in evil; and the church is, with them, 
without the increase of good and truth.

21. And if a man shall take his brother's 
wife, it is impurity: he has uncovered
his brother's nakedness; they shall be
childless. 

21. Also if he corrupts the good of the natural man by 
conjoining it with the falsity of evil there, it is 
profanation; and there is consequently no increase 
of good and truth.

22. You shall therefore keep all my 

22. Therefore the spiritual man must be holy both 

statutes, and all my judgements, and 
do them: that the land, whither I 
bring you to dwell therein, vomit 
you not out. 

23. And you shall not walk in the 

customs of the nation, which I cast 
out before you: for they did all these 
things, and therefore I abhorred 
them. 

outwardly and inwardly so that the church may not
be subject to profanation.

23. Neither shall he live according to the evils of the 
corrupted church; for this church profaned the 
truth, and thus separated itself from the Lord.

24. But I have said to you, You shall 

24. But Divine Good desires that the spiritual man 

inherit their land, and I will give it to
you to possess it, a land flowing with
milk and honey: I am the LORD your 
God, which have separated you from
the peoples. 

may be safe by the reception of heavenly life both 
internally and externally, wherein is abundance of 
truth conjoined with good, and of natural delight; 
and through that the Lord is truly worshiped, and 
those of the church are distinguished from others.

229

25. You shall therefore separate between
the clean beast and the unclean, and 
between the unclean bird and the 
clean: and you shall not make your 
souls abominable by beast, or by 
bird, or by any thing with which the 
ground teems, which I have 
separated from you as unclean. 

26. And you shall be holy to me: for I 
the LORD am holy, and have 
separated you from the peoples, that 
you should be mine. 

27. A man also or a woman that has a 
familiar spirit, or that is a wizard, 
shall surely be put to death: they 
shall stone them with stones: their 
blood shall be upon them. 

References and Notes

25. And therefore also a careful distinction is to be 

made between what is pure and impure both as to 
the will and understanding; and the man of the 
church ought not to corrupt himself with any evil 
or falsity, or any sensual delight which is distinct 
from good and truth, and is on that account 
impure.

37032, 370320, and hence, in this case, taking a wife and her mother denotes to profane by 
adulterating the truth of the church adjoined to its good by contamination with falsity adjoined
to its evil, 48434, 10490; "it is wickedness, or enormity," denotes that it is intense profanation, 
9264; being burned with fire, he and they, denotes that such persons are, consequently,

of truth and good, 2908, chap 18:23.

16. A woman approaching to any beast to lie down thereto denotes that if good in the natural man 

be profaned by contamination with falsity, 46, 725; killing the woman and the beast denotes 
that vastation follows in the same way, 2908; their being surely put to death denotes vastation 
as to will and understanding, or as to the internal and external man, 683; and their blood being 
upon them denotes that they must abide in their own falsity, 473512, chap 18:23.

17. A man taking his sister, his father's daughter or his mother's daughter, and seeing her 
nakedness, and she seeing his nakedness, denotes the profanation of the truth by 
contamination with falsity derived either from the will or the understanding, and the reciprocal
aversion of truth and falsity, 568, 1815, 1895, 6348, 6047; it being a shameful thing clearly 
denotes that such profanation is abominable; being cut off in the sight of the children of their 
people denotes inevitable separation from the church, 5302, 1259; uncovering his sister's 
nakedness denotes the profanation of truth, chap 18:9; and bearing iniquity denotes 
confirmation in evil, 993711.

18. A man lying with a woman having her sickness and uncovering her nakedness denotes the 
corruption either of good or truth by contaminating them with falsified truths which is 
profanation, 6348, chap 18:19; making naked her fountain denotes interior falsification and 
profanation, 4861; she uncovering the fountain of her blood denotes what is reciprocal, 6047; 
and being cut off from among their people denotes that such profanation causes separation 
from the church entirely, 5302, 1259.

19. Not uncovering the nakedness of your mother's sister or your father's sister, denotes that it is 

not lawful to corrupt the truth by conjoining it with falsity in the understanding either external 
or internal, 6348, 370320, 1475, 1815, 1895, chap 18:12, 13; near of kin denotes falsity 
adjoined to selfish love, 37032; and bearing iniquity denotes confirmation in falsity, 993711.

20. A man lying with his uncle's wife, and uncovering his uncle's nakedness, denotes corrupting 
the good of the church by conjoining it with the evil of collateral good, which is profanation,

and dying childless denotes no increase of good and truth, 489, 2908.

232

21. A man taking his brother's wife denotes the corruption of the good of the natural man by 

conjoining it with the falsity of evil there, which is profanation, 3612, 1369, 6348, chap 18:16,
10130; uncovering his brother's nakedness denotes revealing the outward form of that evil, 
996018, 3049, 5337, 9474; and being childless, denotes no increase of good and truth, 489.

22. Keeping all the Lord's statutes and judgements, and doing them, denotes that the spiritual man 
must be holy both outwardly and inwardly, 8357, 5755; and "that the land whither I bring you 
vomit you not out," denotes so that the church may not be subject to profanation, 3705, 9507. 
See also AR 205.

23. Not walking in the customs of the nations which were before you denotes not living according 
to the evils of the corrupted church, 1205, 2657; and their doing all these things and being 
abhorred denotes that this church profaned the truth, and thus separated itself from the Lord, 
1205, 693, 696.

24. "But I have said to you, You shall inherit their land, and I will give it to you to possess it," 
denotes that Divine Good desires that the spiritual man may be safe by the reception of the 
heavenly life both internally and externally, 2001, 3705, 2658; a land flowing with milk and 
honey denotes abundance of truth conjoined with good, and natural delight, 5620; "I am the 
Lord your God" denotes that through these the Lord is truly worshiped, 2001; and separation 
from the peoples denotes that those of the church are distinguished from others, 6653.

25. Separating between the clean beast and the unclean and between the unclean bird and the 

clean, denotes that a careful distinction is to be made between what is pure and impure both as
to the will and understanding, 46, 745, 4545, 10130; and not making your souls abominable by
beast or by bird, or by anything with which the ground teems, or creeps, which I have 
separated from you as unclean, denotes that the man of the church ought not to corrupt himself
with any evil or falsity or any sensual delight which is distinct from good and truth and 
impure, 40.

26. The children of Israel being holy to the Lord, because He is holy and separated them from the 
peoples that they might be His, denotes that the spiritual man must be pure and holy, because 
the Lord is purity and holiness itself, and only the Lord can deliver man from the evils and 
falsities of the corrupted church, and regenerate him, 3654, 2190, 3210, 6653, 2405.

27. A man or a woman that has a familiar spirit, or that is a wizard, denotes those who pervert 

good and truth, by the abuse of order, internally and externally, 7297, 9188; being surely put to
death denotes that such totally vastate themselves, 2908; being stoned with stones denotes that
they are deprived of all truths, 8799; and their blood being upon them denotes being given up 
to their own falsities, 4735. 

Discussion

The particular kind of profanation spoken of in the beginning of this account differs from other kinds in
being the destruction of truth and goodness by the most degraded selfish loves, for we read: "To give 
seed to Molech signifies to destroy the truth of the Word, and thus of the doctrine of the church 
therefrom by application to the vile loves of the body, as to murders, hatreds, revenges, adulteries and 
similar things, which leads to the acceptance of infernal falsities instead of Divine things; such falsities 
are signified by the seed given to Molech. Molech was the god of the sons of Ammon (1 Kings 11:7) 

233

and was set up in the valley of Hinnom, which was called Topheth, where they burnt their sons and 
daughters in the fire" (AE 76825). And to this may be added that Molech means a king, and therefore 
denotes a governing falsity from selfish love signified by fire, 1682, 934; that a valley denotes a low or
degraded state, 1292; that Hinnom means their riches, and in this case therefore signifies the 
knowledge of the truth perverted, 1694; and that Topheth means a place of burning, or spitting, or of 
detestation, 66696, 48354, 1608. And from all these correspondences, the nature of the wickedness 
denoted by giving seed to pass through the fire to Molech may be more fully understood. But observe 
also the connection of consulting familiar spirits and its signification, with this idolatry, namely, that 
the one denotes a state of the depraved affections and the other the corruption of the understanding in 
consequence. In fact, they may be taken as two general statements regarding profanations, the 
particulars of which follow, but in a different order from that adopted in a previous chapter. Now this 
change of order is certainly intended to indicate some spiritual truth, although we may not be able to 
discover what it is, or see the reason for it. But the general subject of the chapter, in the internal sense, 
is the punishment for the various kinds of profanation, or in other words, the consequences of 
indulgence in them. These are the punishment of death by stoning, by burning, and generally; being cut
off or separated from their people; bearing their iniquity; bearing their sin; and dying childless, all of 
them being understood in their spiritual sense. It may be worth while therefore to reflect a little on each
of these.

Let us, however, to begin with, remember that although there are arbitrary punishments in this world, 
under certain circumstances, so far as man's real spiritual life is concerned there are not any, all so-
called punishment being the natural result of the violation of the Divine laws of order. The Lord 
punishes no one; evil brings with it its own punishment; and no punishment is ever permitted but for 
some good and useful purpose. Nor is it necessary to believe that there is such a thing as "eternal 
punishment" (Matt 25:46). But there is in relation to evil spirits, that which is eternal in this connection;
and we ought to know what it is. It cannot surely be eternal suffering; for how can we imagine that 
what the Lord permits for the sake of some use, 696, is unending pain or suffering? Of what use would 
it be, for example, that any living being should be condemned to remain in everlasting fire? We see, 
therefore, that we must look for some other solution of such expressions; and the law of 
correspondences supplies us with it. Fire in the best sense signifies love, because it corresponds to love;
and this love is the love of the Lord and the neighbour. But fire in the opposite sense signifies the love 
of self and the world simply for their own sakes, and these are the loves which constitute an evil spirit. 
Still, all love, whether good or evil, is delightful to him who is in it; and hence the ruling love even of 
an evil spirit cannot be to him what is called eternal punishment, although it is, properly, an 
unquenchable fire. See HH 480. What then is meant by the punishment which is eternal? It is a state of 
eternal restraint arising from the fear of punishment (HH 543). For the Greek word, which in our 
versions is rendered punishment, really means restraint as well, and this more correctly describes the 
permanent condition of the infernals so far as their government is concerned. They are for ever 
restrained by the fear of suffering, and this fear at length becomes so strong that they dare not violate 
the laws in their own sphere, or on their own plane of life. And so long, at any time, or in any state, as 
they are obedient they are not in any punishment. With these general remarks on the subject before us 
we will now consider the specific punishments mentioned in this chapter.

By the punishment of death in general is meant a state of evil and falsity separated from a state of 
goodness and truth, for we read: '"The reason why heaven generally, and eternal happiness specifically, 
are called life is, that in heaven there are the wisdom of good, and the understanding of truth, and in the
wisdom of good and the understanding of truth there is life from the Lord, from Whom is all life. But in

234

hell there are the contraries, namely, instead of good, evil, and instead of truth, falsity, and thereby 
spiritual life is extinct; therefore in hell there is respectively death; for spiritual death is evil and falsity, 
and with man it is to will what is evil, and thence to think what is false. Evil genii and spirits are 
unwilling to hear it said of them that they do not live, or that they are dead; for they say that they have 
life because they can will and think; but they are told that since there is life in good and truth there 
cannot be any life in evil and falsity, for they are contraries," 5407. But death by stoning, as we have 
seen, signifies to be vastated, or deprived, of all truths, and death by burning signifies to be vastated or 
deprived of all good; or what is the same thing, it is to be consumed by selfish love. By being cut off 
from their people, or in the sight of the children of their people, is denoted inevitable separation from 
the church, and thus losing the knowledge of the truth; and we see here that total vastation is not 
implied; for a person may, by wicked actions, be thus separated, and yet there may be left the 
opportunity for salvation by sincere repentance. But now notice also the difference between bearing 
iniquity and bearing sin as occurring respectively in different cases, and as denoting confirmation in 
falsity and confirmation in evil. And lastly, by dying childless is signified no increase of good and 
truth; and from all these instances we surely learn that the results of indulging in various forms of evil 
and falsity are also various, and hence that every kind of wickedness has its appropriate punishment 
which can only be avoided by the rejection, outwardly and inwardly, of the particular evil or falsity 
from which it comes.

There is, however, one expression in this account, which is several times mentioned, and therefore we 
ought not to forget the consideration of it. It is said of the man who curses his father or his mother, not 
only that he shall be put to death, but also that his blood shall be upon him. Now in the literal sense this
clearly means that he has brought the punishment upon himself; and of course the same thing is meant 
in all the other instances. But spiritually by this expression is signified that, generally, evil brings upon 
itself its own punishment, and consequently must abide in its own falsity; for he who rejects Divine 
Good and Divine Truth, which is signified by cursing his father and his mother, must necessarily do 
this, since the conjunction of good and truth is that in which regeneration essentially consists, and, on 
the other hand, the conjunction of evil and falsity is that in which the life of him who will not allow 
himself to be regenerated consists. Every one, we may be sure, has the opportunity of being 
regenerated, for if this were not so the Lord's work of Redemption was in vain, and some would suffer 
unjustly; and therefore it is clear also that all who are condemned choose to be so, notwithstanding all 
the warnings they receive; and thus we see the full force of the repeated statement "their blood shall be 
upon them," both in the literal and spiritual senses, and also the terrible nature of the exclamation of the
people who said concerning the Lord, "His blood be upon us and upon our children," as denoting at 
once the rejection of all Divine Truth, and the adoption of falsities from evil by the corrupted Jewish 
Church (Matt 27:25; 91276).

Leviticus Chapter 21

Summary of the Spiritual Sense

1. Various prohibitions to those who are in good and in truth thence derived generally, vers. 1-9. 
2. Similar prohibitions and directions concerning the celestial man, and the Lord in His 

glorification, vers. 10-15. 

3. Concerning the hindrances during regeneration to the full development of the life of those who 

are in good and in truth thence derived, vers. 16-23. 

The Contents of each Verse

1. And the LORD said to Moses, Speak
to the priests the sons of Aaron, and 
say to them, There shall none defile 
himself for the dead among his 
people; 

2.

Except for his kin, that is near to 
him, for his mother, and for his 
father, and for his son, and for his 
daughter, and for his brother; 

1.

2.

There is revelation from the Lord by Divine Truth
giving perception to the man of the Spiritual 
Church who is in good and thence in truth, that no
person of such a character may be contaminated 
with falsity in which there is no spiritual life.

Except with that which is unavoidable even by the
angels; for those in celestial truth and celestial 
good, or in spiritual truth and the affection 
thereof, or in spiritual good,

3. And for his sister a virgin, that is 
near to him, which has had no 
husband, for her may he defile 
himself. 

3. Or in spiritual truth in the understanding, which is
pure, although not yet conjoined with good — are
not pure in the sight of the Lord; and this the 
spiritual man acknowledges.

4. He shall not defile himself, being a 
chief man among his people, to 
profane himself. 

4.

But nevertheless, he who is in good, because good
is the essential of all truth, may not contaminate 
himself with falsity in which there is no spiritual 
life; for this is profanation.

5.

6.

They shall not make baldness upon 
their head, neither shall they shave 
off the corner of their beard, nor 
make any cuttings in their flesh. 

5. Nor shall he who is in good ever be without truth 

in the natural man interior or exterior; nor shall 
his natural good be vitiated by falsities derived 
from fallacies and appearances causing 
misconceptions.

They shall be holy to their God, and
not profane the name of their God: 
for the offerings of the LORD made 
by fire, the bread of their God, they 
do offer: therefore they shall be 
holy. 

6. And thus those who are in good shall also be 
perfect in truth; neither shall they profane that 
truth by denying the Divine Human; for they 
worship the Lord from pure love, and 
acknowledge that all good is from Him in Divine 
Truth, and on this account are they holy.

236

7.

They shall not take a woman that is 
a harlot, or profane; neither shall 
they take a woman put away from 
her husband: for he is holy to his 
God. 

7. And hence it is unlawful for him who is in good 

to conjoin himself with falsified truth; or with 
falsified truth profaned; or with faith separated 
from charity. For only good and truth can agree 
together.

8. You shall sanctify him therefore; for
he offers the bread of your God: he 
shall be holy to you: for I the LORD,
which sanctify you, am holy. 

8.

Let every one therefore enter into this 
conjunction, and acknowledge that his good is 
from the Lord in truth; and man can do this 
because he has power from the Lord to confirm 
himself in good by truths.

9. And the daughter of any priest, if 
she profane herself by playing the 
harlot, she profanes her father: she 
shall be burnt with fire. 

9. And the affection of good, if it be conjoined with 
falsified truth, is profaned; thereby good itself is 
profaned; and vastation as to good, through 
selfish love, must follow.

10. And he that is the high priest among

his brethren, upon whose head the 
anointing oil is poured, and that is 
consecrated to put on the garments, 
shall not let the hair of his head go 
loose, nor rend his clothes; 

10. Also the Lord, who, as to His Human was Divine 
Truth united to Divine Good, and thence the 
celestial man in whom Divine Good is manifested
by Divine Truths thence proceeding, does not 
disperse good by the dispersion of truths, either 
internally or externally.

11. Neither shall he go in to any dead 

11. And neither is the Lord in His Divine Human, or 

body, nor defile himself for his 
father, or for his mother; 

the celestial man, at all contaminated by 
hereditary evil and falsity thence in respect to the 
Lord, or by the remains of actual evil and its 
falsity in respect to man;

12. Neither shall he go out of the 

12. Neither shall he who is in good, like the 

sanctuary, nor profane the sanctuary
of his God; for the crown of the 
anointing oil of his God is upon 
him: I am the LORD. 

13. And he shall take a wife in her 

virginity. 

regenerated celestial man, ever cease to be so; nor
shall he on any account, in the slightest degree 
profane good by separating truth from it, because 
he has been victorious in the conflict of life, and 
has thus conjoined truth with good; and this truth 
is the perfect expression of good.

13. And hence the Lord, in His glorification, is 
eternally conjoined with His church by the 
removal from it of all impurity; and man, in his 
regeneration, is in good and truth conjoined also 
without impurity.

237

14. A widow, or one divorced, or a 
profane woman, an harlot, these 
shall he not take: but a virgin of his 
own people shall he take to wife. 

15. And he shall not profane his seed 

among his people: for I am the 
LORD which sanctify him. 

14. Nor is it possible for the regenerated man to be in 
good without truth, or in truth without good; nor 
can he conjoin himself with falsified truth 
profaned; but in the course of regeneration he 
must be purified from all evil, and must be finally 
and eternally conjoined with his own conjugial 
partner in the heavens.

15. And lastly, neither shall the celestial man profane 
the truths, by which the church, in its lower 
degrees, is increased and extended, because he 
acts from the Divine Good, by which he is 
rendered pure and holy.

16. And the LORD spoke to Moses, 

16. Further, there is revelation from the Lord, by 

saying, 

Divine Truth, giving the perception,

17. Speak to Aaron, saying, Whosoever 
he be of your seed throughout their 
generations that has a blemish, let 
him not approach to offer the bread 
of his God. 

17. Concerning the celestial man, or concerning the 
man who is in good, that throughout the whole 
course of his regeneration, so long as he is not 
made perfect by truths, he cannot fully 
acknowledge that all good is from the Lord by 
means of Divine Truth.

18. For whatever man he be that has a 

18. For whoever he may be, in whom there is any 

blemish, he shall not approach: a 
blind man, or a lame, or he that has 
a flat nose, or any thing superfluous,

defect as to good or truth, he is thereby hindered 
from that acknowledgement; as, for example, 
when he is ignorant of truth or of good in the 
natural man; when his spiritual growth is 
impeded, or when he is naturally proud of his 
intellectual powers;

19. Or a man that is brokenfooted, or 

19. One whose natural affections are perverted, or 

broken-handed, 

whose spiritual powers are impaired;

20. Or hunchback, or a dwarf, or that 
has a blemish in his eye, or is 
scurvy, or scabbed, or has his stones
broken; 

20. He whose power of elevating himself to spiritual 
things is weak, or one who is defective in 
applying truths to life; he whose intellect is weak; 
he who is outwardly troubled by falsities or evils; 
or he with whom the power of conjoining truth 
with good is injured;

21. No man of the seed of Aaron the 

21. No one who is in good, or in the truth of good 

priest, that has a blemish, shall 
come near to offer the offerings of 
the LORD made by fire: he has a 
blemish; he shall not come near to 
offer the bread of his God. 

internal, and yet is deficient externally, is capable 
of fully acknowledging that all good is from the 
Lord through Divine Love; he is hindered by his 
defects; and he cannot be conjoined with the Lord
as to the external by such acknowledgement.

238

22. He shall eat the bread of his God, 
both of the most holy, and of the 
holy. 

23. Only he shall not go in to the veil, 
nor come near to the altar, because 
he has a blemish; that he profane 
not my sanctuaries: for I am the 
LORD which sanctify them. 

22. He is, indeed, able to appropriate good internally 

as to the will and as to the understanding;

23. But he is not yet prepared to realize his own 

inmost good, by the removal of all appearances; 
nor can he truly worship the Lord until his defect 
is removed, and if that good were manifested he 
would profane it. But the Lord from His Divine 
Good will remove the impediment, because He 
can sanctify man to the uttermost.

24. So Moses spoke to Aaron, and to his
sons, and to all the children of 
Israel. 

24. And this is the dictate of Divine Truth to the man 
who is in good, of the celestial, of the spiritual, or 
of the ultimate heavens.

denotes this conjunction, 10010, 10011; being consecrated to put on the garments denotes 
Divine Good manifested in Divine Truths, 9999; and not letting the hair of his head go loose 
nor rending his clothes denotes not dispersing good by the dispersion of truths internally or 
externally, 42473, 4763.

11. The high priest not going in to any dead body, nor defiling himself for his father or for his 
mother, denotes that neither is the Lord in His Divine Human, nor the celestial man at all 
contaminated, by hereditary evil and falsity in respect to the Lord, or by the remains of actual 
evil and falsity in respect to man, 9946, 9806, 10130, 3813, 370320.

12. Not going out of the sanctuary nor profaning it denotes that neither shall he who is in good 

like the regenerated celestial man, ever cease to be so; nor shall he on any account, in the 
slightest degree, profane good by separating truth from it, 4144, 3210, 8882, 2001; the crown 
of the anointing oil of his God being upon him denotes victory in the conflict of life, and 
thence the conjunction of truth with good, 9930, 9954; and "I am the Lord" denotes that this 
truth is the perfect expression of good, 2001.

240

13. By taking a wife in her virginity is denoted that the Lord in His glorification is eternally 

conjoined with His church, by the removal from it of all impurity; and that man, in his 
regeneration, is in good and truth conjoined also without impurity, 1468, 3081.

14. A widow denotes good without truth, or truth without good, 9198; one divorced denotes also 
truth without good, 484416; a profane woman a harlot denotes falsified truth, 6348; a virgin 
denotes the church purified from all evil, 3081; and a wife denotes truth conjoined with good, 
and thus the heavenly conjugial partner, 1468.

15. Not profaning his seed among his people denotes that the celestial man shall not profane the 

truth by which the church in its lower degrees is increased and extended, 880, 1259; and "I am 
the Lord who sanctifies him" denotes that the celestial man acts from Divine Good by which 
he is rendered pure and holy, 2001, 8042. 

16. This is evident, because by Jehovah is denoted the Divine Being as to His love, 2001; by 

speaking is denoted influx, 2951; by Moses is represented Divine Truth, or the Word, 7010; 
and by saying is denoted perception, 1791, 1822.

17. By Aaron is denoted the celestial man who is in good, 9946; speaking to him denotes 

instruction by means of Divine Truth, 7304, 7010; by the seed of Aaron are denoted those who
are in truths from good, 880; throughout your generations denotes during the whole course of 
regeneration, 1041; by having a blemish is denoted not as yet made perfect by truths, 7837; 
and not approaching to offer the bread of his God denotes that such cannot fully acknowledge 
that all good is from the Lord by means of Divine Truth, 10042 II., 2165, 2001, 5619.

18. By whatever man he be that has a blemish, is denoted whoever he may be in whom there is 

any defect as to good or truth, 7837; his not approaching denotes that he is hindered from that 
acknowledgement, ver. 17; by a blind man is denoted one in ignorance of truth, 2383; by a 
lame man is denoted one ignorant of good in the natural man, 210, 4302; by a dwarf is denoted
one whose spiritual growth is impeded, 10109 end; and by what is superfluous, or one too tall, 
is denoted one naturally proud of his intellectual powers, 5658, 79843, 581, 583, 16733.

19. By one broken footed is denoted one whose natural affections are perverted, 9163, 2162; and 
by one broken handed is denoted one whose spiritual powers are impeded, 9163, 5328.

20. By hunchback is denoted one whose power of elevating himself to spiritual things is weak, 
69521, 69526 (Luke 13:11-13), 10550; by one bruised is denoted one who is defective in 
applying truths to life, 10303, 431; by one having blemish in his eye is denoted he whose 
intellect is weak, 7837, 2148; by scabby or full of warts is denoted he who is outwardly 
troubled by falsities and evils, 7524; and by being bruised in the testicle is denoted he with 
whom the power of conjoining truth with good is injured, 10303, 431, 2173, 5053, 5060.

It is necessary to observe here that the proofs in the preceding three verses are given according
to the translation of the Hebrew into Latin in 10109, and not according to the English versions,
because there is no doubt that Swedenborg perceived clearly the series of the internal sense, 
on account of his peculiar position as a seer, and thence discerned the meaning of each 
Hebrew term, rendering them into Latin according to such discernment; and as the English 
translation is quite in harmony with the original, the terms have been taken in the order there 
given. Hence, therefore, the expression "a flat nose" disappears, the word "dwarf" taking its 

241

place, and instead of the word "dwarf," as it occurs in our versions, the word "bruised" 
appears; and it is obvious that to give the internal sense as the versions have translated the 
Hebrew, would disturb the true series. It may be remarked also, in justification of 
Swedenborg's Latin translation of the Hebrew, that the word rendered by him "decurtatus," and
by his English translator "dwarf," means, according to the lexicon, "cut off," or "tear" being 
equivalent to "too short," or "shortened," and that the word rendered by him "contusus," which
means bruised or pounded, is shown to mean "beaten or ground small." 

21. By no man of the seed of Aaron the priest is denoted no one who is in good, or in the truth of 
good internal, 9946; by having a blemish is denoted deficient externally, 7837; by coming near
to offer the offerings of the Lord made by fire, is denoted to be capable of fully acknowledging
that all good is from the Lord through Divine Love, 10042 II., 10055; by "he has a blemish" is 
denoted that he is hindered by his defects, 7837; and by his not coming near, to offer the bread
of his God, is denoted that he cannot be conjoined with the Lord as to the external by such 
acknowledgement, 10042 II., 2165,

22. Eating of the bread of his God both the holy and the most holy, denotes that he is indeed able 

to appropriate good internally as to the will and understanding, 2187, 2165, 3210.

23. Not going in to the veil denotes that he is not yet prepared to realize his own inmost good, 
9670; the veil denotes appearances, 2576; not coming near to the altar because he has a 
blemish denotes that he cannot truly worship the Lord until his defect is removed, 4541, 7837; 
"that he profane not my sanctuary" denotes that if that good were manifested he would profane
it, 3210, 9670; and "I am the Lord which sanctify them" denotes that the Lord from His Divine
Good will remove the impediment, because He can sanctify man to the uttermost, 2001, 9229.

24. Moses speaking to Aaron and to his sons, and to all the children of Israel denotes that this is 

the dictate of Divine Truth to the man who is in good of the celestial, of the spiritual, or of the 
ultimate heavens, 7010, 2951, 9946, 4286.

Discussion

This chapter, in the spiritual sense, is very interesting, because it is an amplification of the teaching in 
various parts of the Word, that he who has realized the state of good ought not to return back again to 
the state of truth leading to good, and especially to the states of imperfection from evils and errors 
which appertain to the merely natural man. Or we may consider it as describing the perfect state of 
man, in which he is no longer able, because no longer willing, thus to return. And one great reason for 
this is, that when man is established in good he no more suffers temptations. For we read: "With respect
to combat and victories over the hells, the case is this: Whoever once overcomes them does so 
continually; for by conquering he acquires power over them, since he so far confirms in himself, and 
appropriates to himself the good which is of love and the truth which is of faith, against which the hells
afterwards dare not attempt anything," 82733 Now, as the references show, the priest denotes good, and
those who are in good; and it is concerning such that the Lord says, "Let him that is on the housetop not
go down to take out those things that are in his house: and let him that is in the field not return back to 
take his cloak," and "the sense of these words is, let not him who is in good turn himself from it to 
those things which are of the doctrinals of faith," 58955. Much less, then, should he who is in good turn
himself to the evils and errors signified by the various things mentioned as the causes of defilement. 
But it is said that he may defile himself for certain things which are specified, and in the literal sense 

242

are represented by those near of kin. Now in what way does he who is established in good as the angels
are do this? It is in general by the sincere acknowledgement that of himself he is nothing but evil, and 
particularly by the confession that the hereditary and actual evils of his life remain with him, although 
they are now no longer active but quiescent. They remain, because such is the constitution of a human 
being, that nothing which he has once known, thought, said or done can ever be absolutely obliterated 
from his memory, and because although many persons may have in their memories the same, or similar,
things, no two persons can so have them exactly in the same way. But why not? It is because good in 
every one varies, so that no two persons can ever be exactly alike to eternity, and it is good by which 
truths with man are arranged in order, and from which they have their life, while at the same time truth 
qualifies good, such being their reciprocal action and reaction. And here by truth, for the sake of 
illustration, we may understand knowledge in general, whether it be true or false, and by good we may 
understand affection in general, whether it be good or evil. Human experience, even in this world, 
contributes towards showing the truth of this. For often we remember things which happened long, 
long ago, without any effort to do so, things, indeed, which we thought we had forgotten; and besides 
this, we are assured that of every idle word that man shall speak he shall give an account in the day of 
Judgement (Matt 12:36); in addition to which HH 461-469 may be consulted, with advantage in this 
connection.

But it may be asked if the things of man's life thus remain so that he can perpetually acknowledge 
himself even in heaven that he is nothing but evil thus spiritually defiling himself for his father or his 
mother, his son or his daughter, his brother or his sister, by what law of order is it that still, as a rule, his
evils are quiescent? It is by the universal law that in the other life, through the process of the 
Judgement, the evil and the good are separated, and that on this account also temptations no longer take
place. Hence, then, from these reflections we see in what sense he who is in good, even in heaven, may 
defile himself, and in what sense he cannot do so, vers. 2, 3, 4, ii. But, of course, this first section of our
subject, which refers to the spiritual man in good, and thus in heaven, also refers to the spiritual man on
earth who is in the principle of good, and in this respect the teaching is, on the one hand, that he must 
perpetually acknowledge that of himself he is defiled, by hereditary and actual evil, in their three 
degrees, and on the other, that he must resist in temptations, and not allow himself to indulge in actual 
sin.

The next section, however, is especially interesting, because it is concerning the Lord in his 
glorification, and thence concerning the celestial man of the inmost, or third heaven. We must notice, 
therefore, two things, namely, the difference between the Human of the Lord, as represented by the 
High Priest, and that of an ordinary man as represented by the priests in general, and the difference 
between the celestial man of the inmost heaven, also represented by the High Priest, and the celestial 
man in general represented by the other priests. Now the essential difference between the Human of the
Lord and that of an ordinary man is that the Human of the Lord was Divine by conception and birth, 
whereas the Human of an ordinary man is finite by conception and birth. Hence, the Lord's Human by 
glorification was made Divine also as to the External, or in all fullness, for only that which was 
essentially Divine could be made actually Divine; while no finite Human could be made Divine by any 
process. Also, because the Lord's Human was Divine by conception and birth He had no hereditary evil
internally, nor had He any actual evil; but He had only hereditary evil externally, or from the virgin, His
mother; while an ordinary man has evil by heredity from both his parents, and actual evil besides. And 
these remarks are made in order to show the reason why, in our chapter, the ordinary priest was 
permitted to defile himself for his mother and his father, and his other nearest relations, while the High 
Priest was not allowed to do this. It was to represent that whereas every ordinary man has hereditary 

243

and actual evil remaining with him to eternity, which fact he must acknowledge both during 
regeneration and after it, the Lord entirely separated from Himself, and dispersed the hereditary 
maternal life, by His glorification, because it was not really any part of His proper human life, from 
which He endured temptations, overcame the power of evil, and glorified or made Divine that human 
life even to its ultimates, so that He arose from the dead with the body which He had in the world, 
differently from every ordinary man. Thus He did not defile Himself for His mother or His father, or 
spiritually He had no remains of hereditary falsity or evil.

But we have to consider next the difference between the celestial man of the third heaven, and the 
celestial man in general, also represented, respectively, by the High Priest and the other priests. Could it
be said of the celestial man of the third heaven that he had no remains of hereditary or actual evil? By 
no means; because every man created or born requires regeneration; could not enter heaven without 
regeneration; and could not remain there without the acknowledgement that of himself he is nothing 
but evil, 868. For the Most Ancient people required regeneration, 286; they were troubled by the lusts 
of the unregenerate man, 18; they transmitted evil and its falsity to their posterity who constituted the 
Most Ancient Church in its best state, 125; every member of that church required regeneration, 
therefore, on account of hereditary evil, or of actual evil, and transmitted evil to his children, 151-4; 
and thence this evil accumulated until redemption became necessary. The celestial man of the Most 
Ancient Church, or of the third heaven, therefore, does not differ from the celestial man generally by 
having no hereditary evil, but he differs from him in being regenerated through the will and not through
the understanding, or through good and not through truth, nor does he separate truth from good, 
wherefore it is said of him that he does not go out from the sanctuary, nor profane the sanctuary of his 
God, ver. 12; and when it is said of him that he shall not be defiled for his father or for his mother 
thereby is denoted that he is not contaminated by the remains of hereditary or actual evil or falsity, 
although he is bound to acknowledge that he is nothing but evil of himself equally with the celestial 
man, or the man who is in good generally.

Concerning the last section of this chapter also much might be said by way of illustration in regard to 
each of the spiritual defects enumerated, but we note only three facts. No one can become celestial 
according to his degree, or, in other words, can realize good fully according to his degree, except by 
means of truths; no one who is as yet imperfect can do so; and it is the Lord alone who enables man to 
realize fully his inmost angelic life. For the celestial man, who becomes an angel of the third heaven, 
although regenerated through the will, must be made perfect by means of truths; and the spiritual man 
who becomes an angel of the middle heaven, by first receiving instruction in truths; while much more 
must he who only becomes an angel of the ultimate heaven, depend upon the knowledge of the truth in 
order that he may reach the state of simple obedience which constitutes his heavenly life. Let us then 
continually thank the Lord for the gift of His Word.

Secondly, we see that our defects of character hinder our progress, although they do not hinder our 
gradual appropriation of good. We cannot, for many reasons, fully worship according to our inmost life,
as we journey, for we may be blind and lame, and weak in many and various ways, but we can always, 
spiritually, eat the flesh and drink the blood of our Lord if we abide, and stand firmly, in our adopted 
principles of truth and good.

And thirdly, the Lord is able to make us holy and pure by the removal of our defects, whatever they 
may be, if we let it be our part to wait patiently for Him. For "evil doers shall be cut off; but those that 
wait upon the Lord shall inherit the earth" (Ps 37:9).

Summary of the Spiritual Sense

1. Instruction to those who are in good and in truth thence derived, that they cannot acknowledge 

and worship the Lord when defiled by various impurities, lest they should be guilty of 
profanation, vers. 1-9. 

2. Concerning those who are not qualified to appropriate good, lest there be profanation, vers. 10-

16. 

3. That all worship from good must be perfect by truth, and no worship is acceptable which is 

imperfect on account of some evil or falsity, vers. 17-25. 

4. Further particulars concerning the worship of the Lord in order to avoid profanation, vers. 26-

33. 

The Contents of each Verse

1. And the LORD spoke to Moses, 

1.

saying, 

There is revelation from the Lord by Divine Truth
giving perception,

2. Speak to Aaron and to his sons, that 

they separate themselves from the 
holy things of the children of Israel, 
which they hallow to me, and that 
they profane not my holy name: I am
the LORD. 

2. With instruction to those who are in celestial and 
spiritual good, that they cannot but be separated 
from the worship of the Lord and its ministry with
the man of the Spiritual Church, when impure, 
lest they should profane; since celestial and 
spiritual good and truth are the expression of 
Divine Good.

3. Say to them, Whosoever he be of all 

3. And hence the celestial man and the spiritual man

your seed throughout your 
generations, that approaches to the 
holy things, which the children of 
Israel hallow to the LORD, having his
uncleanness upon him, that soul shall
be cut off from before me: I am the 
LORD. 

4. What man soever of the seed of 

4.

Aaron is a leper, or has an issue; he 
shall not eat of the holy things, until 
he be clean. And whoso touches any 
thing that is unclean by the dead, or 
a man whose seed goes from him; 

perceive that whoever would approach the Lord 
in genuine worship, by the acknowledgement that 
all good and truth and holiness are from Him, and
yet profanes by doing this from selfish motives, is
thereby separated from good and truth, and thus 
from the Lord, who is their origin.

For he who thus profanes the truth externally or 
internally, because he is in the affection thereof 
from good, cannot appropriate good until he 
ceases to act from selfish motives in worship; and
even the slightest contact with merely ceremonial 
worship, in which there is no spiritual life, or with
worship from the affection of truth separated from
good;

246

5. Or whoever touches any creeping 

5. Or with merely sensual delight whereby is 

thing, whereby he may be made 
unclean, or a man of whom he may 
take uncleanness, whatever 
uncleanness he has; 

impurity; or with any evil which tends to impurity
of whatever kind,

6. The soul which touches any such 

6.

shall be unclean until the even, and 
shall not eat of the holy things, 
unless he bathe his flesh in water. 

Such conduct renders a man impure until a 
change of state; and he cannot appropriate good 
until he is purified by the truth in the work of 
repentance.

7. And when the sun is down, he shall 
be clean; and afterward he shall eat 
of the holy things, because it is his 
bread. 

8. That which dies of itself, or is torn of
beasts, he shall not eat to defile 
himself therewith: I am the LORD. 

9. They shall therefore keep my charge,
lest they bear sin for it, and die 
therein, if they profane it: I am the 
LORD which sanctify them. 

7.

8.

9.

10. There shall no stranger eat of the 

10.

holy thing: a sojourner of the priest's,
or an hired servant, shall not eat of 
the holy thing. 

But when that state is passed by the rejection of 
selfish love, a person is pure; and he will then 
appropriate good, because it is his ruling delight, 
and can alone support his spiritual life.

But good that is merely natural, or such as is 
mixed with evil unconsciously, he may not 
appropriate, because it renders him impure; his 
good must be wholly from the Lord.

Let the man of the church, therefore, worship 
from internal good and truth conjoined with 
external, lest he should lapse into evil, and be 
vastated on account of profanation; for good from
the Lord is that which alone makes man holy.

It is impossible for one who is out of the church 
to appropriate good which is holy, or for the 
merely natural man to do so; nor can he who is in 
merely natural knowledge within the church, or 
who does what is right for the sake of gain do so.

11. But if a priest buy any soul, the 

11. But if a man is redeemed from sin by a life of 

purchase of his money, he shall eat 
of it; and such as are born in his 
house, they shall eat of his bread. 

12. And if a priest's daughter be married 
to a stranger, she shall not eat of the 
heave offering of the holy things. 

good through obedience to the truth, he will then 
be able to appropriate good; and all who are in 
good internally, will be able to appropriate good 
externally.

12. And if any one is in the affection of good, derived

from the Lord, internally, and yet profanes that 
affection by conjoining it with the evil of selfish 
love, it will be impossible for such to appropriate 
good, which is perceived to be from the Lord.

247

13. But if a priest's daughter be a widow,
or divorced, and have no child, and 
is returned to her father's house, as in
her youth, she shall eat of her 
father's bread: but there shall no 
stranger eat thereof. 

13. But if any one in the affection of good be without 
truth or good, and unproductive of either, and yet 
there is internal association with good, as in the 
beginning of regeneration, good may still be 
appropriated; but merely natural affection cannot 
appropriate good.

14. And if a man eat of the holy thing 
unwittingly, then he shall put the 
fifth part thereof to it, and shall give 
to the priest the holy thing. 

14. Also if any one, from ignorance or inadvertence, 
profanes holy good, he must make restitution by 
the acknowledgement that he is, of himself, 
without remains of good, and that he receives 
good from the Lord.

15. And they shall not profane the holy 
things of the children of Israel, 
which they offer to the LORD; 

15. And no one, who is in good, ought to profane it 
by ascribing to himself what ought to be wholly 
ascribed to the Lord;

16. And so cause them to bear the 

16. For by so doing he brings upon himself a state of 

iniquity that brings guilt, when they 
eat their holy things: for I am the 
LORD which sanctify them. 

evil for which he is responsible, and vitiates his 
reception of good; and it must therefore be 
sincerely acknowledged that all good which 
renders man holy is from the Lord.

17. And the LORD spoke to Moses, 

17. Further, there is revelation from the Lord by 

saying, 

Divine Truth giving perception,

18. Speak to Aaron, and to his sons, and 
to all the children of Israel, and say 
to them, Whosoever he be of the 
house of Israel, or of the strangers in 
Israel, that offers his oblation, 
whether it be any of their vows, or 
any of their freewill offerings, which
they offer to the LORD for a burnt 
offering; 

18. To those who are in celestial, spiritual, and natural
good, that every one, whether he be of the internal
or external church, who worships the Lord in 
freedom, with a view to the removal of evil, or 
from a feeling of gratitude, and yet inwardly has a
desire to devote himself wholly to the Lord;

19. That you may be accepted, you shall
offer a male without blemish, of the 
beeves, of the sheep, or of the goats. 

19.

In order that his worship may be acceptable to the
Lord, it must be free from any selfish or worldly 
motive; as to natural good; as to spiritual good; or
as to the good of faith.

20. But whatever has a blemish, that 

20. But if it be contaminated with selfishness or 

shall you not offer: for it shall not be
acceptable for you. 

worldliness, it cannot be accepted.

248

21. And whoever offereth a sacrifice of 
peace offerings to the LORD to 
accomplish a vow, or for a freewill 
offering, of the herd or of the flock, 
it shall be perfect to be accepted; 
there shall be no blemish therein. 

21. And he who would worship the Lord from 

freedom, so that thus the external man may be in 
harmony with the internal, both as to the will and 
understanding, or from love and from submission 
to the Divine Providence, as to the natural 
affections, or as to the spiritual, this worship must
be perfect, and without an admixture of selfish or 
worldly motives.

22. Blind, or broken, or maimed, or 
having a discharge, or scurvy, or 
scabbed, you shall not offer these to 
the LORD, nor make an offering by 
fire of them upon the altar to the 
LORD. 

22. For the worship of the Lord ought not to be from 
ignorance, or from imperfect affections of the 
understanding or will, or from natural affections 
corrupted by sensual, worldly, or selfish defects, 
for these cannot be consecrated wholly to the 
Lord, or be fully devoted to the service of man.

23. Either a bullock or a lamb that has 
any thing superfluous or lacking in 
his parts, that may you offer for a 
freewill offering; but for a vow it 
shall not be accepted. 

24. That which has its stones bruised, or 
crushed, or broken, or cut, you shall 
not offer to the LORD; neither shall 
you do thus in your land. 

25. Neither from the hand of a foreigner 
shall you offer the bread of your God
of any of these; because their 
corruption is in them, there is a 
blemish in them: they shall not be 
accepted for you. 

23. But external or internal affections grounded in 
innocence, although imperfect, may yet be 
devoted to the Lord when worship is from 
freedom; but such worship is not acceptable if it 
be confirmed by the understanding and will 
together.

24. And that affection which is impure or unholy, 

internally or externally through the violation of 
the heavenly marriage of love and wisdom, 
goodness and truth, charity and faith, or affection 
and intelligence, cannot be consecrated to the 
worship of the Lord internally or externally.

25. And neither is it in the power of merely natural 
love of any kind to promote the true worship of 
the Lord, because they are impure both in feeling 
and thought, and they cannot, therefore, give 
conjunction with the Lord.

26. And the LORD spoke to Moses, 

26. Further, there is revelation from the Lord by 

saying, 

Divine Truth giving perception,

27. When a bullock, or a sheep, or a 

27. That every incipient natural affection, or spiritual 

goat, is brought forth, then it shall be
seven days under the dam; and from 
the eighth day and thenceforth it 
shall be accepted for the oblation of 
an offering made by fire to the 
LORD. 

affection, or affection of truth, is to be purified 
through the operation of the principle of good in 
the church; and that then in the new state 
following, it shall be devoted to the service of the 
Lord in genuine spiritual worship.

28. And whether it be cow or ewe, you

shall not kill it and her young both in
one day. 

man, the good of the former is not to be 
commingled with the good of the latter, but the 
state of new spiritual life must succeed the former
state.

29. And when you sacrifice a sacrifice of
thanksgiving to the LORD, you shall 
sacrifice it that you may be accepted.

29. Also in all the free worship of the Lord from a 

spirit of gratitude, there must be the conjunction 
of the external with the internal man;

30. On the same day it shall be eaten; 
you shall leave none of it until the 
morning: I am the LORD. 

30. The appropriation of the good thereof must be 

only in that preparatory state; nor shall any selfish
or worldly motive corrupt it; for only pure 
affections are to be ascribed to the Lord, because 
they come from Him.

31. Therefore shall you keep my 

commandments, and do them: I am 
the LORD. 

31. And, indeed, true worship is by obedience to the 
Divine Commandments, internally and externally,
by the help of the Lord.

32. And you shall not profane my holy 
name; but I will be hallowed among 
the children of Israel: I am the LORD 
which hallow you, 

33. That brought you out of the land of 
Egypt, to be your God: I am the 
LORD. 

32. Nor is Divine Truth from the Lord to be ascribed 

to self, and thus profaned; but the true spiritual 
man must be holy both inwardly and outwardly; 
and all holiness is through the internal man from 
the Lord,

33. And is communicated to man through the work of
redemption, by actual deliverance from evil in 
each particular case, through the reception of 
Divine Truth and the conflict of temptations; and 
thus is man enabled to acknowledge the Lord as 
Divine Love manifested.

Love manifested, 2001.

Discussion

It is necessary, in beginning to reflect upon what is now before us, to have a clear idea of what is meant
spiritually by "the holy things of the children of Israel which they hallow to me." It is said, in the series,
to mean the worship of the Lord, and the ministry of such worship; but what was offered to the Lord by
the Israelites really represented the good affections which man, in worship, devotes to the service of the
Lord, and acknowledges to be from the Lord. For all real worship consists in such devotion and such 
acknowledgement; and then the ministry of such worship is the external form which it takes, both in the
performance of the uses which those good affections are intended to perform, and in the 
acknowledgement and worship of the Lord in the sanctuary. Hence, then, by the priests separating 
themselves from the holy things is strictly meant that in the performance of uses, and among those in 
public worship, any selfish motive which presents itself is to be carefully separated and rejected, this, 
of course, applying, not to the ministers of religion merely, but to every member of his congregation. 

254

This teaching, therefore, is very weighty teaching indeed, and is worthy of very serious consideration. 
For when we allow selfish motives to get mixed with the uses we perform, or with our worship, we 
then have our "uncleanness" upon us; and every one may know from experience how very apt he is to 
be troubled by selfish thoughts, more or less, in everything he does or says. And also we all know that 
if we indulge in and encourage these selfish feelings and thoughts we realty, just so far, are "cut off" or 
separated from the Divine presence.

But several things are mentioned which constitute such impurity as prevents man in worship from 
appropriating good and truth thence, which is signified by eating the holy things. These are leprosy, 
which, as we have seen, denotes the profanation of truth by applying it to selfish purposes externally; 
an issue, which signifies evil thoughts flowing from evil affections, and in this connection, because said
of one representing worship from good, profanation internally; what is unclean by contact with a dead 
body or carcase, which denotes affection void of spiritual life, that is, without love; one whose seed 
goes from him, as representing truth separated from good; a creeping thing, as denoting what is merely 
sensual; that which dies of itself, which signifies affection merely natural which rejects good and truth; 
and what is torn of beasts, which denotes what is mixed with evil unconsciously. And it is easy to see 
that all these do prevent the spiritual man from receiving the Lord's life of good and truth; for we 
cannot properly worship and appropriate good and at the same time be contaminated with such things 
voluntarily; and if it is done involuntarily, that purification through sincere repentance, which is 
represented by washing, must follow. But here two things are to be very carefully noticed. Even after 
repentance, although this may appear paradoxical, a man is not wholly pure, as it is said, until even, 
that is, in the full sense, until his Judgement takes place, and the tares in him are separated from the 
wheat; and the reason why this is so is lest by a too sudden and violent removal of errors and their 
stimulating evils, good itself may be destroyed or suffer serious injury (Matt 13:29). And secondly, 
there must be, even during regeneration, and finally in the Judgement, that rejection of selfish love 
which is denoted by the sun going down. For while in one sense the going down of the sun signifies the
decline of love to the Lord, in the other it denotes the passing away of selfish love. But it may be 
thought or said, "Can a person really cease to love himself, or to act from his own proper life?" And we
must reply that this is not necessary, and would, in fact, be injurious, since the church is formed in the 
vivified proprium of man, and he could not otherwise reciprocate the Lord's love for him; he must, 
therefore, act as from himself, and, indeed, properly value his genuine spiritual heavenly function or 
use; but he can only do this by ceasing to be selfish in everything that he undertakes. It is not, therefore,
the proper love of self that is the cause of all evil, but the perversion of it which is rightly called 
selfishness. And the truth of this view of the matter is strongly shown both in the literal and spiritual 
senses of the words, "They shall therefore keep my charge, lest they bear sin for it, and die therein if 
they profane it." It is a grand thing for us all that we must continually feel ourselves responsible for the 
proper use of the life which the Lord gives us.

In the next place it is to be observed that simply reading over the series of the spiritual sense of what 
now follows in the new period is sufficient in itself to show the great importance of the teaching that, 
so to speak, naturally arises in each sentence from the correspondences occurring. One out of the 
church may be capable of regeneration and of the appropriation of good, but yet he cannot advance, nor
can his natural good become spiritual; nor can he who is only under instruction within the church do 
this, for both of these may not, as yet, have come into the proper exercise of the new will of good 
which is so essential to man's co-operation with the Lord. But the two cases that come next are very 
different, and we cannot fail to see their truth. We may note also the serious character of the following 
case. For this is a state of confirmed profanation. And it ought to have a very powerful influence upon 

255

every member of the church who has made some advance in the regenerate life so as to be in the 
affection of good, lest he might become a profaner as here described. But the case is different with one 
in the affection of good who is yet without the knowledge of good or truth, and the reason for it is 
obvious; and we may easily understand also how an error may be remedied by the acknowledgement of
the Lord from a state of good through remains, as is described in the last instance given. But how do 
we, at any time, appropriate the holy thing unwittingly? We do so many times in our lives by being 
brought providentially under heavenly influences without any direct seeking on our part, as, for 
example, when we are reading a story it may be only for amusement, and something therein affects us 
by inspiring us with a good feeling or thought we did not anticipate, and which is stored up in our 
minds as remains afterwards to be implanted in our regenerated natural man when the right time or 
state comes. Let us reflect well, therefore, on those experiences, and gather strength from their 
remembrance in our serious conflicts and in the steady labours of our daily lives.

From a careful study of the following section two general and practical truths may be still more fully 
confirmed. First, in order to worship the Lord acceptably, that worship must not only be from good, or 
with affection, but it must be by means of truth; and this is signified by the oblation being a male; and 
secondly, it must be free from contamination by evils and falsities, this being denoted by its having no 
blemish. And, moreover, these general laws refer to the full consecration of the internal man to the 
Lord, which is denoted by a burnt offering, as well as to the devotion of the external man as to will and 
understanding in the same way, which is signified by vows and freewill offerings. And then the specific
kinds of blemishes, or of falsities and evils, are worthy of attention. For there are six, the first three 
referring to the spiritual degree of the mind, and the other three to the natural degree. For to be blind, 
broken or maimed are more serious bodily troubles than to have sores, the scurvy or the scab, and 
consequently the former signify more serious spiritual defects than the latter, although these are bad 
enough. And who does not see at once from common perception, as well as from the mention of all 
these things in other parts of the Word, their natural correspondence? For surely an ignorant man, who 
is like one blind; a man whose affections are imperfect, who is like one broken; and one who not 
having these defects, but yet being unable to make progress in spiritual life, or to exhibit his knowledge
or affection in his actions, who is like one lame, cannot acceptably worship the Lord! And so neither 
can he who, being enlightened internally and well disposed, and with no want of vigour, yet allows his 
merely natural affections, which may be compared to sores or a discharge; his merely sensual powers, 
which resemble the scurvy; or his merely corporeal delights, which may be compared to the scab, do 
so. We see that all this is true, and we feel bound, therefore, to heed well the Word in its internal sense 
as here set before us.

But now the next verse has a qualification which is not to be overlooked. Where there is defective 
worship proceeding from the heart, and thus free, which is accompanied by innocence external or 
internal, denoted by the bullock or the lamb respectively, that worship is taken as if it were perfect. But 
if it is confirmed by the understanding as well, it cannot be acceptable. And we see the reasonableness 
of this. A vow, in the best sense, of course, means the determination of the understanding from the will, 
or, in other words, a willingness that the Lord may provide, but here, as being connected with imperfect
worship, it signifies that worship confirmed by the understanding. But see 388o9, and observe that in 
the quotations from the Word confession refers to the will, and vows to the understanding. And with 
regard to the other two verses of the section, what has already been said concerning the heavenly 
marriage, and here concerning a blemish, is sufficiently illustrative.

And now suppose we for a moment consider only the literal sense of the rest of this description. Then it
is not easy to conceive why, on the birth of a certain animal to be sacrificed, it should remain exactly 

256

seven days under its dam, and not more nor less; why it might be offered on the eighth day in 
particular; and why a sacrifice of thanksgiving was to be eaten on the day when it was offered, and not 
on the next day; while also it seems strange that the children of Israel should be required to hallow and 
worship the Divine Being principally on account of their deliverance from Egyptian bondage. But 
when we are able, by the aid of the correspondences, and by enlightenment from the Lord, to enter into 
the internal sense, then we can understand why such particular directions were given even by the Lord 
Himself. It was in order that the Word might be written as it is for the benefit of the Spiritual Church 
which was to succeed the representative of a church in future ages. For the seven days denote the holy 
state of regeneration, and the eighth day the new state which succeeds; the mother and her young not 
being killed in one day denotes that the successive states of man's life ought not to be confused; the 
sacrifice of thanksgiving being eaten on the day in which it was offered, and none of it being left until 
the morning, signify that worship from gratitude should be conjoined with worship from love, and 
should not be contaminated with selfish love; and keeping the Lord's commandments, and not 
profaning His name, but hallowing Him, because of deliverance from Egyptian bondage, denote that 
obedience to the Lord with the holy states involved therein is to be because of deliverance from the 
bondage of the merely natural life, and consequent eternal conjunction with Him by love. But with 
regard to worship from gratitude, chap. vii. may also be reconsidered with advantage, as well as the 
commentary that follows it.

truth conjoined with good, purification, and the arrangement of truths under good, vers. 4-8. 

3. The second subordinate state is that of the implantation of truth in good, vers. 9-22. 
4. Concerning revelation in consequence, vers. 23-25. 
5. Also concerning the plenary removal of evil in consequence, vers. 26-32.

The Contents of each Verse

1. And the LORD spoke to Moses, 

1. There is revelation from the Lord by Divine Truth 

saying, 

giving the perception,

2.

3.

4.

5.

Speak to the children of Israel, and 
say to them, The set feasts of the 
LORD, which you shall proclaim to 
be holy convocations, even these 
are my set feasts. 

2. And instruction to the man of the Spiritual Church 
from which he discerns the successive general 
states of the regenerate life, under which particular
states are arranged and governed from Divine 
Order.

Six days shall work be done: but on 
the seventh day is a Sabbath of 
solemn rest, an holy convocation; 
you shall do no manner of work: it 
is a Sabbath to the LORD in all your 
dwellings. 

3. But states of conflict against evil must precede, 

and be followed by states of rest and peace in 
general; in which all truths are arranged in order 
from good; neither shall man then act from selfish 
motives, nor endure temptations, good being freely
and joyfully received from the Lord, even as to 
every particular state.

These are the set feasts of the LORD,
even holy convocations, which you 
shall proclaim in their appointed 
season. 

4. And the general state involves those which are 

subordinate, in which also there is an arrangement 
of truths under good, and which man realizes in 
orderly succession.

In the first month, on the fourteenth 
day of the month at even, is the 
LORD's passover. 

5. And the first subordinate state is one of 

deliverance from evil by the Lord, in which the 
state of faith from love is predominant, and is 
accompanied by a state of holiness, through 
submission to Divine Truth both as to the will and 
understanding.

258

6. And on the fifteenth day of the same
month is the feast of unleavened 
bread to the LORD: seven days you 
shall eat unleavened bread. 

6. And then immediately follows, in that new state, 
purification from falsities, and thus a further state 
of holiness in consequence thereof, with the 
appropriation of good accordingly.

7.

8.

In the first day you shall have an 
holy convocation: you shall do no 
servile work. 

7. And therein the knowledges of truth are first 

arranged under good, during which there is no 
temptation.

But you shall offer an offering made
by fire to the LORD seven days: in 
the seventh day is an holy 
convocation; you shall do no servile
work. 

8. And the Lord is then acknowledged freely from 
good, and continually, the result of which is a 
more perfect arrangement of truths, and still 
greater freedom from temptation.

9. And the LORD spoke to Moses, 

9. Again, there is revelation from the Lord by Divine 

saying, 

Truth giving the perception,

10. Speak to the children of Israel, and 
say to them, When you be come 
into the land which I give to you, 
and shall reap the harvest thereof, 
then you shall bring the sheaf of the 
firstfruits of your harvest to the 
priest: 

10. Through influx and instruction to the man of the 

Spiritual Church, that when truths are beginning to
be implanted in good, in the second subordinate 
state of the regenerate life, then are they collected 
together in order from a principle of willing 
obedience, which is acknowledged to be from the 
Lord.

11. And he shall wave the sheaf before 

the LORD, to be accepted for you: 
on the morrow after the Sabbath the 
priest shall wave it. 

11. And consequently, from good, the spiritual life of 
man is vivified; his worship is grateful and 
acceptable to the Lord; and is involved in a state of
holy rest and peace which is perpetual.

12. And in the day when you wave the 
sheaf, you shall offer a he-lamb 
without blemish of the first year for 
a burnt offering to the LORD. 

12. And in this initiatory state of good, the Lord is 

worshiped from a state of innocence, wherein truth
is acknowledged as the receptacle of good; all 
falsity and evil are removed; and there is fullness 
of consecration to the service of the Lord.

13. And the meal offering thereof shall 

13. And in this state there is included the interior 

be two tenth parts of an ephah of 
fine flour mingled with oil, an 
offering made by fire to the LORD 
for a sweet savour: and the drink 
offering thereof shall be of wine, the
fourth part of an hin. 

reception of good conjoined with truth in fullness 
through remains, this being effected by the 
operation of pure love from the Lord, a sphere of 
rest and peace thence flowing and manifesting 
itself externally; and also there is an exterior state 
of truth conjoined with good in the understanding, 
whereby doctrine is elevated and begins to be 
spiritual.

259

14. And you shall eat neither bread, nor 

14. For neither can good be appropriated internally, 

parched corn, nor fresh ears, until 
this selfsame day, until you have 
brought the oblation of your God: it 
is a statute for ever throughout your 
generations in all your dwellings. 

15. And you shall count to you from the
morrow after the Sabbath, from the 
day that you brought the sheaf of 
the wave offering; seven sabbaths 
shall there be complete: 

16. Even to the morrow after the 

seventh Sabbath shall you number 
fifty days; and you shall offer a new
meal offering to the LORD. 

17. You shall bring out of your 

habitations two wave loaves of two 
tenth parts of an ephah: they shall 
be of fine flour, they shall be baked 
with leaven, for first-fruits to the 
LORD. 

18. And you shall present with the 

bread seven lambs without blemish 
of the first year, and one young 
bullock, and two rams: they shall be
a burnt offering to the LORD, with 
their meal offering, and their drink 
offerings, even an offering made by 
fire, of a sweet savour to the LORD. 

nor the affection of good and truth externally, until
this initiatory state of good takes place, when the 
Lord is first truly acknowledged, which is the 
external basis for the continual progress of 
regeneration, and for the reception of spiritual life, 
as to its particulars, to eternity.

15. And the quality of this advancing state of the 
implantation of truth in good is perpetual and 
successive from the state of the initiation and 
vivification thereof by holy obedience to a further 
state of victory over evil and error resulting in one 
of rest and peace,

16. Which involves perpetual advancement, not only 
internally as to good, but externally as to a full 
state of truths for implantation, and of interior 
good conjoined with truth into which such 
implantation takes place; and thus the Lord is more
fully acknowledged in a new state of worship.

17. And then, indeed, man perceives that, as from 
himself, he acts from the affection of good 
conjoined with truth vivified by the Lord through 
remains; that there is a pure state of truth from 
good in the understanding; that it has been 
acquired through victory in temptations; and that it
is an advancement towards the realization of good 
through the love of truth.

18. And now, therefore, the Lord is acknowledged 
from the operation of inmost good celestial, 
involving a holy state of innocence in fullness and 
free from falsity, and also the good of innocence in
the external and internal man by co-operation and 
conjunction with the Lord, and thus full 
sanctification by that conjunction, both as to good 
and truth, and as to exterior truth and good, all 
acknowledged to be from the Lord through his 
pure love for man, and resulting in a further state 
of rest and peace.

260

19. And you shall offer one he-goat for 
a sin offering, and two he-lambs of 
the first year for a sacrifice of peace
offerings. 

20. And the priest shall wave them with
the bread of the firstfruits for a 
wave offering before the LORD, 
with the two lambs: they shall be 
holy to the LORD for the priest. 

21. And you shall make proclamation 
on the selfsame day; there shall be 
an holy convocation to you: you 
shall do no servile work: it is a 
statute for ever in all your dwellings
throughout your generations. 

22. And when you reap the harvest of 

your land, you shall not wholly reap
the corners of your field, neither 
shall you gather the gleaning of 
your harvest: you shall leave them 
for the poor, and for the stranger: I 
am the LORD your God. 

19. And besides this, there is the acknowledgement, in

this state, that all evil and falsity are removed by 
the Lord; and that all the good of innocence is 
received from Him, in the truth thereof, in fullness 
in the internal and external man, so that the Lord is
worshiped in perfect freedom.

20. And thus the whole life of man is vivified from the

Lord, as to good internally, and as to good 
externally from the state of the first implantation 
of truth in good to its completion; and the Lord is 
sincerely acknowledged to be the source of all 
good.

21. And consequently, there is full revelation from the 

Lord in that state, a perfect arrangement of truths 
under good, and the cessation of temptations with 
all disposition to act from selfish and worldly 
motives in the worship of the Lord.

22. And now, therefore, when truth is implanted in 
good, it is no longer appropriated to selfish 
purposes in its ultimate expression with full power,
internally; nor is that good to be contaminated with
selfish motives externally; on the contrary they are
ascribed to the Lord in works of charity and faith 
from charity, and this without any selfish or 
worldly motive.

23. And the LORD spoke to Moses, 

23. Further, there is revelation from the Lord by 

saying, 

Divine Truth giving the perception,

24. Speak to the children of Israel, 

saying, In the seventh month, in the 
first day of the month, shall be a 
solemn rest to you, a memorial of 
blowing of trumpets, an holy 
convocation. 

24. And instruction to the man of the Spiritual Church 
from which he perceives, that when the state of 
faith, or the state of truth leading to good, is at its 
close by the implantation of truth in good, a state 
of holy peace follows, with revelation from the 
Lord, and a rearrangement of truths under good.

25. You shall do no servile work: and 

25. And consequently the cessation of spiritual 

you shall offer an offering made by 
fire to the LORD. 

conflict, and of action from selfish and worldly 
love; and at the same time there is the worship of 
the Lord from pure heavenly love.

26. And the LORD spoke to Moses, 

26. And again, there is revelation from the Lord by 

saying, 

Divine Truth giving the perception,

261

27. Howbeit on the tenth day of this 
seventh month is the day of 
atonement: it shall be an holy 
convocation to you, and you shall 
afflict your souls; and you shall 
offer an offering made by fire to the 
LORD. 

27. That when truth is implanted, in good, there is also
a plenary removal of evil, together with the 
rearrangement of truths under good, and 
confession that man of himself is nothing but evil, 
but that, from the Lord, he is enabled to worship 
Him from pure love.

28. And you shall do no manner of 

work in that same day: for it is a day
of atonement, to make atonement 
for you before the LORD your God. 

28. And, therefore, no temptations are to be endured in
that state, because it is the reconciliation of the 
external man with the internal, from the Lord, both
as to good and truth,

29. For whatever soul it be that shall not
be afflicted in that same day, he 
shall be cut off from his people. 

29. But if in that state any one is not disposed to 

acknowledge that man of himself is nothing but 
evil, he must be, en that account, separated from 
the church for the time being.

30. And whatever soul it be that does 
any manner of work in that same 
day, that soul will I destroy from 
among his people. 

30. Also if any one in that state of the church in 

general, engages in spiritual conflict, or acts from 
worldly and selfish motives, he must needs be 
separated.

31. You shall do no manner of work: it 
is a statute for ever throughout your 
generations in all your dwellings. 

32.

It shall be to you a Sabbath of 
solemn rest, and you shall afflict 
your souls: in the ninth day of the 
month at even, from even to even, 
shall you keep your Sabbath. 

31. For man, in the progress of regeneration, ought not
to act from selfish and worldly motives, and this is
true both as to the external and internal man, and 
also as to every particular state.

32. And in this state there is a foretaste of heavenly 

rest and peace, and the sincere acknowledgement 
that man of himself is nothing but evil; and this is 
effected when the conjunction of faith with charity
is about to take place in the obscurity arising out of
a change from a former state to a new state; for 
states of obscurity must precede states of rest and 
peace in the Lord.

33. And the LORD spoke to Moses, 

33. And further there is revelation from the Lord by 

saying, 

Divine Truth giving the perception,

34. Speak to the children of Israel, 

saying, On the fifteenth day of this 
seventh month is the feast of 
tabernacles for seven days to the 
LORD. 

34. And instruction to the man of the Spiritual Church 
from which he perceives, that a new state must 
follow the implantation of truth in good which is 
the implantation of good in truth, and is the 
culmination of the work of regeneration from the 
Lord.

262

35. On the first day shall be an holy 

convocation: you shall do no servile
work. 

35. And hence there is a new arrangement of truths 
under good, and the end of temptations with the 
final rejection of every selfish and worldly motive,

36. Seven days you shall offer an 

offering made by fire to the LORD: 
on the eighth day shall be an holy 
convocation to you; and you shall 
offer an offering made by fire to the 
LORD: it is a solemn assembly; you 
shall do no servile work. 

36. Involving a holy state of the worship of the Lord 
from pure love; a rearrangement of truths under 
good in that new state; of such holy worship as to 
the understanding as well as the will; and also an 
orderly arrangement of truths under good in the 
external man, with the rejection of selfish and 
worldly motives even there also.

37. These are the set feasts of the LORD,
which you shall proclaim to be holy 
convocations, to offer an offering 
made by fire to the LORD, a burnt 
offering, and a meal offering, a 
sacrifice, and drink offerings, each 
on its own day: 

37. And these are the general subordinate states of the 
appropriation of good in regeneration involved in 
the most general or universal state, which occur 
according to order with every one, and in which a 
new arrangement of truths takes place for the 
worship of the Lord from pure love by full 
consecration; for the appropriation of interior good
by acknowledgement of the Lord; and for the 
appropriation of spiritual truth according to the 
state;

38. Beside the sabbaths of the LORD, 

38. Besides the most general or universal state; the 

and beside your gifts, and beside all 
your vows, and beside all your 
freewill offerings, which you give 
to the LORD. 

acknowledgement that good is from the Lord; that 
man may be confirmed in truths; and that the 
worship of the Lord must be altogether from a 
state of freedom in ascribing all good to Him.

39. Howbeit on the fifteenth day of the 
seventh month, when you have 
gathered in the fruits of the land, 
you shall keep the feast of the LORD
seven days: on the first day shall be 
a solemn rest, and on the eighth day 
shall be a solemn rest. 

39. And therefore in this final new state of the fullness
of faith conjoined with charity, when these are 
made fruitful in good works there is gladness and 
joy of heart in all completeness and holiness, with 
states of peace and rest from the lowest principles 
to the highest which are perpetually renewed.

40. And you shall take you on the first 
day the fruit of goodly trees, 
branches of palm trees, and boughs 
of thick trees, and willows of the 
brook; and you shall rejoice before 
the Lord your God seven days. 

40. And therefore also, in. this state, there is the 

enjoyment of all kinds of good from truths, namely
from spiritual, rational, natural, and sensual truths; 
and also a full and holy state of rejoicing in the 
Lord from the heart and the understanding 
combined.

263

41. And you shall keep it a feast to the 
LORD seven days in the year: it is a 
statute for ever in your generations: 
you shall keep it in the seventh 
month. 

41. And this state shall be a perpetual holy state with 
the regenerated man, both as to Externals and as to
Internals; yea, it is the culmination of the states of 
regeneration, commencing from acknowledgement
by faith, and ending in enjoyment from love.

42. You shall dwell in booths seven 
days; all that are native in Israel 
shall dwell in booths: 

43. That your generations may know 

that I made the children of Israel to 
dwell in booths, when I brought 
them out of the land of Egypt: I am 
the LORD your God. 

44. And Moses declared to the children 
of Israel the set feasts of the LORD. 

42. And this, indeed, is the celestial state of the man of

the church of every degree, that is, of the man of 
the internal church and of the external, who is 
established in good.

43. And thus every one may know that the holy state 
of good from the Lord appertains to the man of the
Spiritual Church, when he is delivered by Him 
from the bondage of the merely natural man, so 
that he acknowledges Him in heart and 
understanding, by the conjunction of good and 
truth to eternity.

44. And it is of the Divine Providence that revelation 

is made concerning this holy process of 
regeneration, in which good is appropriated with 
joy and gladness — in the Word.

arrangement under generals.

speaking is denoted influx, 2951; by Moses is represented Divine Truth, or the Word, 7010; 
and by saying is denoted perception, 1791, 1822.

24. Speaking to the children of Israel and saying, denotes instruction to the man of the Spiritual 

Church from which he perceives, 10355, 3654, 1791, 1822; in the seventh month, on the first 
day of the month being a solemn rest, denotes when the advancing state of faith, or the state of
truth leading to good, is at its close by the implantation of truth in good, 851, 893, 894; a 
solemn rest or Sabbath denotes a state of holy peace following, 851; a memorial of blowing 
trumpets denotes revelation from the Lord, 8802, 8815, 6888, 8620; and a holy convocation 
denotes the rearrangement of truths under good, 7891.

267

25. Doing no servile work denotes the cessation of spiritual conflict, and of action from selfish 
and worldly love, 8888, 8890; and an offering made by fire to the Lord denotes at the same 
time the worship of the Lord from pure heavenly love, 10055.

26. This is evident, because by Jehovah is denoted the Divine Being as to His love, 2001; by 

speaking is denoted influx, 2951; by Moses is represented Divine Truth, or the Word, 7010; 
and by saying is denoted perception, 1791, 1822.

27. The tenth day of the seventh month being the day of atonement, denotes that, when truth is 
implanted in good, there is also a plenary removal of evil, 2075, 10042 III.; it being a holy 
convocation denotes the rearrangement of truths under good, 7891; afflicting the soul denotes 
the confession that man of himself is nothing but evil, 1937, 1947; and an offering made by 
fire to the Lord denotes that, from the Lord, man is enabled to worship from pure love, 10055.

Observe here that, in the references given, afflicting the soul is shown to mean self-
compulsion; but nevertheless it is obvious that this self-compulsion carries with it, as a 
preliminary, the confession that man of himself is nothing but evil, and can only do good from 
the Lord by keeping His commandments as from himself. Thus, then, the expression "you 
shall afflict your souls" involves, in the internal sense, the confession that man of himself is 
nothing but evil; and it also involves the true humility spoken of in 19371, without which man 
cannot properly make the confession.

28. Not doing any manner of work on that same day denotes that therefore no temptations are to 
be endured in that state, 8888, 8890; and it being a clay of atonement to make atonement for 
you before the Lord your God, denotes that it is the reconciliation of the external man with the
internal, from the Lord, both as to good and truth, 10042 III., 683, 2001.

29. Whatsoever soul not being afflicted on that day being cut off from his people, denotes that if in
that state any one is not disposed to acknowledge that man of himself is nothing but evil, he 
must be, on that account, separated from the church for the time being, 1937, 1947, 10042 
777., 5302, 1259.

30. Whatsoever soul doing any manner of work on that day being destroyed from among his 

people, denotes that if any one in that state of the church in general engages in spiritual 
conflict, or acts from worldly and selfish motives, he must needs be separated, 8888, 8890, 
5302, 1259.

31. Doing no manner of work, and it being a statute for ever throughout your generations, etc., 
denotes that man, in the progress of regeneration, ought not to act from selfish and worldly 
motives; and that this is true both as to the external and internal man, and also as to every 
particular state, 8888, 8890, 7884, 471, 9845.

32. It being a Sabbath of solemn rest denotes that in this state there is a foretaste of heavenly rest 
and peace, 851; afflicting the soul denotes the acknowledgement that man of himself is 
nothing but evil, 1937, 1947, ver. 27; and keeping the Sabbath on the ninth day of the month at
even, from even to even, denotes that this is effected when the conjunction of faith with 
charity is about to take place in the obscurity arising out of a change from a former state to a 
new state; for states of obscurity must precede states of rest and peace in the Lord, 2075, 7844,
851.

268

33. This is evident, because by Jehovah is denoted the Divine Being as to His love, 2001; by 

speaking is denoted influx, 2951; by Moses is represented Divine Truth, or the Word, 7010; 
and by saying is denoted perception, 1791, 1822.

34. Speaking to the children of Israel, saying, denotes instruction to the man of the Spiritual 

Church from which he perceives, 10355, 3654, 1791, 1822; on the fifteenth day of this seventh
month being the feast of tabernacles, denotes that a new state must follow the implantation of 
truth in good which is the implantation of good in truth, and is the culmination of the work of 
regeneration from the Lord, 9294, 9295, 92965, 716.

35. The first day being a holy convocation, and no servile work being done, denotes that hence 

there is a new arrangement of truths under good, and the end of temptations with the final 
rejection of every selfish and worldly motive, 7891, 8888, 8890.

36.

''Seven days shall you offer an offering made by fire to the Lord," denotes a holy state of the 
worship of the Lord from pure love, 716, 10055; the eighth day being a holy convocation 
denotes a rearrangement of truths under good in that new state, 92965, 7891; offering again an 
offering made by fire to the Lord denotes holy worship as to the understanding as well as the 
will, and thus what is reciprocal, 92965; "it is a solemn assembly" denotes an orderly 
arrangement of truths under good in the external man, 7891; and doing no servile work 
denotes the rejection of selfish and worldly motives even there also, 8888, 8890.

37. These being the set feasts of the Lord denotes that these are the general subordinate states of 

the appropriation of good in regeneration, 9294; their being proclaimed to be holy 
convocations denotes in which a new arrangement of truths takes place, 7891; offering an 
offering made by fire to the Lord denotes the worship of the Lord from pure love, 10055; a 
burnt offering denotes full consecration, 10053; a meal offering and a sacrifice denote for the 
appropriation of interior good by acknowledgement of the Lord, 2177, 4581, 10079 end; and a
drink offering each in its own day denotes for the appropriation of spiritual truth according to 
the state, 10137, 10262, 45815, 487.

38. Besides the sabbaths of the Lord denotes besides the most general or universal state, 84, 8889; 

gifts denote the acknowledgement that good is from the Lord, 5619; besides your vows 
denotes that man may be confirmed in truths, 3880; besides your free will offerings denotes 
that the worship of the Lord must be altogether from a state of freedom, 3880, 10097; and 
what is given to the Lord denotes the acknowledgement that all good is from Him, 5619.

39. The fifteenth day of the seventh month denotes the final new state of the fullness of faith 
conjoined with charity, 9294, 9295, 92965 2044, 851; the fruits of the earth gathered in 
denotes when faith and charity are made fruitful in good works, 7690; keeping the feast of the 
Lord seven days denotes gladness and joy of heart in all completeness and holiness, 9286, 
9287, 2044, 716; and the first day being a solemn rest, and the eighth day being a solemn rest, 
denotes states of peace and rest from the lowest principles to the highest which are perpetually
renewed, through the reciprocal conjunction of truth with good and of good with truth, 84, 
8889, 92965. 

40. Taking on the first day the fruit of goodly trees, branches of palm-trees, boughs of thick trees, 
and willows of the brook, denotes that, in this state, there is the enjoyment of all kinds of good

269

from truths, namely, from spiritual, rational, natural and sensual truths, 92965; and rejoicing 
before the Lord your God seven days denotes a full and holy state of rejoicing in the Lord 
from the heart and the understanding combined, 2001, 2044, 716.

41. Keeping it a feast to the Lord seven days in a year denotes that this state shall be a perpetual 

holy state, 2044, 716; a statute for ever in your generations denotes perpetual externally, 7884;
and keeping it in the seventh month denotes perpetual internally, 851; also the seventh month 
denotes the culmination of the states of regeneration commencing from acknowledgement by 
faith and ending in enjoyment from love, 851.

42. Dwelling in booths seven days, and all that are native in Israel dwelling in booths, denotes that
this indeed is the celestial state of the man of the church of every degree, that is, of the man of 
the internal church and of the external who is established in good, 92966.

43. "That your generation may know that I made the children of Israel to dwell in booths, when I 
brought them out of the land of Egypt: I am the Lord your God," denotes that thus every one 
may know that the holy state of good from the Lord appertains to the man of the Spiritual 
Church, when he is delivered by Him from the bondage of the merely natural man, so that he 
acknowledges Him in heart and understanding by the conjunction of good and truth to eternity,
92966, 8866, 2001, 9845.

44. Moses declaring to the children of Israel the set feasts of the Lord denotes that it is of the 
Divine Providence that revelation is made concerning this holy process of regeneration in 
which good is appropriated with joy and gladness in the Word, 7010, 3654, 10355, 9294, 
2187.

Discussion

Four things may be first thought of in beginning to consider the subjects of this chapter, namely, the 
Word in its literal sense, the correspondences of which it consists, the internal sense involved, and 
man's actual experience of the states described therein. The Word is distinct from every other book that 
has ever been written, because it is scrupulously constructed of correspondential expressions arranged 
in such a way that the collective sense resulting from their combination forms the internal or spiritual 
sense in a perfect series. And it may thus appear as if the literal sense produced the spiritual sense. But 
to confirm this appearance would be wrong. For, as a matter of fact, it is the internal sense of the Word, 
from the Lord, that has produced the external or literal sense, comparatively as the Lord from His 
Divine Love, by His Divine Wisdom, produces all things in the spiritual world, and thence all things in 
the natural world, thus causing the latter naturally to correspond to the former. And in thinking of the 
Word in this way we see that it is a Divine Work just as creation is, and not a human production in any 
way. It is simply and in reality Divine Wisdom, or Divine Truth in an ultimate form. And then it follows
from this that the Word is the Divine Human in an ultimate form, which is the same thing as the 
essential Divine Life, or Love, in an ultimate form. And further, since finite human life is necessarily 
from the Infinite, and thus from the Divine Human life, we see at once how the Word from its very 
nature, so to speak, inevitably describes all the states of finite human beings in their regeneration. 
Nothing, therefore, could more perfectly describe ordinary human life and its changes than does the 
Word; and we here learn from it that, according to the general experience of human beings, there are 
alternate states of conflict and rest with man during regeneration. But we are not to imagine from the 
literal sense that the states of conflict are six times as much as the states of rest; for here, spiritually, the

270

numbers denote the qualities of the states, and not their quantities; and briefly, six signifies simply 
combat, and seven, rest. And in the Word, as might be shown, had we space, both six and seven also 
denote fullness and completeness in different respects, and thus, in our chapter, six denotes all states of 
conflict, and seven all states of rest taken together, and hence, therefore, man's general state as 
distinguished from his particular states. It is important to notice this, and not to allow the ideas derived 
from the literal sense merely, to confuse our perceptions of the internal sense.

But we notice now that the Sabbath is called a holy convocation, and in the literal sense was, and still 
is, properly a holy convocation. Spiritually, however, this idea disappears, and we are to understand an 
arrangement into order of truths under the state of good by the Lord. For by good all truths are 
conjoined; from good truths have their life and activity; and according to good in truths is the quality of
the man. And that is why it is said, "a Sabbath to the Lord in all your dwellings." For good dwells in 
truth as the man dwells in his house. And the particular good of one man is distinct from that of all 
others, and so also is his truth.

But the general state involves those which are subordinate, and the first is, naturally, deliverance from 
evil by the Lord; and this may be considered in its application to the human race as a whole, and to 
each individual. All men have been redeemed by the Lord's assumption of the Human, and therein 
overcoming the infernal powers which held man in bondage, thus preserving to him the liberty of 
choice between good and evil which, just at that time, was on the point of being lost. It is said "on the 
point of being lost" because then the power of evil with man was beginning to predominate absolutely, 
so that if the Lord had not effected redemption just when He did, the human race would have perished. 
For the safety of man depends upon the equilibrium between good and evil, or between heaven and 
hell, by virtue of which he is in freedom of choice. And it is manifest, upon due consideration, that at 
the time of the Lord's advent, and while this great redemption was being accomplished, all men of 
sound mind still had the liberty of making their choice, and were not compelled to choose evil. For 
example, what would have been the use of the preaching of John the Baptist if the people who heard 
him had not had power to repent, or of the Lord's teaching in Matt, vii., if men generally were not then 
in freedom? Man's freedom, then, has never been allowed to be absolutely lost, and it never will be.

But there must also be deliverance from evil in every individual, as well as in general. And this is 
effected by the Lord through the co-operation of man, since freedom consists in choosing to co-operate 
or not. Now the exercise of this freewill, or free determination, in the case of individuals, is represented
in the account of the institution of the feast of the Passover, and is particularly signified by the choosing
of the lamb or the goat, 7833, 7480; for these denote good from the Lord in innocence, which delivers 
man, and the eating thereof denotes the appropriation of that good, 7849-50, while the Wood of the 
animal sprinkled upon the two posts and the lintel of each house signifies the prior, reception of truths 
in the Natural. We cannot, however, enlarge upon these particulars here, only desiring to point out their 
importance, as descriptive of the way in which we are individually redeemed;. and the same remark 
applies to all that is said of the feast of unleavened bread, which denotes individual purification in the 
process of regeneration. But we may clearly see, from the study of this subject, exactly how universal 
redemption, and the particular and actual redemption of each person are connected. And we must take 
care to notice also that redemption, or deliverance from evil and consequent purification, are always 
going on with man, and thus are not only successive experiences, but simultaneous as well. We must be
continually ceasing to do evil, as it is gradually revealed to us in ourselves by the Lord, and we must 
continually be learning to do well.

271

The second subordinate state in the regeneration of man next claims our special attention; is 
represented by the feast of Pentecost; and is a state of the implantation of truth in good. But this 
expression is not quite so easy to understand as that of deliverance from evil; and it may naturally be 
asked, "How is truth to be implanted in good?" The answer is very simple. Truths are implanted in 
good when a man wills the truth and when he loves and does it. But how can we will the truth and love 
it and do it, unless we know it? And hence it is clear that a state of instruction must precede in which 
truths are, as it were, sown in the ground and carefully cultivated, so that they may produce a plentiful 
harvest. The firstfruits of the harvest, therefore, is a very apt symbol of the first efforts which the 
regenerating man makes in living according to the truths he has learned; and that is, of course, why it is
mentioned so particularly in connection with this second feast. It is exceedingly valuable to begin to 
live a life of principle, and not of mere impulse, in our early years. We mostly learn the truth then; but 
we are not always ready then to devote ourselves in obeying it. But here we see that the implantation of
truth in good is to begin with deliverance from evil, and is to be perpetual. And each act of obedience is
a step in the right direction. But before it begins there must be that acknowledgement of the Lord, 
which is denoted by the waving of the sheaf. This waving is the activity of the mind as the result of the 
Divine operation, or as immediately flowing out of it. The Passover was on the fourteenth, the Sabbath 
was on the fifteenth, and the waving was on the sixteenth day of the Jewish month Nisan. Thus we see 
the continuity of the states of man's life. We are to be perpetually implanting truth in good by our 
obedience in the course of regeneration. And we are thus to worship the Lord by devoting our 
affections of good and truth to Him, which is signified by the sacrifice of the lamb, by the meal offering
and by the drink offerings. But yet we have not arrived at the crowning festival which is to denote and 
mark the full implantation of truth in good. There is some spiritual counting to do. For counting 
signifies to know something of the quality of our states. "So teach us to number our days, that we may 
get us an heart of wisdom" (Ps 90:12). The Lord alone it is Who knows the quality of all our states and 
enables us to comprehend them in some measure. And He arranges all our states, a thing which we 
cannot do. Also our states depend upon our advance in good by the implantation of truth therein. And 
hence again we may perceive the secret cause of this particular counting; of the repetition of waving; 
and of the additional and particular sacrifices, all understood spiritually, and culminating in "full 
revelation, a perfect arrangement of truths under good, and the cessation of temptations, and of all 
disposition to act from selfish and worldly motives in the worship of the Lord." But before closing this 
section one word may be said about the peculiarity of the new meal offering, at this feast, being baked 
with leaven. For it was appointed that the meal offering which was offered upon the altar (generally) 
should not be baked leavened (7906), and therefore it is remarkable that, in this case, there should be a 
new meal offering, contrary to the general practice, baked with leaven. Why? Evidently to denote that 
during the implantation of truth in good there is the combat of truth with falsity by which the truth is 
first purified.

And now, before proceeding to the third feast, which signifies the implantation of good, we notice that 
the feast of trumpets and the day of atonement intervene, the whole three taking place in the seventh 
month. There is nothing, however, in the literal sense to show emphatically why the intermediate 
celebrations should be exactly in that month, and on the days named. But the spiritual sense accounts 
for it fully. The seventh month clearly represents the culmination of the holy state of faith during which
the work of the implantation of truth in good is going on. This the references clearly show, and also the 
peculiar signification of the first and tenth days of the month. A special revelation, so to speak, takes 
place on the full implantation of truth in good; and the implantation is accomplished in a full state of 
remains denoted by the number ten. And, moreover, it necessarily follows that then there is a plenary 
removal of evil, which is signified by the day of Atonement, the particulars concerning which have 

272

already been considered in the exposition of chap. xvi., and therefore no further observations need here 
be made upon it. But it may be clearly seen, on due reflection, that this plenary revelation and removal 
of evil comes according to man's actual experience, during the process of Judgement. For surely truth 
does not become good in us until evil is fully removed. And hence we may learn also the importance of
the description of that process, so far as we are individually concerned, in HH 453-520.

And lastly, we have only a limited space in which to say one or two things about the third great feast 
which, as we have learned, signifies the implantation of good in truth. And be it remembered first of all,
that the two states of our lives denoted by the second and the third great feasts, although according to 
our own consciousness taking place successively, since in the former we have not a full realization of 
the state of good in our natural life (for, as yet, the natural man is not one with the spiritual man owing 
to the activity of evil and error there), still it is a fact that the implantation of good from the Lord is also
simultaneous with the implantation of truth. We are born, in short, at the same time, of water and of the 
spirit; and if we just think of this as we journey, it will be a very great consolation to us many a time, or
in many of our states. There is no doubt whatever that the good which we shall finally realize in heaven
is implanted in us by the Lord at a very early period of our lives, and this without in the slightest degree
interfering with the state of our freedom to choose it or not, 1555.

Secondly, this feast was called not only the feast of the ingathering, which signifies the implantation of 
good, 9296, but also the feast of tabernacles, because then the people dwell in tents seven days, the 
reason for which being that a tent is like a house, and one dwelling in a tent therefore denotes good 
dwelling in truth, and, in another aspect, the internal man dwelling in the external, 2268, 3613, 3312, 
from which it may be seen, that as the feast of tabernacles; this celebration really denotes that when 
good is implanted, then the external man becomes one with the internal, and good is in ultimates. Let 
man, therefore, he continually, even in this life, in the endeavour to bring his external into harmony 
with his internal state as to good, that the agreement of the two in all fullness may be the more easily 
accomplished at last.

But thirdly it must be noticed how the fruit of goodly trees, and particularly of palm-trees, is mentioned
in this connection. It was to show how in our perfect state we shall enjoy all kinds of good in fullness 
externally as well as internally. But literally, as is well known, palm-trees have no branches, but thereby
are meant the immense branch-like leaves of the tree. This, however, does not affect the signification, 
as may appear from 92966, and also from the signification of leaves, 885. Hence, then, we discover 
from the study of the internal sense of all that is said about the annual feasts how completely the whole 
life of man is involved in his Regeneration, both as to his successive experiences, and as to the 
simultaneous operation of the Lord and the co-operation of man.

273

Leviticus Chapter 24

Summary of the Spiritual Sense

1. The good of celestial love, adapted to the state of the spiritual man, is the origin of all spiritual 

truth in order that there may be light in the spiritual kingdom perpetually, vers. 1-4. 

2. On the manifestation of celestial and spiritual good, or, in other words, of pure love to the Lord 
and love to the neighbour, to the man of the church; that they are to be accurately distinguished; 
that they are acquired by spiritual conflict; that they are in their receptacles with man; that they 
are acknowledged to be from the Lord; that they are accompanied by their corresponding truth; 
and that they are appropriated by man, vers. 5-9. 

3. Concerning the falsity derived from evil which infests the church and profanes the truth, and 
especially the doctrine of the Divine Human; that those who are of this character are, in the 
meantime, restrained by external bonds; that they come into judgement; and that they are 
condemned, vers. 10-14. 

4. Concerning profanation; concerning injury done to truth and good; and concerning the law of 

retribution, by which evil and falsity bring upon themselves their own punishment, vers. 15-23. 

The Contents of each Verse

1. And the LORD spoke to Moses, 

1. There is revelation from the Lord by Divine Truth 

saying, 

giving the perception,

2. Command the children of Israel, that
they bring to you pure olive oil 
beaten for the light, to cause a lamp 
to burn continually. 

2. That there is influx from the Lord with the man of 
the Spiritual Church, inducing him to acknowledge
that the good of celestial love, adapted to his state, 
is the origin of all spiritual truth, in order that there
may be light in the spiritual kingdom perpetually.

3. Without the veil of the testimony, in 
the tent of meeting, shall Aaron 
order it from evening to morning 
before the LORD continually: it shall 
be a statute for ever throughout your 
generations. 

3. For this light flows in from the celestial to the 

spiritual degree of man's mind, in every state of 
obscurity and brightness, through the operation of 
celestial good, and this even with regard both to 
the internal and external man, during the course of 
regeneration and afterwards to eternity.

4. He shall order the lamps upon the 
pure candlestick before the LORD 
continually. 

4. For the spiritual degree is the especial receptacle 
of Divine Truth unmixed with falsity from the 
Lord continually.

5. And you shall take fine flour, and 

bake twelve cakes thereof: two tenth 
parts of an ephah shall be in one 
cake. 

5. Also pure celestial truth is that in which celestial 
good is manifested, and whence spiritual good is 
derived to the spiritual man; and through this the 
celestial and spiritual heavens are conjoined.

274

6. And them shall set them in two 

6. But, nevertheless, spiritual good is distinguished 

rows, six on a row, upon the pure 
table before the LORD. 

7. And you shall put pure frankincense 
upon each row, that it may be to the 
bread for a memorial, even an 
offering made by fire to the LORD. 

8. Every Sabbath day he shall set it in 
order before the LORD continually; it
is on the behalf of the children of 
Israel, an everlasting covenant. 

from celestial good, and both are acquired through 
victory in temptations in all fullness; and they are 
in their receptacle with the man of the Spiritual 
Church, and are acknowledged to be from the 
Lord.

7. And these goods are to be accompanied by their 

corresponding truth, which, generally, is the truth 
of faith; for truth is the form or expression of 
good, and through it good is perpetually in the 
memory; and thus the Lord is acknowledged and 
worshiped from love and by faith conjoined.

8. And both celestial and spiritual good are derived to
man from the Lord; by virtue of the glorification 
of the Human, these are from the Divine Human 
with man; and by celestial and spiritual good the 
man of the church has conjunction with the Lord 
to eternity.

9. And it shall be for Aaron and his 

9. And thus both the celestial and spiritual man are 

sons; and they shall eat it in a holy 
place: for it is most holy to him of 
the offerings of the LORD made by 
fire by a perpetual statute. 

10. And the son of an Israelitish woman,
whose father was an Egyptian, went 
out among the children of Israel: and
the son of the Israelitish woman and 
a man of Israel strove together in the
camp; 

enabled to appropriate good from the Lord in a 
state of holiness; for good is the very life of the 
celestial man, being directly manifested in truth; 
and he is enabled to acknowledge and worship the 
Lord from love in a supereminent degree.

10. But on the other hand falsity derived from the evil 
of merely natural love, which is selfishness in the 
Spiritual Church perverted, continually infests the 
church, the consequence of which is that a conflict 
arises.

11. And the son of the Israelitish woman

11. And thus falsities in the church, or all those who 

blasphemed the Name, and cursed: 
and they brought him to Moses. And 
his mother's name was Shelomith, 
the daughter of Dibri, of the tribe of 
Dan. 

are in falsities derived from evil, profane the truths
of the church, and especially the doctrine of the 
Divine Human, and thereby they avert themselves 
from the Lord, confirming themselves in evil. And 
therefore those who are in this state are brought 
under the judgement of Divine Truth, and the 
church is thus at an end with them; and the 
external origin of such a state is merely sensual 
and corporeal delight from the fallacies of the 
senses, and from the imagination of the merely 
natural man which judges of things from the 
outward appearance.

275

12. And they put him in ward, that it 
might be declared to them at the 
mouth of the LORD. 

12. But those who are of this character are, in the 

meantime, restrained by external bonds until the 
state of consummation is arrived.

13. And the LORD spoke to Moses, 

13. And then there is revelation from the Lord by 

saying, 

Divine Truth giving the perception,

14. Bring forth him that has cursed 

14. That the real character of those confirmed in evil 

without the camp; and let all that 
heard him lay their hands upon his 
head, and let all the congregation 
stone him. 

and falsity must be manifested in the process of 
Judgement, and when it is proved by the testimony
of Divine Truth that they have so confirmed 
themselves through disobedience, then they are 
condemned to the consequences of their life, and 
are rejected by the spiritual man.

15. And you shall speak to the children 
of Israel, saying, Whosoever curses 
his God shall bear his sin. 

15. And it is the testimony of Divine Truth also, that 
every one who by a wicked life averts himself 
from the Lord is vastated by his own choice.

16. And he that blasphemes the name of 

16. And especially is this the case with those who 

the LORD, he shall surely be put to 
death; all the congregation shall 
certainly stone him: as well the 
stranger, as the native, when he 
blasphemes the name of the LORD, 
shall be put to death. 

profane the truth, for they must in consequence be 
deprived of all truths, and this whether they belong
to the External or to the Internal of the church, 
because such profanation internally or externally 
cannot possibly be continued, but must be 
removed.

17. And he that smites any man mortally

shall surely be put to death; 

18. And he that smites a beast mortally 
shall make it good: life for life. 

19. And if a man cause a blemish in his 
neighbour; as he has done, so shall it
be done to him; 

20. Breach for breach, eye for eye, tooth 
for tooth: as he has caused a blemish
in a man, so shall it be rendered to 
him. 

17. And also every one who, during his probationary 
state, rejects the truth by an evil life, must suffer 
vastation.

18. But if any one only destroys the life of good in the 

natural man, he is capable of regeneration by the 
rejection of the selfish life, and the reception of the
heavenly life.

19. And on the contrary if he destroys charity in 
another, he also destroys it in himself.

20. And this is the case also as to the will, as to the 

understanding, and as to the outward life; for evil 
invariably brings punishment upon itself, and he 
who acts from falsity must suffer the consequences
of falsity.

276

21. And he that kills a beast shall make 
it good: and he that kills a man shall 
be put to death. 

21. He who destroys good only in the external man is 

capable of regeneration by repentance; while he 
who also destroys it in the internal man must be 
vastated.

22. You shall have one manner of law, as
well for the stranger, as for the 
native: for I am the LORD your God. 

22. And this law of retribution is equally applicable to 
those out of the church and within, for Divine 
Good acts inflexibly according to Divine Truth.

23. And Moses spoke to the children of 

Israel, and they brought forth him 
that had cursed out of the camp, and 
stoned him with stones. And the 
children of Israel did as the LORD 
commanded Moses. 

23. And therefore Divine Truth cannot do otherwise in
the Judgement, than reject those who are in evil by
leaving them to conjoin therewith the falsity of 
evil. And thus those in the infernal life are 
separated from those in the heavenly life of 
obedience to Divine Truth from Divine Good.

References and Notes

Church, 5486, 3654; bringing to Moses pure olive oil beaten for the light, denotes the 
acknowledgement that the good of celestial love adapted to the state is from the Lord by 
means of Divine Truth, 886, 10303, 7010; oil for the light denotes also that good is the origin 
of truth, 92965, 9667; and to cause a lamp to burn continually denotes in order that there may 
be light in the spiritual kingdom perpetually, 9549, 9550, 10200-02.

meeting before the Lord continually, denotes that this light flows in from the celestial to the 
spiritual degree of man's mind in every state of obscurity and brightness through the operation 
of celestial good, 9046, 10200-02, 9670, 35403, 10133; and it being a statute for ever 
throughout your generations denotes even both with regard to the internal and external man 
during the course of regeneration, and afterwards to eternity, 7884, 7931.

spiritual degree is the especial receptacle of Divine Truth unmixed with falsity from the Lord 
continually, 9548-50, 10133.

celestial good is manifested, and whence spiritual good is derived to the Spiritual, 9995, 2177, 
2280, 3272; and two tenth parts of an ephah being in one cake denotes through which the 
celestial and spiritual heavens are conjoined, 2177, 2280.

6. Setting them in two rows, six in a row upon the pure table before the Lord, denotes that, 

nevertheless, spiritual good is distinguished from celestial good, and that both are acquired 
through victory in temptations in all fullness; and that they are in their receptacle with the man

277

of the Spiritual Church, and are acknowledged to be from the Lord, 5194, 9864, 8888, 9545, 
2001, 3272.

7. Putting pure frankincense upon each row that it may be to the bread for a memorial, even an 
offering made by fire to the Lord, denotes that these goods are to be accompanied by their 
corresponding truth, which generally is the truth of faith; for truth is the form or expression of 
good, and through it good is perpetually in the memory; and thus the Lord is acknowledged 
from love and by faith conjoined, 2177, 10177, 6888, 10055.

8. Setting it before the Lord every Sabbath, in order, continually, denotes that both celestial and 
spiritual good are derived to man from the Lord, 2177, 8886, 8889; and it being, on behalf of 
the children of Israel, an everlasting covenant, denotes that, by virtue of the Lord's 
glorification of the Human, these are from the Divine Human with man, 8886, 8889; also that 
by these the man of the church has conjunction with the Lord to eternity, 665, 666.

9.

It being for Aaron and for his sons denotes good for the celestial and spiritual man, 9946; their

being most holy to him of the offerings of the Lord made by fire by a perpetual statue, denotes
that good is the very life of the celestial man being directly manifested in truth, and that he is 
enabled to acknowledge and worship the Lord from love in a supereminent degree, 10055, 
7884, 7931.

10. The son of an Israelitish woman whose father was an Egyptian, denotes falsity derived from 
the evil of merely natural love, 1147, 3654, 370320, 939110; this evil originates in selfishness 
in the Spiritual Church perverted, 3703. end, 7488; going out among the children of Israel 
denotes the influx of falsity from evil with the man of the church, 7124; and the son of the 
Israelitish woman and the man of Israel striving together in the camp denotes the infestation of
falsity and conflict, 1571.

11. The son of the Israelitish woman blaspheming the Name and cursing, denotes that falsities in 
the church or all those who are in falsities derived from evil, profane the truths of the church, 
and especially the doctrine of the Divine Human, and thereby avert themselves from the Lord

brought under the judgement of Divine Truth, at the end of the church, 7010, 931; and his 
mother's name being Shelomith, the daughter of Dibri, of the tribe of Dan, denotes that the 
external origin of such a state is merely sensual and corporeal delight from the fallacies of the 
senses, and from the imagination of the merely natural man, which judges of things from the 
outward appearance, because by mother is denoted external origin, 1815, 8897; name denotes 
quality or state, 144, 145; Shelomith means "my peace, my happiness, my recompense" and 
therefore denotes, in the best sense, heavenly peace, happiness, and reward, but here, in the 
opposite sense, merely sensual and corporeal happiness or delight, 4681, 995; by daughter is 
denoted affection, good or evil as the case may be, hence in this place evil affection, 489, 568; 
Dibri, according to Gesenius, means probably eloquent, and, according to Fuerst, one from the
field, and thus it denotes thoughts grounded in sensual things, or the fallacies of the senses, 
9987, 4440; and Dan means one who judges, and denotes in a good sense the affirmation of 
the truth which is the first thing with those about to be regenerated, and the last with those 
who are regenerated; but in the opposite sense, as here, he denotes reasoning from the 

278

imagination of the merely natural man which judges of things from the outward appearance, 
3923, 6397-6401.

12. Putting him in ward that it might be declared to them by the Word of the Lord, denotes that 
persons of this character are, in the meantime, restrained by external bonds until the state of 
consummation is arrived, 5037, 5096, 4217, 9096.

13. This is evident, because by Jehovah is denoted the Divine Being as to His love, 2001; by 

speaking is denoted influx, 2951; by Moses is represented Divine Truth, or the Word, 7010; by
saying is denoted perception, 1791, 1822.

14. Bringing forth him that had cursed without the camp, denotes that the real character of those 
confirmed in evil and falsity must be manifested in the process of judgement, 379, 10038, 
10023; all that heard him putting their hands upon his head denotes proof by the testimony of 
Divine Truth, 9311, 4197, 10023; and all the congregation stoning him denotes condemnation 
to the consequences of their life, and rejection by the spiritual man, 6338, 8799, 7456.

15. Speaking to the children of Israel and saying, denotes that it is the testimony of Divine Truth, 
7010, 10355, 1822; cursing denotes aversion from the Lord by a wicked life, 379, 8882; and 
bearing his iniquity denotes to be vastated by his own choice, 9937 end.

16. He that blasphemes the Name of the Lord being surely put to death, denotes that especially is 
this the case with those who profane the truth, and that they must in consequence be deprived 
of all truths, 8882, 6887, 2908; all the congregation stoning him denotes the punishment of 
falsity and rejection by the church, 6338, 8799, 7456; as well the stranger as the native, 
denotes whether they belong to the external or to the internal of the church, 7908; and when he
blasphemes the name of the Lord being surely put to death, denotes because such profanation, 
internally or externally, cannot possibly be continued but must be removed, 8882, 6887, 2908.

17. He that smites any man mortally being surely put to death denotes that every one during his 
probationary state, rejecting the truth by an evil life, must suffer vastation, 8902, 4251, 2908.

destroys the life of good in the natural man, he is capable of regeneration by the rejection of 
the selfish life, and the reception of the heavenly life, 4251, 7424, 9097, 9048, 9049.

injuries as to the will, as to the understanding, and as to the outward life, 9163, 2148, 6380;

brings punishment upon itself, and that he who acts from falsity must suffer the consequences 
of falsity, 9048, 9049.

21. He that kills a beast making it good, and he that kills a man being put to death, denotes that he 
who destroys good only in the external man is capable of regeneration by repentance, while he
who also destroys it in the internal man must be vastated, 8902, 9097, 7424, 2908.

279

22. Having one manner of law as well for the stranger as for the native, and "I am the Lord your 
God," denotes that this law of retribution is equally applicable to those out of the church and 
within; for Divine Good acts inflexibly according to Divine Truth, 9048, 9049, 6887, 2001.

23. Moses speaking to the children of Israel denotes that Divine Truth, in the Judgement, cannot 
do otherwise than reject those who are in evil, 7010, 2951, 3654; bringing forth him that had 
cursed out of the camp, and stoning him with stones, denotes leaving the evil to conjoin 
therewith the falsity of evil, 379, 10023, 10038, 6338, 8799, 7456; and the children of Israel 
doing as the Lord commanded Moses denotes that those in the infernal life are separated from 
those in the heavenly life of obedience to Divine Truth from Divine Good, 3654, 7010, 2001, 
5486.

Discussion

When we know the universal principles from which all things are, we are in a better position to 
understand all the particulars thence derived; and good and truth from the Lord are those universal 
principles. Now it is on this account that these terms are so very frequently used in the Writings of the 
church; and there is nothing in creation that we can conceive of which is not, in some way, a form of 
good and truth. But, first of all, good is nothing else but love in operation. Most people mean by good 
things the things which they love, and by true things those which are in agreement with their love, 
embody it, and express it.

Love, therefore, may properly be called THE universal thing; for the Lord is Love, and from the Lord, 
Who is the self-existent ONE, proceeds all things. But seeing that Divine Love is the origin of all 
things, we notice also that love in general exhibits itself in a variety of ways in human beings; and thus 
we are led to ask for some distinct definition of Divine Love. We put it thus: it is the love of imparting 
life, happiness, joy and delight, without any selfish motive; or, in other well-known words, it is the love
of forming a heaven from the human race. Divine Good, therefore, is the manifestation of this love, and
in the supreme sense is denoted in our chapter by pure olive oil. There are several interesting passages 
in the Word which show this. Take, for example, chap 8:10-12; 1 Kings 1:39; 2 Kings 4:2-7; and Luke 
10:34. And then by the Israelites bringing the oil is denoted the acknowledgement on man's part that he 
receives all good from the Lord; its being beaten denotes adaptation to the state; its being for the light 
signifies that good is the origin of truth; and its burning continually denotes, as has been shown, 
spiritual light from a state of good perpetually. Thus, then, we see the importance of the teaching in our 
first section, so far as it may be applied individually; and this is particularly manifest from the contents 
of the following verses. And note here also one reason why the light appeared outside the veil. The 
spiritual man must have good and its truth continually as for his own use, and he must appear to 
disguise them as from himself in every state. But he knows, at the same time, that there is a power 
operating, also perpetually, behind the veil; nor does he, if he is wise, seek to penetrate into Divine 
mysteries which are necessarily above his comprehension. How delightful is the thought that each of us
will enjoy his own heaven, and make progress in his own use to eternity, without desiring or 
ambitiously longing for some height to which he can never attain, or, on the other hand, fearing any 
longer that he may fall below his proper position! And notice also especially the closing words, "a 
statute for ever throughout your generations." For by a statute is specifically signified a state of the 
external life resulting from a state of the internal. Before full regeneration there is the perpetual conflict
between the external and internal man which is called temptation. But afterwards in heaven there are no
conflicts of this kind, but a peaceful and perpetual harmony. And is not this worth striving for, as we 
journey? Truly, it is; and we may gather strength and courage, therefore, in our state of probation, by 

280

the contemplation of these words in their inner signification. But we must now turn to the second 
section.

And first, it is to be noted that, in this description, although the bread signifies celestial good, which 
certainly is prior to its truth, yet the lighting of the lamps is treated of before the bread. Why is this? It 
is because the general subject is the Spiritual Heaven, and the Spiritual Church, and the manifestation 
of Divine principles there; and also because that which proceeds from the Lord, even to the Celestial 
Heaven, is properly Divine Truth in which is Divine Good adapted to the state of the celestial man; for 
otherwise good, or love from the Lord to the Lord, could not be received by him. And since this is the 
case even with the celestial man (John 1:18), much more is it so with the spiritual man, who is led by 
truth to a state of good, the love distinguishing the celestial man being thus love to the Lord, and that 
distinguishing the spiritual man being charity, or love to the neighbour.

Now these remarks are made to show clearly how it is that all the things outside the veil represented 
what relates to the spiritual man, and his perceptions of Divine things coming to him mediately through
the celestial heaven. And this, be it remembered, has a very significant practical bearing. For it shows 
that there can be no true charity without love to the Lord, and no true natural kindness or good without 
genuine faith and charity, and also that even the lowest heavenly delights cannot exist without the 
higher, while evil is produced only by their abuse.

And then, with regard to the practical value of the contents of this section a careful consideration of 
each point in the general summary at the beginning of the chapter will sufficiently show this.

For a perfect life can only be acquired by making accurate distinctions, and at the same time by seeing 
the proper connection of things; without the conflict, denoted by the number six, willingly undertaken, 
a man must, of necessity, remain merely natural; there cannot be spiritual and celestial life apart from 
the natural life, free from defilement signified by the pure table; we cannot have good without its 
corresponding truth, nor can we aspire and properly offer up our worship and prayers to the Lord in 
order that they may be grateful and acceptable, unless we have that which is so appropriately denoted 
by the odour of the frankincense; the true worshiper must conjoin truth with the ardour of heavenly 
love, denoted by fire; he remembers best what he really loves; it is only in states of freedom from 
conflict, signified by the Sabbath, that he can, in some measure, realize his higher life and its heavenly 
order; nothing but this can give the conjunction with the Lord symbolized by a covenant; he 
appropriates the good of this life, denoted by eating, in the holy states of loving obedience; and in one 
word this appropriation is the fullness of his internal adoration from love, expressed in his speech, in 
his actions, and in the perpetual life of usefulness by which he is particularly distinguished from others.

From considering the origin of heavenly good and truth and their effects, we turn now to the 
contemplation of the origin of evil and falsity and their effects. This, indeed, is not so agreeable, but 
still it is necessary, because opposites reveal the quality of each other, when contrasted; also from a 
state of good the quality of evil may be seen, but from a state of evil the quality of good cannot be seen.
But nevertheless the understanding of a wicked man may be enlightened to perceive good and truth in 
such a way that he may be reformed and regenerated, if he so chooses, because every one who is born a
human being has the capacity for regeneration by virtue of this fact; but no one can be compelled to 
choose either good or evil. The origin of evil and hell, therefore, is not from the Lord, but from man, by
the abuse of his natural powers, and this fact is described in our subject by the father of the son of an 
Israelitish woman being an Egyptian. But see the place referred to, 9391.

281

But the son of the Israelitish woman, on account of his paternal origin, is falsity derived from evil, just 
as truth is derived from good. And hence the Lord says concerning the evil principle, which is 
selfishness, and in the Word is called the Devil, "He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not 
in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaks a lie, he speaks of his own; for he is a liar 
and the father thereof" (John 8:44). Now nothing can be clearer than this, as from another point of view
showing the origin of falsity. But we ought to mark well that the Israelitish woman, in the best sense, 
denotes the affection of truth, and her son the truth itself, and then we shall the better understand the 
profanation that follows; for no one can profane the truth if he does not, in some way, acknowledge it; 
and this is the reason why the conflict is described as taking place in the camp, that is in the church. 
But the camp also signifies heaven, and hence it might be conceived that there is war in heaven, as 
indeed is plainly stated in Rev 12:7; but by this war is signified conflict in "the former heaven which is 
passed away," that is, in the corrupted church which passed away (AR 548), and the same thing is 
signified by the conflict mentioned in this chapter. But there can be no conflict in heaven itself, because
every one there has, by the help of the Lord, overcome in all temptations, and the external man is for 
ever in harmony with the internal.

But into the particulars of the rest of this interesting account it is not necessary to enter, as most of the 
points have been already illustrated in the expositions of former chapters, and the general series of the 
internal sense, combined with what is said in giving the references, makes them tolerably clear. But 
there is one thing further. The concluding sections make it very clear that there are violations of Divine 
and spiritual laws from the consequences of which man may be delivered by the work of repentance, 
and thence of purification; while on the other hand confirmation in evil states causes eternal separation 
from the heavenly life. It is well, therefore, that we should reflect seriously upon what the internal 
sense here sets before us, and should earnestly resolve that by a consistent life we will confirm 
ourselves in justice and in an inflexible adherence to Divine laws for their own sake, for this state alone
can bring eternal felicity; for it is written, "To him that overcomes will I give to eat of the tree of life 
which is in the midst of the paradise of God" (Rev 2:7).

Leviticus Chapter 25

Summary of the Spiritual Sense

1. There is instruction to the spiritual man that in the completed state of love to the Lord there is 
rest and peace, which is preceded by a full state of conflict against evil and victory over it, and 
in which the natural man enjoys its legitimate delights, vers. 1-7. 

2. And as with the spiritual man, so with the celestial; in the completed state of regeneration he 

enters into a more intensified state of good and truth, in which there is perfect liberty, in which 
each yet comes into the possession of his own particular good, in which there is perfect justice, 
in which there is a full supply of all the necessaries of life, and in which he cannot be deprived 
of his good, because he is kept in it and delivered from evil by the Lord, vers. 8-24. 

3. Concerning various laws which are to be observed by man during regeneration in order that he 
may be duly prepared to enter into the perfect heavenly state, all of which have reference to his 
fluctuating states, and thus to the alienation and redemption of truth and good with him in many 
different circumstances, vers. 25-55. 

The Contents of each Verse

1. And the LORD spoke to Moses in 

1. There is revelation from the Lord by Divine Truth 

mount Sinai, saying, 

proceeding from Divine Good and giving 
perception,

2.

3.

4.

Speak to the children of Israel, and 
say to them, When you come into 
the land which I give you, then shall
the land keep a Sabbath to the 
LORD. 

Six years you shall sow your field, 
and six years you shall prune your 
vineyard, and gather in the fruits 
thereof; 

But in the seventh year shall be a 
Sabbath of solemn rest for the land, 
a Sabbath to the LORD: you shall 
neither sow your field, nor prune 
your vineyard. 

2. By influx, to the man of the Spiritual Church, and 
by instruction, that in the heavenly state of Love to
the Lord there is rest and peace.

3. And this is preceded, while man is being 

regenerated, by a full state of conflict against evil, 
involving temptations as to the will, during which 
the knowledges of good are cultivated; and as to 
the understanding, during which the knowledges 
of truth are imbibed, and good works are 
performed from a principle of charity.

4. But when these states are completed, then the 

heavenly reception of good from the love thereof 
gives rest and peace, which is entirely from the 
Divine Love; neither does man then proceed from 
a state of truth to a state of good, either as to the 
Internal or External.

283

5.

That which grows of itself of your 
harvest you shall not reap, and the 
grapes of your undressed vine you 
shall not gather: it shall be a year of 
solemn rest for the land. 

6. And the Sabbath of the land shall be

for food for you; for you, and for 
your servant and for your maid, and 
for your hired servant and for your 
stranger that sojourn with you; 

5. Neither does he appropriate any affection which 
springs from selfish love, nor any truth which is 
acquired by self-derived intelligence; for the state 
is one of perfect freedom from temptations.

6. And, in this case, good itself produces truths which
nourish the soul; and this as to the internal man; as
to the interior understanding and will; and as to the
exterior will and understanding;

7. And for your cattle, and for the 

beasts that are in your land, shall all 
the increase thereof be for food. 

7. While the external sensual and corporeal affections
enjoy their abundance of pleasures and delights in 
due subordination.

8. And you shall number seven 

sabbaths of years to you, seven 
times seven years; and there shall be
to you the days of seven sabbaths of
years, even forty and nine years. 

8. But the quality of the heavenly state of the man of 
the Celestial Church is a more intensified state of 
good, internal and external, and also a more 
intensified state of truth conjoined with good, 
internal and external.

9.

Then shall you send abroad the loud
trumpet on the tenth day of the 
seventh month; in the day of 
atonement shall you send abroad the
trumpet throughout all your land. 

10. And you shall hallow the fiftieth 
year, and proclaim liberty 
throughout the land to all the 
inhabitants thereof: it shall be a 
jubilee to you; and you shall return 
every man to his possession, and 
you shall return every man to his 
family. 

9. And thence the general perception of celestial 

good is derived to the spiritual man, through 
intermediate angels when, with him, remains are 
full, and the state is one of faith and charity 
conjoined; and this happens, when by the removal 
of evil, the external man is brought into harmony 
with the internal; for then the perception of truth 
accompanies the perception of celestial good.

10. And then, indeed, is celestial love in its fullness 
and holiness, in which a state of perfect freedom 
prevails throughout the heavens, resulting from the
marriage of good and truth in the inmost heaven, 
from which comes to each the realization of his 
own specific truth and good.

11. A jubilee shall that fiftieth year be 
to you: you shall not sow, neither 
reap that which grows of itself in it, 
nor gather the grapes in it of the 
undressed vines. 

11. For in the middle heaven also is charity received in
its fullness, neither is there any procedure from 
truth to good, nor any appropriation of merely 
natural good as to the will or as to the 
understanding.

284

12. For it is a jubilee; it shall be holy to 
you: you shall eat the increase 
thereof out of the field. 

13.

In this year of jubilee you shall 
return every man to his possession. 

14. And if you sell aught to your 
neighbour, or buy of your 
neighbour's hand, you shall not 
wrong one another: 

15. According to the number of years 
after the jubilee you shall buy of 
your neighbour, and according to 
the number of years of the crops he 
shall sell to you. 

16. According to the multitude of the 
years you shall increase the price 
thereof, and according to the 
fewness of the years you shall 
diminish the price of it; for the 
number of the crops does he sell to 
you. 

17. And you shall not wrong one 

another; but you shall fear your 
God: for I am the LORD your God. 

18. Wherefore you shall do my statutes,
and keep my judgements and do 
them; and you shall dwell in the 
land in safety. 

19. And the land shall yield her fruit, 
and you shall eat your fill, and 
dwell therein in safety. 

20. And if you shall say, What shall we 
eat the seventh year? behold, we 
shall not sow, nor gather in our 
increase: 

12. And this is true also of the ultimate heaven, the 

inmost good of which is the love of obedience in 
which truth is conjoined with good in the life, and 
the man of that heaven appropriates that good 
when he practises the truth thereof.

13. And in this fullness of perfect love in each heaven,
every one enjoys, to eternity, his own particular 
good.

14. And although good is communicated and received 

mutually and reciprocally, there is no loss to any 
individual.

15. For according to the quality of good in 

regeneration by the marriage of good and truth in 
his inmost, is each capable of enjoying the good of
all; and according to each man's reception of good 
and truth conjoined from the Lord, is he capable of
communicating good to all.

16. Also, according to the state of truth with each 

individual from his good, is his power of use to the
whole heaven; and the quality of truth with every 
one is according to his good.

17. Nor does any one in heaven act unjustly, because 
he loves to act by truth from good, for with him, 
truth is the expression of his good, even as the 
Human of the Lord is the expression of the Divine.

18. And for this reason external worship is exactly 
according to internal; and the outward life is 
perfect and free from any encroachment of falsity.

19. And there is, in the heavens, no lack of uses; every

one appropriates good from the Lord in all 
fullness; and no one is in danger from the 
incursion of evil.

20. And although indeed, the angels are conscious in 
their state of good, that they cannot receive it, or 
appropriate it of themselves,

285

21. Then I will command my blessing 

21. Yet they also know that they have conjunction 

upon you in the sixth year, and it 
shall bring forth fruit for the three 
years. 

22. And you shall sow the eighth year, 
and eat of the fruits, the old store; 
until the ninth year, until her fruits 
come in, you shall eat the old store. 

with the Lord by influx and correspondence, 
through the work of regeneration, and the 
purification that follows; and are convinced that 
they are capable of doing good in every state of 
their angelic life.

22. For their eternal life is continually renewed from 
the Lord, and hence they have power to cultivate 
truths, and to appropriate good from Him to 
eternity, because they have threefold conjunction 
with Him, and good is perpetually communicated 
from Him.

23. And the land shall not be sold in 

perpetuity; for the land is mine: for 
you are strangers and sojourners 
with me. 

23. Neither can good received in heaven from the Lord
ever be alienated; it is continually the gift of the 
Lord; and the angels continually receive all good, 
internal and external, from Him.

24. And in all the land of your 

24. And in all the heavens this is acknowledged by 

possession you shall grant a 
redemption for the land. 

them; and also, that they are continually withheld 
from evil and kept in good by the Lord.

25.

If your brother be waxen poor, and 
sell some of his possession, then 
shall his kinsman that is next to him
come, and shall redeem that which 
his brother has sold. 

26. And if a man have no one to redeem
it, and he be waxen rich and find 
sufficient to redeem it; 

27. Then let him count the years of the 
sale thereof, and restore the surplus 
to the man to whom he sold it; and 
he shall return to his possession. 

25. And further, when with the man of the Spiritual 
Church truth is deficient, although he may be in 
good, and good and truth are alienated for the time
being, in states of temptation, then shall he be 
protected and preserved by the Lord, by virtue of 
the principle of good, and the alienated truth or 
good shall be restored by victory in the conflict.

26. But if a man is not in the principle of good, and yet

he is furnished with abundance of truths, through 
which afterwards he does the work of repentance, 
and thus becomes actually receptive of good from 
the Lord;

27. The quality of his good will be according to the 
quality of the truths implanted in good by 
regeneration; and he will acknowledge that the 
good of which the Lord had made him capable, 
and which he had alienated, is really from the Lord
alone, through those in the heavenly society who 
had, in the meantime, preserved it in its general 
form; and then, in this case, the subject of 
regeneration, will come fully into his own specific 
good.

286

28. But if he be not able to get it back 
for himself, then that which he has 
sold shall remain in the hand of him
that has bought it until the year of 
jubilee: and in the jubilee it shall go 
out, and he shall return to his 
possession. 

29. And if a man sell a dwelling house 
in a walled city, then he may 
redeem it within a whole year after 
it is sold; for a full year shall he 
have the right of redemption. 

30. And if it be not redeemed within the
space of a full year, then the house 
that is in the walled city shall be 
made sure in perpetuity to him that 
bought it, throughout his 
generations: it shall not go out in the
jubilee. 

31. But the houses of the villages which
have no wall round about them shall
be reckoned with the fields of the 
country: they may be redeemed, and
they shall go out in the jubilee. 

28. But if a man's state be such, that regeneration must
be delayed through the alienation of truth or of 
good, then such alienated truth or good shall be 
preserved by the Lord for him, until revelation is 
made in consequence of the full conjunction of 
good and truth in the inmost degree of his life; and
on account of that conjunction, good shall flow in 
from the Lord, and truth shall be conjoined 
therewith in the external man.

29. And moreover, if good be, for the time being, 

alienated, with any one who is established in the 
doctrine of the church, and is defended thereby, 
then by victory in temptation, he may recover that 
state of good while he is in the state of probation, 
although it has been alienated, because he is still in
the liberty of choice between good and evil.

30. But if this is not effected during the probationary 

state, then that good shall be confirmed to him, 
who by regeneration acquired it; but it cannot be 
appropriated in the Judgement by him who 
alienated, or rejected it.

31. But those who are in good outside the church, and 
who are not protected by true doctrine, are among 
the Gentiles who are in good; and such persons are
capable of instruction in truths, when revelation is 
made in the Judgement, because, with them, good 
is conjoined with truth in the inmost degree.

32. Nevertheless the cities of the 

32. But nevertheless, those who are in truth from 

Levites, the houses of the cities of 
their possession, may the Levites 
redeem at any time. 

good, and in good which is embodied in truth, are 
continually in the capacity of redeeming alienated 
truth or good.

33. And if one of the Levites redeem, 
then the house that was sold, and 
the city of his possession, shall go 
out in the jubilee: for the houses of 
the cities of the Levites are their 
possession among the children of 
Israel. 

33. For wherever good is active by truth, then in the 
Judgement, when good is conjoined and truth 
inmostly, both alienated good and alienated truth 
are restored, because good which is embodied in 
truth, when confirmed, is the essential life of the 
man of the Spiritual Church.

287

34. But the field of the suburbs of their 
cities may not be sold; for it is their 
perpetual possession. 

35. And if your brother be waxen poor, 
and his hand fail with you; then you
shall uphold him: as a stranger and 
a sojourner shall he live with you. 

36. Take you no usury of him or 

increase; but fear your God: that 
your brother may live with you. 

37. You shall not give him your money 
upon usury, nor give him your 
victuals for increase. 

34. Nor can external good, with him who is internally 
in truth and good fully conjoined, be alienated, 
since from this state he perceives that it is entirely 
from the Lord.

35. And it is the duty of the man of the Spiritual 

Church to support those in the external church who
are deficient in truths, and thus lack power to do 
good; and, in the meantime, such persons either act
from natural good without truths, or are in the 
course of instruction in good and truth.

36. Nor is good to be done to another for the sake of 
reward, or from worldly and selfish motives; but 
the external man is to be aided from a sense of 
holy fear grounded in love and truth, in order that 
harmony may be maintained.

37. For it is unlawful to do good for the sake of 

reward, either from worldly or selfish motives;

38.

I am the LORD your God, which 
brought you forth out of the land of 
Egypt, to give you the land of 
Canaan, to be your God. 

38. Because the Lord acts from pure love and truth, 

and has redeemed the spiritual man from all such 
motives, in order that he may receive good from 
the Lord, and thereby, also truth.

39. And if your brother be waxen poor 

with you, and sell himself to you; 
you shall not make him to serve as a
bondservant: 

39. Moreover, the external man which is without truth,
is not to be controlled, when he submits himself to 
the spiritual man, merely from selfish motives;

40. As an hired servant, and as a 

sojourner, he shall be with you; he 
shall serve with you to the year of 
jubilee: 

40. And although, even in religion, he acts for the sake
of reward, or from natural disposition only, and 
this is permitted for the time being, and may 
continue during the state of probation;

41. Then shall he go out from you, he 

and his children with him, and shall 
return to his own family, and to the 
possession of his fathers shall he 
return. 

41. Yet when good and truth are fully conjoined in the 
inmost with the spiritual man, then the natural man
shall be free as to good and as to truth, and like the
spiritual man will act from spiritual motives as to 
both will and understanding.

42. For they are my servants, which I 

brought forth out of the land of 
Egypt: they shall not be sold as 
bondmen. 

42. For the natural man is redeemed by the Lord from 
merely natural affection, and ought not to be 
alienated, and governed by the spiritual man from 
selfish love.

288

43. You shall not rule over him with 
rigour; but shall fear your God. 

43. He is not to be governed by truth apart from good, 

but by truth conjoined with good.

44. And as for your bondmen, and your 

bondmaids, which you shall have; 
of the nations that are round about 
you, of them shall you buy 
bondmen and bondmaids. 

44. But natural powers and affections which are evil, 
or persons who are in such, may be controlled by 
the fear of punishment.

45. Moreover of the children of the 
strangers that do sojourn among 
you, of them shall you buy, and of 
their families that are with you, 
which they have begotten in your 
land: and they shall be your 
possession. 

45. Also those in falsities from the evils of the natural 
man, and who are under instruction, may be 
controlled by an appeal to their selfish fears and 
motives, for these may be the means of promoting 
good and truth which are received by connection 
with the church; and thus such persons may, in the 
meantime, be subordinate.

46. And you shall make them an 

46. And thus too, in the course of regeneration the 

inheritance for your children after 
you, to hold for a possession; of 
them shall you take your bondmen 
for ever: but over your brethren the 
children of Israel you shall not rule, 
one over another, with rigour. 

natural affection may be controlled by the spiritual
powers, and may become truly subordinate; and 
indeed, the natural powers are continually 
subordinate; but the natural powers which are 
subordinate willingly, from spiritual motives, are 
not to be controlled from selfish motives or from 
truth without good.

47. And if a stranger or sojourner with 
you be waxen rich, and your brother
be waxen poor beside him, and sell 
himself to the stranger or sojourner 
with you or to the stock of the 
stranger's family: 

47. And besides, if those who do good from natural 

disposition only, or those who are in truth without 
good, have abundance of the knowledges of truth 
and good, while yet the man of the external church
is deficient in truths, and thus good and truth are 
alienated, and evils and falsities have power 
through such natural dispositions prevailing;

48. After that he is sold he may be 

48. Yet redemption is possible to those who thus 

redeemed; one of his brethren may 
redeem him: 

suffer; for they may be saved by obedience to the 
truth of simple good which they love,

49. Or his uncle, or his uncle's son, may

redeem him, or any that is near of 
kin to him of his family may redeem
him; or if he be waxen rich, he may 
redeem himself. 

49. Or by collateral external good or truth; or by any 
kind of good which is congenial to their state; or if
the knowledges of truth and good increase with 
them they may redeem themselves.

289

50. And he shall reckon with him that 
bought him from the year that he 
sold himself to him to the year of 
jubilee: and the price of his sale 
shall be according to the number of 
years; according to the time of an 
hired servant shall he be with him. 

51.

If there be yet many years, 
according to them he shall give 
back the price of his redemption out
of the money that he was bought 
for. 

52. And if there remain but few years to
the year of jubilee, then he shall 
reckon with him; according to his 
years shall he give back the price of 
his redemption. 

53. As a servant hired year by year shall
he be with him: he shall not rule 
with rigour over him in your sight. 

50. And such redemption is to be worked out in the 
course of regeneration during the state of 
probation; and the quality of their life will be 
according to the good of truth in successive states; 
and according to the predominance of selfish 
motives in the acquisition of good.

51. And according to these influences they will 

acknowledge that they were delivered from evil 
and kept in good by means of Divine Truths freely 
given to them by the Lord.

52. And if the state be such that the conjunction of 

truth with good inmostly is less remote, their 
quality will be according to the degree of the 
acknowledgement that their life is from the Lord.

53. And in proportion to the influence of selfish 

motives in successive states, shall their general 
state be; nor shall the natural man be allowed to 
prevail over the spiritual man.

54. And if he be not redeemed by these 

54. And if such natural men who are in good are not 

means, then he shall go out in the 
year of jubilee, he, and his children 
with him. 

redeemed from the power of falsities in the church 
by these experiences; yet, in the Judgement, 
because they are in good, the truth will be 
conjoined therewith in the inmost mutually and 
reciprocally.

55. For to me the children of Israel are 
servants; they are my servants 
whom I brought forth out of the 
land of Egypt: I am the LORD your 
God. 

55. For the men of the Spiritual Church internally and 
externally are the servants of the Lord; and the 
Lord has redeemed both those who are internal 
men and those who are external; and therefore He 
is to be worshiped as the only source of all good 
conjoined with truth in the man of the church.

that this is preceded, while man is being regenerated, by a full state of conflict against evil, 
involving temptations as to the will, during which the knowledges of good are cultivated; and 
as to the understanding, during which the knowledges of truth are imbibed, and good works 
are performed from a principle of charity, 8888, 737, 9272-3, 9277.

4.

In the seventh year there being a Sabbath of solemn rest for the land, a Sabbath to the Lord, 
the field not being sown and the vineyard not being pruned, denotes that when these states are 
completed the heavenly reception of good from the love thereof gives rest and peace, which is 
entirely from the Divine Love, neither does man then proceed from a state of truth to a state of
good, either as to the Internal or External, 9274, 9272, 9277.

5. Not reaping that which grows of itself, and not gathering the grapes of the undressed vine, it 

being a year of solemn rest for the land, denotes that in this state neither does man appropriate

derived intelligence, because the state is one of perfect freedom from temptations, 9278, 9279.

6. By the Sabbath of the land being for food is denoted that good itself produces truths which 

nourish the soul, because the Sabbath signifies a state of good which is formed by truths, 
8889; and good and truth are man's genuine spiritual food, 680; by "you" is denoted the

state of the man of the Celestial Church, 8802, is a more intensified state of good, internal and 
external, and also a more intensified state of truth, internal and external, as appears from the 
signification of the number seven, as denoting what is holy, 716; of years, as denoting states in
particular, and of days, as denoting states in general, thus of the first twofold expression as 
relating to the internal man, and of the second as relating to the external, since they who are in 
internals are in particulars, and they who are in externals are in generals, 488, 3513, 3739; of 
the two pairs of double expressions, as denoting what relates to the will and understanding 
respectively, 683; and of forty-nine, like ninety-nine, as denoting incipient conjunction, 1988, 
2252.

9. Sending abroad the loud trumpet on the tenth day of the seventh month denotes that thence the
general perception of celestial good, or of love to the Lord, is derived to the spiritual man, 
716, 8802, 2075, 851; and doing this on the day of atonement denotes when by the removal of 
evil the external man is brought into harmony with the internal, for then the perception of truth
accompanies the perception of celestial good, 10042 II., 8802; while by ten is denoted a full 

291

state of remains, 3107, and by the seventh month is denoted a state of charity conjoined with 
faith, 851.

10. Hallowing the fiftieth year, and proclaiming liberty throughout the land to all the inhabitants 
thereof, denotes that then indeed is celestial love in its fullness and holiness, in which a state 
of perfect freedom prevails throughout the heavens, 2252, 8042, 892; it being a jubilee denotes
"resulting from the marriage of good and truth in the inmost heaven," 8802; and returning 
every man to his possession, and every man to his family, denotes from which comes to each 
the realization of his own specific truth and good, 2028-9, 7833, 3239.

11. The fiftieth year being a jubilee denotes that in the middle heaven also is charity received in its
fullness, 2252; not sowing nor reaping denotes that in this state there is no procedure from 
truth to good, 9274, 9272, 9277; and not reaping what grows of itself, nor gathering the grapes
of the undressed vines, denotes no appropriation of merely natural good either as to the will or 
understanding, because the corn denotes good, 3580; the undressed vine denotes evidently 
truth without good, 1071, and gathering denotes appropriation, 9273.

12. It is a jubilee denotes that this is true also of the ultimate heaven, 2252; the inmost good of this

in the life, 2146; and eating the increase thereof out of the field denotes that the man of that 
heaven appropriates that good when he practises the truth thereof, 2187, 3310.

according to the quality of good in regeneration by the marriage of good and truth in his 
Inmost is each capable of enjoying the good of all, 10217, 8802, 2967; and according to the 
number of the years of the crops his selling to you denotes that according to each man's 
reception of good and truth conjoined from the Lord is he capable of communicating good to 
all, 10217, 5212, 5886.

16. According to the multitude of the years increasing the price thereof, and according to the 
fewness of the years diminishing it, denotes that according to the state of truth with each 
individual from his good is his power of use to the whole heaven, 6172, 6285, 2966-7; and 
"for the number of the crops does he sell to you" denotes that the quality of the truth with 
every one is according to his good, 10217, 5212, 5886.

17. Not wronging one another denotes that no one in heaven acts unjustly, 9196; fearing your God 
denotes to act according to truth from good, 28265; and "I am the Lord your God" denotes that
with him truth is the expression of his good, even as the Human of the Lord is the expression 
of the Divine, 2001, 3049.

18. Doing the Lord's statutes denotes that external worship is to be exactly according to internal, 
2001, 7884; keeping His judgements and doing them denotes the same, the former statement 

292

having relation to the external man, and the latter to the internal, 8357; and dwelling in the 
land in safety denotes to be free from any encroachment of falsity, 4480, 10160.

19. The land yielding her fruit denotes that there is in the heavens no lack of uses, 3705, 7690;

10160, 683.

20. "And if we shall say, What shall we eat in the seventh year? behold, we shall not sow nor 

gather in our increase," denotes that although, indeed, the angels are conscious in their state of 
good that they cannot receive it or appropriate it of themselves, because by "if we shall say" is 
signified the perception of the good man or the angel, 1822; "what shall we eat" signifies the 
thought with them that they cannot appropriate good of themselves, 2187; "in the seventh 
year" denotes in their full state of good, 9274; and not sowing nor gathering in denotes that of 
themselves they neither acquire truth nor appropriate good, 9272, 9273.

21. The Lord commanding His blessing in the sixth year, and it bringing forth fruit for three years,

denotes that they also know that they have conjunction with the Lord by influx and 
correspondence, 5486, 3514, 3017, through the work of regeneration and the purification that 
follows, 8888, 8891, and are convinced that they are capable of doing good from the Lord in 
every state of their angelic life, 913.

22. By the eighth year is denoted that their eternal life is continually renewed from the Lord, 2044,
9227; by sowing and eating of the fruits is denoted that hence they have power to cultivate 
truths and appropriate good from Him, 9272, 2187; by the old store is denoted the good of 
remains from the Lord to eternity, 5299, 5370, 1854; by the ninth year is denoted threefold 
conjunction with the Lord, 2075, 278810; and by eating the old store until the fruits come in is 
denoted that good is perpetually communicated by the Lord, 913, 5299, 5370, l854.

23. The land not being sold in perpetuity denotes that good received in heaven from the Lord can 
never be alienated, 3705, 4758; the land being the Lord's denotes that good is continually the 
gift of the Lord, 3705; and the children of Israel being strangers and sojourners with Him 
denotes that the angels continually receive all good internal and external from Him, 8002.

It is to be observed here that the Hebrew words rendered in the text "strangers and sojourners" 
are in the last reference translated "sojourners and foreign residents," and that as sojourners 
were in closer relationship with the Israelites than foreign residents, since the former were 
under instruction and the latter were not, therefore the sojourners denote what is respectively 
internal, and the foreign residents what is respectively external.

24. Granting a redemption for the land in all the land of your possession denotes that in all the 

heavens this is acknowledged by them; and also that they are continually withheld from evil 
and kept in good by the Lord, 3705, 8002, 2966, 10218.

25. "If your brother be waxen poor" denotes when with the man of the Spiritual Church truth is 
deficient, although he may be in good, 2360, 92097; selling some of his possessions denotes 
the alienation of good and truth, for the time being, in states of temptation, 3705, 4758; it is 
said in states of temptation for the time being because good from the Lord is not really 
alienated with him who is being regenerated, ver. 23; and his next of kin coming and 

293

redeeming that which his brother had sold denotes protection and preservation by the Lord by 
virtue of the principle of good and the restoration of alienated truth or good through victory in 
temptation, 37032, 2937, 2966.

26. "If a man have no one to redeem it" denotes one who is not in the principle of good, 37032; 

becoming rich denotes to be furnished with abundance of truths, 10227; and finding sufficient 
to redeem it denotes through which afterwards he does the work of repentance, and thus 
becomes actually receptive of good from the Lord, 2937, 2966, 10152.

27. Counting the years of the sale thereof denotes that the quality of his good will be according to 
the quality of the truths implanted in good by regeneration, 10217, 3705, 4758, 2937; restoring
the surplus to the man to whom he sold it denotes the acknowledgement that the good of 
which the Lord had made him capable, and which he had alienated, is really from the Lord 
alone, through those in the heavenly society who had in the meantime preserved it in its 
general form, 9087, 9097, 2966, 3705, 4758; and "he shall return to his possession" denotes 
that he will come fully into his own specific good, 3705.

28. Not being able to get it back for himself denotes that his state is such that regeneration is 

delayed, 9087, 9097, 2966, 3705; that which he has sold denotes what has been alienated, and 
continues to be alienated, through defect of truths, 4758; that which he has sold remaining in 
the hand of him that bought it until the year of jubilee denotes that then such alienated truth or 
good shall be preserved by the Lord for him until revelation is made in consequence of the full
conjunction of good and truth in his inmost degree, 3705, 4758, 878, 2964, 2966, 8802; and it 
going out in the jubilee, and his returning to his possession, denotes that on account of that 
conjunction good shall flow in from that Lord, and truth shall be enjoyed therewith in the 
external man, 8802, 2028, 2029, 7833, 3239.

29. A man selling a dwelling-house in a walled city denotes the alienation of good with any one 
established in the doctrine of the church by which he is defended, 2233, 4758, 402, 6419; 
having power to redeem it for a whole year after it is sold denotes that by victory in temptation
he may recover that state of good while he is in the state of probation, although it has been 
alienated, 2966, 2906, 4758; and having the right of redemption for a full year denotes because
he is still in the liberty of choice between good and evil, 2966, 2906, 683. Observe here that 
the liberty of choice between good and evil appertains only to the state of probation denoted 
by the full year, HH 479, 480.

30. Not being redeemed within the space of a year denotes redemption not effected in the 

probationary state, 2966, 2906; the house in that walled city being made sure in perpetuity to 
him that bought it throughout his generations denotes that that good shall be confirmed to him 
who by regeneration acquired it, 2232, 6419, 402, 984, 2964, 1041; and it not going out in the 
jubilee denotes that good cannot be appropriated in the Judgement by him who alienated or 
rejected, 8802.

31. The houses of the villages which have no wall round about them being reckoned with the 

fields of the country denotes that those who are in good outside the church, and who are not 
protected by true doctrine, are among the Gentiles who are in good, 2233, 3271, 7407, 620; 
and their being redeemed and going out in the jubilee denotes that such persons are capable of 
instruction in truths when revelation is made in the Judgement, because with them good is 
conjoined with truth in the inmost degree, 2966, 8802.

294

32. The cities of the Levites denote truths derived from good, 402, 6716; the houses of the cities 
of their possession denote good which is embodied in truth, 2233, 402, 6716; and the Levites 
redeeming them at any time denotes that they are continually in the capacity of redeeming 
alienated truth and good, 6716, 2966, 3705, 2233, 9150.

33. One of the Levites redeeming denotes wherever good is active by truth, 6716, 2966; the house 
that was sold and the city of his possession going out in the jubilee denotes that then in the 
Judgement, when good is fully conjoined to truth inmostly, both alienated good and alienated 
truth are restored, 2233, 402, 2029, 2966, 8802; and the houses of the cities of the Levites 
being their possession among the children of Israel denotes that good which is embodied in 
truth, when confirmed, is the essential life of the man of the Spiritual Church, 2233, 402, 
6716, 2028, 2029, 3654.

34. The field of the suburb of their cities not being sold because it is their perpetual possession 

denotes that external good with him who is internally in truth and good fully conjoined cannot 
be alienated by ascribing it to himself; for he perceives that it is entirely from the Lord, 7407, 
6078, 402, 4758, 6148, 2029.

35. "If your brother be waxen poor and his hand fail with you" denotes those in the external 

church who are deficient in truths, and thus lack power to do good, 1222, 2360, 9209, 878; to 
uphold him clearly denotes to support him, 39012, 6343; and living as a stranger and a 
sojourner denotes that in the meantime such persons either act from natural good without 
truths, or are in the course of instruction in good and truth, 8002.

According to what is said in the note under ver. 23, we ought to read in this verse, "a sojourner
and a stranger, or foreign resident," instead of "a stranger and a sojourner," which, of course, 
would reverse the statement of the internal sense; that is, "such persons are either in the course
of instruction in good and truth, or act from natural good without truths." Certainly the 
context, in the spiritual sense, seems to require that, both here and in ver. 23, what is relatively
internal should precede what is relatively external.

36. Taking no usury of him, nor increase, denotes that good is not to be done for the sake of 

reward, or from worldly and selfish motives, 9210; fearing your God denotes that the external 
man is to be aided from a sense of holy fear grounded in love and truth, 2826; and "that your 
brother may live with you" denotes in order that harmony may be maintained, 1222, 290.

37. Not giving him your money upon usury, nor giving your victuals for increase, denotes that it is
unlawful to do good for the sake of reward either from worldly or selfish motives, 9210.

38. "I am the Lord your God, which brought you forth out of the land of Egypt, to give you the 

land of Canaan, to be your God," denotes because the Lord acts from pure love and truth, and 
has redeemed the spiritual man from all such motives, in order that he may receive good from 
the Lord, and thereby also truth, 2001, 2966, 3705.

39. "If your brother be waxen poor with you and sell himself to you, you shall not make him serve
as a bond-servant," denotes that the external man which is without truth is not to be controlled,
when he submits himself to the spiritual man, merely from selfish motives, 1222, 9209, 6142, 
6143, 8974.

295

40. Being with his master as a hired servant and a sojourner, or, more correctly, as a hired servant 
and a foreign resident, denotes that although even in religion he acts for the sake of reward, or 
from natural disposition only, 8002; and serving until the year of jubilee denotes that this is 
permitted for the time being, and may continue during the state of probation, 8802.

41. His going out at the jubilee, he and his children with him, denotes that when good and truth 

are fully conjoined in the inmost with the spiritual man, then the natural man shall be free as to
good and as to truth, 8802, 489, 2966; and returning to his own family and to the possessions 
of his fathers denotes that, like the spiritual man, he will act from spiritual motives as to both 
will and understanding, 7833, 3239, 2028, 2029. 

42. Being the Lord's servants, which He brought forth out of the land of Egypt; and not being sold 

as bondmen, denotes that the natural man is redeemed by the Lord from merely natural 
affection, and ought not to be alienated and governed by the spiritual man from selfish love, 
7038, 8866, 4758, 8974.

43. Not ruling over him with rigour, but fearing your God, denotes that he is not to be governed by

truth apart from good, but by truth conjoined with good, 6148, 4180.

44. By bondmen and bondmaids of the nations round about are denoted natural powers and 

affections which are evil, 8890, 1868; and by buying of them for bondmen and bondmaids is 
denoted that such may be controlled by the fear of punishment, 7998, 7999, 3718.

45. By the children of the strangers that sojourn are denoted those in falsities from the evils of the 
natural man, and who are under instruction, 1147, 8002; by "of them shall you buy and of their
families which are with you, which they have begotten in your land," denotes that such may be
controlled by an appeal to their selfish fears and motives, 7998, 7999, 3718, 1215, 1145, 1708;
and by their being a possession is denoted that they may be the means of promoting good and 
truth which are received by connection with the church; and that thus such persons may in the 
meantime be subordinate, 2028, 2029.

46. Making them an inheritance for their children after them denotes that thus, too, in the course 

of regeneration, the natural affections may be controlled by the spiritual powders, and may 
become truly subordinate, 1799, 1802; "of them shall you take your bondmen for ever" 
denotes that, indeed, the natural powers are continually subordinate, 25677; and not ruling 
over your brethren the children of Israel, one over another with rigour, denotes that the natural 
powers which are subordinate willingly from spiritual motives are not to be controlled from 
selfish motives, or from truth without good, 4286, 6148, 4180.

47. By a sojourner a stranger, or by a sojourner a foreign resident, is denoted one who is under 
instruction, and is thus in truth without good, and at the same time acts from natural 
disposition only, 8002; to be waxen rich denotes to have abundance of the knowledges of good
and truth, 10227; a brother denotes the man of the external church, 1222; to be waxen poor 
denotes to be deficient in truths, 10227; and selling himself to the sojourner, the stranger, 
denotes that thus good and truth are alienated, and evils and falsities have power, through such
natural dispositions prevailing, 4758.

296

48. "After that he is sold, he may be redeemed; one of his brethren may redeem him," denotes that
yet redemption is possible to those who thus suffer; for they may be saved by obedience to the 
truth of simple good which they love, 4758, 2966, 1222.

49. His uncle or his uncle's son denotes collateral external good or truth, 3612, 489; any that is 

near of kin denotes any kind of good which is congenial to their state, 37032; "if he be waxen 
rich" denotes that if the knowledges of truth and good increase with them, 10227; and being 
redeemed denotes deliverance from evil through the application of the truth to life, 2966.

50. Reckoning with him that bought him from the year that he sold himself to him to the year of 
jubilee denotes that such redemption is to be worked out in the course of regeneration during 
the state of probation, 10217, 2937, 4758, 8802, 2252; the price of his sale being according to 
the number of years denotes that the quality of their life will be according to the good of truth 
in successive states, 2966; and according to the time of a hired servant shall he be with him 
denotes according to the predominance of selfish motives in the acquisition of good will be the
delay, 8002.

51. If there be many years, his giving back, according to them, the price of his redemption out of 

the money that he was bought for, denotes that according to these influences they will 
acknowledge that they were delivered from evil and kept in good by means of Divine Truths 
freely given to them by the Lord, 2966, 10217.

52. And if there remain but a few years to the year of jubilee, reckoning with him according to 

them the price of his redemption, denotes that if his state be such that the full conjunction of 
truth with good is less remote, their quality will still be according to the degree of the 
acknowledgement that their life is from the Lord, 2966, 10217.

53. Being with him as a servant hired year by year; and not ruling with rigour over him, denotes 

that in proportion to the influence of selfish motives in successive states shall their general 
state be; nor shall the natural man be allowed to prevail over the spiritual man, 8002, 487, 488,
6148, 4180.

54. If he be not redeemed by these means, going out in the year of jubilee, he and his children 
with him, denotes that if such natural men who are in good are not fully redeemed from the 
power of falsities in the church by these experiences, yet in the Judgement, because they are in
good, the truth will be conjoined therewith in the inmost in all fullness, and mutually and 
reciprocally, 2966, 8802, 2252, 489.

55. The children of Israel being the servants of the Lord denotes that the men of the Spiritual 

Church are internally and externally the servants of the Lord, 3654, 1713, 7038; being brought
forth out of the land of Egypt denotes that the Lord has redeemed both those who are internal 
men and those who are external, 8866; and "I am the Lord your God" denotes that He is to be 
worshiped as the only source of good conjoined with truth in the man of the church, 2001.

Discussion

It will appear very clearly to the reflecting mind that this chapter and the two which follow it are the 
culmination of the series in the internal sense of the whole book of Leviticus. For the subject now 
before us is the fullness of the regeneration of man in every respect and of every degree. Let us, then, 
consider it carefully.

297

It is well known to Christians generally that the ordinary Sabbath, or day of rest, is representative of the
completion of regeneration, when all spiritual conflict is over; and on that account heaven itself has 
been called an eternal Sabbath. And it is indeed an eternal Sabbath, for there man is in an eternal state 
of rest from all temptations, and of the eternal worship of the Lord in consequence. But it is not to be 
imagined, as some have done, that the state of peace and rest in heaven is a perpetual state of inactivity,
or that the angels are for ever employed in the services of the sanctuary, or in praising and worshiping 
the Lord externally. This is far from the truth. The peace and rest of heaven is freedom from spiritual 
warfare, and the worship there which is perpetual is the worship of a good life in the performance of 
uses of various kinds, from the delight of being useful, and with the wisdom which properly discerns 
the quality of genuine use. While at the same time it is quite reasonable to conclude that there are 
seasons, or states of angelic life, wherein people assemble for the united glorification of the Lord, for 
instruction in Divine things, and for the expression of mutual love in a common realization that all 
good is from the Lord, and that He accepts the praises of His children because they are a real 
expression of their genuine appreciation of His Divine Wisdom and Love, which He constantly enables 
them to reciprocate, and not because praise or worship is delightful to Him from any consideration of 
self-glory. For surely even the angels themselves are not delighted with praise and honour and glory for
the sake of such things, but rather turn away from them, since they know so well that all real blessings 
are from the Lord, and that to be delighted with honours simply is the sure indication of the lurking 
love of ourselves. Much less, then, does the Divine Being seek for praise and glory.

But now, if the ordinary Sabbath denotes the perfect heavenly state, much more does the sabbatical 
year, or the jubilee. In a word, they denote the intensification of the heavenly state, and from a certain 
point of view the general Sabbath, and the other two actually represent the state of the lowest, the 
middle and the highest heavens, as adequately appears from all the contents of this chapter.

But there were three things that took place in this sabbatical year, two of them being mentioned in this 
account, namely, the cessation of sowing and reaping, and the giving of the spontaneous produce of the 
ground to the poor and to the animals, while the third, which was a release from all debts, is enjoined in
Deut 15:1-3. Let us, then, consider the spiritual import of these three enactments. First, the six years in 
which there might be sowing and reaping, and other hard work in the field and vineyard, as we have 
seen, signify man's states of spiritual conflict, and the seventh year a state of rest and peace; but this is 
not all that is involved, because the six years of sowing and reaping also signify the state in which we 
are led by the cultivation of our minds in truths, and the adoption of good principles, from the love of 
knowledge, and the practice of good under a sense of duty, to a genuine love of the Lord and the 
neighbour; and the seventh year denotes the perfect realization of that love, and consequently the 
cessation of the former state, 9271. And, of course, the state of conflict and the state of cultivation are 
co-extensive. But, it may be thought, is there no cultivation of the mind in the heavenly state? Certainly
there is, but then, instead of acquiring knowledge and developing our powers that we may become 
good, we shall do these things as the effects of a particular love of good, and thus with the object of 
becoming more and more perfect, so to express it, in our ow7n function and in general usefulness.

And then, the heavenly life involves, secondly, freedom in the enjoyment of all good things internal 
and external, or spiritual and natural, as the series shows; or, in other words, freedom in the natural man
as well as the spiritual for the appropriation of every good thing (vers. 5-7). And thirdly, a further state 
of freedom is denoted by the release from debts, which signifies that "every state of obedience to truth 
acknowledged to be from the Lord becomes a state of obedience from the love of good; that 
compulsory obedience from a principle of truth ceases, because love is now the motive for every 

298

action; and that where charity prevails freedom from self-compulsion follows" (Deut 15:1-3). But of 
this we shall speak fully in the future.

Coming to the second section, we have now to consider the Jubilee, which represents the perfect state 
of the celestial man, or heaven, and thence also that of the spiritual man, or heaven in certain 
particulars, as appears from the manner in which the series is constructed and arranged. For the latter 
depends upon the former; and what applies to the one relates also to the other, as well as, more 
remotely, to the perfected natural man, or to the ultimate heaven. This is represented by the blowing of 
the trumpet, by doing so on the day of atonement, and on the tenth day of the seventh month. Why is 
this? It is because revelation or a clearer perception of Divine things always follows the removal of 
evil, and especially the plenary removal of evil, since good then flows in from the Lord, remains are 
brought forth, and the state of faith is full and complete.

But look at the result, and try to realize how joyful it is. There is perfect freedom for the whole man; 
there is full conjunction with the Lord in the inmost, and thence outwardly; and the full enjoyment of 
all good things on the natural plane. And that is why it is three times said to be a jubilee. And how 
finely does the return of every one to his own possessions symbolize the realization by each of his own 
good. Heaven is a grand man, and each angel there has his own function in it, nor will he ever desire to 
abandon it. There has, indeed, been all through life the selling and the buying, that is, the parting with 
what we ought to have kept, and the acquiring of what could only for a time be ours, all depending, 
however, on a mysterious union of right feeling and thought in the deep recesses of our inward life. We 
have been very poor spiritually, and yet very rich, without knowing it. But now we have returned to our
home and our property, and we shall never more lose them. And there will be no injustice in our 
jubilee, and no one will do wrong to his brother, because our life will be complete in love and 
intelligence (ver. 17). And notice the next two periods; for they assure us that no falsity and evil will 
trouble us in heaven, and that there will be full enjoyment. But the points that follow to the end of the 
section are exceedingly interesting. The angels, or the celestial of every degree, are conscious of their 
dependence on the Lord, and know that He will give them all things necessary; that their good cannot 
be alienated, or become the good of some one else; that it is the Lord's; that they have no good and 
knowledge of themselves; and that they can continually acknowledge this. These are all states of the 
perfected man, and states for which the yet imperfect may well strive.

We now come to the consideration of the various laws described in the second half of this interesting 
chapter, which, internally, are laws relating to regeneration. And in the first section there are two 
distinct cases, namely, the poor brother redeemed by his kinsman, and the one who has no kinsman, the
former denoting him who is in good and alienates it during regeneration, and the latter him who is in 
truth without good and does the same. But we alienate good and truth when we give way to evil; and 
we are liable to do this either when we are making progress, or before we have begun to do so; and the 
law teaches what happens in each case. But who is the kinsman that redeems? It is the Lord operating 
through our inmost state as to good, and thus through the general good of our own angelic society, 
37032. Every man, however, has a capacity for good, if he chooses to exercise it, since all have been 
redeemed, and can therefore choose between good and evil, 2966; and hence, in the second case, the 
poor man grown rich has that power, and may make a proper use of his truths by acknowledging the 
Lord and doing the work of repentance, and in this way appearing to redeem himself. But observe the 
process described in ver. 27, and remark how it agrees generally with the teaching that "the price of 
redemption is also predicated of reception with man, with whom it is as great as the degree of 
reception," 2966. And that restoring the surplus to the man to whom he sold it denotes "the 
acknowledgement that the good of which the Lord had made him capable is really from the Lord alone,

299

through those in the heavenly society who had in the meantime preserved it in its general form," 
appears from 8685, where it is shown that there is influx from the Lord, both immediate and mediate, 
with man when he comes into the state of his own good, that is, immediately from Himself and 
mediately through heaven, and that before this, or "in the meantime," there is only immediate influx. 
Thus, then, we may see how the regenerated man realizes his state of good in and through his own 
heavenly society. And this explanation also shows how it is the same in the case of delayed 
regeneration, as described in ver. 28.

An examination of the next section, however, shows that it refers to the redemption of alienated good 
with those who are relatively more external; but the essential truth of it evidently is that there can only 
be redemption during the natural life, or during the state of probation, which is denoted by a whole 
year. The state of probation is that in which every one is in the liberty of choosing between good and 
evil; and that state is limited to the natural life, because it is the ultimate; and it must always be 
remembered that regeneration, like creation, is from the operation of first or highest principles, and the 
co-operation of last or lowest principles, and cannot be effected in any other way. See, concerning this 
truth, HH 470-483, where it is confirmed from Scripture, from reason and from experience. But it is 
said of the Levites that their cities or houses might be redeemed at any time, that is, according to the 
literal sense, beyond the stipulated year; and this might seem to be a contradiction of the general truth. 
And yet it is not so, because, in this connection, the Levite denotes one who is already in good to some 
extent, or in the good of truth, as it is sometimes called, and thus one who is making progress; and the 
expression "at any time," therefore, must be interpreted to mean in any state during the period of 
probation, which period is also represented by the years between one jubilee and another, as is evident 
from the signification of the jubilee. And also it is further said of the Levites that the field of the 
suburbs of their cities may not be sold at all, to denote that external good cannot be alienated where 
there is full conjunction of good and truth internally, because this conjunction is what the jubilee 
represents, as we have seen.

But it is not necessary to extend these notes, as the various laws which follow, relating to masters and 
their servants, all have relation to the jubilee; and it will be sufficient to make some general remarks in 
conclusion. Now it appears very clearly from the directions here given that it is not according to Divine
Order, nor consistent with the character of the Divine Love, that men should make slaves of their 
fellow-men, and thus that the Israelites were not allowed to have bond-servants, and buy and sell them, 
because it was agreeable to the will of the Lord, but because it was their natural disposition so to act; 
and the laws here prescribed were evidently intended to regulate, moderate and soften their merely 
natural love. For it is just the same in these cases as in the permission granted to divorce their wives. It 
was on account of the hardness of their hearts (Matt 19:8). And this we the more easily understand even
from the plain teaching of the Lord in the Gospels, which is confirmed by the revelation of the internal 
sense.

For that sense teaches that although there are certainly distinctions like that of masters and servants in 
the heavens, yet there all government is that of mutual love, the masters loving the servants and 
directing and guiding them from love, and the servants loving the masters and yielding obedience from 
love. And this is a very different kind of government from that which arises out of the love of dominion
arising from selfish love, which desires to keep all in subjection from the lust of having power and of 
possessing the wealth of all the world. And from this consideration we cannot fail to see how highly 
beneficial are all the spiritual laws here named and insisted upon. And particularly is it to be observed 
that those who are, either for the time being or permanently, in selfish love as a governing principle 
cannot be governed through love to the Lord and the neighbour, which they have not realized, or may 

300

never wish to realize, and therefore are compelled by their own fear of suffering to live according to 
order on their own plane of life. And when they do this, which no doubt each does finally, it is just to 
believe that they no longer suffer. For it is the Lord Himself who governs the infernals as well as the 
angels, and His government in both cases is the government of Divine Love and Divine Wisdom, which
has no other end than the formation of heaven and its preservation from the human race.

While, therefore, we are still in the probationary state let us choose, and confirm ourselves in the 
choice, that we will surely be governed by heavenly love, and also minister from that love to the eternal
well-being of every human soul, according to his state, even by becoming images and likenesses of the 
Lord in this respect, as well as in every other.

Leviticus Chapter 26

Summary of the Spiritual Sense

1. Man is commanded not to devote himself to any selfish or to any worldly affection, but above 

all things to worship the Lord from celestial love, because if he is obedient, he will enjoy every 
spiritual blessing including states of peace and tranquillity, and protection in all his temptations. 
For the Lord will dwell with His people, and the active life of uses will prevail, since He has 
accomplished the work of redemption, vers. 1-13. 

2. But, on the contrary, if the man of the Spiritual Church is disobedient and rejects the Lord and 
His Divine laws, then he will suffer from all kinds of calamities, which are described in order, 
vers. 14-39. 

3. And yet all who, in their degraded state, confess their wickedness, and sincerely repent, will 

again be received by the Lord, since He has effected the work of redemption, and has, by means
of the Word, supplied man with an abundance of truths adapted to every state of his life, vers. 
40-46. 

The Contents of each Verse

1. You shall make you no idols, neither 
shall you rear you up a graven 
image, or a pillar, neither shall you 
place any figured stone in your land, 
to bow down to it: for I am the LORD
your God. 

1. Moreover, the spiritual man is commanded not to 
devote himself in worship to any selfish affection 
or to any falsity thence derived in the internal man,
or in the external man, even where the church is, 
and to become a slave thereto; because the Lord 
alone is to be worshiped.

2. You shall keep my sabbaths, and 
reverence my sanctuary: I am the 
LORD. 

3.

If you walk in my statutes, and keep 
my commandments and do them; 

2. And, therefore, above all thing's the Lord is to be 
worshiped from celestial love, by means of the 
truth thence proceeding which is holy; for love to 
the Lord is the essential of all worship.

3. And if the man of the church lives both outwardly 
and inwardly according to the laws of Divine 
Order,

4. Then I wall give your rains in their 
season, and the land shall yield her 
increase, and the trees of the field 
shall yield their fruit. 

4. Then he will receive from the Lord the influx of 

Divine Truths according to his state, and truths 
will be multiplied from good, while good again is 
rendered fruitful by truths.

302

5. And your threshing shall reach to the
vintage, and the vintage shall reach 
to the sowing time: and you shall eat
your bread to the full, and dwell in 
your land safely. 

6. And I will give peace in the land, 
and you shall lie down, and none 
shall make you afraid: and I will 
cause evil beasts to cease out of the 
land, neither shall the sword go 
through your land. 

5. Also the realization of good, through regeneration,
will be co-extensive with the reception of Divine 
Truths; and the reception of Divine Truths with the
insemination of truth in good; and the 
appropriation of good will be in fullness, while the
state of the heavenly life will be secure from the 
encroachments of evil or error.

6. Also peace will pervade the mind, and tranquillity 
prevail in the life; nor will any evil or falsity give 
anxiety, for evil passions will be entirely removed, 
and destructive falsities will no longer cause 
vastation in the church.

7. And you shall chase your enemies, 
and they shall fall before you by the 
sword. 

7. And when temptations do arise, the love of good 
will disperse evils; and the love of truth will 
exterminate falsities.

8. And five of you shall chase an 

hundred, and an hundred of you shall
chase ten thousand: and your 
enemies shall fall before you by the 
sword. 

8. For the smallest remains of truth will be more 
powerful than abundance of falsities; while the 
smallest realization of good is capable of resisting 
the whole force of evil; and Divine Truth shall 
prove victorious against every opposing natural 
affection unregenerate.

9. And I will have respect to you, and 

make you fruitful, and multiply you; 
and will establish my covenant with 
you. 

9. And Divine Good will fill the soul internally, and 
manifest itself externally; while truths will be 
thereby abundant, and man will have conjunction 
with the Lord.

10. And you shall eat old store long

in fullness through constant and never-failing 
renewal.

11. And I will set my tabernacle among 
you: and my soul shall not abhor 
you. 

11. Also the Lord will dwell with His people; nor shall

any want of correspondence hinder the full 
perception of heavenly truths.

12. And I will walk among you, and will
be your God, and you shall be my 
people. 

12. And the active life of uses will prevail; with the 
reciprocal enjoyment of heavenly blessings.

303

13. I am the LORD your God, which 

brought you forth out of the land of 
Egypt, that you should not be their 
bondmen; and I have broken the bars
of your yoke, and made you go 
upright. 

13. For the Lord, by His glorification, has redeemed 
the spiritual man to eternity from the bondage of 
the merely natural man, so that he should not be a 
slave thereto; and no impediment remains to 
human regeneration; in order that he, who is at 
first merely natural, may afterwards become truly 
spiritual.

14. But if you will not hearken to me 

14. But, on the contrary, if the spiritual man shall 

and will not do all these 
commandments; 

become disobedient, and this not only outwardly 
but inwardly also;

15. And if you shall reject my statutes, 

and if your soul abhor my 
judgements, so that you will not do 
all my commandments, but break my
covenant; 

15. And if external worship is neglected, and the study
of interior truths is despised, so that disobedience 
prevails internally, and conjunction with the Lord 
is broken;

16. I also will do this to you; I will 

16. Then the spiritual man will suffer the 

appoint terror over you, even 
consumption and fever, that shall 
consume the eyes, and make the soul
to pine away: and you shall sow your
seed in vain, for your enemies shall 
eat it. 

consequences, for he will bring upon himself a 
dread of Divine realities, even vastation as to truth,
and the force of fiery passions destroying good, 
that will take away all truths, and deprive man 
gradually of every principle of good; and no longer
will he advance from truth to good, because evils 
of life will destroy spiritual growth.

17. And I will set my face against you, 

and you shall be smitten before your 
enemies: they that hate you shall rule
over you; and you shall flee when 
none pursues you. 

17. Also man will then no longer apprehend internal 
good and truth; he will suffer the punishment 
which evils carry with them; the selfish love of 
dominion will prevail; and intense fears of 
suffering arising from ignorance of Divine Truths.

18. And if you will not yet for these 
things hearken to me, then I will 
chastise you seven times more for 
your sins. 

18. And, indeed, if the spiritual man will persist in his 
disobedience, then he will bring upon himself the 
conjunction of evil and falsity and complete 
vastation.

19. And I will break the pride of your

power; and I will make your heaven 
as iron, and your earth as brass:

while, as to the internal man unmixed falsities will 
reign, and as to the external, merely natural 
delights.

land yield their fruit. 

true, because it is impossible for evil to produce 
good, or for falsities grounded in evil to produce 
truths.

304

21. And if you walk contrary to me, and 

will not hearken to me; I will bring 
seven times more plagues upon you 
according to your sins. 

22. And I will send the beast of the field 

among you, which shall rob you of 
your children, and destroy your 
cattle, and make you few in number; 
and your ways shall become 
desolate. 

21. And if the spiritual man will still further persist in 
living contrary to the laws of Divine Order, and in 
disobedience to those laws, as set forth from 
Divine Love and as expressed in the Word which 
is Divine Truth, complete vastation will overtake 
him according to the degree of his depravity.

22. For abominable evil affections will take possession
of him, which will deprive him of all innocence, of
all good natural affections, and of power to act 
from truths; neither shall there be with him any 
doctrine of the church which is true.

23. And if by these things you will not 

23. And if he will still more oppose Divine Laws, and 

be reformed to me, but will walk 
contrary to me; 

24. Then will I also walk contrary to 
you; and I will smite you, even I, 
seven times for your sins. 

25. And I will bring a sword upon you, 
that shall execute the vengeance of 
the covenant; and you shall be 
gathered together within your cities: 
and I will send the pestilence among 
you; and you shall be delivered into 
the hand of the enemy. 

26. When I break your staff of bread, ten
women shall bake your bread in one 
oven, and they shall deliver your 
bread again by weight: and you shall
eat, and not be satisfied. 

refuse to be outwardly obedient;

24. Then will he bring upon himself more intense 

vastation; for he will suffer torment from the very 
presence of the Divine sphere; and will intensely 
dread all that is holy, and pure, and peaceable.

25. For falsities from evil will prevail with him which 
will destroy all possibility of conjunction with the 
Lord, and he will be bound by external barriers of 
falsity; remains will entirely perish with him; and 
evil will have full power over him.

26. And when he is completely vastated as to good 

affections, falsities in fullness will alone provide 
nourishment for him from the heat of selfish love 
according to the quality of evil affections; nor will 
the appropriation of such evils, satisfy the 
continual cravings of infernal loves.

27. And if you will not for all this 

27. And still again, if the spiritual man refuses to be 

hearken to me, but walk contrary to 
me; 

obedient and will continue to oppose Divine laws;

28. Then I will walk contrary to you in 
fury; and I also will chastise you 
seven times for your sins. 

28. Then the effects of such opposition will be greatly 
intensified; for vastation as to all good will be the 
natural result of such a life.

29. And you shall eat the flesh of your

sons, and the flesh of your daughters

affection.

305

30. And I will destroy your high places, 
and cut down your sun-images, and 
cast your carcases upon the carcases 
of your idols; and my soul shall 
abhor you. 

31. And I will make your cities a waste, 
and will bring your sanctuaries to 
desolation, and I will not smell the 
savour of your sweet odours. 

30. And further, all semblances of worship from the 

understanding will be destroyed, as well as all 
semblances of worship from the will; and only the 
dead forms of life will remain without the spirit, 
through indulgence in evils which cause aversion 
from the Lord.

31. For pretended orderly arrangement of truths will 

be fully exposed as real vastation; all pretences of 
worship will be abandoned; neither will there be 
any more false appearances of peace and rest, and 
of what is grateful in worship.

32. And I will bring the land into

desolation: and your enemies which 
dwell therein shall be astonished at 
it.

the wicked themselves.

33. And you will I scatter among the 

33. And thus, perverted and corrupted spiritual men 

nations, and I will draw out the 
sword after you: and your land shall 
be a desolation, and your cities shall 
be a waste. 

34. Then shall the land enjoy her 

sabbaths, as long as it lies desolate, 
and you be in your enemies' land; 
even then shall the land rest, and 
enjoy her sabbaths. 

will be entirely given up to evils and falsities; and 
falsities will pursue them continually; and every 
good affection will be desolated as to truth and all 
knowledge of true doctrine will be vastated as to 
good.

34. And then the true spiritual man, by the suppression
of all evil, will enjoy the perfect heavenly state of 
celestial love; and this will be true externally as 
well as internally.

35. As long as it lies desolate it shall 

35. For the suppression of all evil will bring peace, 

have rest; even the rest which it had 
not in your sabbaths, when you 
dwelt upon it. 

even that peace which the church could not have 
by external worship separated from internal with 
the corrupted spiritual man.

36. And as for them that are left of you, 
I will send a faintness into their heart
in the lands of their enemies: and the
sound of a driven leaf shall chase 
them; and they shall flee, as one 
flees from the sword; and they shall 
fall when none pursues. 

36. But as for the wicked who continue in the slightest
degree to infest the true church, they will lose all 
power through being rejected among evils, and 
even the smallest vestige of faith will cause 
aversion; and they will be glad to escape from the 
truth as if it were destructive, and from good as if 
it were productive of misery.

37. And they shall stumble one upon

another, as it were before the sword, 
when none pursues: and you shall 
have no power to stand before your 
enemies. 

distinguish between truth and falsity; nor do they 
at all apprehend the difference between good and 
evil.

306

38. And you shall perish among the 
nations, and the land of your 
enemies shall eat you up. 

38. For evils are destructive the one of the other; and 
falsities, by conflict with falsities are utterly 
consumed.

39. And they that are left of you shall 
pine away in their iniquity in your 
enemies' lands; and also in the 
iniquities of their fathers shall they 
pine away with them. 

39. And the slightest remnants of good will be entirely
dissipated through confirmed evil; and also 
confirmation in falsity from evil will disperse all 
truth.

40. And they shall confess their iniquity,

40. But the good, in this corrupted state of the 

and the iniquity of their fathers, in 
their trespass which they trespassed 
against me, and also that because 
they have walked contrary to me, 

41. I also walked contrary to them, and 
brought them into the land of their 
enemies: if then their uncircumcised 
heart be humbled, and they then 
accept of the punishment of their 
iniquity; 

42. Then will I remember my covenant 

with Jacob; and also my covenant 
with Isaac, and also my covenant 
with Abraham will I remember; and 
I will remember the land. 

43. The land also shall be left of them, 
and shall enjoy her sabbaths, while 
she lies desolate without them; and 
they shall accept of the punishment 
of their iniquity: because, even 
because they rejected my 
judgements, and their soul abhorred 
my statutes. 

Spiritual Church, will acknowledge that they are in
falsities, from the falsities of those in evil, and also
through ignorance of truth owing to such falsities, 
which are opposed to Divine Truth; and also that, 
because of their actual evils, they have lived 
contrary to the truth.

41. And that, therefore, the truth has appeared to be 

their enemy, and has inflicted evil upon them. But 
if then the good confess that evil punishes itself, 
and that of themselves they are nothing but 
impurity;

42. Then will they be capable of conjunction with the 
Lord, first through their natural state as to the 
reception of good from Him; secondly as to their 
spiritual state; and thirdly as to their celestial state;
and they will then be furnished with truths leading 
to good.

43. But all who are in evil will be separated from the 

true church, which is protected in its state of good, 
when separated from evil; and they shall live and 
endure the consequences of their evil, because, 
from freedom, they rejected Divine Truths 
internally; and refused even to offer external 
worship separated from internal.

307

44. And yet for all that, when they be in 
the land of their enemies, I will not 
reject them, neither will I abhor 
them, to destroy them utterly, and to 
break my covenant with them: for I 
am the LORD their God: 

45. But I will for their sakes remember 
the covenant of their ancestors, 
whom I brought forth out of the land
of Egypt in the sight of the nations, 
that I might be their God: I am the 
LORD. 

44. But nevertheless, the Lord, when the wicked are 
vastated, does not cease to protect them; neither 
does He permit them to be utterly destroyed for the
want of such protection; for He is still conjoined 
with them through the higher degrees of their life, 
which are not open, and because of this 
conjunction they must continue to live to eternity. 
For the Lord is conjoined with the wicked because 
they were created capable of good, and perfect in 
those higher degrees.

45. And the Lord, on account of this conjunction, 
permits the wicked to live; because by the 
redemption of mankind from the absolute bondage
of evil, He is able to protect them; and from Him 
they have their life still to eternity.

46. These are the statutes and 

judgements and laws, which the 
LORD made between him and the 
children of Israel in mount Sinai by 
the hand of Moses. 

46. And these are the laws of order for the spiritual 
man, as to externals, as to interiors, and as to 
internals, by which conjunction is maintained 
between the Lord and the human race, from His 
Divine Love, by means of His Divine Truth.

every good affection will be desolated, 620, 411; and your cities becoming a waste denotes 
that all knowledge of true doctrine will be vastated as to good, 402, 411.

34. The land enjoying her sabbaths as long as it lies desolate, and you be in your enemies' land, 
denotes that then the true spiritual man, by the suppression of all evil, will enjoy the perfect 
heavenly state of celestial love, 620, 87, 411, 2851; and "even then the land resting and 
enjoying her sabbaths," denotes that this will be true externally as well as internally, or as to 
the understanding as well as the will, 683.

35. "As long as it lies desolate it shall have rest, even the rest which it had not in your sabbaths, 
when you dwelt upon it," denotes that the suppression of all evil will bring peace, even that 
peace which the church could not have, by external worship separated from internal with the 
corrupted spiritual man, 411, 620, 87, vers. 14-15.

36. "As for them that are left of you" denotes that as for the wicked who continue in the slightest 

degree to infest the true church, 7564-5; sending a faintness into their heart in the land of their 
enemies denotes the loss of all power through being rejected among evils and consequent 
falsities, 6111, 7272; the sound of a driven leaf chasing them denotes that even the smallest 
vestige of faith will cause aversion, 216, 884, 4555; and fleeing as one flees from the sword, 
and falling when none pursues, denotes that they will be glad to escape from the truth as if it 
were destructive, and from good as if it were productive of misery, 1689, 2799, 696.

37. Stumbling one upon another, as it were, before the swords when none pursues, denotes that the
wicked, in vastation, are not able to distinguish between truth and falsity, 91632, 2799, 696; 
and not having power to stand before your enemies denotes that they do not at all apprehend 
the difference between good and evil, 7530, 49265, 2851.

38. Perishing among the nations; and the land of your enemies eating you up, denotes that evils 
are destructive the one of the other; and that falsities by conflict with falsities are utterly 
consumed, 1849, 7655, 620, 2851, 5149.

39. They that are left of you pining away in their enemies' land denotes that the slightest remnants 
of good will be entirely dissipated through confirmed evil, 7564, 14602 (Lam 4:9), 620, 2581; 
and pining away also in the iniquities of their fathers denotes that confirmation in falsity from 
evil will disperse all truth, 7564, 14602 (Lam 4:9), 9156, 370320.

40. Confessing their iniquity and the iniquity of their fathers denotes that the good in this 

corrupted state of the Spiritual Church will acknowledge that they are in falsities from the 
falsities of those in evil, 9156, 370320; their trespasses which they trespassed against me 
denotes that they have erred through ignorance of the truth, owing to such falsities which are 
opposed to Divine Truth, 9156; and walking contrary to the Lord denotes that, because of their
actual evils, they have lived contrary to the truth, 519.

312

41. The Lord walking contrary to them, and bringing them into the land of their enemies, denotes 
that therefore the truth has appeared to be their enemy and has inflicted evil upon them, 2001, 
620, 2851; their uncircumcised heart being then humbled denotes their confession that evil 
punishes itself, 7272, 7225, 74183; and accepting the punishment of their iniquity denotes their
confession that of themselves they are nothing but impurity, 7225, 3994.

42. Remembering the covenant with Jacob, and Isaac, and Abraham; and remembering the land 
denotes that then will they be capable of conjunction with the Lord first through their natural 
state as to the reception of good from Him; secondly as to their spiritual state; and thirdly as to
their celestial state; and that they will then be furnished with truths leading to good, 840, 665, 
6098, 620.

43. The land being left of them denotes that all who are in evil will be separated from the true 
church, 5812; enjoying her sabbaths while she lies desolate without them denotes the 
protection of the church in its state of good, when separated from evil, 87, 620, 411; accepting 
the punishment of their iniquity denotes living and enduring the consequences of their evil, 
9937 end; and rejecting the Lord's judgements, and abhorring His statutes denotes rejecting 
Divine Truths internally, and refusing even to offer external worship separated from internal, 
9257, 8357.

44. Their not being rejected in the land of their enemies denotes that, nevertheless, the Lord, when
the wicked are vastated, does not cease to protect them, 1875, 620, 2851; not abhorring them 
to destroy them utterly denotes that neither does He permit them to be utterly destroyed for the
want of protection, 3605, 693, 694, 696; not breaking the covenant with them denotes that He 
is still conjoined with them through the higher degrees of their life, which are not open, and 
that because of this conjunction they must continue to live to eternity, 9163, 665, 43643, 4525; 
and "I am the Lord their God," denotes that the Lord is conjoined with the wicked because 
they were created capable of good and also perfect in those higher degrees, 4525, 2001.

45. The Lord, for their sakes, remembering the covenant of their ancestors, denotes that the Lord 

on account of this conjunction, permits the wicked to live, 4525, 2001; bringing their ancestors
out of the land of Egypt in the sight of the nations that He might be their God, denotes that by 
the redemption of mankind from the absolute bondage of evil, He is able to protect them, 
8866, 10152, 2706; and "I am the Lord," denotes that from Him they have their life still to 
eternity, 2001.

46. These being the statutes and judgements and laws, which the Lord made between Him and the 
children of Israel, in Mount Sinai by the hand of Moses, denotes that these are the laws of 
order for the spiritual man as to externals, as to interiors, and as to internals, by which 
conjunction is maintained between the Lord and the human race, from His Divine Love by 
means of His Divine Truth, 8357, 7995, 3654, 8399, 7010.

Discussion

There are evidently three general thoughts in the portion of the Word we have now to reconsider; and 
these are the advantages of a consistent life of obedience to the Lord and to the laws of Divine Order as
contained in the Word; the miseries that man brings upon himself by disobedience; and that in no 
condition of a corrupted church, or of a corrupted state of the individual, is the opportunity of 
repentance and regeneration wanting.

313

But observe that the short introduction is significant and implies a tendency in man to the worship of 
himself, and of worldly things, while at the same time he has power to worship the Lord and love his 
neighbour in every state. And this has been so from the beginning, that is, it has always been so; for 
man was created free to choose between evil and good; and the first created man could not have had 
this choice without a perception that it was wrong to do certain things, and only right to do certain other
things. And since they were not created in the state of regeneration, but only in the capacity for it, 18, 
95, 125; and since there is no angel in heaven who has not been regenerated, and thus who does not 
acknowledge that, of himself, he is nothing but evil, 286, 868, it follows that the first created human 
beings, whoever they were, and although they were of the celestial order as distinguished from the 
spiritual, did fall into evil, and transmitted their evil to their posterity. Hence, then, even now every 
person has the capacity for regeneration, and can be regenerated if he chooses.

And as a commentary on the two sections which follow, it ought to be observed that, in the literal 
sense, the appeal is apparently made to the selfish principle of man, certain good things being promised
to those who are obedient, and certain severe punishments threatened for the wicked; and this is as it 
should be, since all are first in the merely natural state, which renders it necessary that each should feel 
and think and act as from himself, and in the order of time consider first how he may provide for 
himself, and how he may avoid those calamities which are so apt continually to fall upon mankind. For 
if we cannot provide for ourselves and for our families, so that neither we nor they shall become a 
burden upon society, how can we perform the higher uses, which regard the welfare of others, and the 
promotion of the Lord's kingdom among men? It is not at all necessary, however, to act from selfish 
motives in providing for ourselves, although, with great diligence, we may take care of our property, 
and see that it is used as it should be, and that it is not wasted. For it is remarkable that even the Lord 
Himself enjoined such prudence when He said upon a particular occasion, ''Gather up the fragments 
that remain, that nothing be lost" (John 6:12). But the internal sense of our first section shows us how 
we may do this, and yet have higher motives as governing motives. For what is represented by the 
refreshing rain, the fruit of the trees, and the corn and the wine, are just those very principles which can
alone render man unselfish, since heavenly truth from the Lord, and all the various kinds of good 
actions made useful in the natural life, together with the bread of life which nourishes the soul, and the 
wine of the kingdom of God, which gives energy and sterling force of character, are all unselfish 
things, which do not regard our own welfare simply but the love of the Lord, and of the neighbour in all
their forms. It is a fact that selfish people, indeed, may apply even these things to selfish purposes, but 
all the while the very truth and goodness they abuse condemn them, and from their very nature are 
calculated to teach and urge them on to better things. And now notice particularly the next point, with 
its inevitable corollary, that, notwithstanding so many appearances to the contrary, good and truth are 
co-extensive, and always bring peace and safety and a secure dwelling-place in the highest and best 
sense of those terms.

And now, before leaving this section, we have to reflect on the power of the truth in overcoming evil; 
on the implantation of remains and their appropriation; of the true worship of the Lord; and of the 
reason why we are able to worship Him truly. It is the dictate of common sense that the Divine Being is
omnipotent, and few will deny this truth. But it is not as well understood in what omnipotence consists,
and there are not a few who, while believing that the Lord can do anything, forget that this means 
anything that is consistent with Divine Love. It is impossible, therefore, for Him to do many things, 
because there are so many which are contrary to His character as Divine Love, and thus He cannot 
destroy a human soul; He cannot act towards that human soul otherwise than with love; and even the 
worst of evil spirits owe their continuance in life to His never-failing love. And, besides this, the Lord 

314

cannot do anything that is wrong, because what is wrong is contrary to His Divine Laws, which are all 
from Divine Wisdom. We see, therefore, that the omnipotence of our heavenly Father does not mean 
the power of doing everything, but lies in the fact that He is the origin of all power, because He is the 
origin of all life, and there can be no such thing as power without life. To which, if we add that He is 
Divine Order as well as Divine Love, it is still more manifest that He cannot act contrary to His Order. 
But being the origin of all power, as is now evident, we see that the good man or the angel has power 
from Him; and also that the wicked have no power, therefore, against the good; and these 
considerations illustrate the first of the four points just above named.

And then there are the remains about which so much is said in the Word, and consequently in the 
Writings of the church. From infancy to the end of life the Lord is continually storing up these remains 
in man; and whether he makes a good use of them or not, it is provided that they shall not be absolutely
destroyed or lost, although with the infernals this is the case as far as their consciousness goes. They 
consist of every good and true influence and impression, every holy affection, and every pious thought 
which people have during their lives; these are stored up and are reserved by the Lord; they are those 
things in him who is to be regenerated upon which the spirit of the Lord operates; they are symbolized 
by water (Gen 1:2; John 3:5); and our chapter teaches that when man is regenerated, they are 
manifested or implanted in his external man and become a part of his actual life, enriching it and 
exalting it. And this appropriation it is which is described by eating of the old store long kept, and by 
bringing forth the old because of the new. But what, then, is the result? It is that the tabernacle of God 
is with men, and that worship is genuine and holy and pure through the complete deliverance from all 
evil, which, it is well known, is signified by the deliverance of the Israelites from their oppressive 
Egyptian bondage.

The next section, which is comparatively a long one, and speaks of many points in connection with a 
corrupted church, and the states through which it passes even to its consummation, need not, however, 
detain us long, considering that all the particulars are explained in the foregoing notes. But it is 
necessary to remember, in reflecting on those things, that the Lord brings evil and punishment upon no 
man; and that the dreadful sufferings which do really occur, and are represented by the various 
calamities named, are the natural results of evil states, and thus are brought upon the wicked by 
themselves. And the reason why the various punishments are ascribed to the Lord, or why the Lord 
says that He will Himself do these things, is to show that He controls all things in the universe both 
natural and spiritual, and because bad men, and evil spirits, being in falsities and evils, by which their 
minds are weakened and darkened, are apt to think that the Lord actually punishes them, and that He is 
the cause of their sufferings. And careful reflection will show that it is better for them that they should 
thus think, according to their condition and circumstances. For thus they may be led, while yet in this 
world, to a state of external repentance, which may afterwards become genuine. And if they are in the 
other life, having confirmed themselves in evil, the persuasion that God inflicts torments upon them, or 
permits, or directs that they shall suffer severely, on account of some violations of order, may greatly 
contribute to restrain them, and bring them into obedience to the laws of order in their own particular 
sphere, so as to render them willing to perform certain uses of which they are capable. For every one 
must, finally, become some form of use, this being the end of the Divine Government under any 
circumstances or conditions.

But the last section now requires careful thought, because it not only shows that those in good, at the 
end of the church, have the opportunity of repentance, but also that the wicked even in their states of 
confirmed evil, are still protected by the Lord, even against themselves, and are preserved in their life 
by Him, that they may become of some use. And this is the reason why the section is naturally divided 

315

into two parts, the first including verses 40-42, and the second verses 43-45, while verse 46 is, 
evidently, a general statement. The whole of the six verses, however, are included in one section, 
because they unitedly show that the Divine attitude is one of love and mercy both to the good and the 
evil in their final states.

The reason, moreover, for the interpretation here given may be seen from the consideration that those 
who confessed their iniquity clearly denote those who do the work of repentance, and thus those who 
are in good at the end of the church, ver. 40; while those by whom the land was left, while she enjoyed 
her sabbaths without them, as clearly denote those who separated themselves from the church on 
account of a confirmed state of evil, ver. 43; and this being so, all the other terms must be applied 
accordingly. And therefore, for example, accepting "the punishment of their iniquity," signifies, in one 
place, the confession that of themselves they are nothing but impurity, and in another living and 
enduring the consequences of their evil; and also, the interpretation of what is said concerning the 
wicked in verses 44-45, is according to their character, as described in the latter part of verse 43, the 
expression "because, even because" involving in the internal sense confirmation in their state as to the 
will and understanding together, and also internally and externally, since judgements have relation to 
what is internal and statutes to what is external.

Hence, then, we see how a comparison of the two parts of this section illustrates the subject; and 
enables us to perceive, and, in some measure, to realize, how the love and mercy of the Lord are 
extended and continued for ever even to the worst of human beings (Luke 13:34-35).

Leviticus Chapter 27

Summary of the Spiritual Sense

1. Every one who devotes himself to the Lord deliberately with the consent of the will and 

understanding, is estimated according to his quality or state as to the reception of good in truth 
from the Lord, vers. 1-8. 

2. Concerning the devotion of the interior natural affections to the service of the Lord and the 

estimation of their quality, vers. 9-13. 

3. The same with regard to the exterior natural affections, vers. 14-15. 
4. Concerning the devotion of the exterior natural man as to truth to the service of the Lord and its 

estimation in differing circumstances, vers. 16-25. 

5. Especially, no one ought to ascribe good to himself, because it is entirely from the Lord; impure
natural good, which is not from the Lord, is to be replaced by genuine good; no good from the 
Lord is to be alienated, or applied to selfish purposes; all remains must be acknowledged to be 
from the Lord; all good and truth with man must be acknowledged to be from the Lord by 
remains; and no one is allowed, from his self-derived intelligence, to estimate his own quality, 
vers. 26-33. 

6. And all these are the laws of Divine Order from the influx of Divine Good into Divine Truth, 

for the benefit of the spiritual man out of the pure love arid mercy of the Lord, ver. 34. 

The Contents of each Verse

1. And the LORD spoke to Moses, 

1. Further, there is revelation from the Lord by 

saying, 

Divine Truth giving the perception,

2. Speak to the children of Israel, and 
say to them, When a man shall 
accomplish a vow, the persons shall 
be for the LORD by your estimation. 

2. That the spiritual man must be instructed, that 
every one who devotes himself to the Lord 
deliberately with the consent of his will and 
understanding together, is estimated according to 
his quality or state as to the reception of good in 
truth from the Lord.

3. And your estimation shall be of the 
male from twenty years old even to 
sixty years old, even your estimation 
shall be fifty shekels of silver, after 
the shekel of the sanctuary. 

3. And thus those who are in the intelligence of truth 

and good, through which they are in the capacity 
to endure temptations are, according to Divine 
Truth, in a full state as to the reception of truth, 
which by temptation is to be conjoined with good.

4. And if it be a female, then your 

estimation shall be thirty shekels. 

4. But those who are in the intelligence of truth from 
the affection thereof without the knowledge, have 
less capacity to endure temptations, and cannot 
worship the Lord so perfectly.

317

5. And if it be from five years old even 
to twenty years old, then your 
estimation shall be of the male 
twenty shekels, and for the female 
ten shekels. 

5. Again, those who worship the Lord, or devote 

themselves to Him, in a state of ignorance as to 
truth and good, are saved because of their affection
for good, but are not in combat against evil from 
deficiency as to truths; but their quality if only in 
the affection of good is capacity for salvation by 
virtue of remains.

6. And if it be from a month old even to

6. But those who are in the good of infancy, when 

five years old, then your estimation 
shall be of the male five shekels of 
silver, and for the female your 
estimation shall be three shekels of 
silver. 

7. And if it be from sixty years old and 
upward; if it be a male, then your 
estimation shall be fifteen shekels, 
and for the female ten shekels. 

faith is only a germ, and charity is very little, have 
the quality of the spiritual life also small because 
there is little truth conjoined to affection; and even
smaller, where there is only affection and no truth.

7. And with those who are in the good of wisdom the
result of a full course of temptations, the quality of
life, when truth is abundant and conjoined with 
good, is a new state in which they act from love by
truth; but when little truth is conjoined with good 
their quality is from a full state of remains.

8. But if he be poorer than your 

estimation, then he shall be set 
before the priest, and the priest shall 
value him; according to the ability of
him that vowed shall the priest value 
him. 

8. But those who have no quality derived from truth 
are to be considered from their state of good, for 
good produces truths which express its quality; 
and according to truth from good with him who 
devotes himself to the Lord, is such a person to be 
estimated.

9. And if it be a beast, whereof men 

offer an oblation to the LORD, all that
any man gives of such to the LORD 
shall be holy. 

9. Also those who devote to the service of the Lord 
their interior natural affections by acknowledging 
that they are from Him, thereby enter into a state 
of holiness.

10. He shall not alter it, nor change it, a 
good for a bad, or a bad for a good: 
and if he shall at all change beast for 
beast, then both it and that for which 
it is changed shall be holy. 

10. Nor is it allowable for such a person to pass from a
prevailing state of good or truth, to a prevailing 
state of evil or falsity; nor can he who worships 
from an interior ruling affection, descend to one 
that is exterior; nor from an exterior ruling 
affection can he ascend to an interior; but if he 
fluctuates between good and evil in the course of 
temptation against his own will, then by victory 
good is confirmed and evil is rejected, both states 
of confirmation and rejection being holy.

318

11. And if it be any unclean beast, of 

which they do not offer an oblation 
to the LORD, then he shall set the 
beast before the priest: 

11. But if any one would devote his interior natural 
affections to the Lord, and yet they are impure, 
then he shall acknowledge his impurity before the 
Lord from his prevailing state of good;

12. And the priest shall value it, whether

12. And thence, also, he will know the quality of the 

it be good or bad: as you the priest 
values it, so shall it be. 

impure natural affections; and at the same time be 
able to estimate the sincerity of his worship.

13. But if he will indeed redeem it, then 
he shall add the fifth part thereof to 
your estimation. 

14. And when a man shall sanctify his 
house to be holy to the LORD, then 
the priest shall estimate it, whether it
be good or bad: as the priest shall 
estimate it, so shall it stand. 

13. And if he truly does the work of repentance, 

according to that state of worship, he will be in 
acknowledgement from some good of remains as 
well.

14. Also when a person would devote to the Lord, in 
worship, his exterior natural affections which are 
receptacles of good, then the quality of those 
affections is, again, according to his prevailing 
state as to good, because it is this which decides 
concerning the quality of worship.

15. And if he that sanctified it will 

15. And if the worshiper is willing to do the work of 

redeem his house, then he shall add 
the fifth part of the money of your 
estimation to it, and it shall be his. 

16. And if a man shall sanctify to the 
LORD part of the field of his 
possession, then your estimation 
shall be according to the sowing 
thereof: the sowing of a homer of 
barley shall be valued at fifty shekels
of silver. 

17. If he sanctify his field from the year 

of jubilee, according to your 
estimation it shall stand. 

repentance from the Lord, he will do this by some 
acknowledgement from his state as to remains of 
good, in addition to the acknowledgement that he 
is in evil; and thus he will appropriate good as 
from himself.

16. And when any one will worship the Lord by 

devoting to His service the exterior natural man as 
to truth, then the quality of such worship is, 
according to the reception of truth, in good, or 
according to the good of truth, and the state will be
full according to that good.

17. And further, if this state of worship is derived from
the marriage of good and truth in the inmost of his 
life, then it will be confirmed and the state of good
will be permanent.

18. But if he sanctify his field after the 
jubilee, then the priest shall reckon 
to him the money according to the 
years that remain to the year of 
jubilee, and an abatement shall be 
made from your estimation. 

18. But if this state of worship is not derived from 

such inmost conjunction, but looks forward to it, 
then from good its quality will be according to 
acquired truth implanted in good during the course
of regeneration, and consequently will be less 
perfect in the beginning.

319

19. And if he that sanctified the field 

19. But if the worshiper will persevere in doing the 

will indeed redeem it, then he shall 
add the fifth part of the money of 
your estimation to it, and it shall be 
assured to him. 

work of repentance from his state of good then he 
will not only worship the Lord from the good of 
repentance, but will also acknowledge, from some 
good of remains, that he receives continually new 
life from the Lord, and his state of good will be 
confirmed.

20. And if he will not redeem the field, 
or if he have sold the field to another
man, it shall not be redeemed any 
more: 

20. But if such worship is only temporary, and 

repentance does not follow; or if his good is 
alienated through confirmation in evil, then his 
redemption is impossible.

21. But the field, when it goes out in the 
jubilee, shall be holy to the LORD, as 
a field devoted; the possession 
thereof shall be the priest's. 

21. But in the Judgement every state of worship from 
the good of truth with man will have been, so far, 
to his advantage, because it was a holy state both 
as to truth and good; for all such states are from 
the Lord.

22. And if he sanctify to the LORD a 

22. And moreover, if such a state of worship is only 

field which he has bought, which is 
not of the field of his possession; 

put on, or acquired from merely external motives, 
and not from genuine good;

23. Then the priest shall reckon to him 
the worth of your estimation to the 
year of jubilee: and he shall give 
your estimation in that day, as a holy 
thing to the LORD. 

23. Then the quality of such worship will be discerned
from good, according to Divine Truth, with respect
to what the inmost state of the worshiper is or will 
be in the Judgement, and he will be compelled to 
acknowledge that genuine good was wanting;

24. In the year of jubilee the field shall 

return to him of whom it was bought,
even to him to whom the possession 
of the land belongs. 

25. And all your estimations shall be 
according to the shekel of the 
sanctuary: twenty gerahs shall be the
shekel. 

26. Only the firstling among beasts, 
which is made a firstling to the 
LORD, no man shall sanctify it; 
whether it be ox or sheep, it is the 
LORD's. 

24. And in the Judgement it will be seen to be from 
the Lord, from whom is all good, with the man 
who has acquired it by regeneration.

25. And the estimation of Divine Truth concerning the
state of man, is according to truth derived from 
good.

26. And good which is prior to truth, and is to be 

ascribed to the Lord, no man ought to claim as his 
own; whether it be natural good or spiritual good, 
it is from the Lord.

320

27. And if it be of an unclean beast, then
he shall ransom it according to your 
estimation, and shall add to it the 
fifth part thereof: or if it be not 
redeemed, then it shall be sold 
according to your estimation. 

28. Notwithstanding, no devoted thing, 
that a man shall devote to the LORD 
of all that he has, whether of man or 
beast, or of the field of his 
possession, shall be sold or 
redeemed: every devoted thing is 
most holy to the LORD. 

27. But impure natural good which is not from the 

Lord, is to be replaced by genuine good through 
Divine Truth; and in this way, good is to be 
acquired in the natural man by some 
acknowledgement from remains; and if the work 
of repentance is not performed, merely natural 
good is then rejected because it is not in harmony 
with Divine Truth.

28. Moreover, no affection or power that a man 

devotes to the Lord, from that life which seems to 
be his own, or at his own disposal, whether it be 
internal, interior, or external, is to be alienated or 
applied to selfish and worldly purposes; it is to be 
fully ascribed to the Lord.

29. None devoted, which shall be 

29. And, in short, nothing which is devoted to the 

devoted of men, shall be ransomed; 
he shall surely be put to death. 

30. And all the tithe of the land, whether 
of the seed of the land, or of the fruit 
of the tree, is the LORD's: it is holy to
the LORD. 

31. And if a man will redeem aught of 
his tithe, he shall add to it the fifth 
part thereof. 

32. And all the tithe of the herd or the 

flock, whatever passes under the rod,
the tenth shall be holy to the LORD. 

Lord from internal acknowledgement can be 
alienated by selfish love; it is fully ascribed to the 
Lord by the conjunction of truth with good, and 
therefore the old life must be rejected, and the new
life must be eternal.

30. And, also, all remains with man whether remains 
of truth or of good, are from the Lord; they are 
stored up in the man from the Divine mercy.

31. And in order that man may appropriate good to 
himself as if it were his own, by the work of 
repentance, he must acknowledge, from some 
good of remains, that it is entirely from the Lord.

32. And therefore all natural and spiritual good, which
are acquired by the power of the truth, by man 
acting as from himself, are to be acknowledged to 
be from the Lord by remains.

33. He shall not search whether it be 

33. For a man may not, from his self-derived 

good or bad, neither shall he change 
it: and if he change it at all, then both
it and that for which it is changed 
shall be holy; it shall not be 
redeemed. 

intelligence estimate his own quality as to good or 
evil; nor is it allowable to go back from good to 
evil; if, in the fluctuations of temptations, he fall 
into evil, he must worship the Lord both by 
resistance to evil, and determination to good, and, 
in this case, both states are sanctified; nor can man
then pass from a state of good and truth to a state 
of evil and falsity.

321

34. These are the commandments, which
the LORD commanded Moses for the 
children of Israel in mount Sinai. 

34. And all these are the laws of Divine Order from 
the influx of Divine Good into Divine Truth, for 
the benefit of the spiritual man, out of the pure 
love and mercy of the Lord.

References and Notes

1. This is evident, because by Jehovah is denoted the Divine Being as to His love, 2001; by 

speaking is denoted influx, 2951; by Moses is represented Divine Truth, or the Word, 7010; 
and by saying is denoted perception, 1791, 1822.

2. Speaking to the children of Israel, and saying to them, denotes that the spiritual man must be 
instructed, 3654, 7304; a man accomplishing a vow denotes one who devotes himself to the 
Lord deliberately, with the consent of the will and understanding together, 3732, 3880; and the
persons being for the Lord by "your estimation," denotes that such a one is estimated 
according to his quality or state as to the reception of good in truth from the Lord, 2001, 7010.

It is here to be understood, in the highest sense, that only Divine Truth discerns the real quality
of the worship of every one, and in a lower sense, that while good is the essence of the life of 
every regenerated man, truth is the form of that life, and therefore reveals the quality thereof.

3. The estimation of a male, 725, twenty years old, denotes those who are in the intelligence of 

truth and good, 2280, 10225; even to sixty years old denotes through which they are in the 
capacity to endure temptations, 3306, 8888; even your estimation denotes according to Divine 
Truth, 7010; fifty shekels of silver denotes a full state as to the reception of truth, 2261, 425, 
2959; and after the shekel of the sanctuary denotes "which by temptation is to be conjoined 
with good," 2959, 3210.

4.

If it be a female the estimation being thirty shekels, denotes that those who are in the 
intelligence of truth from the affection thereof without the knowledge, have less capacity to 
endure temptations, and cannot worship the Lord so perfectly, 725, 2276.

5. From five years old to twenty denotes those who worship the Lord, or devote themselves to 
Him, in a state of ignorance as to truth and good, 2280; your estimation denotes according to 
Divine Truth, 7010; twenty shekels for a male denotes salvation on account of good with some
truth, but not sufficient for combat, 2280, 725; and ten shekels for a female denotes that the 
quality, if only in the affection of good, is capacity for salvation by virtue of remains, 2280, 
725.

6.

7.

It being from a month old even to five years old, denotes those who are in the good of infancy,
when faith is only a germ and charity is very little, 2280, 10225; your estimation denotes 
according to Divine Truth, 7010; for a male five shekels of silver denotes the quality of 
spiritual life small, because there is little truth conjoined to affection, 725, 649, 10225; and for 
a female three shekels of silver denotes even smaller when there is only affection and no truth,
725, 44953, 10225.

It being from sixty years old and upwards denotes those who are in the good of wisdom the 
result of a full course of temptations, 10225; your estimation denotes according to Divine 
Truth, 7010; for a male fifteen shekels denotes the quality of life when truth is abundant and 

322

conjoined with good in a new state, in which they act from love by truth, 10225, 8400, 92965; 
and for a female ten shekels denotes that when little truth is conjoined with good their quality 
is from a full state of remains, 10225, 576.

8.

If he be poorer than your estimation being set before the priest denotes that those who have no 
quality derived from truth are to be considered from their state of good, 7010, 44594, 9946; the
priest valuing him denotes that good produces truths which express its quality, 4985; and 
according to the ability of him that vowed the priest valuing him denotes that according to 
truth from good with him who devotes himself to the Lord is such a person to be estimated, 
8304, 3732, 3880, 9946.

9. By a beast is denoted in relation to a man, or a "soul," interior natural affection, 1823; by 

offering an oblation is denoted that it is from the Lord, 349, 5619; and all that any man gives 
of such to the Lord being holy, denotes a state of holiness from true acknowledgement in 
worship, 8042.

10. Not altering it, nor changing it, denotes that it is not allowable for such a person to pass from a
prevailing state of good or truth to a prevailing state of evil or falsity, 1463, 683; not changing 
a good for a bad, nor a bad for a good, denotes that he who worships from an interior ruling 
affection cannot descend to one that is exterior; and the reverse, 1276, 1377; and if he shall at 
all change beast for beast, both it and that for which it is changed being holy, denotes that if 
man fluctuates between good and evil in the course of temptation, against his own will, then 
by victory, good is confirmed and evil is rejected, both states of confirmation and rejection 
being holy, 1823, 8042, 847.

11. It being any unclean beast of which they do not offer an oblation to the Lord, setting the beast 
before the priest, denotes that if any one would devote his interior natural affections to the 
Lord, and yet they are impure, then he shall acknowledge his impurity before the Lord from 
his prevailing or ruling state of good, 10130, 9946.

12. The priest valuing it whether it be good or bad, denotes that thence also he will know the 

quality of the impure natural affections, that is, from his state of good, 9946, 10217; and "as 
you the priest values it so shall it be," denotes that at the same time he will be able to estimate 
the sincerity of his worship, 9946, 10217.

13. If he will indeed redeem it, his adding the fifth part thereof to your estimation, denotes that if 

he truly does the work of repentance, according to that state of worship, he will be in 
acknowledgement from some good of remains as well, 2966, 6156.

14. Sanctifying his house to the Lord denotes devoting to the Lord, in worship, his exterior natural
affections, which are receptacles of good, 1488, 8042; the priest estimating it whether it be 
good or bad, denotes that the quality of those affections is still according to his prevailing state
as to good, 9946; and as the priest estimates so it standing, denotes "because it is this which 
decides concerning the quality in worship," 7724, 10217.

15. He that sanctified it redeeming his house, and adding the fifth part of the money of your 

estimation to it, and it then being his, denotes that if the worshiper is willing to do the work of 
repentance from the Lord, 2966, he will do this by some acknowledgement from his state as to

323

remains of good in addition to the acknowledgement that he is in evil, 6156; and it being his 
denotes that thus he will appropriate good as from himself, 1488.

16. A man sanctifying to the Lord a part of the field of his possession, denotes that when any one 
worships the Lord by devoting to his service the exterior natural man as to truth, 4982, 8042; 
this estimation denotes according to Divine Truth, 7010; according to the sowing thereof 
denotes that the quality of such worship is, as to the reception of truth in good, 9272; and the 
sowing of a homer of barley being valued at fifty shekels of silver, denotes according to the 
good of truth, and that the state will be full, according to that good, 9272, 10262, 7602, 2261, 
425, 2959.

17. "If he sanctify his field from the year of jubilee, according to your estimation it shall stand," 
denotes that if this state of worship is derived from the marriage of good and truth, in the 
inmost of his life, then it will be confirmed, and the state of good will be permanent, 4982, 
8042, 8802, 7010, 4926.

18. Sanctifying his field after the jubilee denotes a state of worship not derived from such inmost 
conjunction, but looking forward to it, 8802; the priest reckoning to him the money according 
to the years that remain to the year of jubilee, denotes that from good its quality will be 
according to acquired truth implanted in good during the course of regeneration, 9946, 10217, 
725, 2966.

19. He that sanctified the field indeed redeeming it; adding the fifth part of the estimation to it; 

and it being assured to him, denotes that if the worshiper will persevere in doing the work of 
repentance from his state of good, then he will not only worship the Lord from the good of 
repentance, but will also acknowledge from some good of remains, that he receives 
continually new life from the Lord; and his state of good will be confirmed, 4982, 8042, 2966,
6156, 4926.

20. Not redeeming the field denotes that such worship is only temporary, and that repentance does 
not follow, 2966; selling the field to another man denotes good alienated in consequence of 
confirmation in evil, 4758; and the field not being redeemed anymore, denotes that there is 
confirmation in evil; otherwise redemption would still be possible, 4747.

21. The field, when it goes out in the jubilee, being holy to the Lord, denotes that, in the 

Judgement, every state of worship from the good of truth will have been, so far, to the 
advantage of the worshiper, 4982, 8042, 8802; "as a devoted field," in the opposite sense, 
denotes what is utterly condemned from confirmation in falsity and evil, 9193; but in the best 
sense, what is holy since it was worship from truth and good, 8042; and the possession thereof
being the priest's denotes that all such states are from the Lord, 9946.

22. Sanctifying to the Lord a field which he has bought, which is not of the field of his possession,

denotes that if such a state of worship is only put on, or acquired, from merely external 
motives, and not from genuine good, 8042, 4982, 2967, 4397.

23. The priest reckoning to him the worth of your estimation, denotes that the quality of such 

worship "will be discerned from good, according to Divine Truth, 9946, 10217, 7010; to the 
year of jubilee denotes with respect to what the worshiper is, or will be, in the Judgement, as 
to his inmost state, 8802; and giving your estimation, in that day, as a holy thing to the Lord, 

324

denotes that he will be compelled to acknowledge, in that state, that genuine good was 
wanting, 2966, 8802, 7010, 2119.

24. In the year of jubilee the field returning to him of whom it was bought even to him to whom 

the possession of the land belongs, denotes that in the judgement, genuine good will be seen to
be from the Lord, from whom is all good with the man who has acquired it by regeneration, 
8802, 4982, 2028-9, 7833, 3239.

25. All "your estimation" being according to the shekel of the sanctuary, denotes that the 

estimation of Divine Truth concerning the state of man is according to truth derived from 
good, 10221, 2959; and twenty gerahs being a shekel denotes all remains of good, 10222.

26. The firstling among beasts denotes good which is prior to truth, 33258; made a firstling to the 
Lord denotes, evidently, what is ascribed to the Lord, 5619; no man (ish) sanctifying it denotes
that no one ought to claim it as his own, as well as that the mere knowledge of truth does riot 
produce a state of holiness, 33258; and it being the Lord's, whether it be ox or sheep, denotes 
that whether it be natural good or spiritual good it is from the Lord, 5913, 6126.

27. An unclean beast denotes impure natural good, 46, 10130; ransoming it according to your 

estimation denotes that it is to be replaced by genuine good through Divine Truth, 8078, 7010; 
adding the fifth part thereof denotes that in this way good is to be acquired in the natural man 
by some acknowledgement from remains, 6156; it not being redeemed denotes if the work of 
repentance is not performed, 2966, 8078; and it being sold according to your estimation 
denotes that merely natural good is then rejected because it is not in harmony with Divine 
Truth, 46, 4758, 7010.

28. No devoted thing that a man shall devote to the Lord, of all that he has, whether of man or 
beast, or of the field of his possession, being sold or redeemed, denotes that no affection or 
power that a man devotes to the Lord, from that life which seems to be his own, or at his own 
disposal, whether it be internal, interior or external, is to be alienated or applied to selfish and 
worldly purposes, 9193, 8042, 2001, 7424, 4982, 4758, 2966, 8078; and any devoted thing 
being most holy to the Lord, denotes that it is to be fully ascribed to the Lord, 8042.

29. None devoted, which shall be devoted of men being ransomed but surely put to death, denotes 
that nothing which is devoted to the Lord from internal acknowledgement can be alienated by 
selfish love; it is fully ascribed to the Lord by the conjunction of truth with good; and 
therefore the old life must be rejected, and the new life must be eternal, 9193, 683, 2966, 
4758, 1408, 1854.

30. All the tithe of the land, whether of seed of the land or of the fruit of the tree, being the Lord's;
and being holy to the Lord, denotes that, in fact, all remains, with man, whether remains of 
truth or good, are from the Lord; and are stored up in man from the Divine Mercy, 576, 57, 
8042.

31. A man willing to redeem aught of his tithes adding the fifth part, denotes that, in order that 

man may appropriate good to himself, as if it were his own by the work of repentance, he must
acknowledge, from some good of remains that it is entirely from the Lord, 2966, 6156.

32. All the tithe of the herd or the flock, whatever passes under the rod, the tenth being holy to the 
Lord, denotes that, therefore, all natural and spiritual good, which are acquired by the power 

325

of the truth, by man acting as from himself, are to be acknowledged to be from the Lord by 
remains, 576, 5913, 6126, 4876, 2001.

33. Not searching whether it be good or bad, neither changing it, denotes that a man may not from 

his self-derived intelligence estimate his own quality as to good or evil; nor is it allowable to 
go back from good to evil, 4162, 1276, 1377; if he change it at all, then both it and that for 
which it is changed being holy, denotes that if in the fluctuations of temptations he fall into 
evil, he must worship the Lord both by resistance to evil and by determination to good, 1823, 
847, 8042; and its not being redeemed denotes that neither can man then pass from a state of 
good and truth to a state of evil and falsity; or in other words, that a man cannot claim as his 
own the good and truth of remains which are wholly from the Lord, by the work of 
redemption, 2966.

34. These being the commandments, which the Lord commanded Moses for the children of Israel 
in Mount Sinai, denotes that all these are the laws of Divine Order, from the influx of Divine 
Good into Divine Truth for the benefit of the spiritual man out of the pure love and mercy of 
the Lord, 2634, 2951, 2001, 7010, 3654, 8753.

Discussion

We may depend upon it that there is a very good reason for the order in which the literal sense of the 
Word is given; in some cases we are not able to discover any reason; and in others we may be able to 
do so with more or less certainty. But we cannot tell from the literal or historical sense alone why one 
part comes before or after another, nor which book of the Word should come before or after another. 
We know that we have the Word at the present time with the books, and the parts of the books arranged 
in a certain order; and there is a certain mode of investigation called the Higher Criticism which, 
considering the books of the Word as if they were merely human literature, goes to show that those 
books were not written or composed in the order in which we have them. And in fact, the higher 
criticism concludes that the five books usually ascribed to Moses were not all written by him, but that 
some one else, hundreds of years afterwards, wrote one or more of them. But surely weight is to be 
attached to the general belief continued from age to age, and no doubt well founded on certain things 
said in the Word itself concerning these books. And we have mentioned this subject now because the 
last verse of the chapter just finished, and the last verse of the present chapter, is one of those things, 
and its testimony is that the book of Leviticus was written by Moses as a continuation of the Divine 
laws delivered to him in Mount Sinai. That this is the case also is evident from the frequent repetition 
of the words "The Lord spoke to Moses, saying," combined with the fact that the beginning of 
Leviticus is evidently a continuation of Exodus, the Lord delivering the laws concerning the sacrifices 
from the tent of meeting. Thus, then, it clearly appears that Moses himself wrote, under Divine 
inspiration and guidance, both the book of Leviticus and the book of Exodus, and this is confirmed 
from what is said in Exod 17:14, and 24:4, 7. But now, turning to Num. 33:2, we find the statement that
Moses wrote at the commandment of the Lord, an account of the journeyings of the Israelites from 
Egypt to the promised land, and thus was the writer of the book of Numbers; while also, turning to 
Deut 31:24-26, we find that he also wrote the book of Deuteronomy, or more correctly, the whole 
Pentateuch, because this "book of the law" was also called the "book of the covenant" with Abraham, 
Isaac and Jacob, and therefore contained the book of Genesis (Gen 26:42-45; 2 Kings 23:2, 21).

Thus, then, we see that the Word itself, in the Old Testament, distinctly affirms that Moses was the 
writer of all the books generally ascribed to him, which, as a matter of fact, constituted only one 

326

complete work. It is not surprising, therefore, that the New Testament speaks of all these as parts of the 
law of Moses. See for examples Matt 19:4-8; Luke 20:37; Matt 8:4; Luke 16:31.

Proceeding now with the subject before us, we remark that it is concerning the estimation or valuation 
of certain persons and things by Moses and the priests. And thus in the literal sense it is a limited 
estimation. But spiritually it is not so. For the internal sense is the universal sense, and has relation to 
mankind generally, and not to a particular nation, or to particular individuals in the nation. The 
estimation of Moses therefore is the Lord's estimation of every one by His Divine Truth. And there is 
never the slightest mistake in the Lord's estimation of any one. And, moreover, every person will have 
his position assigned to him to eternity according to the Lord's estimation. And this is so certain that the
position is determined and fixed in heaven or in hell according to our life in the world into which we 
are born because this world is the basis or the foundation upon which the life of each of us is built. And
this thought shows the importance of what we have here to study.

Next, however, it must be observed that although the estimation is the Lord's it is intended that man 
should understand it. To be worth a certain number of shekels, especially for a human being, appears 
very strange. But when we remember that numbering, measuring and weighing, in the internal sense, 
have relation to the discovery of our own quality, as to love and intelligence, we see that estimating 
ourselves and others, by means of power from the Lord to do so correctly, is a most valuable 
accomplishment. For although it is certainly the Lord and the Word from Whom and by which all 
estimation takes place, yet it is the man himself who actually fixes his own destiny, so that whatever it 
may be at last, he will always be perfectly satisfied with it. And that is why it is written, "So teach us to
number our days that we may get us a heart of wisdom" (Ps. xc, 12). Now we all understand this, and 
even without a critical knowledge of what are called correspondences, we feel the immensity and 
gravity of what we have to do. It is indeed exceedingly valuable to be able, from the Lord, to estimate 
the persons and things even in this natural world. The men who can do this most successfully, and 
properly apply their knowledge, are the best men; and those who cannot do this are, comparatively, of 
less value. But under any circumstances, the value of one human being is so great, compared with 
everything else, that the Lord does not allow any human being to be lost in the absolute sense of the 
term. There is a great difference between an angel and an infernal, because they are opposites, like 
good and evil, and truth and falsity. But all the same, in the sight of the Lord, the worst evil spirit is 
worth taking care of; and, of course, no one is ever compelled to be an evil spirit if he does not like. 
And we know that we never shall see things from the point of view of the Infinite. But with our finite 
capacities we are able, from the Lord, to be quite sure that no one could live in an eternal existence 
without being satisfied with his freely chosen life, and also without the unavoidable restraints involved 
in it.

Having considered the general truths connected with our subject, we may now take a general view also 
of the contents of this interesting description. It will have been noticed by the student that the four 
states described in the first section are all explained in the place referred to, namely, 10225; and as this 
explanation is very clear, it is not necessary further to enlarge on it now than to consider one or two 
points of a practical character. First, then, there is the fact that progression in regeneration is gradual, 
and is described by the different periods of man's natural life. Now regeneration is differently described
in different parts of the Word. For it is like a journey from one place to another; or it is compared to the 
cultivation of the ground. In one place it is called a work of creation, or in another it is said to be a new 
birth; and by these differing descriptions various truths concerning it are made manifest in the spiritual 
sense of the Word. But in every case it is gradual; and we have first the blade, then the ear, and after 
that the full corn in the ear. And it affords us some comfort to know that we must reach the kingdom of 

327

heaven by taking one step at a time. There is one thing, however, in the first section of this chapter that 
must be noticed. We are not to understand that every one is regenerated exactly as he advances from 
infancy to old age. Perhaps we may consider that this may be the case in certain instances; but 
observation and experience prove that the actual process may commence early or late in life; and that 
with some it does not take place at all. Thus, then, some persons may be only in the initiatory state 
symbolized by the period of natural life from infancy to five or ten years, when they are actually forty 
years of age, and yet the correspondence of the state of regeneration to that of the natural state called 
infancy may and does still hold good. And clearly it is necessary that we should remember this.

And another point is, that the different periods of life are not mentioned in regular order here, but the 
third commences the series, and is followed by the second, the first and the fourth, the section closing 
with the valuation of the poor by the priests and not by Moses. Now why is this? It seems to be because
the general subject of the whole chapter is the state of the Spiritual Church, and that, therefore, what 
relates to spiritual things takes the precedence, being described as to their internal, and then as to their 
external states, by the third period and the second, while what relates to things celestial follows, and is 
described first as to the innocence of ignorance, and secondly as to the innocence of wisdom, denoted 
respectively by first and fourth periods. But those who are poor signify persons of every class, who, 
from their state, can only be estimated as to good, and as to truth proceeding thence; and now follows, 
therefore, in order, what relates to the natural affections, interior and exterior, and also to the natural 
intellectual powers, or to the affections for knowledge as well as to the natural delights. And in 
reflecting on the particulars given in the fourth section, we cannot but be reminded of the searching 
character of the Word of the Lord by which every one is judged and estimated exactly according to his 
life, and of the absolute necessity of genuine repentance from the very best and highest motives. And 
we may, in this connection, profitably apply to ourselves the words of the psalm, "Search me, O God, 
and know my heart: try me, and know my thoughts; and see if there be any wicked way in me, and lead
me in the way everlasting" (Ps 139:23-24).

And finally, who does not see from even a cursory glance at the spiritual truths contained in the last two
sections, that they are of immense practical importance? For how very much disposed are we all, 
during the fluctuating states of our life, not only to ascribe the good which we do to our own 
intelligence and prudence, forgetting that it is the Lord from Whom all the power comes, but we are 
also greatly inclined to mistake our merely natural impulses to be kind and generous for real goodness! 
We learn from these teachings of the Word, however, that we ought properly to discriminate, and apply 
to the Lord, so that we may acquire the ability as we advance in regeneration to perceive the quality of 
merely natural affections, and to reject them, as well as to do real good, without claiming any merit for 
it; and we may be certain indeed that this ability will come to us just in proportion as our 
acknowledgement of the Lord is more and more from the heart, combined with an enlightened 
reception of Divine Truths, and their application to the purposes of daily life.
