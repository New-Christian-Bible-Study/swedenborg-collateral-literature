   CHAPTER I

   The Nature and Importance of the Doctrine

   "There are more arcana in the doctrine of reflection than in any other
   whatever." This arresting statement is found in number 733 of the
   Spiritual Diary by Emanuel Swedenborg. It seems to challenge the
   generally accepted view, for we have been prone to think of reflection
   as merely one form, among many, of mental activity. We would ordinarily
   place it in the same category as sensation, memory, imagination and
   thought. Why should it contain more arcana than any of these? Are there
   not other doctrines that are of even greater importance? Consider
   creation, redemption and glorification; or influx, providence and
   regeneration. Must these not have an even broader application than the
   doctrine of reflection?

   However, when we analyze the teaching of the Writings on the subject of
   reflection, we learn that it has a universal application because it
   underlies all the other operations of the human mind. All consciousness
   depends upon it. Without it there can be no sensation, memory,
   imagination or thought. Without it the Lord could not have effected the
   glorification of His Human; nor could He have provided for the
   regeneration of man and the salvation of the human race. Not only does
   it contain the key to the understanding of all the conscious activities
   of the human mind, but it explains all the countless phenomena of the
   spiritual world. The life of man on earth is distinguished from that of
   angels and spirits solely by the fact that they have a distinctly
   different plane of reflection. Because of this, the inhabitants of one
   world can be completely unconscious of those in the other world, and at
   the same time can be in constant and intimate association with them.
   Without this association there could be no conscious life in either
   world. Open communication between the two worlds is made possible only
   by bringing both men and spirits temporarily into a state of reflection
   that is common to both.

   Furthermore, the doctrine of reflection has never been revealed before
   in the entire history or the human race. The laws of reflection have
   indeed been operative from the beginning of time, but they have not
   been known. Men have enjoyed the benefits of their operation, and have
   taken them for granted without even trying to understand them. Just as
   the laws of gravity existed before the time of Newton, and those of
   electricity before Franklin began to investigate them, so the laws of
   reflection were operative before they were revealed in the Writings of
   the Lord's Second coming. They were unknown to the men of the Most
   Ancient Church who nevertheless had great heavenly wisdom. They were
   concealed from the men of the Ancient Church even in the days of its
   pristine glory. They could not be made known to those who belonged to
   the Jewish Church, nor even to Christians before the Lord had made His
   second coming. Only through the medium of one who could live
   consciously in both worlds at the same time, and who therefore could
   compare the two worlds and note how each was related to the other,
   could the laws of reflection be made known.

   These laws are now laid open by the Lord because some understanding of
   them is vital to the establishment of the New Church. Indeed the whole
   suppose of the Lord's Advent was that His heavenly kingdom may be
   established on the earth. By this is meant a kingdom of heavenly uses
   in which men may have a greater measure of responsibility and a greater
   sense of participation than was ever possible before. Being enabled to
   perform spiritual uses, men can receive the Lord's life in greater
   fullness and with deeper enjoyment; wherefore the Lord said to His
   disciples: AI am come that they may have life, and that they may have
   it more abundantly" (John 10:10). The ability to perform any use
   depends upon a knowledge and understanding of the laws that are
   applicable to it. Only the knowledge of spiritual laws can open the way
   to the performance of spiritual uses. The doctrine of reflection has
   been revealed to the end that men may be introduced to a whole new
   realm of spiritual uses, together with the joy of accomplishment that
   this makes possible.

   But what do we mean by "reflection?" The root meaning of the word
   "reflect" is to bend back. It refers to the bending back of any force
   that strikes upon a resisting object. Thus light is reflected from a
   mirror, and heat waves are reflected from a pavement. Similarly in
   regard to the things of the mind. A stream of sense-impulses is passing
   through the mind every waking moment. Only when this stream is arrested
   at some point, that is, when one pays attention to it, is it "bent
   back" or "reflected." Then for the first time does it produce a
   conscious sensation. We are said to "look" at something because it
   "strikes our fancy." We perceive it as something that has an important
   relation to our life, as something that gives either pleasure or pain.
   For this reason we "take an interest" in it, and are said to "reflect
   upon it." Thousands of sense-impulses pass by unheeded; but whatever we
   reflect upon is perceived and felt. We become aware of it. The impulses
   to which we do not pay attention nevertheless make an impression upon
   the mind, and are stored up in the interior memory, producing there an
   unconscious background out of which new sensations may arise; but the
   mental world in which we live is made up of a selected strand of
   sense-impulses to which we gay attention, upon which we reflect, and of
   which therefore we become conscious.

   The focus of attention varies with every one according to the love that
   is active in the mind at any particular time. For this reason the same
   experience will make a different impression upon different people. One
   will "see" what another passes by un-noticed. For this reason two
   people may derive from the same environment very different ideas, and
   thus may live in different mental worlds.

   Not only human beings, but animals also can reflect. They instinctively
   pay attention to the things in their environment that have relation to
   their life. They recognize their own food, and distinguish it from
   whatever would be injurious to their health. They know how to avoid
   their enemies, and how to protect their young. They can remember and
   recall sensations or experiences that are important to their life. They
   seek what is needful, and avoid what is hurtful. All this they do
   spontaneously without knowing why. But they cannot reflect upon
   themselves; that is, upon what takes place within their own mind. They
   are impelled by a single love which is their whole life, and this love
   dictates all their conscious sensations.

   Human beings, on the other hand, are capable of being influenced by
   various loves or affections. They therefore can see things differently
   at different times, or in different states of mind. While seeing an
   experience in one state of mind, they can still remember how it
   appeared under the influence of another affection. They can compare
   these two divergent impressions, and so can decide which they will
   retain as true, and which they will reject. Thus they can reflect, not
   only upon material objects, but also upon ideas, and can analyze the
   nature and quality of their own thoughts. Thus they have a plane of
   reflection that animals do not possess--a plane whereby they know
   themselves or become aware of the various loves by which they are moved
   at different times; and because of this they can choose the loves that
   are to qualify their life, and thus can determine their own character.
   In this ability lies the moral and spiritual freedom that distinguishes
   them from the animal creation and makes them human. That is what
   enables man to become aware of spiritual things, and thus to live in a
   spiritual world. It is the secret of his immortality.

   All conscious life is the product of reflection, but human
   consciousness is the product of spiritual reflection; that is,
   reflection upon the nature and quality of human life itself, its
   origin, its inner content, its relation, not only to the world of
   material objects but also to love itself, and thus to God. Of this, man
   becomes aware from the teaching of the Word concerning God; that is,
   concerning the essential quality of love and wisdom. Of this no man
   would become aware merely by reflecting upon his own inner feelings.
   These appear to arise within himself. He perceives them only as to
   their effects. He cannot know, apart from the teaching of the Word,
   that they inflow from the Lord through the spiritual world, and thus
   through angels and spirits in that world. Their origin is not in man,
   but outside of him; and only when this is realized can man understand
   that they are not inevitable. Man has the power to determine which of
   them he will make his own, and which he will reject. This no one could
   possibly know except by reflection upon the teaching of the Word.

   Man was endowed from creation with the faculty or spiritual reflection.
   As soon as man became capable of exercising this faculty, the human
   soul because immortal. Before this time it could hardly be said that
   "man" existed, except perhaps in potency. The foetus in the womb may be
   said to be "human" because of the human life in the seed that
   progressively builds the body of a potential man. But the foetus has no
   power of reflection, and therefore has no conscious life, either on
   earth or in the spiritual world. It is not the body, but the mind that
   makes the man. Without reflection there is no conscious mind, no
   awareness of life, no enjoyment of human qualities and attributes; that
   is, of love and wisdom which are the essential human.

   These qualities can be acquired only after birth, and even then, only
   by slow degrees. Reflection begins with an infant by noticing most
   general sensations--the contrast between light and shade, outline and
   what lies beyond, rough and smooth, loud and soft, and so forth. This
   is the first plane of consciousness. Only after innumerable such
   sensations have been perceived and stored in the memory can the infant
   begin to recognize the relation of various sensations to one another,
   and so to discover "things." Then for the first time does the infant
   begin to picture things in the imagination, and identify these mental
   pictures with names. He begins to ask "what" things are, and to reflect
   upon the combinations of many isolated sensations. Later the young
   child discovers what things do, what they are for, and how they can be
   used. When he begins to reflect upon this he no longer is satisfied to
   discover things and call them by name. He wants a story about them. He
   wants to know what they do and why they do it. Here again is a new
   plane of reflection that opens before the child a vast new world to be
   explored. As he grows older he begins to recognize abstract ideas,
   qualities of immaterial or spiritual things, things moral and
   philosophical, thoughts, truths, and affections or loves. Such are the
   stages of mental growth from infancy to adult age, and for this reason
   reflection upon spiritual things is not possible in childhood.

   The same law of mental development applies to the race. The first men
   achieved spiritual wisdom, but only by reflecting upon sensations. They
   perceived spiritual truths within the superficial appearances of
   nature, the shapes and colors of objects, the sounds of wind and wave,
   the contrast of light and darkness, of day and night. A study of what
   is involved in this kind of reflection would throw a flood of light
   upon the nature and mental quality of that most ancient wisdom, as
   contrasted with the wisdom that is common to man in modern times.

   In the Ancient Church reflection was centered upon knowledges drawn
   from the Word, from which arose the science of correspondences. Theirs
   was a different kind of wisdom, concerning which, perhaps we can have a
   somewhat better idea because it is something we also can experience.
   Yet unlike ourselves, those ancient people had no regard to scientific
   facts, to historic accuracy, but only to a parable, a story with a
   meaning.

   When the Lord came into the world, He introduced his disciples to still
   another plane of reflection; namely, of abstract ideas and their
   importance to man's spiritual life. He introduced not only the parable,
   but also the doctrinal sermon, and this became the chief focus of
   Christian worship. Such doctrine was the expression of a love, an
   affection, an emotion, rather than an intellectual understanding. That
   is why such irrational doctrines could be accepted on faith without
   understanding--the doctrine of a God in three persons, the doctrine of
   original sin and a vicarious atonement, the doctrine of the
   resurrection of the body, and many others.

   Not until the second coming of the Lord could man be given to reflect
   even upon reflection itself, and thus to understand spiritual things
   rationally, and so "enter intellectually into the mysteries of faith."
   Again a whole new world is presented for exploration--a world of
   spiritual use, of participation with the Lord in His Divine work of
   salvation, together with a sense of accomplishment end enjoyment never
   possible before. Because this new plane of reflection is of such vital
   importance to the establishment of the New Church, we have been moved
   to search out from the Writings the doctrine of reflection which alone
   brings that plane within the reach of human minds, and opens up a
   limitless opportunity for the establishment, by gradual stages, of the
   Lord's promised kingdom on earth.

                                                                         1

   THE DOCTRINE OF REFLECTION

   CHAPTER II

   Reflection and Human Freedom

   The very essence of human life consists of the two faculties called
   liberty and rationality, and both of these depend for their operation
   entirely upon man's ability to reflect. It is obvious, of course, that
   human freedom is by no means absolute. It is limited by many
   circumstances over which man has no control. No one, for instance, can
   choose his parents or his ancestors, although he derives from them
   hereditary tendencies that profoundly affect his life. He has no choice
   over the time or the place of his birth, and yet racial, national, and
   family customs play an enormous part in determining what every one
   thinks and feels. The times under which one grows up--times of peace or
   war, of economic prosperity or depression, may place many restrictions
   on one's opportunity to achieve the goals one might desire. Human
   freedom, therefore, does not imply an unlimited choice, but merely a
   choice between possible alternatives. This freedom may be enjoyed at
   times by all men regardless of external circumstances. Yet even this
   choice is real only so far as it is the result or rational judgment
   based upon reflection. If, when one is confronted by several
   alternatives, he merely yields unthinkingly to the one that seems to be
   the most desirable at the moment, he cannot be said to make a free
   choice. His action then is dictated by the force that exercises the
   greatest pressure upon his mind. He has been pre-conditioned for it by
   some natural impulse, by previous experience, or by instruction and
   education. This is the case with the great majority of human choices.
   They can be traced to some prior cause and for this reason many
   scientific psychologists are led to believe that man has no choice that
   is really free. This is certainly true of children whose behavior is
   determined either by their native disposition, by whatever emotion
   happens to be strongest at any given time, or by habits that have been
   acquired under the influence of parents and teachers. It cannot be
   otherwise before they have learned how to think; that is, how to
   reflect and judge for themselves. It is well recognized that no choice
   can be free unless it is based upon rational judgment. For this reason
   no one is held responsible under the law before he becomes adult. Even
   in adult age, no one can be blamed for what he does under the stress of
   extreme pain, or rear, or any overpowering passion.

   It should be noted that the ability to reflect is progressive. It
   begins in earliest infancy by reflection upon very general
   sensations--the contrast between light and shade, smooth and rough,
   light and heavy, round and square. Gradually one becomes aware of
   boundaries with spaces in between, of strongly contrasting colors, and
   by degrees one learns to notice more particular distinctions. Only
   after innumerable sensations have been stored in the memory can one
   begin to realize how they are related to one another. One must see
   objects, feel them, and note their qualities from many different angles
   before one can even begin to understand "what" they are. Thousands of
   isolated sensations must be ordered by the mind to form the idea of a
   "thing." Only then can it be pictured in the imagination, remembered,
   and recalled even when the object is not present. Only then can one ask
   for it by name. All this results from noticing how all sensations are
   intimately related to one another. By this kind of reflection, an
   ever-increasing number of mental pictures called "things" are built up,
   producing a whole world of marvels to be explored. But even then, one
   wilt not understand what these things really mean until he begins to
   reflect upon what they do, only then can he realize what they are for,
   and how they can be used, and this requires a higher kind of reflection
   which opens up a new and unlimited. field of exploration. Such are the
   successive stages by which the mind of every infant grows.

   There can be no rational judgment without knowledge, and all knowledge
   must be derived, in the last analysis, from bodily sensation.
   Furthermore, sound judgment requires a sufficiency of accurate
   knowledge. No choice that is truly free can be based on ignorance or on
   incorrect data. Nor can a choice be free that is not based upon a
   genuine sense of values, that is, a sense of what is really most
   desirable because it will promote the greatest good. Without this even
   the most accurate knowledge may be used for an unworthy purpose. To do
   this is an abuse of free choice that can result only in human bondage
   because it causes man to act contrary to the Laws of nature, and
   contrary to the laws of God. What the laws of nature are no one can
   learn without subordinating his own opinions to the test of experience;
   and what the law of God is, no one car, realize without submitting his
   mind to the teaching of Divine revelation. That is why the Lord said to
   "those Jews who believed on Him, If ye continue in My Word, then are ye
   My disciples indeed, and ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall
   make you free" (John 8:31, 32).

   All children begin with the idea that freedom consists in the ability
   to do whatever one pleases. They look forward eagerly to growing up in
   order that they may be liberated from the bond of obedience to parents
   and teachers, and may come into this kind of absolute freedom. Only by
   slow degrees can they learn that there are laws which no one may
   successfully defy. The laws of nature are inscribed by the Divine
   Creator on all things of the material world; and the laws of spiritual
   life, as revealed in the Word, determine irrevocably the relation of
   human beings to one another and to the Lord. All freedom arises from
   willing obedience to these laws; nor can any one obey them willingly
   unless he know; them, and freely chooses, from rational judgment, to
   follow them. In doing so man achieves a true sense of freedom in which
   there is fullness of joy and blessing. This is the secret, or human
   happiness. Wherefore it is written: "The judgments of the Lord are true
   and righteous altogether...in keeping them is great reward" (Psalm
   19:9, 11).

   The Writings, therefore, make a clear distinction between apparent
   freedom and real freedom, showing that this latter can be attained only
   through the knowledge, the acknowledgment, and the rational
   understanding of truth, and this depends entirely upon reflection.

   Rational reflection is a distinctly human faculty. By this man is
   distinguished from the animal creation, as we have already pointed out.
   Animals reflect upon sensations as affecting their bodily life either
   for good or ill. They react to them spontaneously, not knowing why.
   They can have no concept of "things" but only or sensations that
   satisfy physical needs, longings and appetites, or that give pain and
   warning of danger to their life. After all, the concept of a "thing" is
   an abstraction made possible by reflecting upon relations. Of this,
   animals are incapable because their whole life is dominated by a
   corporeal love, the love of the body and its life. Man alone is endowed
   with a love that makes him sensitive to things immaterial and
   spiritual. He has a soul by virtue of which he is able to live
   consciously in a spiritual world, sensing the objects of that world
   even as animals sense the objects of nature. He has an inner mind
   whence to look down upon his physical sensations, perceive their
   relations to one another, their true quality, and the use for which
   they are intended. That is what is meant in Genesis, where it is
   written: "The Lord God planted a garden eastward in Eden; and there He
   put the man whom He had formed...to dress it and keep it" (Genesis 2:8,
   15). In this garden there were two trees, the "tree of life" and the
   "tree of the knowledge of good and evil." By the "tree or life" is
   meant the perception of things heavenly and Divine; and by the "tree of
   the knowledge of good and evil" is meant the perception of things
   worldly and corporeal. The "tree of life" represents a mind formed by
   love to the Lord and charity toward the neighbor, while the "tree of
   the knowledge of good and evil" represents a mind formed the pleasures
   of the body and of the world. This latter is called the "animus," which
   is a mind that man has in common with animals; but the former is called
   the "mens," an inner mind that is strictly human and belongs to man
   alone. It is called a "rational" mind because by means of it man can
   reflect upon relationships, can deduce reasons and can perceive uses.
   He can sense higher values whence comes a conscience whereby to govern
   and control, his animal nature, that it may serve and promote the ends
   of a spiritual love. Concerning this ability we read in Divine
   Providence 75:

   "Man has not only the affection of natural love but also the affection
   of spiritual and...[celestial] love. For the human mind is or three
   degrees.... Wherefore a man can be raised from natural knowledge into
   spiritual intelligence, and from this into...[celestial] wisdom; and
   from these two, intelligence and wisdom, he can look to the Lord, and
   thus be conjoined with Him, by which means he lives forever. But as to
   the affection there would not be this elevation unless man had from
   rationality [the] ability to elevate the understanding, and from
   liberty, ability to wish to do so. By means of these two
   faculties...[man] is able to reflect within himself upon the things
   which he perceives...through the bodily senses; and he can also think
   above concerning what he is thinking below. For any one can say, I have
   thought this, and I think this. Also, this I have willed, and this I
   will; or again, I understand this, that it is so, and I love this
   because it is such; and so on. Thus it is manifest that a man can think
   above the thought, seeing it as beneath him. This ability a man has
   from rationality and from liberty, from rationality that he can think:
   higher, and from liberty, that from affection he wills to think so; far
   unless he had liberty so to think, he would not have the will, and thus
   not [have] the thought. Wherefore they who do not wish to understand
   any thing but what is of the world and its nature--not even what moral
   and spiritual good and truth are--cannot be raised from knowledge into
   intelligence, still less into wisdom, for they have blocked up these
   faculties. They therefore make themselves men only in being able to
   understand, if they wish, and in being able to wish, from the
   rationality and liberty implanted in them. From these two faculties one
   is able to think and to speak from the thought. In all other things
   they are not men, but beasts; and some, from the abuse of these
   faculties, are worse than beasts."

   The knowledge of things both spiritual and natural must enter the mind
   by way of the bodily senses. For this reason the Word must be given in
   forms that can be sensually perceived, and primarily through sight and
   hearing. In ancient times it had to be spoken by the prophets in words
   that men could hear and understand; or it; had to be written by them in
   books that men could read. It was spoken by the Lord Himself when He
   was in the world, and was perpetuated by the inspired writings of the
   Evangelists. Finally, it was imparted in rational language that lays
   open the deeper meaning of the Scripture through the Writings of
   Emanuel Swedenborg. By this means there is imparted to man a vision of
   God and a perception of His Divine and Infinite qualities, which could
   not be transmitted by nature alone. Nature is so vast, so complex, so
   apparently self-sufficient, that man cannot penetrate its superficial
   appearances to perceive the Divine life within it. In the Word, the
   objects of nature are selected, arranged, and ordered into a simplified
   form through which the Divine may in some measure be seen. This becomes
   more and more evident as man reflects upon the teaching of the Word,
   from a love that has been insinuated into his mind especially during
   infancy and childhood by influx out of heaven. Thence comes the desire
   to know and understand what the Word teaches. It causes man to reflect
   upon it, and thus to become aware of its deeper meaning, by this mode
   alone does man come to know the laws of God, that he may reflect upon
   them, and learn, in increasing measure, to understand them and take
   delight in them. From this comes genuine freedom--freedom, that is, to
   choose between the promptings of the animus or external mind and those
   of the mens or internal mind. This choice is possible only so far as
   the teaching of the Word is known, that it may be compared to the
   outward appearances or nature, and so far as man freely, as a result of
   rational reflection, adopts the teaching of the Word as the law of his
   life. This is the key to a truly religious life. Everyone must learn
   the truth of the Word by his personal reading and reflection, that he
   may accept it, not on the testimony of others, but because the Lord
   Himself has said it, and because the man himself understands it, and
   acknowledges it to be the truth. Then for the first time can the Lord
   from his conscience, direct his judgment, and lead him in the way to
   true freedom and everlasting happiness.

                                                                         2

   THE DOCTRINE OF REFLECTION

   CHAPTER III

   The Plane of Reflection Determines the Objective World in which We Live

   We have stated that conscious life can result only when the forces of
   the spiritual world interact with the forces of the material world. The
   constant stream of sense-impulses striking upon the cerebrum makes no
   distinct or meaningful impression upon the mind unless its flow is
   checked by same love that affects the mind from the spiritual world.
   That is what causes one to notice, to pay attention, and thus to become
   aware. The reason is, that regarded in themselves sense-impulses have
   no meaning. They enter haphazardly through sight, hearing, taste, smell
   and touch, in a confused and disordered stream of separate and
   unrelated impressions. They may be compared to flotsam and jetsam
   washed up by the tide. Yet they are the only materials out of which any
   idea of shape, or form, or tangible substance may be produced in the
   mind. Love selects from them whatever is in accord with its purpose,
   and orders it to form a mental picture that has significance. It is
   perceived either as delightful or undelightful, as something that
   imparts pleasure or pain. It is felt either as accordant with the life
   of man's love, or as injurious to it. Sense-impulses therefore provide
   the material out of which form is produced; while love brings scattered
   parts into mutual relationship and reveals their quality, that is,
   their use. This perception of quality is that which causes the mind to
   notice, and thus to become conscious.

   Love therefore produces reflection. It reaches out to hold and to
   increase any sensation that is delightful, and to shrink from that
   which is perceived as painful, and to try to escape from it. This
   spontaneous reaction is what we call the will; and the form that
   pictures it in the mind is called the understanding. These two combine
   to produce conscious life, and without them both no consciousness is
   possible.

   This applies to animals as well as to human beings. The soul of every
   animal is a love which enables him to perceive the quality of
   sensations that impinge upon him from his material environment. It
   causes him to feel sensations either as pleasant or unpleasant, and
   thus to become aware of their relation to his physical life. However,
   he cannot reflect upon the quality or his love. That is because he is
   moved by only one love, and cannot compare it with other affections.
   Human beings, on the other hand, are affected by various loves. They
   can compare them and note their differences. They can distinguish
   between loves that are conducive to their well-being and happiness, and
   those that are not. They therefore can reflect upon the quality of
   spiritual forces and can picture them in the form of spiritual ideas.
   That is why men can become conscious of a spiritual world, and can
   perceive what are called human values. Reflecting upon these things,
   man can become aware of deeper longings, of delights which physical
   pleasures do not satisfy. This, because man, unlike animals, is endowed
   with an inner mind sensitive to the forces and the objects of a
   spiritual world, and is capable of perceiving their relation to his
   life.

   Because consciousness requires the interaction between two worlds, man
   may be said to live in both worlds at the same tide. Indeed, the
   spiritual world and the natural world are so intimately associated that
   the one cannot exist without the other. That is because the spiritual
   world is a world of causes, and the natural world is a world of
   effects. There can be no effect without a cause, and no cause without
   an effect. For this reason there cannot be two separate worlds, each
   existing by itself. There can be only a dual world, composed of two
   constantly interacting parts. For the same season man cannot have two
   separate minds, one wholly sensual and natural, and the other purely
   spiritual. He must have two distinctly different organs of sensation,
   one sensitive to spiritual forces, and the other sensitive to material
   forces; but these can produce no mental consciousness except as they
   act in concert.

   Why then is it, we may well ask, that man, to all appearance, lives for
   a time in the natural world, being altogether oblivious of his
   spiritual environment; and then, when the body dies, awakens to all the
   wonders of the spiritual world while becoming altogether oblivious of
   things natural and material? It is indeed a remarkable provision of the
   Divine Providence that men on earth live solely in their own world, and
   spirits, after death, similarly live in theirs, in spite of the fact
   that both are under the constant influence of both worlds. This can be
   true only because in each world conscious life is determined by the
   plane on which reflection takes place.

   During his life on earth, man is so dependent upon physical sensation
   that he cannot think apart from space and time. His love, and therefore
   his attention, are focused upon the needs of the body and the natural
   world. He can conceive of that which is spiritual only in relation to
   these things. He feels affections as if they originated within himself,
   and can conceive of them only as abstractions. He may learn from
   revelation that he is constantly being influenced by spirits and
   angels, but this is a matter of knowledge, not of sensible experience.
   For this reason he is unaware of his spiritual environment, and he
   cannot visualize the spiritual world as existing outside of himself
   except in terns of space and time. The chief reason why this is so is
   that all sensation comes to him by way of the material body and its
   organs of sensation. The body may be compared to a glove through which
   all sensation must pass, and by which the sensation is rendered vague,
   general and imperfect. As long as one is in the body he can reflect
   only upon what he feels through this gross covering. He can be aware of
   nothing else. Indeed, he cannot even imagine how keen and how
   delightful sensation would be if this covering were removed. Consider
   how limited is the range of our sense organs. The eye responds only to
   those light waves that lie within the spectrum, although there are
   indefinite extensions of these waves beyond that which we know as red
   light in one direction, and what is called violet light in the other.
   So also the human ear is sensitive to only a few of the sound
   vibrations that fill the air around us, and even these must be of a
   sufficient intensity to be heard. So also with taste, smell and touch,
   all of which function only within a limited range, and remain oblivious
   to whatever lies beyond. It is true that sight may be considerably
   expanded by mechanical means, by the use of the microscope or the
   telescope. The ability to hear may be increased by electrical aids. All
   one's senses may be perfected by training and experience. But still
   much remains beyond the horizon of our perception. Consider also how
   the normal function of our sense organs may be impaired by accident or
   disease, which in extreme cases shuts out all sensation.

   Nevertheless, during his life on earth, man can enjoy no physical
   sensation apart from love; and after death he can enjoy no spiritual
   sensation apart from the memory of bodily sensation. Every impulse that
   has reached the brain, whether it has been consciously perceived or
   not, is retained in the interior memory, and becomes the basis for all
   ideas of form or shape possible to the spirit in the after life.
   Furthermore, after the death of the body the spirit remains in constant
   communication with the world of nature, not immediately, but through
   the minds of men still living on earth. Whatever men picture in the
   imagination affects the spirits who are associated with them,
   performing for them the same function that physical sensation performs
   for man on earth. For this reason it is said that "heaven rests upon
   the human race as upon its foundation." If the race on earth should
   perish, or if the bond of communication between the two worlds should
   in any way be broken, the angels and spirits would become unconscious
   as if in a swoon. And it is equally true that if men on earth were cut
   off from all influx from spirits and angels they would be moved by no
   love, no desire or interest, and would, in consequence, become
   unconscious.

   The restriction imposed by the material body affects not only the
   ability to feel material objects, but also the ability to perceive
   spiritual things. We can respond to affections and thoughts only
   according to states of both body and mind. We experience moods of
   sadness or of elation for no discernible reason, and these qualify all
   our conscious life. Because our plane of reflection is in the natural
   world, we imagine that material things are like source of our
   happiness, and therefore we labor constantly to amass worldly
   possessions. Only by degrees can we learn to distinguish between that
   which is spiritual and that which is natural. We may learn of the
   existence of God, of heaven, and of truly human qualities as distinct
   from the things of earth, but at first we perceive this only as
   abstract knowledge. We continually gravitate to the delight of external
   sensations; and because we have to struggle to grasp the delight of
   heavenly things, the effort to do so cannot be long maintained. Yet the
   Lord, through the angels, and directly by the teaching of His Word,
   constantly stirs within us a sense of love to Him, of charity toward
   the neighbor, of delight in use. By these means He repeatedly calls to
   us, even as He called to Abram, so long ago, saying: "Get thee out of
   thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house, unto a
   land that I will show thee; and I will make thee a great nation, and I
   will bless thee, and make thy name great, and thou shalt be a blessing"
   (Genesis 12:1, 2).

   This is a call to withdraw the mind from the constant stream of bodily
   sensations, and from dependence upon ideas of space and time, that we
   may become aware of the qualities of love and wisdom, which at first
   appear only as abstract and intangible entities. This is essential if
   we are to acquire any concept of the difference between right and
   wrong, good and evil, truth and falsity. In no other way can we be
   gifted with a conscience whereby to form our character. Nevertheless,
   as long as we are on earth, we do not normally reflect upon these
   spiritual things. The needs and desires of the body are so immediate,
   and so pressing that we cannot ignore them. They take precedence over
   the needs of the spirit. Try as we may we cannot think for long apart
   from them; and for this reason we cannot reflect while in the body, as
   we will be able to reflect after the body has been laid aside. We can
   indeed elevate our minds "almost into the light in which the angels
   are," and so doing, from time to time we can catch a glimpse of
   heavenly joys, that we may learn to strive for them.

   "Man," we read, "so long as he lives in the world...cannot be elevated
   into very wisdom, such as the angels have, but only into higher light,
   even up to angels, and can receive enlightenment from their light, that
   flows in from within and illuminates....The natural mind may be raised
   up into the light of heaven in which angels are, and may [thus]
   perceive naturally, thus not so fully, what the angels perceive
   spiritually; nevertheless, man's natural mind cannot be raised into
   angelic light itself" (DLW 256, 257). The reason is that while he is on
   earth, man cannot reflect apart from his material environment. He
   cannot wholly remove from his mind ideas of space and time. He
   therefore cannot visualize a spiritual world as existing outside of
   himself, and as consisting of visible, tangible forces and objects
   without ascribing to these the properties of matter. Although he is
   being influenced by loves, and is capable of forming abstract ideas of
   human qualities, he remains completely oblivious to the world in which
   spirits and angels live.

                                                                         3

   THE DOCTRINE OF REFLECTION

   CHAPTER IV

   The Value and Importance of a Fixed Environment

   We have pointed out that during his life on earth all man's conscious
   sensations come to him through the material body, which is like a glove
   that covers the spirit. To this rule we must note certain exceptions.
   There may be a partial and temporary removal of this covering while man
   is still living in the body. This was the case with the ancient
   prophets when they were in a state of spiritual vision, or in dreams.
   At such times, the life of the body was, as it were suspended. The mind
   was withdrawn from reflection upon physical sensations, and focused
   upon the impulses that come from the spiritual world. The prophet
   became aware of his spiritual environment and was brought into open
   communication with spirits and angels. He "saw a vision, he heard a
   voice, or he dreamed a dream." His personal will was quiescent, and he
   was swept along by the current of spiritual affections that impinged
   upon the internal mind. Because the individual will was quiescent, the
   Lord could move him to see, to feel, and to say things far beyond his
   comprehension so that he might become a medium for the giving of the
   Divine Word. This however is not a normal state of life, but one that
   is induced from time to time under the immediate control of the Divine
   Providence.

   The two worlds are so intimately interrelated that such an opening of
   the spiritual sight is possible, and it may take place in varying
   degrees in order to meet some specific need. It produces the experience
   of what men call extra-sensory perception, of which there is
   unquestionable evidence, although it may often be confused with pure
   imagination, with ordinary dreams, or with deliberate pretense of
   spiritual insight for the sake of some selfish purpose. It is so
   important for men on earth to live as if in a purely natural world, and
   for spirits and angels to live as if in a purely spiritual world, that
   any deliberate attempt to penetrate the veil is said to be contrary to
   order. Warning against this is given because it can be destructive of
   all free choice and rationality, without which regeneration is not
   possible.

   Whatever one perceives through the glove of physical sensation is
   necessarily vague and general. When this covering is removed one enjoys
   far keener sensations and perceptions that are incomparably more
   delightful. Particulars become clear that had been sensed only as a
   confused mass without distinctions. What has been seen, as it were
   through a mist, becomes sharply defined. The fact that this is
   impossible as long as man lives in the body appears indeed as a great
   disadvantage, yet it is a very important necessity, and is compensated
   by the fact that on earth man is surrounded by a fixed environment. By
   means of sense organs and the connecting system of nerves the mind is
   brought into contact with the material creation. In no other way can
   man be given the opportunity of free choice on which depends the
   formation of human character.

   Because of this, men on earth enjoy a kind of freedom quite different
   from that of spirits and angels. In order to progress from place to
   place there must be ground on which to walk, propellers by which to
   move through water or air, or some form of jet propulsion by which to
   explore outer space. There must be something hard, solid, resistant to
   react against. No one can lift himself by his bootstraps. He must be
   able to lay hold of something outside of himself. This is just as true
   or the mind as it is of the body. One's state of mind cannot be changed
   except by contact with something fixed outside of itself. There must be
   facts which are dependable, and at the same time independent of any
   individual opinion. There must be principles on which one may rely with
   certainty from which to reason. There must be truth which transcends
   reason--truth which is self-evident or axiomatic, from which to think.
   The foundation of all natural knowledge and intelligence is the world
   of nature; and the foundation of all spiritual intelligence and wisdom
   is the Word of Divine revelation. These are called the "two foundations
   of truth" because they are fixed and unalterable, and because they
   exist independently of the human mind, as something the mind may lay
   hold upon to progress, to change its state, to determine its character.

   The purpose of man's life on earth is that he may freely choose what he
   will love above all things, and what, from love, he will think and
   believe. To this end he is presented with alternatives, and finds it
   necessary to accept one in preference to the other. Every action he
   takes of his own will involves such a choice. No one can go in two
   different directions at the same time. If he moves at all he must adopt
   one way and reject the other. As he does this persistently he
   establishes habits of both will and thought, as a result of which the
   choice becomes progressively easier, more spontaneous and effortless.
   It becomes natural to him, and so is appropriated as his own or as his
   very life. When such a choice has been made and confirmed by living
   experience, it remains, not because it could not be changed, but solely
   because there is no will or desire to change it. So far as this is the
   case man's character has been fixed to eternity because even the Lord
   will not compel him to change against his will. To do so would destroy
   his individuality, in the exercise of which all the joy of life
   resides. One who has made such a choice on earth has irrevocably
   determined his place in the spiritual world, whether it be in heaven or
   in hell, and that is why it is said, "As the tree falls, so shall it
   lie." Whatever love man has adopted may be perfected to eternity, but
   it cannot he changed or replaced by any other love.

   Every one is confronted by many alternatives during the course of his
   natural life; but there is one fundamental choice that embraces and
   determines the character of all the others. It is this: will he claim
   his life as his own to do with as he pleases, or will he acknowledge
   that it is a gift from God to be used in accord with the Lord's will
   rather than his own. No one of sound mind who reaches adult age can
   avoid making this decision, at least in some degree. He must decide to
   act in accord with his conscience or against it, and this whether his
   conscience is true or false. By a conscience here is meant whatever he
   has come to believe is right because it is decreed by God. One who
   persistently strives to obey his conscience is said to be "innocent"
   because he is willing to be led and taught; and such a one however
   ignorant or mistaken he may be, will come at last into heaven. Such is
   the universal mercy and lovingkindness of the Lord. Only those who have
   persisted in self-will during their life on earth will find the gates
   of heaven closed against them in the other life, but only because they
   refuse to enter, and deliberately choose the life of hell.

   Although those who die in infancy and childhood cannot make such a
   choice, they still can be prepared for heaven in the other life because
   they are innocent, and have not confirmed themselves against the Lord's
   leading. They can be educated by the angels; and when they reach mature
   age they can be introduced into the world of spirits, where they come
   in contact with evil spirits, and can learn to resist temptation, and
   so make the life of heaven their own by individual choice.

   That which produces free choice is a love. This causes one to reflect,
   that is to notice, to pay attention. There constantly pours in upon the
   mind a stream of sensations or impulses, all of which are transmitted
   to the brain by the nerves, and there knock upon the door of the mind.
   For the most part this knocking is unheeded, and therefore produces no
   conscious sensation. But when the mind is moved from within, that is,
   from the spiritual world, by a love or desire, that love reaches out to
   lay hold of any sense-impulses which it spontaneously recognizes as
   harmonious with itself, and thus as giving pleasure. It focuses the
   mind upon such sense-impulses, drawing them out from the confused
   background of unconscious sensations, end forming from then a mental
   picture, an ideal, a promise of achievement for which to strive. Such
   an ideal may be retained in the memory and recalled long after it has
   been superseded by other sensations.

   In this way the mind, in accord with its active affection or interest,
   creates its own mental world consisting of those things to which it
   pays attention, at the same time ignoring or by-passing many sensations
   that appear irrelevant or of no consequence to its life. Furthermore,
   the love spontaneously seeks to impose its ideal upon the material
   environment, to make it actual by bringing all things in the
   environment into accord with it. Here is where the fixed surroundings
   play a vital role. They do not readily yield to the demands of the
   love. Their resistance compels man to search, to investigate, to
   struggle in the attempt to achieve what his love envisages. Only
   partially can they be adapted to that ideal. In large measure they
   prove to be intractable, and the ideal must be modified accordingly.
   Seldom if ever, does one find the actual accomplishment of an objective
   fully satisfying. To some degree the goal may be changed, the imagined
   purpose altered by external necessity. And because ideals are born of
   ignorance or of insufficient knowledge, one may grow more intelligent
   and wiser by experience. By the insistent requirements of a fixed
   environment man may learn to obey the laws of Divine order, all of
   which are inscribed from creation upon the objects and the forces of
   nature.

   Love does not arise within the human mind. It comes from spirits and
   angels in the other world with whom a man is associated. Any love that
   is active in the mind produces reflection, determines what a man shall
   seek and what he shall avoid, therefore what shall form the field of
   his consciousness. It would appear, therefore, as if man has no mind of
   his own, but is merely swept along by whatever love inspires him. Yet
   this does not follow, because man can be moved by many different
   affections at different times. While he is under the influence of one
   love, he can still remember others that have moved him in the past.
   Among these memories be may choose one, and by an act of will he may
   focus his attention upon the objects associated with it.

   Reflecting upon such objects opens the gate of influx from these
   spirits or angels who find in such objects an ideal or goal of
   accomplishment. Because of this, man can control the spirits who shall
   influence him. He can attract certain spirits and force others to
   withdraw. This also is possible because of a fixed environment. Man can
   purposely turn his attention from one thing to another, and so doing
   can determine what spirits shall influence his mind. The ability to do
   this is the source of all human freedom, and yet it often appears as a
   cause of bondage. We are confronted by immediate and imperative needs
   that compel us to shift our attention. There are times for work, and
   times for rest. There is hunger that demands attention for the
   sustenance of the body. There are obligations to others that must be
   taken care of at specific times, dates to be kept, crucial
   circumstances to be met that cannot be delayed. Indeed, man's life is
   made up of constant interruptions that may be very annoying, but that
   cannot be avoided. For this reason man is constantly being forced to
   pay attention to other things, to break his line of thought, and so to
   drive away certain spirits and invite others to influence him. Too long
   a concentration upon one thing leads to weariness, and at last to utter
   inability to think and act. This is the great need for a change of
   occupation, a vacation, by which to renew one powers of perception and
   understanding. By means of necessities the Divine Providence leads us
   whither we would not go. New influences from the other world, and new
   opportunities resulting open up vistas of inspiration and insight we
   could not have foreseen. Yet within the framework of all these
   necessities, man has the freedom, and the responsibility to determine
   what he will love most of all, what he will repeatedly come back to,
   despite all interruptions.

   We see therefore, that while the first condition of life on earth,
   namely, the covering of a material body, places a restriction upon our
   power of reflection, and one which appears to be a serious disadvantage
   when compared, to the life after death, the second condition gives us
   what appears as a marvelous advantage over spirits and angels, in that
   by means of a fixed environment we are able to control the affections
   and loves that shall dominate our life. By turning from one thing to
   another, by focusing attention upon different objects in nature, we can
   choose to be inspired either by a good or an evil love, and can
   continually perfect our love and perception of what is good and true.
   However, once a man has chosen his ruling love, and has so far
   confirmed it that he has no desire to change it, the fixed environment
   is no longer of any use to him. When this point is reached, the Lord
   calls him into the spiritual world, where each one may be free to
   develop his chosen love without limit, unless he seeks to injure or
   destroy the life of others whom the Lord, in His mercy, must protect.

                                                                         4

   THE DOCTRINE OF REFLECTION

   CHAPTER V

   The Importance of Varied Human Associations

   Life in the natural world differs from life in the spiritual world in
   that men are brought inevitably into contact and association with all
   kinds of people. By family relationship, the neighborhood in which one
   lives, through travel, through social activities, through business and
   employment, the path of each one is continually crossing the paths of
   others. Such contacts may be casual and fleeting, but under the
   influence of mutual interests or common needs the life of one may
   become closely intertwined with the lives of others, and this perhaps
   for many years. This is true irrespective of mental states, and it may
   bind together externally people of extremely diverse forms of mind,
   disposition or temperament. From this arises a conflict of wills that
   may cause suffering varying from a mere momentary irritation to
   prolonged and severe distress of mind. Such an interplay of
   heterogeneous natures results from the fact that human society on earth
   is founded, not upon congeniality of spirit, but rather upon common
   needs of the body and of the material world. The uses that bind men
   together may be performed by the evil as well as by the good. They may
   be performed from love to the Lord and charity toward the neighbor, or
   the loves of self and the world. Not only this, but in ail men evil
   tendencies and good tendencies exist side by side. At times they act
   from one, and at, other times from the other. So mixed are the motives
   that prompt men to action, and so deeply are they concealed that no one
   can know with certainty whether he acts from charity or from some
   selfish ambition.

   Conditions under which opposing affections are brought together and
   held in close association are not confined to individuals of an alien
   race or nationality, but frequently obtain among members of the same
   family. Such may have many interests in common, and may be bound by
   strong ties of affection. They may be held together by mutual
   responsibilities, even though they may be poles apart as to ideals of
   life or principles of action, and thus may be incapable of deep mutual
   sympathy or understanding.

   In the other life this is not so. There all consociations are according
   to affinities of love and affection. Diversity of love spontaneously
   causes separation, while affinity brings presence. There are not
   external needs such as exist on earth to compel the association of
   alien spirits. The only needs that obtain after death are spiritual.
   The uses performed for one another are all spiritual. It is in accord
   with these spiritual uses that society there is organized. We read in
   AC 2449:

   "Such is the communication in the other life of all ideas of thought
   and of all affections, that goods are communicated among the good, and
   evils among the evil....Unless the good and the evil were separated,
   countless mischiefs would result, and moreover, all association
   together would be impossible...yet all things are most exquisitely
   consociated--in the heavens according to all the differences of love to
   the Lord and...mutual love, and of the derivative faith; and in the
   hells according to all the differences of cupidities and of the
   derivative phantasies. Be it known, however, that the separation is not
   entire removal, for from no one is that which he has had altogether
   taken away."

   All who possess similar affections are, in general, together in one
   place, in one heaven, and in one society of heaven. So also the
   particular varieties of one homogeneous society also are arranged
   according to more particular likenesses of affection, of thought and of
   use. Thus in heaven the only bonds are those of love, and only those
   who possess a mutuality of love can be together in the same heaven, the
   same society, the same house. So also in the hells, those in similar
   loves of evil art associated, and this more closely as their loves are
   more nearly alike. In heaven the bond is one of mutual love and use,
   while in hell the bond is one of the need to enlist the cooperation of
   others for the sake of one's own personal ambition.

   Between heaven and hell, therefore, there is "a great gulf fixed" (Luke
   16:26). Those from heaven cannot pass over to those in hell, and evil
   spirits cannot invade the heavens. Those who are spiritually
   incompatible do not meet, and remain quite unaware of one another. That
   is because there are no external necessities compelling them to
   associate. This is not the case in the world of spirits, into which
   intermediate world every one comes immediately after death. There, for
   a time, the good and the evil are together very much as they were on
   earth. Yet, even there, spirits are not bound together by external
   necessities, but solely by loves and interests they have in common.
   Every one entering that world, unless he has been fully regenerated on
   earth, carries with him opposing affections by which he is brought into
   contact with spirits of opposing character. Each one is led by his
   affections to seek consociation with others of like disposition. Those
   who have been striving for regeneration retain many habits of thought
   and life, many appearances and fallacies which they mistake for the
   truth, and many hereditary tendencies to evil which they have not yet
   overcome. The converse also is true; namely, that the evil possess
   acquired habits of use, of charity and of piety whereby they have
   adapted their external lives to the demands of society. The purpose of
   a temporary period of life in the world of spirits is that through a
   series of experiences and by instruction, mistaken ideas may be
   corrected, and evil habits may be rejected in favor of uses in accord
   with one's ruling love. And on the contrary, outward pretenses of good
   and truth may be removed that the inner character of evil may become
   apparent. By this means the good are gradually separated from the evil,
   the good being instructed and elevated into heaven, while the evil seek
   association with their own kind in hell.

   This process may at times require a considerable period, and may be
   accompanied by severe temptation and suffering. But at last each one is
   brought, by his own will, through Divine leading, into his place,
   either in heaven or in hell.

   The conditions existing on earth are of the Divine Providence because
   only by the mingling of people of different characteristics can any one
   learn to know himself. Only thus can one recognize the quality of evil
   tendencies in himself, and determine to oppose them. No one living in a
   mutual admiration society could realize his own shortcomings. His pride
   would be continually fed by the praise and approbation of others. But
   when he is in contact with opposing natures he is given the constant
   opportunity to reflect upon his own affections, to judge them, and
   select those which he wishes to cultivate, while rejecting those he
   finds objectionable. Especially in periods of spiritual decline, when
   evil conditions are tolerated in human society, and when the dominant
   loves are those of self and the world, many are bound together by
   external bonds who are interiorly very diverse. Families are forced to
   live together in single rooms or in close quarters that bring them into
   continual conflict with one another. They may have to live in
   neighborhoods largely occupied by criminals. They may be restricted in
   association by conditions of war, or of political and social
   antagonisms. Nevertheless, even on earth all men have a longing to
   associate with others who understand them and sympathize with their
   aims and purposes. A most important need is felt for a home where one's
   own family may enjoy privacy and a sense of freedom from outside
   pressures. Human nature, even on earth, causes all men constantly to
   seek congenial companionship, and to struggle against the conditions
   that throw them together with those who are antagonistic and
   unresponsive.

   That which is of particular interest to us at the moment is that the
   difference between conditions on earth and corresponding conditions in
   the spiritual world is due to a difference in the power of reflection.
   On earth men are compelled to reflect upon bodily needs and worldly
   desires, with their resultant uses. They are brought into association
   with others by limitations of time, and place and opportunity, by the
   lack of economic means, or by considerations of health, of employment
   or business. Such restraints often appear as unfortunate, or even
   cruel, and yet no one can altogether avoid them. The truth is that
   without them no one could regenerate. Only by such a mingling of
   divergent natures can one be led to perceive the quality of his own
   states of mind. Without some such compulsion no one would reflect upon
   his inner thoughts and emotions. Every one takes these for granted, and
   accepts them at face value unless his judgment of them is challenged.
   Reflection first arises when one sees these same qualities in others,
   and notes their effect upon himself. Not otherwise can any one overcome
   the bias or prejudice with which he is wont to judge himself.
   Concerning this we read:

   "When [a] man does not reflect upon those things that are in his mind
   or ... [spirit,] namely, how he thinks, what he thinks, what he does,
   and whence he acts [he has no knowledge of these things].... Without
   reflection he knows nothing, except that a thing is.... [He does not
   know[ its quality. But if he reflects in himself from others, or if he
   suffers others to reflect upon him, and to say of what quality he is,
   then... [first] he can know that he is of such a quality. Otherwise he
   can never know it, but he remains in his phantasies, and from them he
   reflects upon others" (SD 734).

   This is a matter of universal experience, and it is permitted by the
   Lord in order that man may learn to know himself, to judge as to the
   quality of his habitual thoughts and feelings. Judgment requires
   knowledge, and without knowledge there can be no freedom of choice. The
   whole purpose of man's life on earth is that he may learn to judge
   between good and evil, truth and falsity, and may freely choose the one
   and reject the other. To this end he is compelled by circumstances to
   mingle with people of alien character and given the opportunity to
   reflect upon his own innate tendencies. Even given the opportunity
   there is no assurance that a man will avail himself of it. To do so
   requires an act of will, and a struggle, for every one is prone to
   reflect upon others rather than upon himself. Every one naturally
   assumes that he is right, and that those who disagree with him are
   wrong. The temptation to judge others harshly, and one's self with
   great leniency is very strong. This is especially true if one has no
   standard of judgment based on Divine revelation, and no religious
   conscience from which to judge.

   However, so far as regeneration has been achieved, this same kind of
   struggle and temptation is no longer necessary. The judgment has been
   made, and whatever is contrary to the laws of love and charity is
   rejected at once, spontaneously and with effort. Close association with
   alien spirits becomes a hindrance rather than a help, and then the Lord
   provides that one may enter the spiritual world where he may enjoy the
   association only of such as are congenial spirits. Further growth is
   effected, not by conflict with the evil but by a continual perfection
   of the good. This is achieved by association with others in the
   promotion of uses mutually loved, receiving from others new affections
   and new thoughts whereby the mind of each one is enriched and
   perfected. Such is the kingdom of heaven.

                                                                         5

   THE DOCTRINE OF REFLECTION

   CHAPTER VI

   Reflection in the Spiritual World is on Qualities of Love, Wisdom and
   Use

   It has been pointed out that both men on earth and spirits after death
   really live in both worlds at the same time. Every one must receive
   sense-impulses from the world of nature and affections of love from the
   spiritual world, both of these being necessary to produce
   consciousness. While man is on earth, although he has all the organs of
   sensation, and is in constant touch with the objects in his environment
   from which a stream of sense-impulses pours in upon his mind during
   every waking moment, nevertheless no conscious realization of his
   surroundings will result unless he is being stirred at the same time by
   some affection, some interest, some desire that causes him to focus his
   attention and so to notice a particular set of sense-impulses. On the
   other hand, although every one is surrounded by spirits and angels,
   they cannot produce any conscious effect upon the mind unless there is
   a stream of sense-impulses knocking upon the door of consciousness. If
   one were deaf, blind, and incapable of taste, smell or touch, even if
   he were alive, he would have no love, no emotion, no desire, and
   therefore no reflection that could produce consciousness.

   It follows from this that men on earth must receive some influx from
   the spiritual world, and spirits after death must receive some impulse
   from the world of nature in order to enjoy any conscious life whatever.
   This must be true in spite of the fact that while on earth men are
   completely unaware of their spiritual associates, and spirits after
   death are wholly unconscious of the material world. On earth we feel
   affections or loves as if they arose in our minds, and have no
   knowledge of whence they come. So also spirits in the other world are
   moved by the ideas present in the minds of men on earth, but perceive
   these as if they originated in themselves, and remain wholly ignorant
   of their source.

   Ideas formed in the imagination are all derived from the physical
   senses, but they have been so ordered as to clothe, represent, and make
   tangible some love or affection. They have been separated from the
   material properties of matter to produce ideals. These ideal forms are
   what affect and move the minds of spirits and angels, performing for
   them the same function as the direct touch with nature performs for men
   on earth. For this reason it is said that the whole spiritual world
   rests upon mankind as a common basis. It is solely because they are
   touched and moved by a constant stream of impulses originating in the
   world of nature, but elevated thence to the plane of the imagination,
   that spirits are capable of reflection, and therefore of consciousness.

   Nevertheless, the fact that in the other life no one possesses his own
   bodily sense organs, produces a profound difference in the kind of
   reflection that is possible. Concerning this we read:

   "The state of spirits relatively to the state of men appears similar at
   first glance, but yet it differs greatly. They think, indeed,
   similarly, and will similarly, but they are different as to
   reflections" (SD 4716).

   "After death, reflection upon inconveniences and punishments is taken
   away from man; for external bonds are removed and the man is left to
   his own disposition, thus to the delights of his life, so that he may
   act according to them. For in the other life a reflection other than
   prevails during the life of the body is requisite. In this there is
   reflection upon honors, gains, reputation, dangers to life and the
   like. These things are taken away, and the spirit is left to his own
   disposition which he had acquired to himself in the life of the body"
   (SD 4756).

   The difference between the two worlds is caused by the different plane
   upon which reflection takes place. As long as one lives in the body he
   is aware of the source from which sense-impulses come, but he is not
   aware of the source whence spiritual influences come. Therefore
   attention is fixed upon material objects and the mechanical forces in
   our natural environment. Even when we picture these things in our
   imagination we notice their material attributes and characteristics
   such as size, shape, weight, color, texture. We are interested in these
   things because of the physical needs they fill and the worldly uses
   they perform. Because of this we are said to live in a natural world
   which is characterized by these properties and uses. At the same time
   we feel affection, emotion, desire, and we can perceive in some degree
   the qualities of these spiritual things, but only as they exist in
   ourselves, wherefore we call them "human qualities"-thoughts, abstract
   ideas, and spiritual or moral aspirations.

   After death it is altogether otherwise. Then one is no longer affected
   by material things directly, but only after they have been idealized in
   the minds of men on earth. Ideals are representative of things
   immaterial and supernatural. These representations are perceived by
   spirits in the other world without realizing whence they come. But
   spirits are conscious of one another, and of their spiritual
   environment. They are aware of spiritual things as existing outside of
   themselves, and as constituting a world to be sensed, explored and
   enjoyed. This is the living world of the Divine Proceeding, the world
   of Divine Love, and Divine Wisdom accommodated to human reception. Yet
   these spiritual objects and forces are perceived in forms altogether
   similar to those found in nature, because they can become visible to us
   under no other form or aspect than that which has been impressed upon
   the external senses during life on earth. To create such representative
   forms is the Divine purpose in providing a material world of objects.
   Not by any other means can spiritual things become visible and
   tangible. For this reason no one can be created in the spiritual world,
   but must first live on earth in a body sensitive to material things.

   The difference between reflection on earth and reflection in the
   spiritual world is further explained, as follows:

   "Man in the world reflects from his corporeal memory....When a man sees
   another, he reflects upon all that he had heard and has experienced
   concerning the person; and [he] acknowledges him as [a] friend and
   companion with whom he has associated and [has] for various reasons,
   entered into friendship. But not so spirits. They acknowledge as [a]
   friend him who is like themselves; for an acquaintance, every one who
   receives their ideas; but this with much variety, and whether they have
   been acquainted or not" (SD 4716).

   From this it is clear that after death every one is brought into
   association with those who are in similar loves to his own, and he at
   once feels himself to be among friends. It is as if he had known them
   always even though he had never met them before. He does not reflect
   upon who they are, where they have lived, or what they have done during
   their life on earth. These things would be regarded as of on
   consequence, because they already perceive the interior quality of the
   one they meet to be in sympathy with their own. There would be no
   thought of person from family connection, from social station, from
   outward appearance, manners or dress. They would have regard only to
   the quality of love which they present in a representative form. They
   see each other because an accordant love is roused in the mind of each
   one, and made visible through the memory of corresponding forms derived
   originally, either from their own experience on earth or from ideas in
   the minds of men still living in the natural world. Whence these
   memories or impulses come is not known, nor is it reflected upon. Only
   the results of it are consciously enjoyed as if originating in
   themselves, while the attention is focused solely upon the spiritual
   things that come into view. Spirits live in a world of human affections
   and human thoughts made tangible in correspondential forms derived, in
   the last analysis, from physical sensation. Thus from their own memory
   of past experience, or from the memory of men still living on earth,
   spirits derive the forms, the mental pictures through which spiritual
   things are seen and felt. For this reason, all the appearances in the
   spiritual world are similar to the forms existing in nature. Houses,
   garments, trees, plants, fields, rivers, mountains-all of these appear
   similar to those on earth. Yet to the spirits they are merely the
   medium whereby they sense and feel loves, or goods and truths. Spirits
   pay little attention to the forms, being delighted with the spiritual
   realities of which the forms are but clothing. Such appearances are not
   subject to the restriction of space and time; nor are they regarded as
   to any material properties. The appearances may change suddenly. They
   may appear and disappear, but the spirits do not reflect upon such
   changes, and find nothing strange or surprising about them. They seem
   perfectly natural because the plane of reflection is not upon the
   forms, but upon the spiritual things they represent. The forms change
   as the states of the spirits change, not because the spiritual things
   really change, but only the way the spirits are affected by them, how
   they look at them, from what point of view they regard them. In
   explanation, the number quoted from the Spiritual Diary continues:

   "Man reflects upon the various things wherewith he may array, and with
   which he does array himself; and this variously....[Spirits do not do
   this.] Garments are given them according to their state. They do not
   know whence and at what time; nor do they care. Man knows of what sort
   is his house, his rooms, his halls, and many things, also the
   furniture. Spirits, indeed, are similarly circumstanced; but when their
   surroundings are changed, when new things are given them, when they are
   provided with furniture, they rarely reflect [upon] from whence, or
   when, these things came. But it is different with one spirit to what it
   is with another. Likewise, when he comes into another place he does not
   know where he had been before, [and] thus does not turn back from the
   former to the latter, as does man. In a word, reflections are
   circumstanced according to the states in which they are... [whether in
   the other life or] in the world. In respect to reflections, so many
   things occur that they cannot be described....Still...[spirits] have a
   wakefulness and life...[which], on account of the difference of
   reflections...differs greatly...from the wakefulness and life of
   man....The angels think and act in a far more excellent manner than men
   [do], although they are not so well acquainted with the state of man as
   to be able to institute a comparison. The principal cause is that they
   have no memory of the past as regards such things as are external, but
   [only] as regards such things as are internal thus which are of faith
   and eternal life; but...whence or how these things are learned, they do
   not remember. In this they are like infants who learn and know not
   how."

   This teaching may help one to understand why the spiritual world and
   all things in it appear similar to things in the natural world, and yet
   are altogether different, being wholly spiritual. The forms upon which
   angels and spirits look are derived from the world of nature, but the
   things they see, hear, touch and feel are not material objects, but
   instead are goods and truths. These goods and truths exist outside the
   angels. They exist in the Divine of the Lord that "makes heaven." They
   are Divine creations, and not figments of man's imagination. They are
   merely perceived differently according to the changes of state with the
   angels and spirits.

                                                                         6

   THE DOCTRINE OF REFLECTION

   CHAPTER VII

   Concerning Reflection in the World of Spirits

   The phenomena of the spiritual world are innumerable. In variety they
   far exceed the phenomena of nature; and yet consider how innumerable
   these are! Those in the spiritual world represent far more perfectly
   the infinity of God. Yet they are all the product of reflection.
   Reflection is but the mode by which these phenomena are produced.
   Therefore, only by exploring the doctrine of reflection is it possible
   to learn and understand rationally the nature of life in the spiritual
   world. We shall attempt no more than to trace in brief outline the
   distinction between the reflection that obtains in the world of
   spirits, and that which obtains in heaven and in hell.

   To begin with we must remember that the spirit that awakes in the
   spiritual world when the body dies is the same as the mind which had
   previously lived in the body. The phenomena of the spiritual world,
   therefore, are the same as the phenomena of mental life on earth.
   Wonderful, strange, and seemingly fantastic as are many of the
   appearances of the spiritual world as described in the Writings, they
   all are governed by the same laws as those which control the operation
   of the mind. If we could remove our attention from the properties and
   characteristics of material things, and focus our thought instead
   entirely upon things of love and faith, on which truly human values
   depend, we could form some idea of what the spiritual world is like. It
   is a world completely human. In it are all those things which we value
   as human qualities-love, mercy, justice, use and service, worship,
   knowledge, intelligence, insight, perception, truth-all these set free
   from the restrictions of a fixed material environment. We perceive
   these things dimly in our minds as abstractions only, as long as we are
   in the body. We may know that they exist in God, that they are really
   outside of ourselves, that they are not mere creations of our
   imagination; yet we cannot picture them objectively. Nevertheless,
   there is no phenomenon of the spiritual world of which we may not form
   some faint but essentially accurate idea, by reflecting upon our own
   mental states. Our idea will be vague and imperfect, however, because
   we cannot completely remove from our thought the properties of matter,
   ideas of fixed time and space, which really have no place in the
   spiritual world.

   The truth is, that when we wake up in the spiritual world we will go on
   thinking and feeling just as we did before. Our thoughts and emotions
   will seem exactly the same as before. At first we will not be aware of
   the slightest change. We will seem to be in our accustomed
   surroundings, in company with those we have known and loved. We will
   not know that we have departed out of the world. Only by angelic
   instruction can we be brought to reflect upon our former state of life.
   But as we do so we begin to notice strange things such as could not
   happen on earth. By this experience we are brought to recognize that we
   are indeed in a spiritual world. This reflection must come from our
   association with others; that is, from angels whose use and function it
   is to preside over the process of resurrection from the dead. Without
   such instruction we would continue to believe that we were still on
   earth. Indeed, with the evil, who presently reject the instruction of
   the angels, the fantasy that they are still in the body returns, and
   some never escape from it. It is otherwise with the good who love
   spiritual things, and who are willing to be instructed. They gladly
   accept the idea that they have departed from the world and eagerly seek
   to explore the wonders of their new life. Yet after a brief time they
   no longer reflect upon this, but take it for granted, enjoying the
   spiritual world even as men on earth enjoy the natural world.
   Swedenborg describes the experience of a newly arrived spirit, saying:

   "He knew not at first where he was, supposing himself to be in the
   world altogether as if living in the body, for...all souls...[recently]
   from the life of the body [have this impression], inasmuch as they are
   not then gifted with reflection upon place (SD 2031)...[or upon] time,
   the objects of the senses, and the like, of which I have spoken
   elsewhere, and which would enable them to know that they are in another
   life, only that they live, as it were, in the body, and think
   accordingly" (SD 2032).

   "That souls lose nothing of the things which they had in the life of
   the body, you will see everywhere affirmed; thus they neither know nor
   can know that they are in the other life, but [suppose] that they are
   in the world, inasmuch as they are without that reflection which is
   excited by things stored up in the memory; nor is that which is in the
   memory excited except by means of objects, and objects are not
   presented unless by those who are in society together. Reflection is
   also given, but by the Lord, that they are in the other life" (SD
   1903).

   "Moreover, that without reflection they cannot know that they are in
   the other life may appear from the nature of reflection, as man does
   not know the distances of objects without reflecting upon what
   intervenes, nor can he judge of times but in the same manner. And so of
   many other things besides; for reflection enables...man to know the
   quality and quantity of anything" (SD 1904).

   "A spirit who spake with me positively affirmed that he did not know
   otherwise than that he was...myself, especially when he did not reflect
   upon the subject; but my own reflections were that spirits did know
   themselves to be spirits separate from men. In a word, without
   reflection they know nothing else, nor is reflection given except with
   those who converse with them and give responses, and then converse with
   others also. Reflection is indeed given without the speech of man with
   spirits, but this is effected by the Lord" (SD 1852).

   "The first state of man after death resembles his state in the world,
   for he is then likewise in externals, having a like face, like speech,
   and a like disposition, thus a like civil and moral life;
   and...[consequently] he is made aware that he is not still in the world
   only by giving attention to what he encounters, and from his having
   been told by...angels when he was resuscitated that he had become a
   spirit. Thus is one life continued into the other, and death is merely
   [a] transition" (HH 493).

   As soon as we realize that we are in the other life, because our
   thought is focused upon the desires, ambitions, and delights habitual
   with us, we at once wish to meet friends who have gone before us. We
   think of these friends just as we did on earth, or as we knew them,
   especially as to those qualities of mind by which we had become
   conjoined with them (SD 2771; CL 273; HH 494). We think of things we
   had in common with them, mutual interests, concordant ideas whereby
   there had been a meeting of minds and an interchange of affections.
   Thus we meet them, but there is no reflection upon their physical
   characteristics, no thought as to their former place of abode, their
   station in earthly society, or their family relationships. The meeting
   takes place on the plane of the natural mind, the animus with its
   characteristic affections and thoughts. The whole world of spirits is
   the state in which reflection is focused upon the tings of this
   external mind. For this reason we appear to be in surroundings similar
   to those we had been familiar with on earth-in the same country, the
   same city, the same house. We appear to have the same occupation, the
   same place in society, the same duties and responsibilities. We have
   the same religious affiliations, and see consociation with others of
   the same faith. The reason is that we are in the company of the same
   spirits who had been attendant upon us, without our realizing it,
   during the life of the body. For this reason they seem to be familiar
   to us, as if they were friends and companions we had previously known.
   At first we do not normally reflect upon the fact that they are not the
   persons with whom we have been outwardly associated on earth. The
   realization of this arises only when we begin to reflect that we are no
   longer on earth, but are in the spiritual world. Such reflection is
   induced by instruction from the angels who at the same time impart a
   sense that there is no real separation, that we are still present with
   those we love, that we can continue to serve them and be served by
   them, and this even more fully than before. Thus the first awakening is
   accompanied by a far more perfect realization of the Divine Providence
   and the overruling mercy of the Lord in caring for every essential need
   of those on earth. For this reason there is no sense of worry and
   anxiety for the future such as that which usually oppresses those on
   earth at the death of a close friend.

   The spontaneous association in the world of spirits of those who are
   similar as to externals, that is, as to the loves, the thoughts of the
   external mind, causes the formation of imaginary heavens. It causes
   spirits to congregate into societies of those in similar faiths and
   similar modes of civil and religious life. The simulation which has
   been habitually practiced on earth is still possible, and is continued
   as a matter of course. Deeper feelings remain hidden behind an outward
   appearance of politeness, courtesy and friendship. Sincerity, justice,
   honesty, and piety are expressed in speech and action. These
   appearances are accepted uncritically by those who are simple in heart,
   and for this reason they will respect and reverence others, whether
   they be interiorly good or evil. Such confiding spirits, therefore,
   come under the influence of evil spirits who seek to dominate over
   them. In this respect all in such imaginary heavens are mingled very
   much as they were on earth.

   Before the Last Judgment, such societies could be maintained for a very
   long time, even for centuries, constantly receiving new additions from
   the world, and therefore growing continually in numbers and in power.
   The larger they grew the greater their influence over the minds of men
   on earth, specially through the weight of tradition. They tended to
   hold the minds of men bound to the beliefs, the ideas, and the modes of
   life which had been accepted as Divinely commanded. Nor could this
   bondage be broken except by the Lord Himself. He alone had power to
   penetrate the appearances, the fallacies, and the evil practices to
   which they led, and this by opening, at His Advent, the internal sense
   of the Word. As this was done, the mask of pretense could be removed
   and the true character of the evil could be made manifest, whereupon
   their power over the good spirits was broken, and a separation could
   take place between the good and the evil. Since the Last Judgment, at
   the time of the Lord's Second Coming, although such temporary
   associations are still being formed in the world of spirits, they can
   be judged periodically, and cannot be maintained for a period longer
   than twenty or thirty years. Such is the liberation that has been
   effected by the Lord through the giving of the Heavenly Doctrine. For
   this reason there is no need for the Lord to come again, and the New
   Church, which He is now establishing on earth and in the heavens, will
   be eternal.

   What is here described was true of the simple who could be innocently
   deceived by the evil, and held under their authority. But those who
   belonged to the Primitive Christian Church, when the Lord Jesus Christ
   as worshiped as God, and before the meaning of the Gospels had been
   perverted by false doctrines, could not be held in the imaginary
   heavens. They were instructed by angels, and introduced into heavenly
   societies. They could reflect upon the teaching of the Word, and
   steadily progress into an ever truer understanding of it, and into a
   more perfect life of love to the Lord and charity. They could be formed
   into genuine societies of heaven, into which, after the Judgment, the
   simple good spirits could be introduced. Those who belonged to these
   heavenly societies could be given a part in the Lord's work of
   redemption. They could assist in breaking up the imaginary heavens, and
   liberating those "under the altar" who had been held bound there. Such,
   we believe, are included among those "twelve apostles who had followed
   the Lord during His life on earth, and who were sent on the 19th of
   June 1770, to proclaim throughout the whole spiritual world the Gospel
   that the Lord God Jesus Christ reigns as the one God of heaven and
   earth."

   What we wish to emphasize is that all this is effected solely by means
   of reflection induced from without by instruction and experience. For
   reflection, knowledge is necessary, in the spiritual world as well as
   on earth. The Lord had to come, He had to give His Word, and this had
   to be written simultaneously in both worlds. It was the internal sense
   of the Word revealed, and the Doctrines of the New Church made known,
   that alone could break the hold of the evil upon the good. It was by
   learning this truth and reflecting upon it that the false assumptions
   of the former churches were recognized for what they were, and so
   repudiated. In the spiritual world, however, this great change could
   take place quickly, while on earth it requires many centuries. The
   reason is that in the spiritual world there are no fixed conditions of
   time and space, no binding requirement of physical needs, and the mind
   is free to follow where the inner love would lead. We are told that the
   Last Judgment was effected in the world of spirits in the course of a
   single year, 1757, and it has been slowly progressing here on earth
   ever since, and promises to continue almost imperceptibly for many
   generations to come.

                                                                         7

   THE DOCTRINE OF REFLECTION

   CHAPTER VIII

   Reflection in the Final State After Death. The Case with Infants who
   Die

   Passing from the world of spirits to a final home, either in heaven or
   in hell, is like passing from the natural world into the spiritual
   world, at least in this respect, that it is effected by a change in the
   plane of reflection. While man is on earth he cannot reflect apart from
   ideas of time, and space and matter. He can conceive of spiritual
   things only as abstractions. He cannot think of them objectively
   without ascribing to them the properties of nature. He is held in this
   mode of thinking, not only because of the body through which all
   sensation must pass to reach his mind, but also because of the pressing
   needs, responsibilities, and restrictions of the world in which he
   lives. Only occasionally, and for brief periods can one withdraw
   himself from these limitations, and by a conscious effort focus
   attention upon spiritual things. This requires an effort that cannot be
   long sustained. Nor is it possible for him even then, to remove
   completely the idea of space and time.

   When the body dies these external bonds are removed, and one can begin
   to reflect apart from them. Nevertheless, everyone has both an external
   mind and an internal mind. The external mind is active in the presence,
   and under the influence, of others; and the internal mind can become
   consciously awake only when one is spiritually alone. When man first
   awakes in the spiritual world, he is separated from all things of the
   body and its earthly environment; but he is still in contact with other
   spirits in whose presence he feels and thinks from the external mind.
   This mind has been adjusted to society. It has been trained in the
   forms of politeness and courtesy, and has learned to conform to the
   customs and ideas of those with whom one is associated. As a result,
   even in the spiritual world, a man at first thinks and wills, speaks
   and acts from the external mind when in the presence of other spirits
   who have similar externals. By gradual stages, however, he seeks to
   express his inner feelings and beliefs. He is attracted to others who
   are interiorly in sympathy with him. The real joy of his life consists
   in the expression of these things, and every one is led by experiences
   through which he passes, to reflect upon these inner feelings, to
   become aware of them, and to try to ultimate them in speech and action.

   It is of providence that even spirits may be able to conceal the
   affections of the internal mind, not only when they are evil, but also
   when they are good. He must be able to conceal them when they are evil
   in order that he may gain the approbation of others, and their
   assistance in the achievement of his personal ambitions. But he must be
   able to conceal them when they are good in order to protect them from
   injury by others who are opposed to them. There must therefore be
   degrees of friendship. There must be some with whom a man may associate
   externally and temporarily for the sake of cooperation in a common use
   or mutual enterprise. There must be others who can share their deeper
   feelings with mutual understanding and confidence. And there must be
   some who can freely bare their inmost loves and thoughts to each other
   without fear or restraint. But every one has the need for privacy-the
   privacy of thought and affection, of the home, and of each individual
   life even within the home. Such privacy exists, we are told, even with
   the celestial angels. Only husband wife can be together in the inner
   recesses of the home. Children and close friends may be together with
   them in the outer courts of the home. Companions and fellow workers may
   be together in the same society, and there may be contact with others,
   even with those in hell for some specific purpose, or to perform some
   special service. But in this case they are clothed in official garments
   that protect against the violation of the precious things within their
   hearts and minds.

   When one first enters the spiritual world there are, except in very
   rare cases, many things in the external mind that are of harmony with
   the internal mind. During one's sojourn in the world of spirits these
   disharmonies are gradually brought to light. As one reflects more and
   more upon one's inner states, the discrepancy becomes apparent, and one
   feels an increasing urge to remove that which is contrary to his inmost
   love. The opposition between the two becomes evident by contact with
   others that cause some to reflect upon one's deeper feelings. Gradually
   one learns to reflect more often and more persistently, and by degrees
   such reflection becomes easier, more natural and more delightful, until
   it becomes a second nature, and one lives altogether in the internal
   mind. As this change takes place one draws near to one's permanent
   spiritual home.

   The state that is characteristic of both heaven and hell is one in
   which one normally and habitually reflects upon the internal mind, and
   finds in this a sense of peace, of satisfaction, and of happiness that
   is not otherwise possible. It is a state of freedom, of feeling at
   home, as among family and friends, and there one wills to stay, feeling
   under no obligation to go elsewhere. It is a permanent abode that is
   freely chosen. It is a place where one can think most clearly, act most
   spontaneously, and express his deepest loves most perfectly. It is
   therefore where man can perform his individual use to others most
   fully, and in doing so can feel the greatest delight and happiness.
   That is the case in heaven because the greatest joy of the angels is to
   serve others, and through them, to serve the Lord.

   In hell, however, the case is quite different. When one's inmost love
   is evil, one finds satisfaction only in dominating over others, in
   taking for one's own the goods of others, and finding one's own
   pleasure in bringing suffering upon others. Evil spirits are brought
   together, and are held together by these mutual antagonisms which find
   no fulfillment except in so far as they can be exercised against
   others. Hell, therefore, is a perpetual clash of opposing wills, a
   constant warfare, with all its cruelty and hatred. Such evil passions
   are continually restrained by the laws of the Divine Providence for the
   protection of the good. They are permitted so far as they may be of use
   to check the evils of others, to bring punishment upon them and so
   deter them from worse evils, or to balance one force of evil against
   another. There is no love of use in hell. There is only the love of
   gain and of dominion for the sake of which one may work very hard only
   to be confronted with failure, disappointment and disillusion, because
   one's real love can never be satisfied. Nevertheless, even in hell, use
   is the only thing that can sustain human life. The evil spirits
   discover that they must perform some use in order to secure what to
   them are the necessities of life-food, clothing and habitation. These
   are all given freely to the angels, but in hell they cannot be secured
   without making some useful return. For this reason evil spirits perform
   in hell something of the use they would have performed gladly and with
   great joy had they been willing to receive love to the Lord and charity
   into their hearts. This is the only use of which they are capable. But
   in hell they are compelled to perform it reluctantly, and in doing so
   they feel no happiness, but only a constant desire to exercise their
   malevolent ambition to bring injury to others.

   However, evil spirits are reduced to a willingness to perform a use
   when they have been deterred by the fear of punishment from doing the
   evil things they love. Then their evil passions are for the same being
   laid to rest, and by concentration upon some work their external mind
   is brought into order, and they sense the nearest thing to contentment
   that is possible to them. The fear of punishment is temporarily in
   abeyance, and their evil loves do not break forth but merely smolder
   beneath the surface. Thus the Lord brings the hells into order and
   under obedience to His Divine will. Yet He cannot take away completely
   all their sense of freedom without destroying their life. He must
   permit the hope of achieving their evil ends to survive, even when they
   see no immediate possibility of success. He must protect their freedom,
   and give it free rein just so far as to do so may be turned to some
   good and of which the evil spirits can have no idea. But beyond this
   point it must be strictly restrained, and herein lies the frustration
   that is the eternal lot of the wicked.

   Just the opposite is the case in heaven. When one's inmost love is
   good, and when one's greatest delight is to serve others and to promote
   their happiness, there is no need for Divine restriction. When those
   who have this love in common are associated together, each one can
   achieve his highest ambition and at the same time assist others to
   attain theirs. The success of one does not bring with it the failure of
   another. What one gains does not mean a loss to another. Each one
   performs his use with no thought of personal reward, feeling his
   happiness in the happiness of others. Such is the state of peace and
   joy which it is the Lord's will to impart to all men. This is the very
   heaven for the sake of which the entire universe was created. This end
   of the Divine Providence is achieved in spite of man's unwillingness to
   receive it. For those who refuse it, the Lord provides a hell, where
   they may still enjoy some measure of life even if the delights thereof
   are evil. And in His mercy, between heaven and hell there is "a great
   gulf fixed" to prevent the evil from destroying or even impairing the
   happiness of the good.

   Just a brief word about the case of those who die in infancy. There
   have been two opposite ideas about this. Some have questioned the
   Divine justice by holding that infants who die are preferred above all
   others, since they attaint he joys of heaven without sustaining all the
   toil and temptation incident to adult life on earth. Why should the
   rest of us be subjected to this great hardship when the ultimate goal
   could have been assured so easily? Others have held that the Lord is
   unjust because He has deprived the infants who die, of all the
   advantages that accrue to those who endure the burden of life and the
   challenge of temptation. It is thought that the infants can never
   perform so high a use because they lack the knowledge, the training,
   and the experience by which alone wisdom may be achieved. Both ideas
   are wrong. Every one, we are taught, is taken into the spiritual world
   at the time that is best for his eternal welfare, and at the same time
   is best for others. The Lord alone knows for what eternal use in heaven
   each one is created. He knows what earthly preparation for that use is
   necessary. He knows when that preparation has been completed, and when
   a longer sojourn on earth would prove to be detrimental to one's
   eternal happiness instead of beneficial. There are uses in the Grand
   Man of heaven that can be performed only by those who have died in
   infancy. They are uses that require a degree of innocence that could
   not be preserved through the struggles of adult life. It is true that
   the infant will lack an individual fund of knowledge and experience
   that can be acquired only through a lifetime of effort, but he will not
   be limited by this because he can learn from others. After all, the
   difference between an infant and an adult in this respect is not so
   great as might appear. For if we consider, we may realize that what any
   one attains by his own investigation and experience is very little
   compared to all that he has acquired from others through instruction,
   conversation and reading. Infants raised in heaven can become wise,
   even to the celestial degree, although they have had scarcely any
   personal experience on earth. However, the use they can perform in
   heaven will differ from one which requires a store of individual
   knowledge, and the struggle to overcome on earth the evil tendencies of
   the proprium. Such a one also may become wise, even to the celestial
   degree. But he will have something of great value to give to others
   which the infant lacks. The use of each may be just as great, but it
   will be distinctively different in kind. And in each case it could be
   provided for only the Providence that fixed the moment of death at the
   time appointed by the Lord in His infinite wisdom. "He that is our God
   is the God of salvation; and unto God the Lord belong the issues...of
   death" (Psalm 68:20).

                                                                         8

   THE DOCTRINE OF REFLECTION

   CHAPTER IX

   Reflection upon the Word

   We have pointed out that only by means of a fixed environment can man
   be led to reflect upon his own affections and thoughts, and thus
   realize their quality. Unless he does so he cannot know what they are.
   Taking them for granted without reflection he has no desire to change
   them. There must be something outside of man, something that is
   independent of his shifting states and moods, which he may use as a
   fulcrum to draw himself out of one state and into another by an act of
   will. Just as the body can be transported from one place to another by
   walking only because the ground is immovable; just as man can lift
   himself off of the ground only by leaping, or propelling his body
   against a resisting surface, or by taking hold of something stationary
   above him and pulling himself up by his arms; just as a boat can be
   moved through the water by oars or propellers only because the water
   resists the pressure; or as an airplane can be moved through the air by
   similar means, or propelled by rockets; so also it is with the progress
   of the mind. No one can purposely change the state of his mind without
   appealing to something stationary outside of the mind itself.

   The entire environment of the natural world is such an immovable
   fulcrum. Its objects, with their distinct qualities, are fixed. If they
   are changed it is by means of forces that are independent of man's
   mind. Thus there are facts and laws that man may learn to understand,
   and that he may use to achieve his progress. By seizing upon these
   stable things man can change his ideas, his opinions and his
   objectives, and the tool by which he lays hold of them is what is
   called "reflection." One may observe these fixed ultimates at different
   times, in different states of mind, and from different points of view;
   and so doing he can become aware of his own changing states. He can
   analyze them, appraise them, and judge their quality in relation to his
   life.

   Such reflection upon the objects and forces of nature enables man to
   change the states of his external mind; but this by itself cannot
   empower him to change the states of his internal mind. The external
   mind has to do with man's relation to the world of nature, with the
   needs of the body, and with external pleasures and worldly ambitions.
   The internal mind, on the other hand, is concerned with spiritual
   states, with man's relation to the Lord, to the Word, and to the laws
   of the spiritual world. These cannot be learned from nature. They have
   to do with things invisible and intangible to the bodily senses. They
   cannot be learned by sense-experience, but solely from what the Lord
   says by means of Divine revelation. This must come by way of the bodily
   sense through reading and hearing the Word which, for this purpose,
   serves as a fixed ultimate by which to become aware of spiritual states
   of mind, and their quality. Concerning this we are taught:

   "Without the Word no one would possess spiritual intelligence, which
   consists in having [a] knowledge of...God, of heaven and hell, and of a
   life after death; nor would [he] know anything whatever about the Lord,
   about faith in Him...nor anything about redemption, by means of which
   nevertheless comes salvation" (SS 114).

   The knowledge that there are spiritual things existing in a world
   outside of man, and remaining constant irrespective of man's changing
   state of mind, is vital to any spiritual progression. There must be a
   love that is universal, eternal, and the same for all men. There must
   be laws, principles, truths that are constant, unchanging and absolute.
   Unless this were so there would be no criterion from which to judge
   one's own ever shifting states of affection, of thought, and of
   opinion. Unless this were so no one could possibly know the quality of
   his own thoughts and feelings, in order that he might judge them, alter
   them, and improve them. He would take for granted whatever he might
   feel spontaneously to be true and good, and would never question it. N
   one can be led to reflect upon these deeper things that belong to the
   internal mind except by means of the Word. As we read:

   "It may also be stated that the doctrine of faith effects nothing
   whatever with man except the Lord gives him to reflect. Wherefore men
   learn what is true and good from the Lord's Word in order that they may
   thereby reflect upon themselves [and judge] whether they are such (as
   the Word teaches they ought to be). This reflection is awakened in them
   at certain times, especially in times of trouble. Wherefore, to know
   truth is of the greatest moment; [for] without the knowledges of truths
   there can be no reflection, and consequently no reformation" (SD 737).

   The whole purpose of the Word is to teach man what is true in the sight
   of the Lord. It is to teach him the laws that govern the life of the
   internal mind, the laws that obtain in the spiritual world into which
   all men will come after the body dies, and after the fixed laws and
   objects of nature have been left behind. Spiritual truths, the laws of
   the spiritual world, are independent of any human mind. They are
   eternal, unchanging and universal. They exist in the Divine proceeding,
   that is, in the Divine of the Lord which we are told "makes heaven."
   They are therefore a fulcrum by means of which man may deliberately
   change his own inner feelings of affection, and his own ideas of human
   life and happiness. They are the sole means whereby man may progress
   spiritually into ever great intelligence and wisdom, and may acquire
   loves, affections, and ends more nearly in accord with those of the
   Lord and His heavenly kingdom.

   Because there is one God, the Creator and Preserver of the entire
   universe, there is one Divine truth, one Divine law that applies to all
   men, in all time, and in every earth in the starry heaven. The Lord has
   appeared to men everywhere, and has spoken this Word in accommodation
   to man's ability to understand, in every age, from the beginning of
   time. He spoke it to those of the Most Ancient Church, to Noah and the
   prophets of the Ancient Church, to Abram and Moses, and the prophets of
   the Old Testament. He spoke it immediately to His disciples while He
   was on earth, and through the Gospels His teaching was preserved for
   all the generations of Christians after His resurrection. And at His
   Second Advent he has spoken it as adapted to man's rational
   understanding in the Heavenly Doctrine of the New Jerusalem. Whenever
   the true knowledge of God and of religion was threatened with
   destruction, the Lord has come to reveal it anew, that men might always
   be able to advance from spiritual ignorance to knowledge, intelligence
   and wisdom, and this by reflecting upon that which is true in itself,
   that which is transcendent over the appearances, fallacies and opinions
   of erring human minds.

   Now the Word is unique in this: although it comes to man through the
   bodily senses, just as do all the other objects of nature, it enables
   one to penetrate the appearances of nature, and opens to view things
   spiritual, things intangible to the bodily senses. It is so written as
   to contain within the obvious sense of the letter, unto depths of
   meaning, to the discovery of which man may be led by his innate love of
   learning. The human mind is created to perceive spiritual truth. The
   delight of understanding is instilled in him by the Lord from earliest
   infancy, and this delight knows no boundary, but leads the mind on,
   even to the source of all truth, the first cause and origin of all
   things, and thus to a knowledge of God. Through the Word the love of
   spiritual knowledge and understanding is roused, and man is inspired to
   seek it, and to cherish it and choose it above the loves of self and of
   the world. It is therefore the sole medium of spiritual growth and
   progress, even during man's life on earth. It continues to be the only
   fulcrum for the perfection of man's spiritual life, after the fixed
   ultimates of nature have been left behind.

   We are told, therefore, that the Word is written in both worlds. It
   appears there in written form that is stable and unchanging. Unlike the
   other appearances that surround the angels, it does not change with
   their shifting states. It remains there as a fixed ultimate, outside
   the angels, and performs a service similar to that which was previously
   performed by the fixed ultimates of nature. In order that the Word
   might be written on earth, it had to be written at the same time in
   heaven. "Inasmuch," we read, "as the Divine truth passed down through
   the heavens even to the world, it became adapted to [the] angels in
   heaven, and also to men in the world" (TCR 85). That it continues to
   exist there as a fixed ultimate, unlike all other spiritual
   appearances, is clear from what is said in the Doctrine of the Sacred
   Scripture number 72:

   "In every large Society of heaven a copy of the Word, written by angels
   inspired by the Lord, is kept in its sanctuary, lest being elsewhere,
   it should be altered in some point."

   We are also told that there are two different kinds of writing in
   heaven, one "that exists without the aid of the hand, from mere
   correspondences with the thoughts...[and another written by the hand.
   The latter alone is said to be] permanent" (HH 262). So it is in heaven
   as it is on earth: there are books written by men expressing human
   thoughts and ideas that reflect the degree of knowledge and
   intelligence of the author. And there is the Word, written by the Lord,
   conveying the eternal truths that could be fully compassed by no finite
   mind, and yet which men may grasp partially, and with increasing
   fulness and perfection to all eternity. So it is said in the Apocalypse
   Revealed number 200:

   "All thought, speech and writing derive its essence and life from him
   who thinks, speaks and writes. The man with his quality is therein; but
   the Lord alone is in the Word."

   The Word, therefore, as it exists in heaven, is the sole medium whereby
   spirits and angels can progress spiritually, and this by reflecting
   upon what the word teaches, and learning thereby how to change the
   states of the internal mind, and grow in the understanding and life of
   the Divine and eternal laws therein revealed.

                                                                         9
