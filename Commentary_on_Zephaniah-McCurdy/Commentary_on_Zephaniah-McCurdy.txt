How To Use This Study Guide

1. A slow unhurried reading of Zephaniah is essential. Reading the chapter before 
looking at the notes, while working with the notes, and after finishing with the notes
will give each researcher a powerful sense of the series of meanings within each 
chapter. It is important to be comfortable with all the names and places in the 
prophecy and to understand the announcements the prophet makes on behalf of the 
Lord. When possible, historical information will be included in the notes to increase 
reading comprehension and enhance application.

2. Our study of each chapter of Zephaniah will begin with quotes from a work of the 
Writings called Summary Exposition of the Prophets and Psalms. This work includes a
verse-by-verse overview of all three chapters of Zephaniah that provide general 
information about the internal sense. Our research will help move us from the 
generals to the particulars of the internal sense.

3. Another important reference tool is Searle’s General Index to Swedenborg’s 
Scripture Quotations. This reference is used to find passages in the Writings where a 
verse(s) from the Word is either explained specifically or used to illustrate a 
doctrinal point that we can use in our study. There is also another use of this work. 
As we study, each researcher will be led by the Lord’s Providence in myriad ways, 
according to specific needs or states. Knowing how to use this book will help each of 
us to explore relevant topics and look up related passages to increase our knowledge
of the three-fold Word.

4. You will soon discover that not every verse, word, name, etc. is directly quoted in 
the Writings. But there are often other references to the same name, place, or thing 
in the explanation of a different verse of the Word. The hope is that reflection on 
these other doctrinal explanations will help us see possible applications to our study
of Zephaniah. We will need to use "derived doctrine" often. Please don’t run away 
from this maligned term. If we use it properly and admit openly that it is derived 
doctrine, we bring no harm to the internal sense.

5. Keep some kind of notebook handy during your study times. Write out insights, 
questions, and any summaries you find helpful in organizing your thoughts about 
each chapter. The goal of this study guide is not to give a detailed summary of 
the internal sense but to start each researcher’s quest for deeper insight.

6. At the end of each chapter in the study guide, you will find a study review. The 
review includes a summary of each section to help you reinforce and build on your 
understanding of several of the key points.

7. Begin each study unit with a devotional prayer asking the Lord to guide and direct
your thoughts. Certainly beginning in this sphere has the power to inspire and open 

4

our minds with a higher spiritual priority that will keep us in the company of the 
Lord’s angels. As the Writings teach, we must seek to love truth for truth’s sake. Such
an approach will free each reader from preconceived ideas that might limit his or 
her ability to "see" the intent and message of the Lord’s Word.

Introduction

As we prepare to study the literal and spiritual senses of the Book of Zephaniah, 
let’s look at some historical facts that will help us enter into the eternal message of 
the Lord’s Word. First, let’s consider the following questions:

1. Who was Zephaniah?

2. What kings of Judah preceded Zephaniah’s prophetical work, and what king 

was reigning during his prophecy?

3. What spiritual issues did Zephaniah address on behalf of the Lord?

4. What hope did Zephaniah bring to Judah from the Lord?

WHO WAS ZEPHANIAH?

Zephaniah gives us a glimpse of his heritage. Four generations are mentioned:

 The son of Cush
 The son of Gedaliah
 The son of Hezekiah


In the days of Josiah, the son of Amon, king of Judah.

Zephaniah may be the only minor prophet of the Lord to have royal family 
connections. Scholars identify him as the great-great-grandson of Hezekiah, the 
twelfth monarch of the kingdom of Judah. Hezekiah reigned for 29 years and was 
considered a good king in that he sought to lead his people in the ways of the Lord. 
Some scholars have dubbed Zephaniah "the royal prophet." It is believed that he was 
born during the reign of King Manasseh and that he worked as a prophet during the 
reign of Josiah.

If Zephaniah is truly of royal lineage, is this of any spiritual significance? This is a 
question worthy of speculation, but I found no direct teachings to help us answer 
this question. My inclination is to follow the teachings regarding the correspondence
of "kings" and the "sons of kings," and of "hidden" or "concealed" when spoken of in 
reference to the Lord.

5

Kings represent goods and truths having the upper hand. Kings also represent the 
dominant evils and falsities against which the Lord fought. (Arcana Coelestia [AC] 
1661-1664) Kings signify divine truth and divine good in and from the Lord, as noted
in Apocalypse Explained (AE) 446 [10].

Zephaniah’s name means Jehovah hides; Jehovah has hidden or concealed; 
Jehovah of darkness. We are not given direct teachings as to why the Lord would 
call a prophet, at this precise moment, whose name means hidden, concealed, or 
darkness. We can reflect on possible reasons. Was Zephaniah kept, or protected by 
the Lord, from the influence and disorders of his times? Or, could it be a 
representation of the state and spiritual condition of the people to whom he spoke? 
Had the falsity of the church obscured the light of heaven, concealing or hiding truth 
in the darkness of ignorance? The idea of something hidden is clearly borne out in 
Chapters 2 and 3, where the Lord draws out from hiding the meek from among the 
haughty. The hidden are the remains the Lord uses to restore a New Church.

WHAT KINGS OF JUDAH PRECEDED ZEPHANIAH’S PROPHECY, AND WHAT 
KING WAS RULING DURING THE TIME OF HIS PROPHECY?

The kings of Judah preceding Zephaniah’s prophecy are the first three in boldface 
type below. Zephaniah’s prophecy came during the reign of Josiah. During the period
beginning with Hezekiah and ending with Jehoahaz, spiritual issues fluctuated 
according to the leadership of the king. Here is a list of all of the kings (and one 
queen) of Judah for your reflection:

The Rulers of Judah

Rehoboam reigned 17 years
Abijah reigned 3 years
Asa reigned 41 years
Jehosphaphat reigned 25 years
Ahaziah reigned 1 year
Athaliah (queen) reigned 6 years
Joash reigned 40 years
Amaziah reigned 29 years
Uzziah reigned 52 years
Jotham reigned 16 years
Ahaz reigned 16 years
Hezekiah reigned 29 years
Manasseh reigned 55 years (695–642 BC)
Amon reigned 2 years (642–640 BC)
Josiah reigned 31 years (640–619 BC)
Jehoahaz reigned 3 months
Jehoiakim reigned 11 years

6

Jehoiachin reigned 3 months
Zedekiah reigned 11 years

Manasseh became the king of Judah at the age of twelve. For many years, Manasseh 
permitted cults to exist in Jerusalem and the land of Judah to appease the cult-
followers among the people. He allowed and participated in human sacrifices. He 
even offered one of his own sons as a sacrifice. This is horrific to think about.

When Manasseh was taken prisoner by the Assyrians, he "found religion." He 
realized he had been disobedient to the Lord. He returned to Jerusalem, where he 
sought to mend his ways before he died. Some reforms were started, but they ended 
quickly when Manasseh died and his son Amon assumed the title of king. Amon 
reintroduced idolatry and immorality, corrupted his office, and concentrated more 
on accumulating personal wealth than on working for the good of others.

Josiah, a son of Amon, loved the ways of the Lord and sought to reform the kingdom. 
At the suggestion of the high priest Hilkiah, Josiah ordered the repair of the Temple. 
During the repairs, a lost book of the law (Deuteronomy) was found. Josiah, when he 
heard the reading of the book, ordered it to be read to the people. He also took 
positive steps to clean up the spiritual disorder in Judah. Josiah closed down dozens 
of shrines, destroyed idols, and centralized all worship in the city of Jerusalem.

Both Jeremiah and Zephaniah were shown by the Lord that the "reforms" were not 
genuine. Reform was only a surface or cosmetic change in the hearts of the people. 
The population complied with reforms because the king promoted them. They went 
along with the popular views of the kingdom. How deeply did the people of Judah 
believe in the mission?

Jehoahaz’s reign of three months answers this question for us. His tolerance of evil 
during that brief reign brought cults, idols, and disorder back to their former state of
importance in the nation.

WHAT SPIRITUAL ISSUES DID ZEPHANIAH ADDRESS ON BEHALF OF THE 
LORD?

Chapter one of Zephaniah carries a message of judgment. The strong words of the 
Lord are spoken to Judah so that she might see her errors and work for a deeper 
reformation. The Lord promises to "consume," "punish," "search," and "bring 
distress" to the unrepentant evil ones.

Chapter two stresses that the Lord will not tolerate the abuse or maltreatment of His
Word and church. He promises that the meek (the remnant) will be hidden, cared 
for, and rescued by Him. The meek are hidden among the haughty.

7

Chapter three is a magnificent story of the end of the rebellion, the restoration of 
order, and the rejoicing that will come back to the church. Zephaniah prophesies that
there will be a new song sung. The Lord will be in the midst of the church. It will be a
time of exhilarating confidence and assurance. The former barrenness will be 
replaced with productivity.

WHAT HOPE DID ZEPHANIAH BRING TO JUDAH FROM THE LORD?

This question is asked purposefully in light of the preceding summation of the three 
chapters of Zephaniah. So many scholars highlight the gloom and doom of the first 
chapter. They don’t focus enough on the book’s movement to hope and restoration. 
The third chapter of Zephaniah is a powerful message of hope, restoration, singing, 
productiveness, new birth, and the Lord’s return to the center of His New Church.

Don’t we need the prophecy of the "royal prophet" today to bolster our wavering 
faith? Doesn’t this minor prophet named Zephaniah seem extremely relevant for our 
times, too?

Please read the study guide with an eye to the past, the present, and the future. As 
always, we need to begin each chapter, verse, or line with a prayer. The Lord told the 
Pharisees and the Scribes that they had eyes to see and saw not. He told them they 
had ears to hear but heard not.

Then He looked at His disciples and promised that their eyes would see and their 
ears would hear. May our prayer be that we will see and hear the positive promises 
of the Lord as we study the prophecy spoken by Zephaniah.

It is to be hoped that the meek will come out from among the haughty popular 
opinions of the evil. It is the goal of the Lord that we learn a new song. The Lord tells 
us that all of the years in which we have felt bound and unproductive will end. The 
Lord promises births. We need growth and confidence in the regeneration work He 
calls us to undertake. It isn’t impossible. We can achieve the innocence of wisdom 
promised in the doctrines of the New Church.

So let’s sing a new song and be done with the monotony of hell’s tune. We are the 
"apple of the Lord’s eye." Freedom is reserved for and awaiting those who are meek 
and faithful.

Chapter One

ZEPHANIAH 1:1-3

"The word of the Lord which came to Zephaniah the son of Cushi, the son of Gedaliah, 
the son of Amariah, the son of Hezekiah, in the days of Josiah the son of Amon, king of 
Judah. ‘I will utterly consume everything from the face of the land,’ says the Lord; ‘I will
consume man and beast; I will consume the birds of the heavens, the fish of the sea, 
and the stumbling blocks along with the wicked. I will cut off man from the face of the 
land,’ says the Lord."

Passages From The Writings

Prophets and Psalms (P&P)



"All knowledge (cognitio) and understanding of truth will perish."

AC 411



"That the last time of vastation must exist before a new church can arise, is 
frequently declared by the Lord in the Prophets, and is called ‘vastation’ or 
‘laying waste,’ in reference to the celestial things of faith; and ‘desolation,’ in 
relation to the spiritual things of faith. It is also spoken of as ‘consummation’ 
and ‘cutting off.’" Zephaniah 1:1-18 is cited as an example.

Apocalypse Revealed (AR) 290



"[By]…‘every created thing which is in heaven, and on the earth, and under 
the earth, and in the sea,’ are meant angels… Their being called ‘created thing’
is according to the style of the Word, in which, by all created things, as well 
those which belong to the animal kingdom as those which belong to the 
vegetable kingdom, are signified various things with man, in general such 
things as belong to his will or affection, and such as pertain to his 
understanding or thought…since the Word is written by mere 
correspondences, similar things are said of the angels of heaven and the men 
of the church; in proof of which a few passages…shall be 
adduced…"Zephaniah 1:2-3 is cited.

AR 567



"…harmless and useful beasts signify man as to good affections, and noxious 
and useless beasts signify man as to his evil affections… The reason is, 
because the affections of a man, in the spiritual world, appear at a distance as

9

beasts…and beasts, considered in themselves, are nothing but forms of 
natural affections… That men, as to their affections, are meant by ‘beasts,’…‘by
beasts’ are signified men as to their affections. By ‘man and beasts’ together 
is signified man as to spiritual and natural affection (as in the following 
passages)…" Zephaniah 1:2-3 and Zephaniah 2:13-14 are cited.

AE 342 [9]



"‘Man and beast’ when mentioned together signify the interior and exterior 
affections of good…and ‘the fowl of the heavens and the fishes of the sea’ 
signify the affections of truth and the thoughts spiritual and natural, but in 
the passages here cited, that these are about to perish." Zephaniah 1:2-3 is 
cited.

AE 650 [17]



"In these passages [Zephaniah 1:2-3] ‘man and beast’ signifies what is 
interior or spiritual, and ‘beast’ what is exterior or natural; and therefore 
‘man’ signifies the spiritual affection of truth, from which is all intelligence, 
and ‘beast’ the natural affection corresponding to the spiritual. What is 
exterior or natural is signified by ‘beast,’ because man, in respect to his 
external or natural man is nothing but a beast; for he enjoys like desires and 
also pleasures, appetites and senses, so that in these respects man is entirely 
similar to the beast; therefore the natural man may be called the animal man. 
But what is internal or spiritual is signified by ‘man,’ because it is in respect 
to his internal or spiritual that man is man…"

AC 776 [4]



"Here [Zephaniah 1:3] ‘man and beast’ denote the things which are of love 
and of good; the ‘fowls of the heaven and the fishes of the sea,’ the things 
which are of the understanding, thus which are of truth. These are called 
‘stumbling-blocks’ because goods and truths are stumbling-blocks to the 
wicked, but not beasts and birds; and they are also plainly spoken of ‘man’."

AC 991



"In [Zephaniah 1:3] the ‘fowls of the heavens’ denote things of reason, and the
‘fishes of the sea’ lower rational things, that is, man’s thought from sensuous 
memory-knowledges."

10

AC 7523 [1&2]



"…‘beast’ denotes the affection of good, and in the opposite sense the cupidity
of evil… ‘Man and beast’ denote interior and exterior good…" Zephaniah 1:3is 
cited as an example.

AR 405



"…[in the spiritual world] the affections and the perceptions and the thoughts
of spirits and angels appear at a distance in the forms of animals or creatures 
upon the earth, which are called beasts, of creatures in the air which are 
called birds, and of creatures in the sea which are called fishes, therefore in 
the Word mention is so often made of ‘beasts,’ ‘birds,’ and ‘fishes,’ by which 
nothing else is meant…" Zephaniah 1:3 is cited as an example.

AR 757



"…by ‘bird’ is signified everything that is of the thought or the understanding 
and thence of the design…" Zephaniah 1:3 is listed among many examples 
from the Word.

AE 280 [8]



"In Zephaniah (1:3)…‘To take away man and beast’ means to take away the 
spiritual affection of truth; ‘to take away the fowl of the heavens and the 
fishes of the sea’ means to take away spiritual truths and natural truths; and 
‘to cut off man from the surfaces of the earth’ means to cut off the affection of 
truth and wisdom."

AE 513 [8]



"In Zephaniah (1:3)…‘the beast of the field’ means man’s voluntary faculty, 
‘the fowl of heaven’ his intellectual faculty, and ‘the fish of the sea’ his 
knowing faculty…"

AE 1100 [16]



"In Zephaniah (1:3) ‘To consume man and beast’ signifies to destroy spiritual 
and natural affection; ‘to consume the birds of the heavens and the fishes of 
the sea’ signifies to destroy the perceptions and knowledges of truth; and as 
these signify things pertaining to the church it is said, ‘I will cut off man from 
the faces of the land,’ ‘man’ signifying everything of the church."

11

Derived Doctrine

"The word of the Lord which came to Zephaniah…"

"Coming" denotes communication by influx. (AC 5249)


 AC 5272 teaches that "the Word of the Lord" signifies divine truth, from which

all things, which are things, exist.

 Most importantly, we get the sense that we are being shown that all that 

follows in this prophecy is the Lord speaking and not the prophet. His word is
the "all" for our spiritual good and truth.

"…the son of Cushi, the son of Gedaliah, the son of Amariah, the son of Hezekiah…"

 Four generations are mentioned in this first verse. We need to reflect on the 
possible correspondential meaning of Zephaniah’s lineage. It is necessary for 
us to consider the meaning of the number four, the idea of a generation, and 
the offices (uses) that some of Zephaniah’s forefathers served. Especially 
must we note Zephaniah’s connection with the royal family of king Hezekiah 
and king Josiah.

 Four signifies union, or disunion in a negative sense, because it is two pairs.

(AC 1686) Four signifies the duration and state of temptation. (AC 1856) Four 
signifies what is conjoined to the full in repayment for an injury or injustice. 
Four signifies the restoration of interior good to the full. (AC 9103 [2])

 Generations signify those who are perpetually being regenerated, or created 
anew. (AC 1041) Passages in AC 208 and 280 to 285 help us to reflect on the 
meaning of "fourth posterity." "…the fourth posterity of the Most Ancient 
Church [occurred when they allowed] themselves to be seduced by self-love 
and were unwilling to believe what was revealed, unless they saw it 
confirmed by the things of sense and of memory-knowledge."

 AC 280-285 gives us the meaning of seven posterities. The fourth posterity 



denotes a state where "natural good [begins] to be dissipated…"
I cannot find a representation of the name Cushi, nor can I find a meaning for 
his name. Is his name a shortening of the name Cushite?

 Gedaliah’s name means "Jehovah is great." Other then this insight, we have no

doctrinal teachings about him.

 Amariah’s name means "Jehovah has spoken." Amariah was a son of 

Hezekiah, and he was a subordinate Levite, one of six assistants appointed to 
help in the distribution of offerings. (II Chronicles 31:15)

 Hezekiah’s name means "Jehovah is my strength." Hezekiah succeeded his 

pagan-minded father, Ahaz, and led his people through some frightening days
when the Assyrians were on a campaign to conquer all the nations around 
them. Hezekiah sought to bring the people out of their pagan worship. He 
destroyed shrines, high places, pillars, Asherah images, and any venerated 
icon he found being worshipped in the kingdom.

12

 Unfortunately, Manasseh, his son, did not continue with the work of spiritual 
cleansing. Instead, Manasseh brought the nation to a low point of spirituality 
by rebuilding the "high places," restoring the altars of Ashtoreth, Chemosh, 
Milcom, and Baal. Manasseh allowed the worship of the stars, sun, moon, and 
astral bodies within the temples. To keep Assyria from attacking his kingdom,
he paid tribute to their deity Esarhaddon.

 All of this information is useful when we consider Josiah’s reign. He 

succeeded Manasseh and sought to restore the worship of the Lord among 
the people. Zephaniah was called during this period of reformation. Josiah’s 
name means "may Jehovah give."

 Priestly uses represent the Lord as to the Divine good and the work of 

salvation. (AR 854) Priests are to teach truth, and so lead to good, and to the 
Lord. (AC 10794)

 Kings and rulers signify divine truth and divine good in the Lord and from 

Him. (AE 446 [16])

All of these derived doctrines seem to offer us important clues when we consider the
importance and meaning of "four generations" in this passage. Their names, the 
successive seed that passed on the inherited tendencies toward good and evil in 
their souls, and their uses testify what tendencies toward good and evil the 
generations had inherited and to what state Zephaniah was called to speak the 
words of the Lord.

Remember that the purpose of derived doctrine is to help us see the spiritual sense 
more fully. Without doctrine, the words about the Lord consuming everything from 
the face of the earth—men, beasts, birds, and fish of the sea—seem harsh and 
vindictive.

Putting It All Together

"All knowledge and understanding of truth will perish." (P&P) "I will utterly 
consume everything from the face of the land. I will consume man and beast…the 
birds…the fish and the stumbling blocks along with the wicked. I will cut off man 
from the face of the land, says the Lord."

Taken at face value, these are chilling words. How could Zephaniah’s listeners ignore
or brush off the Lord’s promise to "utterly consume" and "cut off man from the face 
of the earth"?

The direct teachings of doctrine indicate such things were to happen within the 
hearts and minds of the people of Judah. "Vastations must exist before a new church 
can arise…" (AC 411)

There were 20 kings of Judah prior to the great exiles. Of those 20, 12 were bad 
kings and 8 were good kings. Manasseh, a bad king, ruled 55 years. During that 

13

reign, he allowed serious spiritual disorders to exist and thrive in the kingdom. His 
evil leadership provided the means and example for the people to move away from 
the Lord. So the minds and hearts of the people were in great errors, evils, and sins. 
In the words of our text, their hearts and minds were providing "stumbling blocks" 
to all that was holy and good.

The Writings picture the "spawning medium" of hell as a self-love out of order. If a 
church is to be saved or preserved, the stumbling blocks of self-love must be 
emptied and consumed. AC 5258 expresses what this consuming means: falsities 
that are not of charity or of faith must be exterminated. This cleansing occurs in the 
voluntary (love), in the intellectual (wisdom), and in the knowing (use) faculties. 
Hence we have the representations of the beast, the fowl, and the fish. Each of these 
inner vessels required a Divine purging to be saved and to make room for the new 
church to rise up.

Read and Review

Read Zephaniah 1:1-3.

Questions To Stimulate Reflection

1. As you read the literal sense about the utter consummation that the Lord 

would bring about, did you sense or anticipate that this was a spiritual event?
Why?

2. Can we imagine what it would be like to live under total spiritual chaos for 55
years? What effect would so many years of worshipping multiple gods have 
on us and our children? How would this confuse our understanding of the 
true nature of the Lord?

3. Spiritual stumbling blocks are something we experience daily. For example, 

when we express a doctrinally based personal belief, it is not always 
welcomed. An exchange of views on doctrine may bring us into a "point and 
counterpoint" argument with someone. Stumbling blocks are troublesome 
and hurtful. How can we face them? Can we avoid them? How can we 
overcome them without compromising the Lord’s truth? How can we 
faithfully present the Lord’s truth with charity and conviction?

4. What did you take from the information about the four generations of 

Zephaniah? What correspondence was most interesting to you? How did the 
representation of generations add to your reflection? Was the possibility that 
Zephaniah’s lineage linked him to a royal family of any significance?

14

5. What do you understand about the concept of vastations? Are vastations 

welcome, to a degree, as a necessary event for the New Church to begin and 
flourish?

6. Please note that the Lord promises to empty the church of falsity. Doesn’t that
promise give us some hope and confidence while we are waging war against 
hell?

ZEPHANIAH 1:4-6

"I will stretch out My hand against Judah, and against all the inhabitants of Jerusalem. 
I will cut off every trace of Baal from this place, the names of the idolatrous priests 
with the pagan priests – those who worship the host of heaven on the housetops; those 
who worship and swear oaths by the Lord, but who also swear by Milcom; those who 
have turned back from following the Lord, and have not sought the Lord, nor inquired 
of Him."

Passages From The Writings

P&P



"The church will perish because it is in mere falsities and evils in respect to 
doctrine and in respect to worship."

AE 608 [7]



"As the ancients were allowed to swear by Jehovah God, it follows that it was 
an enormous evil to swear falsely or to swear to a lie, as is evident from these 
passages." Zephaniah 1:4-6 is cited.

AC 10184 [3]



"As a ‘roof’ signified good, therefore the ancients had roofs on their houses 
where they walked, and where they worshiped, as can be seen in…Zephaniah 
1:5."

AR 919



"Since by ‘the sun,’ in the opposite sense, is signified self-love, and by ‘the 
moon’ one’s own intelligence and faith from himself, therefore, it was an 
abomination to adore the sun, moon, and stars, as may appear…in Zephaniah 
1:5; and that such were stoned."

15

AE 573 [8]



"In Zephaniah (1:5)…‘the host of the heavens’ means the sun, moon, and 
stars, because these signify all goods and truths in the complex, but here all 
evils and falsities in the complex; for the ‘sun’ in the contrary sense, as here, 
signifies all the evil flowing from the love of self, the ‘moon’ the falsity of faith,
and the ‘stars’ falsities in general (that the ‘sun, moon, and stars,’ in the 
natural world, when they are worshiped instead of the sun and moon of the 
angelic heaven, signify direful evils and falsities….)."

Derived Doctrine

"I will stretch out My hand against Judah…"

 AC 7205 offers us an insight into the meaning of stretching out. "…from the 
signification of a ‘stretched out arm,’ as being Divine power… [That a] 
‘stretched out arm’ denotes omnipotence or Divine power, is because when 
an arm appears stretched out in the heavens, there is represented power 
from the Divine… Hence then it is, that in the Word, Divine power is very 
often expressed by a ‘stretched out arm,’ and by a ‘strong hand,’…" AE 
684instructs us that the hand signifies the omnipotence of truth from good,
and the arm represents the omnipotence of good by truth.

 The Lord opposing or being against Judah seems obvious. Judah was 

worshiping idols and other gods, and making unholy pledges. The Lord’s 
omnipotence and power would come against such evils and sins.

"…against all of the inhabitants of Jerusalem."

 AE 741 indicates that to "inhabit" signifies those of the church who are in (or 



lacking) the good of doctrine, and thence the good of life. AR 558 says 
inhabiting signifies those who are principled in the doctrine of faith alone 
and thence in the evils of life.
Jerusalem has a positive and negative correspondence. AC 2909 notes that 
Jerusalem signifies the Lord’s spiritual church and His celestial church. AC 
2466 [3] notes that in the opposite sense, Jerusalem represents the church 
perverted as to truths.

"I will cut off every trace of Baal…the names of idolatrous priests with the pagan 
priests…"

 AE 315 [23] explains that to "cut" signifies that divine truth shall be taken 

from the people but shall live again in a new church. AC 9316 explains that to 
"cut out" signifies that hell is to be removed solely through the protection of 
heaven and by the hand of the Lord.

16

 Baal signifies worship motivated by the evils of self-love and love of the 



world. (AE 160 [2])
Idolatrous priests represent those who should have known better but chose 
to blaspheme and falsify the truths.

 Pagan priests were gentiles. They polluted truth because of their ignorance. 
Both idolatrous and pagan forms of worship need to have their names 
(essence or qualities) wiped out by the Lord when He establishes His new 
church.

"…those who swear by Milcom…"

 Milcom or Malcam is an Ammonite god also called Molech. Scholars believe 
that Molech was a pagan deity to whom children were sacrificed as a means 
of making the most binding vows or pledges, to emphasis the sanctity of a 
vow.

 The literal sense describes the followers of Molech as people who turn their 

backs on the Lord. Does the word "traitor" seem to be implied here?

Putting It All Together

P&P sums up these verses by saying, "The church will perish because it is in mere 
falsities and evils in respect to doctrine and in respect to worship."

The people of Judah were swearing by the name of the Lord and yet not meaning it. 
There was a showy appearance (the rooftop walk) that they were doing the right 
things. They tried to mix all forms of faith together to please everyone, to 
accommodate the preferences for differing forms of worship. Those who turned 
away from following the Lord had "not sought Him nor inquired of Him."

Throughout the Word, the Lord reminds His people to "choose this day whom you 
will serve." He asks them how long they will limp between opinions. He tells us that 
we cannot serve God and mammon. We will love one and hate the other.

The Lord said He would stretch out His hand. His divine omnipotence of truth from 
good would eradicate the vain promises of Judah. The twisted doctrines of the 
Jewish priests and the ignorance of the pagan priests had to be cut out of the heart 
and mind of Judah. Cutting it out seems like an appropriate representation. Like a 
cancer, self-love has to be completely removed along with all its extending tentacles. 
When the Lord deals with evil and sin, there is no room for a compromise with the 
hells. No deals. It has to be done the Lord’s way. He sees and knows the way of truth
—doctrine—and He builds the New Church where open and loving worship will 
flow from the heart and mind.

Questions To Stimulate Reflection

1. As you read this short section, how did you respond to the imagery of the 
Lord’s "stretched arm"? The Divine power of the Lord’s arm and hand 
stretching to cover all things gives us a sense of His protective, controlling 
power. It is a powerful image to hold onto, especially when hell tries to 
convince us the Lord’s arms are too short or small to help everyone.

2. What images are conjured up by the picture of the people of Judea walking on
the housetop swearing vows to the Lord? Why does this seem representative 
of what a vain, pompous, spiritually empty person would be like? Can you 
think of stories in the Word that show a contrasting type of person?

3. The inhabitants of Judah lapsed into a forgetful spirit; they did not seek the 
Lord, nor did they ask about Him. How can we learn from their mistakes? 
How can we sincerely "inquire" about the Lord with interest and care?

4. Once again, let’s think about the cutting off or cutting out of dead falsity 

within our hearts. How does this "surgery" feel? Painful or bearable? Is it life 
saving? How is it accomplished?

5. Can you identify with what traitor priests and pagan priests do to our lives? 

Any current examples come to mind?

6. Have you ever "sworn by the Lord’s name" and not kept the promise? Can you

imagine a situation where someone intentionally "swears to a lie"?

7. Perjury is an action the courts hold to be a heinous crime. Do life experiences 
sometimes justify or excuse "white" lies? Why or why not? Is there a limit 
after which you won’t tolerate false "swearing"?

ZEPHANIAH 1:7-8

"Be silent in the presence of the Lord God; for the day of the Lord is at hand, for the 
Lord has prepared a sacrifice; He has invited His guests. And it shall be, in the day of 
the Lord’s sacrifice, that I will punish the princes and the king’s children, and all such 
as are clothed with foreign apparel.”



"That ‘the great day of God Almighty" signifies the coming of the Lord, and

AC 10287 [15]



"In Zephaniah (1:8)…‘those clothed in the clothing of a foreigner’ denote

visitation, denote the chief truths, and in the opposite sense the chief falsities 
(that princes have this signification, see n. 1482, 2089, 5044; and that ‘kings’ 
denote truths themselves, and in the opposite sense falsities themselves…) 
consequently ‘the king’s sons’ denote that which is derived therefrom."

AE 195 [12]



"In Zephaniah (1:8)…‘Princes’ and ‘king’s sons’ signify those who are in 
truths, and in the contrary sense, as here, those who are in falsities; these are 
said to be ‘clothed with the garment of the alien,’ because ‘garment’ signifies 
falsity, and ‘alien’ those who are out of the church and do not acknowledge 
the truths of the church."

Doctrine of the Lord 14 [4-5]

 The Lord’s advent into the world, and His subsequent victory in the Word are 
described as "…they are dismayed, and that their strong ones being beaten 
down… His advent into the world for this purpose is meant by, ‘that day is to 
the Lord Jehovih Zebaoth a day of vengeance, that He may take vengeance of 
His enemies." Zephaniah 1:8, 15-16 are cited among other verses.

Derived Doctrine

"Be silent in the presence of the Lord God…"

 AC 8176 explains that "silence" signifies an awareness that nothing can or will
be accomplished by one’s own strength. Psalm 46:10 carries this theme: "Be 
still and know that I am God; I will be exalted among the nations. I will be 
exalted in the earth." Psalm 4:4 urges us to "Meditate within your heart on 
your bed, and be still." "The Lord is in His holy temple; let all the earth keep 

20

silence before Him." (Habakkuk 2:20) "When He opened the seventh seal, 
there was silence in heaven for about half an hour." (Revelation 8:1)
 AE 487 explains the meaning of the words in Revelation 8:1: "When He 

opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven…" This "signifies 
astonishment that the church is such and that its end is at hand… [and 
signifies] the destruction of the church and the damnation of all in whom 
there was no church; that is, in whom there was no conjunction of truth and 
good or of faith and charity; for this conjunction makes the church in every 
one."

"For the Lord has prepared a sacrifice; He has invited His guests."

 AC 5998 explains that a sacrifice signifies worship from charity, or from 

truths which are from good.

 A worthy sacrifice will have a Divine influx that comes from the Divine 

Intellectual. Thus, we can see why it is said in our verse that the Lord has 
prepared a sacrifice. He gives His people a special sacrifice of worship from 
charity and invites guests to His sacrifice.

 AC 4205 (Elliott translation) explains the meaning of "guest" this way: "…

good flows in from the Lord, but does not become fixed within anything apart
from truths, for truths receive good as a guest since the two are congenial…
good flowing in from the Lord is able to be received as a guest."

"And it shall be."

 The word "Amen" means may it ever be so. Doctrine of Faith 6 explains: "…
truth and faith are one word in the Hebrew language, namely Amuna or 
Amen." "And it shall be" seems to be an utterance of the word Amen.

Putting It All Together

"The Lord will come and gather [men] together to the church." (P&P)

Within your heart and mind, picture Zephaniah speaking these words to the people 
of the church: "Be silent in the presence of the Lord God." In the place of any terror, 
focus on this calming thought: The Lord is asking us to be still. For just a moment, 
put aside all other plans and worries. Let your soul drink in the message that the 
Lord is in charge. His plan, His Providence wants to give us a sacrifice that is full of 
holiness and a sense of joyous worship. The Lord wants us to receive an influx of His 
Love and Wisdom, so that we recognize that we can welcome Him in as our desired 
guest.

There is a required state that we need to create in ourselves and offer up to the Lord.
We need to get rid of the "princes and the king’s children." We need to throw off such

21

things that are like "foreign apparel," the pretense, the act of looking good on the 
outside with evil and sin underneath.

The words of the Lord, "Be still and know that I am God…" carry a soothing message 
that is important to hear in our "as-of-self" lifestyle. The Lord is in charge, and all 
will be well with those who trust in His providential guidance.

His first advent defeated all of the disorder the hells sought to use against Him. None
of their tricks worked. Now we have a prophetical message that the Lord will "come 
and gather together the church." Which church? The New Church. How do we know 
this? The prophets repeat this message over and over again. They are wonderful 
words of life. They are words to carry in the heart and mind while battling the 
bullies of hell. They are words worth repeating often.

Let us prayerfully recite these quotes from the Word:






"Be silent in the presence of the Lord God."
"The Lord is in His holy temple; let all the earth keep silence before Him."
"Be still and know that I am God."
"Meditate within your heart on your bed, and be still."

ZEPHANIAH 1:9-11

"In the same day I will punish all those who leap over the threshold, who fill their 
masters’ houses with violence and deceit. And there shall be on that day, says the Lord, 
the sound of a mournful cry from the Fish Gate, a wailing from the Second Quarter, 
and a loud crashing from the hills. Wail, you inhabitants of Maktesh! For all the 
merchant people are cut down; all those who handle money are cut off.”

Passages From The Writings

P&P



"Then those who have adulterated the truths of the Word will perish, and are 
to be cast into hell."

AR 624



"…by ‘deceit’ is signified speech, preaching, and doctrine…and by ‘deceit’ is 
signified persuasion to evil by falsity, properly from cunning and design; for 
he who persuades to anything from cunning or deceit also persuades from 
design; for cunning or deceit proposes something to itself, conceals its 
purpose, and does it when opportunity offers …" Zephaniah 1:9 is cited 
among many other references.

AE 866 [3-4]



"…‘deceit’ signifies falsity that is not from ignorance of truth, but from 
deliberation, thus from the purpose of deceiving…‘violence and blood’ signify 
perversion of truth and falsification of the Word…" Zephaniah 1:9 is cited as 
an example.

AC 375



"A ‘voice crying,’ and the ‘voice of a cry,’ are common forms of expression in 
the Word, and are applied to every case where there is noise, tumult, or 
disturbance, and also on the occasion of any happy event… In the present 
passage it denotes accusation." Zephaniah 1:9-10 is cited as one of many 
examples.

23

AC 2240 [3]



"In Zephaniah (1:10, 13) where…a ‘cry’ is predicated of the falsities which lay
waste."

AR 885



"That ‘crying,’ in the Word, is said of grief and fear of falsities from hell, and 
thence of devastation by them, appears from the following 
passages…"Zephaniah 1:10, 13 are cited as examples.

Derived Doctrine

"In the same day I will punish all those who leap over the threshold…"

 The words "in the same day remind us that on the same day that He invites 
guests to the special holy sacrifice, He will deal with those not invited. The 
uninvited are those who chose to ignore the Lord’s invitation. Plain and 
simple, they did not want to come. Watching the Lord gather His church 
together caused them anguish. They hated the Lord, and they hated the 
church. What the church had to offer the soul made them uncomfortable, 
troubled, and sick.

 What did the uninvited do to bring this on themselves? They leapt over the 
threshold. What does this represent? A threshold signifies introductory 
truths. "Spirits who are in the knowledge of the doctrinals of faith, without 
love, are in such a coldness of life and obscurity of light that they cannot even 
approach the first threshold of the court of the heavens, but flee…" AC 3833 
[3] records this arcanum against those who will not believe: "…it may be 
known in what obscurity such persons are, and that they do not even see, 
much less touch, the first threshold of wisdom."

 Leaping in the positive sense signifies having a joy from the perception of 

truth. (AE 455 [20]) It would seem, then, that in the negative sense, leaping 
for the evil would be a joy at closing off, evicting, the introductory truths from
their lives. The remains of their youth and the first things of faith were stifled 
and allowed to wither and die.

"Who fill their masters’ houses with violence and deceit."

 Check AC 3041-45 regarding the meaning of a master. A master signifies 

knowledge of good in the natural person that exacts a sacred obligation or 
obedience. It is the pledging of the natural person to the good of marriage 
love. AE 409 [8] explains that master signifies the internal human whom the 
external human serves.

24

 Can we not, with what is given above, see that those who turn away from the 
Lord wish to fill the master’s house with things that are destructive of the 
internal or conjugial principles of doctrine?

"…a mournful cry from the Fish Gate…"

 Let’s first look at this from the literal sense. The Fish Gate was the main gate 
of Jerusalem. There, fish were sold. The fisherman unloaded their catch for 
sale in the market. Manasseh made some changes, or modifications, at this 
gate. He fortified the entrance way.

 Nebuchadnezzar made his triumphant entry through the Fish Gate. Indeed, 

when the city was attacked, there must have been a mournful sound heard as 
his army pressed on to the next gate.

 Fish signify items of information that arise or spring from sense-impressions 

and external learning. (AC 991)

 A gate signifies the teachings that introduce one to the truth of faith. (AC 

2943)

 A mournful cry signifies grief because truth and good are being destroyed. 

(AE 1129 [2])

"A wailing from the Second Quarter…"

 This second gate was second in dignity to the Fish Gate, but it had its place of 
importance because it had V-shaped defensive walls and some of the oldest 
ramparts of the city. Huldah the prophetess dwelt there. Josiah sent the newly
found scroll of Deuteronomy to her. She read the scroll and warned that the 
day of God’s reckoning was fast approaching. See II Kings 22:14 and II 
Chronicles 34:22.

 Again, can we see some of the importance of this literal sense to the spiritual 

sense of our study?

"Wail, you inhabitants of Maktesh!"

 Another name for Maktesh is "the Mortar." Its importance to the city of 

Jerusalem was its silver industry. Silver traders and silversmiths conducted 
their business there.
Silver signifies truth; in the opposite sense, it represents falsity. (AC 1551)


 Did the merchants use the silver to make idols?
 To wail signifies to have grief on account of damnation. (AE 659 [4]) To wail 
signifies the grief of sensuous people in their opposition to truths. (AR 435)

"All of the merchant people are cut down; all those who handle money are cut off."

 Merchants signify those who falsify the Word, speak out, and offer for sale.

(AE 543 [10])

25

 Money handlers signify those who make gain for themselves. (AE 840 [4])
 Both of these are "cut down" or "cut off.’ This action by the Lord signifies that 

hell is removed through the protection of heaven. (AC 9316)

Putting It All Together

"Then those who have adulterated the truths of the Word will perish, and are to be 
cast into hell." (P&P)

Choices are so important. If we listen to the Lord, we are invited to His Church. If we 
ignore and reject the invitation, we wall ourselves off from Him. Instead of filling the 
Master’s home with good things, those who reject Him fill their house with violence 
and deceit.

The inhabitants of a house of deceit and violence never get to, or past, the threshold. 
Like blind people, they grope and stumble, never finding the entrance or threshold. 
The sad part is that these people had the innocence of remains from their childhood.
The great spiritual Fish Gate was there. The Second Quarter had its prophetess to 
read the newly found Deuteronomy. But those intent on their evil ways wanted to 
hone their skills, to twist the silver truths, to make idols. They were more interested 
in making money for their own interests than in heeding the Lord’s call. What is to 
be the end for them? Mourning and wailing, to be cut down and cut off from eternity.

In these passages, we have contrasts. There is the invitation from the Lord to leap for
joy, and there is the "leaping over" the spiritual conjunction with the Lord. Obviously,
there is a silent question here: Which choice will we want for our soul?

Questions To Stimulate Reflection

1. What did the brief historical overview of the Fish Gate, the Second Quarter, 
and Maktesh help you discover about the deeper meaning of the spiritual 
sense?

2. What ideas did you have regarding the Master’s house? Is the house 
representative of our mind or soul? Is it both? Do we have a way to 
periodically clear our spiritual house of unhealthy spiritual clutter?

3. Hell always thinks it can win against the Lord. No matter how many times the
hells are defeated, their insanity continues to cloud their sense of reality. Do 

26

you think we pay unnecessary attention to their bragging? Do you think they 
will leave us alone if we remind ourselves often enough of the stories of the 
prophets (the Word)?

4. Have you ever noticed how often the Word uses the correspondences of fish? 
Think for a moment about the Lord’s ministry. He called fisherman to be His 
disciples. He sent them out several times to catch many fish after they had 
toiled all night with no results. Following His directions, they came back with 
record catches. The Lord used the correspondence of fish in His parables. He 
fed the multitude with the loaves and fish. He multiplied the fish and bread so
as to have 12 full baskets left over. When the question of taxes came up, He 
sent the disciples to a brook to catch a fish. In the mouth of the fish was a 
coin. After His resurrection, He sat on the shore and cooked fish for the 
disciples and called them in from fishing to sup with Him. Can you think of 
other uses the Word makes of fish?

5. Can you understand the spiritual reason why Nebuchadnezzar invaded the 

city of Jerusalem through the Fish Gate first and then worked his way toward 
the Second Quarter Gate?

ZEPHANIAH 1:12-13

"And it shall come to pass at that time that I will search Jerusalem with lamps, and 
punish the men who are settled in complacency, who say in their heart, ‘The Lord will 
not do good, nor will He do evil.’ Therefore their goods shall become booty, and their 
houses a desolation; they shall build houses, but not inhabit them; they shall plant 
vineyards, but not drink their wine.”

Passages From The Writings

P&P



"No truth will then be left in the church."

AC 1488 [2]



"‘Houses’ mean where there are wisdom and intelligence, thus where there 
are the knowledges of good and truth… ‘House’ is used in the opposite sense 
in Zephaniah (1:12 & 13)…‘houses’ denote memory-knowledges by which, 
through reasonings, come falsities."

AC 1071 [5]



"…planting vineyards and drinking the wine thereof is predicated, when [the 
spiritual church] becomes such as to have faith from charity. In Zephaniah 

27

(1:13)…is described the opposite condition, when the spiritual church is 
vastated."

AR 316

 Note that this number states: "Nearly the same words occur in Hosea 9:2, 3; 
Zephaniah 1:13; Lamentations 2:11, 12; Micah 6:15; Amos 5:11, Isaiah 24:6, 
7, 9, 11."

AE 376 [16]



"In Zephaniah (1:13) the ‘wealth that shall be for plunder’ signifies spiritual 
wealth, which is the knowledges of good and truth; ‘the houses that shall be 
for devastation’ signify the things of the church in man; that from these when 
devastated one profits nothing and receives nothing, even though he listens 
to them, and sees them in the Word, is signified by ‘building and not 
inhabiting, and planting vineyards and not drinking the wine thereof,’ 
‘houses’ meaning the goods of the church, and ‘vineyards’ with ‘wine’ its 
truths."

AE 919



"That a ‘vineyard’ signifies the spiritual church is evident from the passages 
in the Word where ‘vineyard’ is mentioned…" (Zephaniah 1:13 is cited among 
many other passages.) "From the signification of ‘vineyard’ it can be seen that
‘to gather the vintage’ signifies to collect for uses those things that will be 
serviceable to the understanding, and which give intelligence and wisdom; 
and in the contrary sense it signifies to lay waste the church as to spiritual 
good… In the contrary sense ‘vintage’…[is] used in the sense…this signifies…
that all spiritual good, and thus all truth that is truth…is destroyed; and this 
especially effected in the church by falsifications of the Word, likewise when 
evil of life corrupts all good, and falsity of doctrine perverts all truth…"

Derived Doctrine

"I will search Jerusalem with lamps…"

 AR 140 explains that by "searching" is signified "to see all the things which a 





man believes and loves, thus the quality of his truth and of his good."
"Lamps" signify "the light of truth from the Divine Human of the Lord." (AC 
2832 [3]). AR 796 explains that lamps signify an illumination from the Lord.
"Jerusalem," as explained in AR 880, signifies the church as to worship and its 
doctrine. "For worship is prescribed in doctrine and performed according to 
it…"

28

"…and punish the men…"

 TCR 459 [15] has a helpful explanation for punishment. In essence, this 
number teaches that punishment has as its end or use amendment. 
Punishment is to bring the offender into order, and it is to protect the greater 
good of society and heaven. Anger has nothing to do with punishment when 
administered by the Lord.

"…who are settled in complacency…"

 The Writings don’t seem to deal specifically with the word "complacent." But 

if we look for the synonyms of complacent, we find: contentment; 
satisfaction; and self - satisfaction.

 The Lord with His lamps will show what is at the core of the heart. The 

people to whom Zephaniah was speaking had no drive to undertake self-
examination. They had no desire to make themselves guilty for any 
transgressions. Nor were they willing to supplicate the Lord for help. They 
did not want a new spiritual life. They liked what and where they were 
spiritually. They were content with themselves.

"The Lord will not do good, nor will He do evil."

 Do we hear arrogance (the hells) speaking? Do we hear them saying the Lord 

is a do-nothing deity?

 The prophet Zephaniah tells how wrong they are in this assessment. He 

speaks for the Lord of action.

Putting It All Together

"No truth will be left in the church." (P&P) How do we know this? With the help of 
the internal sense, the truth of this statement is easily ratified.

The Lord says that He will come with His Divine lamp (light) and search the heart 
and mind of all within the church. He will examine what the people believe. He will 
look at their faith and doctrines. For those who believed in their own prudence, for 
those who were satisfied with life’s status quo (complacency), there is not good 
news: their evil ways will bring them self-punishment. They will not find heaven. In 
spite of their pronouncements of Divine inaction, good will come from the Lord. 
Rejection of the Lord will bring the evil to their knees. These things are so because 
the Divine order will serve as the amending force to bring about His new church.

For the evil, the plundering of their houses, the vineyards from which they could not 
drink wine, their goods becoming booty, the building of houses that they could not 
inhabit, all illustrate the fruitlessness of their choices. They do not have much to look
forward to.

29

Is this a hard message to consider? It depends on what choice has been made. For 
the faithful, it is an encouraging and reassuring prophecy. For those who hate the

ZEPHANIAH 1:14-17

"The great day of the Lord is near; it is near and hastens quickly. The noise of the day 
of the Lord is bitter; there the mighty men shall cry out. That day is a day of wrath, a 
day of trouble and distress, a day of devastation and desolation, a day of darkness and 
gloominess, a day of clouds and thick darkness, a day of trumpet and alarm against 
the fortified cities and against the high towers. I will bring distress upon men, and they
shall walk like blind men, because they have sinned against the Lord; their blood shall 
be poured out like dust, and their flesh like refuse.”

"They will perish on the day of the judgment by the Lord."

AC 1839 [5]

"That ‘the day of the Lord’s anger’ signifies the Last Judgment is evident from 
the following passages…Zephaniah 1:14, 15…"

AR 413



"Who…cannot see that the sun, the moon, and the stars of the world are not 
meant in these cases? That falsities of various kinds are signified by 
‘darkness,’ is evident from these passages…" Zephaniah 1:15 is cited among 
the many references.

AE 526 [5]



"…by ‘the day of Jehovah great and terrible;’ and as this comes when the 
church is in darkness and in thick darkness, that day is also called ‘a day of 
darkness and thick darkness,’ and also ‘a day of cloud and obscurity,’ as also 
in the following passages…In Zephaniah (1:14, 15)…"

31

AC 5376 [12]



"In Zephaniah (1:14-18)…it is evident that desolation is the apparent 
deprivation of truth with those who are being regenerated, but is the 
absolute deprivation of it with those who are not being regenerated."

AC 1860 [3]



"In Zephaniah (1:15)…‘the day of Jehovah’ denotes the last time of the church,
which is here treated of; ‘darkness’ denotes falsities, ‘thick darkness’ evils; 
both therefore are mentioned; otherwise it would be repetition of the same 
thing, or an unmeaning amplification. But the word in the original language 
that in this verse is rendered ‘thick darkness’ involves falsity as well as evil, 
that is dense falsity from which is evil, and also dense evil from which is 
falsity."

AC 7688 [2]



"[In Zephaniah 1:15]…‘darkness’ signifies falsities. In the Word ‘darkness’ 
also signifies ignorance of truth, such as the Gentiles are in who have not the 
Word and know nothing of the Lord."

AC 7711 [3]



"[In Zephaniah 1:15]…‘darkness’ denotes the privation of truth; and ‘thick 
darkness,’ the privation of truth and good; if ‘thick darkness’ signified nothing
more than ‘darkness,’ it would be an empty repetition which would be far 
from the Holy Word."

TCR 761 [3]



"…all the truth of the church will be consummated, and then it will be night, 
because the truth of the church is light." Zephaniah 1:15 is cited as one of the 
examples.



"…[that] by…trumpets…is signified the exploration and manifestation of what
the state of the church is with those whose religion is faith alone…may be 
seen in the following passages…" Zephaniah 1:15-16 is cited.

Derived Doctrine

"The noise of the day of the Lord is bitter; there the mighty men shall cry out."

 AE 618 offers us this insight regarding "bitter." "‘Bitter (or bitterness)’ 

signifies what is undelightful because of adulterated truth…what is sweet 
becomes bitter and thus undelightful by a mixture with something 
offensive…‘sweet’ signifies what is delightful from the good of truth and the 
truth of good, so ‘bitter’ signifies what is undelightful because of adulterated 
truth."
"The noise of the Lord is bitter…" signifies that the Lord’s presence will bring 
a sense of disturbance to those who adulterate truth. He "disturbs" their 
falsities. The angels view ‘noise’, generated by the Lord, as a form of 
celebration. (AC 375)
"…the mighty men shall cry out." The positive meaning of mighty men 
denotes those who are in the good of love. (AR 832)





 Conversely, "mighty ones" signify those who are intoxicated with self-love.

(AC 583)

 AR 885 instructs us that "cry" in the Word is said of every affection that 

breaks out from the heart. It can be a cry of lamentation, of imploring, of 
supplication, of indolence, of indignation, of confession, and of exultation.

"That day is a day of wrath, a day of trouble and distress, a day of devastation, a day of
darkness and gloominess, a day of clouds and thick darkness, a day of trumpet and 
alarm against the fortified cities and against the high towers."

 Heaven and Hell (HH) 155 tells us that "day" and "year" in the Word signify 



the states of life in general.
"Day of anger and wrath" relates to the Last Judgment executed at the Lord’s 
Second Advent. (AE 413)

 A day of "devastation" is predicated of good. (AE 960)
 A day of darkness signifies a state of ignorance caused by the deprivation of 



truth. (AE 526)
"Thick darkness" signifies the presence of hatred, instead of charity. (AC 
1860)The light of heaven effectively appears as darkness to those who are in 
the love of self and of the world. (AC 2441)

 A "trumpet" of alarm signals, or announces, that the intellectual of the church

has been laid to waste. (AC 4592 [10])



"A day of darkness and gloominess…" "They…who are in truth and not yet in 
good, are in shade [gloom] and darkness; because truth has no light from 
itself, and the light which they have from good is faint, like a light which is 
going out…" (AC 6400)
In TCR 755, we read "‘desolation signifies the consummation of truth, 
‘devastation’ the consummation of good…"
"High towers" signify the worship of self which manifests itself when a 
people exalt themselves above others. (AC 1302) The "highest towers" signify 
doctrines of falsity, or those who love to dominate by misusing the holy 
things of the church. (AC 315 [15])

"…they shall walk like blind men, because they have sinned against the Lord…"

 To be "blind" signifies being ignorant of truth and so being without 

understanding. (AE 239 [22])

 To "walk" signifies to live (or not live) according to the doctrine, or truth, of 

faith. (AC 519)

 The church, from its high tower of self-love, became like "blind men." The 
people of the church sinned against the Lord. Their eyes lost the heavenly 
light. They stumbled and tripped through life, missing the light of the Word 
because of their sins.

"…their blood shall be poured out like dust, and their flesh like refuse."



"Blood" in the positive sense represents charity, or love of the neighbor. (AC 
1000 [2])

 Blood being poured out like "dust" intends to show us something quite the 
opposite of charity. "Dust" signifies the sensuous life. Thus, blood being 
poured out like dust signifies a "charity" that lives only from what is physical 
and material, or the body and earth. (AC 242)
"Refuse," or litter or rubbish, signifies the worthlessness of such a life of 
pretense. Real charity begins with the shunning of evils as sins. This kind of 
life keeps our "blood" rich and contributing to the health and well-being of 
our spiritual life and vitality. (AE 374 [5])



Putting It All Together

"They [the high and lofty abusers of the Word in the church] will perish on the day of
the judgment by the Lord."

The spiritual sense of this portion of Zephaniah deals with the things that will occur 
following the Last Judgment. The Second Advent of the Lord will cause a positive 
internal conflict within the church. It is a necessary overturning and emptying of 
falsities that misled the hearts and minds of the people within the church. His 
spiritual coming will cause the church to face the most grievous and heart-searching 

34

temptations. Those who sought to hold the course of truth will find themselves on 
the edge of momentary anxiety and despair. But His Second Advent will be worth the
temporary anguish. This Last Judgment will inspire the unification of the faithful 
throughout the heavens. The Doctrine of the Lord will draw the good and faithful 
away from the influence of hell.

Hell does not like losing to the Lord. The mere mention of His presence and of 
restoration of the heavens causes the inhabitants of hell to speak words of 
condemnation about His uncharitableness to them. He is made to appear dark, 
gloomy, stormy, terrifying, vengeful, and a destroyer of people.

Those in hell like puffing themselves up. Their blood, their life, is one of pomposity. 
They love their lofty towers where they speak words and make "erudite" 
pronouncements solely to attain adulation from those who have joined them in a life
of "dust" blood and "refuse." The representation of the "dust" blood and "refuse" is 
powerful, a stark picture of spiritual reality from the Lord but ever so true. The Lord 
sees motives and intentions. His heavenly light exposes all corners and dark places 
where evil loves to hide and cover up its corrupt essence.

The Lord watches the extent of the shallowness of evil people. He permits the 
pompous pretenders their brief moment of flaunting good and truth. But it is only 
for a moment. The Lord wants all to know it will not last. It cannot last because it has
no light and wisdom. Like a flickering candle in the wind of the Lord’s refreshing 
truth, their flame will go out.

The hellish spirits lament this. They cry out in protest. They deny that it is of their 
own choice and actions that these things will come to fruition. No, they say, it is the 
Lord’s fault. He is the one who causes the dark, gloomy, fierce, vindictiveness that is 
so unfair.

The Lord’s Second Coming, the Last Judgment, is the great liberator of good and 
truth. To hell, the trumpet of the Lord is like a piercing "bitter" noise that hurts them.
To the angels, the trumpet of the Lord is a delightful "sweet" noise of great 
celebration and victory.

Questions To Stimulate Reflection

1. Are you anxious about the things that have to come to clear the way for the 

spiritual New Church? What makes you anxious?

2. The hells protest the Lord’s presence. They love to find examples of "unfair" 
things in life. Do we assist them in any fashion if we allow negative states to 
enter our mind? What negative issues capture your attention? How can you 
counteract this?

3. Hell’s lofty towers seem clear in the mind as a representation. Can you put 

any natural specifics with the spiritual imagery?

4. Bitter noise versus sweet noise of the Lord’s trumpet is an interesting 

concept. It seems to go along with the idea that one person’s meat is another 
person’s poison. Can you relate to times of bitter and sweet music from the 
Word?

5. Any thoughts regarding the blood like dust and the flesh like refuse? How can

we illustrate these states?

ZEPHANIAH 1:18

"Neither their silver nor their gold shall be able to deliver them in the day of the Lord’s 
wrath; but the whole land shall be devoured by the fire of His jealousy. For He will 
make speedy riddance of all those who dwell in the land."

Passages From The Writings

P&P



"They cannot be preserved."

AC 4535 [4]



"…by ‘land’ in the Word is signified the church…From this it is manifest what 
is meant …in Zephaniah by the ‘speedy consummation of all that dwell in the 
land.’ That the Jewish nation which dwelt in that land was not consummated, 
but the holy of worship with them…"

AR 216



"…‘zeal’ in the Lord is not wrath; it only appears so in externals, interiorly it is
love. It appears so in externals, because the Lord seems to be angry when He 
rebukes man, especially when man’s own evil punishes him. It is so permitted
from love, that his evil may be removed; just like a parent, who, if he loves his 
children, suffers [allows] them to be chastised for the sake of removing their 
evils." This explanation follows the citing of Zephaniah 1:18 and 3:8.

36

AR 658



"…by ‘the anger of God’ is signified evil with men, which, because it is against 
God, is called the anger of God; not that God is angry with man, but because 
man, from his evil, is angry with God, and because it appears to man, when he
is punished and tormented for it, as is the case after death in hell, as if it were
from God, therefore, in the Word, anger and wrath, yea evil, is attributed to 
God." Zephaniah 1:18 is cited as an example of this truth.

TCR 755



"…[that] the consummation of the age is the last time of the church, can be 
seen from those passages in the Word where it is spoken of…(Zephaniah 
1:18)…In these passages ‘the land’ signifies the church…"

AE 397 [3]



"In Zephaniah (1:18)…‘Consummation’ signifies the last state of the church, a 
state in which there is no longer any truth because there is no good, or in 
which there is no longer any faith because there is no charity; and when this 
is the state of the church, then comes the Last Judgment. The Last Judgment 
then comes, for the further reason that the human race is the basis or 
foundation of the angelic heaven, for the conjunction of the angelic heaven 
with the human race is perpetual…when therefore the basis does not 
correspond the angelic heaven totters; consequently there must then be a 
judgment…"

Derived Doctrine

"Neither their silver nor their gold shall be able to deliver them in the day of the Lord’s 
wrath…"





"Silver" signifies truth, and in the opposite sense, falsity. (AC 1551) Silver also 
signifies rational truth. (AC 2575)
"Gold" signifies good. It is representative of good from love and the good of 
faith from love. (AC 110)

 Gold and silver signify knowledge of celestial things and knowledge of 

spiritual things. (AC 1551 [3])

 The word "deliver" means to be saved or to be rescued. To be delivered in the 



positive sense means to be withdrawn from falsities. (AE 714 [14])
"The Lord’s wrath" signifies the advent of the Lord to judgment. (Divine Love 
and Wisdom [DLW] 5) This kind of wrath comes about when the Lord turns 
away the opposition and the consequent penalties the opposition feels from 
His judgment. (AC 5798 [6])

37

"…the whole land shall be devoured…"

 AC 2571 offers us a wide view of what "land" represents. Land may represent 
the internal man or woman of the church; the region where the church is; the 
church itself; also in the universal sense, the Lord’s kingdom in heaven and 
on earth; the doctrine of love and charity, hence the faith of the church.
 To be devoured signifies to destroy goods and truths. It also signifies the 

destruction of doctrine from its inception. (AR 542)

"By the fire of His jealousy…He will make speedy riddance of all those who dwell in the 
land."








"Fire" signifies the good of love. (AC 2799) Fire in the opposite sense 
represents the love of self and the hell of falsities therefrom. (AC 2444)
"Jealousy" signifies that divine truth is perceived as falsity and divine good as 
evil by those who do not receive the divine truth of the Lord’s divine good; so 
they attribute anger and wrath to the Divine, for to be jealous in the case of 
the Lord means to be zealous. The words jealous and zealous come from the 
same root meaning. (AC 8875)
Jealousy signifies the Lord’s love of saving humankind. (AC 5071)
"Zeal" signifies a kind of fire, but within it is the love of doing good to others, 
or, with the Lord, the love of saving humankind. (AC 5071)

 Can we now see the meaning of speedy riddance in the land? The Lord’s love 
is alive. It is quick, meaning it is fervent, thorough, and lively in its task of 
removing the hells and their attendant evils. Nothing of disorder shall be left 
when the Lord completes the consummation of the church.

Putting It All Together

"They [the great deceivers within the falsified church] cannot be preserved." (P&P)

Those who sought to be deceivers of the doctrines of the church cannot use the 
silver of "rational truths" to talk their way out of the Lord’s spiritual assessment. Nor
can they present the gold of imagined celestial knowledge to justify their actions. 
What looked beautiful and precious on the outside was a veneer—a cover-up—of a 
valueless base. TCR 519 likens the pretense of hell to coins made of dung and 
covered over with gold. Their fine coverings will not save them. So committed to evil 
were the people of Zephaniah’s time that there was no love left within their hearts to
be changed. If they had asked for help, it would have been given to them. But the 
great falsifiers wanted nothing to do with the Lord.

When the Lord cleans and purifies His church, He does so completely. The whole 
"land" will receive His cleansing. The "fire" of His jealousy is the way the Word 
explains what zeal He has to save humankind. The warmth of His love is strong and 
comforting. He will not tarry over the removal of disorder. Speedy. Complete. 

38

Thorough. Hell has nothing, no power, to stop the Divine process of reformation and 
regeneration.

Will this happen in our lifetime? Let the people say Amen, which is to say, "may it 
ever be so."

Questions To Stimulate Reflection

1.

Is there any uncertainty in your mind about what the Lord says will happen 
during the Last Judgment? What does this section teach you about the 
refreshing changes the Lord will introduce in His New Church?

2. Will the false charges against the Lord, by the deceivers, stand up in the end? 

Discuss this.

3. Remember when the Lord called Moses by the burning bush. Do you see 

something in that story that shows the fire of His love as a preservation of 
our freedom? The bush burned, but it was not consumed. What does this tell 
us about how the Lord leads us?

The promise of the Lord’s thorough emptying of the vastated church shows that He 
offers no compromises to the rebellious. Therefore, we can rest assured that there 
are no compromises with hell either. Comments?

ZEPHANIAH 2:1-3

"Gather yourselves together, yes, gather together, O undesirable [shameless] nation,

It may be that you will be hidden in the day of the Lord’s anger."

"‘The great day of the anger of the Lamb,’ signifies the day of the Last

Derived Doctrine

"Gather yourselves together, yes, gather together…"

 AC 679 explains that to "gather" signifies searching and gathering together 

(inventorying) the truths in the memory.

 AR 707 presents the negative meaning of gathering as signifying "to excite to 
combat from falsities against truths…From the purpose of destroying the 
New Church…"

 Please note

  the repetition of the word "gather." The cause of repetition in the 

Word is because the Word treats distinctly of the two faculties, namely the 
understanding and the will. (AC 707)

"O undesirable [shameless] nation…"

 As we know, there is a good and bad meaning to all words used in the 

spiritual sense. "Nation" in the good sense represents the Lord’s kingdom or 
the spiritual church that receives the good of faith. (AC 2699) In the negative 
meaning, nation signifies falsity from evil, that which comes from the 
sensuous man that nurtures destructive truths. (AE 724 [27]) "Nation" 
signifies those who trust in themselves. (AC 249)

 The wording of our text makes it plain as to which of the possible meanings 
of "nation" we need to reflect on. "O undesirable [shameless] nation…" This 
seems to call forth the image of a church or nation that was in love with 
nurturing those doctrines that harbor destructive truths.

"Before the decree is issued…"

 A decree signifies that the Lord was to come into the world. (TCR 101) A 

decree signifies an eternal law of order. (AC 10248)

 To "issue" means to set forth; to publish; to emit (to give influx); to announce.

"Or the day passes like chaff…"





"Chaff" signifies things in which there is nothing good and also falsity of 
every kind that has a hellish origin. (AC 3941 [9])
"Day" signifies vastation (as taught in Zephaniah 1:14), and "day" represents 
the last time and state of the church. (AC 488 [3] and 1839 [5])

"Before the Lord’s fierce anger comes upon you…"

 Anger (especially fierce anger) is attributed to the Lord, but it signifies more 
of the anger of the people, or church. It represents the separation or turning 
away from things divine; for when wrath or anger is said of the Lord, it means
a turning away on the part of the individual. (AC 10431)

41

 
 Any movement or correction by the Lord, to the evil, appears to be from 

anger, when in reality, His purpose is a calm and loving motive.

"Seek the Lord, all you meek of the earth…"

 To "seek" signifies a longing to be instructed in the ways of truth. (AC 3058 
[2]) Seeking describes the attitude of those who will nothing and seek 
nothing except that which is from the Lord, and whatever they ask is granted. 
(AR 951)

 The "meek" signify those who are in the good (love) of charity. (AE 304 

[44])Meekness denotes a willingness to follow the ways of the Lord. Putting 
aside our unhealthy forms of self-love is a worthy act of meekness.
 The spiritual meanings of the word "earth" are manifold. It would be 

impossible to record the full list in this brief capsulation. Here are but a few 
of the references to consider. The "earth" signifies the external man. (AC 477 
[3])"Earth" signifies a receptacle. (AC 28) "Earth" signifies the exterior things 
of the church, and interior things are the heavens. (AC 1066 [3]) In the 
parable of the Sower, four kinds of "earth" are mentioned. The good "earth" 
represents the good in a person, or church, which receives the Word. (AC 
3310 [2]) One last quote might be worth considering, too: "earth" signifies the
old church. (AC 8902 [8])

"…who have upheld His justice. Seek righteousness, seek humility."



"Justice" signifies a life that holds dearly to the good of charity. Those who 
love the good of charity are endowed by the Lord with the ability to know 
what is true. (AC 615)

 To "uphold" represents to support, and to have an inner sustainability in 

times of temptation. (AE 298 [10])
"Righteous" can be tied in with integrity and perfection, having a clear 
conscience and thinking from innocence and simple good. (AC 2525)
"Humility" signifies a willingness to give in to the ways of the Lord. It signifies
a quieting of one’s proprium so that the Lord’s Proprium can grow within us 
and lead the way to good and truth.
"Seeking" indicates a willingness to be instructed in truths. (AC 3058 [2])







"It may be that you will be hidden in the day of the Lord’s anger."

 When the words "It may be…" occur in the Word, the core of their meaning 

seems best explained by the following passage from AC 994: "…interior things
are as it were asleep, being immersed in the corporeal things. But yet it may 
be evident to any one who reflects, that all pleasures are such as are the 
affections that are more and more interior, and that they receive from these 
all their essence and quality." The words "It may be…" remind the reader of 

42

the words "Nunc Licet." "Now it is permitted..." Interior things will give the 
faithful a sense of new enlightenment, protection, and pleasures forevermore.

 To be "hidden" by the Lord signifies finding refuge in the protection of the 



Lord. (AC 8764)
"…in the day of the Lord’s anger…" We best understand this phrase when we 
study the root meanings of anger and zeal. The Lord has no anger. He is full of
zeal. He wishes no harm or destruction on anyone. He doesn’t lash out, nor 
does He seek revenge. Zealously, He wants to save, protect, and deliver all 
from the anger of hell. We are the ones who project anger on the Lord when 
in fact it is hell that is full of anger.

 The phrase "day of anger" as used in the Old Testament relates, or points, to 
the judgment that will be executed at the incarnation of the Lord. (AE 413 [6-
7]; AC 488 [3] and 1839 [5])

Putting It All Together

"They ought to be converted before the Lord comes to judgment." (P&P)

The underlining of the words ought and converted is added to help us focus on our 
summary. The word "ought" conveys to us a powerful sense of why we have the 
Lord’s Divine imperative. The church ought to be proactive in its work of repentance,
reformation, and regeneration. It’s a work dedicated to preparing the way for the 
Lord. To use the imagery of Isaiah 40:3-4 and Luke 3:5, our spiritual work is a 
specific series of changes. The Word proposes changes that will make His 
incarnation positively direct and free of stumbling blocks.

"Prepare the way of the Lord; make straight in the desert a highway for our God. 
Every valley shall be exalted and every mountain and hill brought low; the crooked 
places shall be made straight and the rough places smooth…"

AE 405 [36] explains this passage as signifying that we "should prepare [ourselves] 
to receive the Lord; ‘wilderness’ signifying where there is no good because there is 
no truth, thus where there is as yet no church; ‘every valley shall be lifted up, and 
every mountain and hill shall be made low,’ signifies that all who are humble in 
heart, that is, all who are in goods and truths, are received, for such as are received 
by the Lord are raised up to heaven; while ‘every mountain and hill shall be made 
low’ signifies that all who are elated in mind, that is, who are in love of self and the 
world, shall be put down."

The call to be converted will bring us out of the "undesirable [shameless]" nation 
state. Instead of being like chaff, we can be converted to the "heart" or kernel of 
wheat. Conversion changes our negative fear of the Lord to a positive love of the 
Lord. We will seek His counsel. His love and wisdom will give us a sense of being 
upheld by His justice. In the stream of the Lord’s Providence, we will be carried to 

43

places of innocence, peace, calmness, tranquility, and mutual love to the Lord and 
the neighbor.

Please note how understanding the spiritual sense of the Word turns us away from 
negative ideas. Quickly the affirmative side of the Lord’s Providence calls us to 
gather ourselves together and prepare the way for Him. "Seek the Lord, all you meek
of the earth…seek righteousness, seek humility."

Questions To Stimulate Reflection

1. How do the words "ought" and "conversion" sit with you? There are some 
psychological schools of thought that urge us to give up on compulsion 
words. Should, ought, and must are seen as enemies of a healthy and 
balanced psyche. Do you agree with this concept? What about the church’s 
teachings that tell us there is freedom in self-compulsion?

2.

If these compulsion words are not troublesome, how do you incorporate 
them into a healthy lifestyle?

3. How about the word "conversion"? What does it mean to be converted?

4. What "valleys" in life can you identify that need to be lifted up? In the stories 
of the Word, wars, despair, and danger exist in the valley. The Twenty-Third 
Psalm reminds us: "Yea, though I walk through the Valley of the shadow of 
death, I shall fear no evil; for Thou art with me…"

5. The mountains that need to be lowered speak of a mental vanity. What are 

some spiritual mountains that need to be leveled or moved?

6. Remember, these preparatory events are not just to humiliate us. They are to 
be experienced to make the way straight for the Lord. We need to get the 
crooked straight. What does this last process tell us about playing around 
with truth, twisting it this way and that way for our own ends?

7. Lastly, did the harshness of the literal sense soften for you as the spiritual 

sense shone through?

ZEPHANIAH 2:4-6

"For Gaza shall be forsaken, and Ashkelon desolate; they shall drive out Ashdod at 
noonday, and Ekron shall be uprooted. Woe to the inhabitants of the seacoast, the 
nation of the Cherethitest! The word of the Lord is against you, O Canaan, land of the 
Philistines: "I will destroy you; so there shall be no inhabitant.’ The seacoast shall be 
pastures, with shelters for shepherds and folds for flocks."

Passages From The Writings

P&P



"…for the evil will then perish on account of evils and falsities of many kinds."

AC 1197 [3]



"The ‘Philistines’ signify in general a mere memory-knowledge of the 
knowledges of faith, and specifically those who make faith and salvation 
consist in knowledges alone, which they make matters of memory…" Thus, "it 
is evident what is meant by the Philistines, and by ‘all of Philistia,’ or all ‘the 
borders’ of it…So also in other places in the Prophets, as in…Zephaniah 2:5…"

AC 9340 [4]



"The reason why ‘Philistia,’ which bordered on the land of Canaan even unto 
Tyre and Zidon, signified the interior truths of faith, was that the 
representative Ancient Church had been there, as is evident from the remains
of Divine worship among its inhabitants, and referred to in the historic and 
prophetic books of the Word that treat of the Philistines and the land of 
Philistia; as in the prophecies of…Zephaniah 2:5…"

AC 1565



"That ‘flock and herd’ signify the possessions of the external man, is evident 
from the signification of ‘flock’ and ‘herd,’ as being goods…" And that they 
also "signify things not good, is evident from the following passages of the 
Word." Zephaniah 2:5-6 is cited among other references.

AC 2323 [3]



"…when a Judgment is close at hand, that is, the salvation of the faithful and 
the condemnation of the unfaithful, then visitation precedes, or an 
exploration of what quality they are, that is, whether there is any charity and 
faith. This visitation takes place in the ‘evening;’ and therefore the visitation 
itself is called ‘evening,’ as in Zephaniah…2:5, 7."

45

Derived Doctrine

"For Gaza shall be forsaken…"


"…by ‘Gaza’ [are signified] the things that are revealed concerning charity…"
 To be forsaken signifies withdrawal. The apparent absence of the Lord is the 

result of the lack of charity and the iniquities and sins of the Philistine 
church.(AE 412 [19])

"…and Ashkelon desolate…"

 Of the five principal cities of the Philistines, Ashkelon is the only one located 
on a seacoast. Ashkelon’s long history shows a spirit of rebellion. She caused 
the Egyptian Pharaoh, Ramses II, to storm her city. He crushed the rebels, and
to record his victory, he inscribed on their temple walls a dramatic 
representation of the battle.

 Was the spirit of Ashkelon’s rebellious nature actively being demonstrated 

against the Lord? Are we to consider the spiritual meaning, or representation,
of a Philistine city on a seacoast? A "sea" represents a collection of spiritual 
and natural knowledges in the memory. (AC 28 and 991) A "coast" represents 
the border, the extension of the church from the knowing faculty to the 
intuitive and thinking faculties. (AC 569 [12])

 To be "desolate" signifies to be without visible truth. (AC 6141) To be desolate

connotes ruin.

"They shall drive out Ashdod at noonday…"



 Ashdod, too, was one of the five principal cities of the Philistines. It was the 
northernmost city (near the coast and half way between Gaza and Joppa.) 
When the Philistines captured the Ark of the Covenant, they took it to 
Ashdod, where the temple of the god Dagon was located.
Since we don’t have a direct teaching about Ashdod, we have to turn to what 
we do know to draw inferences about what might be represented. The 
Philistines represent those whose faith is separated from charity. They place 
everything of religion in knowledge and cognitions. This type of faith sounds 
like faith alone. (AE 700 and TCR 203) Dagon represents a mixture of 
doctrine. They made the representation of Dagon in a form that was half man 
and half fish. Dagon’s form testifies to this mixture that lacks intelligence and 
power and is deficient of spiritual good. Does its northern location also tell us
about a "coldness" or indifference to the good and truth of the Lord?
 To "drive out" signifies that the Lord will put to flight all of their evils and 



falsities. (AC 1835)
"Noonday" is a period of the day where the greatest amount of light is 
present. Noonday therefore represents a state of fullness of enlightenment. 

46

The light of heaven presents to the heart and mind of the church the greatest 
intelligence and wisdom. (AC 5672)

"And Ekron shall be uprooted…"



"‘Beelzebul,’ who was the god of Ekron, means the god of all falsities, for 
Beelzebul by derivation means god of flies, and ‘flies’ signify the falsities of 
the sensual man, thus falsities of every kind." (AE 740 [10])

 A "root" signifies the proprium as the source of infernal falsity. (AR 410) A 

root signifies that charity cannot bear fruit. (AC 382 [3]) In Doctrine of Life 93,
we read that as the proprium "constitutes the first root of [our] life, it is 
evident what kind of a tree a man would be unless this root were plucked up, 
and a new root planted in its place…"

"Woe to the inhabitants of the seacoast…"





"Woe" signifies an admonition of disaster and warns of the danger of eternal 
damnation. (AC 3755)
Inhabitants in the good sense represent all goods and those who are in 
charity. (AC 795 [4]) In the contrary sense, inhabitants represent evils goods 
and a lack of charity to the Lord and neighbor. Therefore, we can sense why 
the Lord spoke words of woe to the inhabitants.

 The "sea" represents a collection of spiritual and natural knowledges in the 
memory. (AC 28 and 991) "Coast" signifies the extension of the church from 
the knowing faculty to the intuitive and thinking faculties. (AC 569 [12])

"…the nation of the Cherethitest!"

 We need to identify the Cherethites. Cherethites have an interesting 

background. They constituted a section of David’s personal army when he 
defeated the Philistines and were part of his retinue after he was established 
in Jerusalem. (II Samuel 8:18) Their loyalty to David may be seen when they 
joined him in the fight against Absalom and his mutinous army. (II Samuel 
20:7)

 The Cherethitest lineage also has family roots that cross lines with the 



Philistines. Is it the Philistine connection that is being condemned here? Or is 
the condemnation due to a spoiling of their loyalty and support of Israel’s 
Lord?
Since we do not have direct teachings regarding the nation of Cherethitest, 
we might do well to focus on the Philistine representations. Philistines 
represent those who are in faith separated from charity. The Philistines also 
represent those who hold false ideas and reason about spiritual things from 
their false ideas. (AC 727)

47

"The word of the Lord is against you, O Canaan, land of the Philistines: I will destroy 
you; so there shall be no inhabitant."

 When the Word speaks of the Lord being against anyone, it means something 
other than what we would mean if we used these words. For the Lord, it 
means bringing things back into order. It means bringing hell to the point of 
being yoked or controlled. Divine power is offered in place of self-interests. 
(AC 8625)

 Canaan has many representations. Let’s look at some of them. In the negative 
sense, it represents a church or an individual who is worshiping externally 
without internals. In a positive sense, Canaan represents the Lord’s kingdom, 
the church, the man or woman of the church, the celestial of the church, or its 
good. (AC 5757)

 Can we use derived doctrine here? Would it make sense to see this as an 

announcement from the Lord that He planned to reorder the worship of the 
church? Can we imagine a movement from a lifeless external worship to a 
spiritual excitement for internal worship?

 The destruction announced by the Lord is a cleansing process. It "means not 
to be afraid because of the damnation which comes upon those who are in 
knowledges and pervert them." In other words, it signifies the removal of 
perverted memory-knowledges. (AC 1458 [3])
"Inhabitants" represent goods and truths. (AE 741 [6]) To announce that no 
inhabitants would be left represents the removal of all evils and falsities that 
had been called goods and truths. See AC 417 [10] for the meaning of 
"unpeopled."



"The seacoast shall be pastures, with shelters for shepherds and folds for flocks."


"Pastures" signify knowledges that contain the goods of truth.
 Pastures also signify what sustains the spiritual life. (AC 6078)
 Pastures signify the Word from which spiritual nourishment is derived. (AE 

644)

 To find pastures signifies to be taught, enlightened, and nourished by divine 

truths. (AR 914)

 A "shelter," or shade, signifies a defense against evil and falsity. (AE 298 [5])
 A shelter in the negative sense represents an obscure general perception of 
good and truth, especially with one who is in external worship. (AC 2367)
"Shepherds" signify those who lead to the good of life. (AC 6052)
Shepherds signify one who does the goods of charity or who leads and 
teaches. Shepherds signify the Lord. (AE 375 [34])
"Gold" signifies good from the celestial things of love, in which innocence may
rest. (AC 415)






 A "flock" signifies those who are led and taught. (AC 343)
 A flock signifies the church of those who are in the truth of simple good. (AC 

6828)

Putting It All Together

P&P sums up this section from the Word with this doctrinal statement: "…the evil 
will then perish on account of evils and falsities of many kinds."

What evils and sins of every kind were the Philistines guilty of?

 They made memory-knowledges the core of their faith.
 They believed salvation to consist in knowledges alone.
 This attitude took the Lord and charity out of genuine worship.
 They were rebellious and quarrelsome within their hearts toward the good 

and truth of the Lord.

 Ashdod proudly and defiantly hosted the god Dagon within its temple. 
Dagon’s image was a mixture, half man and half fish. Dagon signifies a 
religious faith that separates truth from charity. (Divine Providence [DP] 326 
[12])

After looking over the summary of "evils and sins of every kind," do we find anything
listed above that makes us cringe with horror and disgust? If nothing affected our 
sense of injustice, why is that so? Does it mean we have fallen victim to 
misconceptions about true faith? Some describe this state as being "numbed out." Is 
this a good description of the process of losing a vital faith?

As I read it, the Philistines placed too much emphasis on mere confession of faith. 
They chose to have a faith of the lips and not of the heart. In many ways, they were 
dangerous spiritual hypocrites. They represented a religion that valued the "faith 
alone" choice. Such a choice spurned real spirituality. They were not interested in 
finding the spiritual sense of the Word to see the error of their ways or to get a 
better understanding of their spiritual needs. Instead, they looked for ways to excuse
or justify their actions. The Philistines molded a mixture of man and fish ideas to 
pollute and adulterate truths they had had from the days of the Ancient Church. In 
other words, they were intent on destroying the "Divine Human Representative" 
understanding they had of the Lord.

Are we now moving toward a clearer understanding of what the Lord is condemning
within the Philistine church? Can we picture the light of the Lord going out? Instead 
of striving to keep as correct an idea of God as they could, they worked toward 
worshipping an "invisible" lifeless statue of Dagon, an idol fashioned from their 
minds and hands.

Real spiritual growth depends on a progressive, deepening faith from the Word and 
on shunning of evils as sins. A true faith pushes aside spiritual lethargy, negligence, 
and self-love so as to serve the greater good of the Lord and the neighbor.

49

Do we still have these enemies of faith among us? Can we sense that the "faith alone"
ideas thrive in present-day churches? Are there places where you see the 
memorization of creedal statements honored as meriting heaven? Do we still try to 
mold and blend, or bend, the ways of the Lord with time-honored excuses and 
justifications, such as "we are only human"? Are we still a people of lip service and 
not heart service?

Recall the position of the nation of Cherethites. David trusted them and made them a
part of his inner circle of confidants. They rallied to help him overcome the 
rebellious army of Absalom. What happened to those virtues within their nation? 
The Word illustrates the correspondential answer: they turned away and sought to 
fashion their own spiritual ends.

Our story doesn’t end with this bleak picture. Instead, the prophecy announces: 
"The seacoast shall be pastures, with shelters for the shepherds and folds for 
the flocks." The Lord promises that there will be a restoration of knowledge based 
on the goods of His truth. He promises to teach, enlighten, and nourish the flock. He 
will bring shepherds who will lead them to the good of life. In the highest sense, the 
Lord is promising that He will be the Shepherd of Innocence Who will bring peace 
and rest to His people.

Questions To Stimulate Reflection

The following questions are drawn from the "Putting It All Together" section.

1. How does this part of Zephaniah and its meanings give us a sense of the 

depth, or seriousness of the spiritual disorder of the Philistines?

2.

If nothing appeared serious enough, for you, to warrant total desolation of 
the Philistines, where do you think we might be missing the point? Have we 
become somewhat numbed to the seriousness of disorders? Certainly with 
what we see daily in the media, nothing seems to surprise us anymore. We 
see and hear all kinds of brutality on a nightly basis. Are we somewhat jaded?
Have we thrown in the towel on restoring spiritual values in our world? Are 
there ways to counteract this numbness?

3. Did the point about the Philistines being part of the Ancient Church register 

and strike you as something we ought to remember? At one time, they were a 
church that saw the Divine Human in all of the representative forms around 

50

them. They let their spiritual gift slip away with a mixture of rationalizations 
and memory-knowledges. Can we find ways to keep lip-service worship from 
replacing a heart-inspired worship service?

4. Real spiritual growth comes about when we participate in a deeper study of 
the Word. It comes when we look within ourselves honestly to remove those 
areas of evil and sin that cause a blockage between the Lord and ourselves. 
How might a study, like this one, help us develop a more disciplined way to 
read the Word? What are the fruits of such reading?

5. What were your reflections about the inadequacy of "faith alone" and 
memorization of facts for achieving salvation? Real faith is an internal 
acknowledgment of truth—the Lord’s truth. If you believed in the 
confessional booth and the granting of absolution, would that take away a 
sense of your individual need to shun evils as sins?

6. What modern application can we make of what we learned about the 

representative nation of the Cherethites?

7. Did the positive closing prophecy about pastures, shelters, shepherds, and 
flocks help lift the cloud of doom and eminent destruction? What do these 
images bring to mind?

8. What other questions would you add to this study?

ZEPHANIAH 2:7

"The coast shall be for the remnant of the house of Judah; they shall feed their flocks

will intervene for them, and return their captives."

the new…That ‘evening’ denotes the last state of the church, when there is 
dense falsity because there is no faith, and dense evil because there is no 
charity…"

Derived Doctrine

"The coast shall be for the remnant of the house of Judah…"





"The coast" signifies the extension of the church from one limit to the other, 
that is, from the knowing faculty to the intuitive and thinking faculties." (AC 
569 [12], emphasis added) To grasp the significance of this citation, we must 
picture the Lord coming to the church to make a judgment. The Lord’s 
visitation is for the purpose of building up the new church. All of the faulty 
thoughts and affections must be vastated. Therefore, He opens the aspects of 
the church concerned with knowing; He visits the intuitive and thinking 
faculties. He examines the real thinking and affections of the church to rid it 
of lip service and pretense. Nothing can be hidden if spiritual integrity is to 
be restored. What is in the heart will be shouted from the rooftops.
"…shall be for the remnant of the house of Judah…" When a church is 
vastated, a remnant always remains and is continued under the guidance of 
the Lord. (AC 407) A remnant signifies those who have joined some goods of 
charity to faith. (AR517)

 The house of Judah signifies the celestial church. (AE 710) What are the 
qualities of the celestial church in comparison to those of the spiritual 
church? "The truth of good is of the celestial church, and the good of truth is 
of the spiritual church. With those who were of the celestial church, good was
implanted in the will part, which is the proper seat of good, and from this 
good, that is, through this good from the Lord, they had a perception of 
truth…But with those who are of the spiritual church, good is implanted in 
the intellectual part by means of truth…" (AC 5733)

52

"They shall feed their flocks there; in the houses of Ashkelon they shall lie down at 
evening."

 To feed signifies to make provision for the increase of the new church. (AR 

547)

 To feed signifies to teach. (AR 383)
 To feed signifies to imbibe good and truth in a state of temptations. (AC 8527)
 A flock signifies those who are to be led and taught. (AC 343)
 A flock signifies the church and those who are in the truth of simple good. (AC

6828)

 Houses represent the natural mind. The rational mind and the natural mind 

are like a house. (AC 4982)

 Houses signify the church. (AC 3720)
 Houses signify the will principle. (AC 706)
 Houses signify scientifics that are collected together to raise and build up the 

external human, which is not unlike the building of a house. (AC 1488)

 We have no representation given for the city of Ashkelon. The Philistines had 
five major cities: Ashkelon was one of them. Ashkelon was the only one 
among the five powerful cities to be on the seacoast.

 To understand the meaning of lying down at evening in the houses of 

Ashkelon, let us consider first the representation of "down." AC 1311 teaches 
that to come down signifies judgment. Can we take this to mean that the 
houses, the natural-rational mind, were about to be brought "down" to 
judgment? Does the evening represent the judgment of the last state of the 
church and the mind prior to the "new day" of the Lord’s advent? Consider 
this possible meaning in light of the passage below.

"For the Lord their God will intervene, and return their captives."

 To "intervene" means to come between; to mediate, arbitrate, intercede, or 
interrupt. Recall the wonderful teachings regarding the importance of the 
"remnant." Whenever a church undergoes vastations, AC 407 teaches, the 
Lord sees to it that "…there always remains some nucleus of a church" so that 
a new light may shine forth to lead the captive back to a state of freedom.
 The Lord "interrupts" evil. His light comes between us and our states of 
disorder, and cleans or removes the murky and nefarious works of hell.

 AC 10500 teaches that expiation for our sins "signifies a possibility by virtue

of the Divine power of the Lord [to be] with those who have so 
completely turned themselves away…that their worship be…accepted 
and heard." (Emphasis added.)

 The Lord will intervene. He will provide a way out of spiritual captivity. He 
will free us from our cruel enslavement of mind, heart, and soul. His church 
will renew its work to feed and care for the souls of His flock.

53

Putting It All Together

Restoration, healing, rebuilding—this work is not always attractive. There is the 
knocking down and removal of what is worn out, the scarred walls, and weak 
foundations. With the dust of the rubble clouding our vision and the scattered 
remnants of steel and cement all over the former foundation, it is hard to picture 
what the new building is going to look like. The architect and the builder may assure 
us that the new building is going to please us and more adequately fit our growing 
needs. We look at their plans and drawings, and hope for the day when it will be 
completed so we can move in and enjoy the new usefulness of the building.

Surgery is not pretty, either. A hip replacement means cutting tissue and muscles 
and removing the damaged parts. There will be blood and weeks of soreness. The 
doctors promise that all of their work and a rehab regimen will bring relief and more
mobility. We hope, we fear, we trust that it will happen as they promise.

Zephaniah’s message is direct. What the church had been building was going to 
collapse in the day of the Lord’s judgment. The doctrines of the church were faulty, 
based on false logic so precariously unbalanced that it was in eminent danger of 
collapsing. The worship going on within the church was superficial and nearly 
empty of holiness. The flock was not being fed. Souls were not receiving care. People 
were going through the motions of praise, but their hearts were not feeling any 
excitement. Genuine ends were not evident, and much spiritual ignorance was 
enslaving the Lord’s flock.

The Lord, as the Divine Architect and Divine Physician, counseled His people that 
falsity would fall and that it would be cut out of the diseased body of the church. A 
day of judgment was at hand. Those who loved their man-made truths were going to 
be separated from the church. They would be cut off not because of Divine anger, but
because of their unwillingness to let the Lord lead them in the way of truth. They, the
self-promoters, would no longer dictate what was essential to the church.

Zephaniah 2:7 reports that "some are to be saved." Who will be saved? Why only 
some? Why not everyone? The concept of the "remnant" comes out in this prophecy. 
The nucleus of a church will remain. The Lord’s intervention begins with a few. 
Again, we ask, why with a few? Real spiritual growth comes with a degree of 
slowness. It is a faith that has a line-upon-line and precept-upon-precept mission 
statement. Growth in the Lord’s church is founded on good and truth, not on popular
opinions. Can you accept this plan of the Lord’s? AC 10500 encourages us to see that 
the Lord’s Divine power can restore the integrity of the church so that worship can 
be heard and accepted.

Questions To Stimulate Reflection

1. As you look at the state of the church (for now, let’s use the church universal 
as our model), what is your view of its soundness? What is the basis for your 
opinion?

2. Can you see any signs of the nucleus (remnant) working? Is the New Church 

part of the nucleus? Are the Writings a nucleus?

3. When we research and judge civil, moral, and spiritual issues, how much are 

we influenced by popular concepts and how much by the Word?

4. For example, consider the issue of same-sex marriages. Whatever your 

opinion on this issue, how do you search "objectively" for answers? Will the 
courts and individual states decide for us? Do we put our heads in the sand 
and make no stand, hoping that it will eventually sort itself out?

5. What makes for a living and active church? Is a successful church one that 
fosters activities for all ages? Is a successful church one that provides 
preaching (worship), teaching, and doctrinal instruction for all ages? How do 
we avoid going through the motions of empty worship?

6. "A few will be saved." How did your heart and mind react to those words? Did 
you wish for a larger promise? If the Word had said "many" will be saved, 
how would that have changed how you felt about the prophecy?

7. We have so much more to learn about the ways of the Lord. We tend to try to 
get ahead of the Lord. We want faster results, faster growth. Impatience is a 
factor. What will it take for us to follow the Lord’s pace in growing the New 
Church?

8. Continuing the thought from question 7, how do we follow the pace of the 

Lord and avoid being complacent about our need to spread the good news of 
the Second Coming?

ZEPHANIAH 2:8-10

"I have heard the reproach of Moab, and the insults of the people of Ammon, with 
which they have reproached My people, and made arrogant threats against their 

55

borders. Therefore, as I live, says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, surely Moab shall 
be like Sodom, and the people of Ammon like Gomorrah—overrun with weeds and 
saltpits, and a perpetual desolation. The residue of My people shall plunder them, and 
the remnant of My people shall possess them. This they shall have for their pride, 
because they have reproached and made arrogant threats against the people of the 
Lord of hosts."

Passages From The Writings



"Those who have adulterated the Word will utterly perish"

AC 2468 [13]



"In Zephaniah… (2:8-10)…To ‘reproach the people,’ and to ‘enlarge against 
their boundary, and against the people of Jehovah Zebaoth,’ is to hold as vile 
and to reject interior truths, which are the ‘people of Jehovah Zebaoth.’ The 
consequence of this is that goods become evils of falsity, which are ‘Sodom’ 
and a ‘place abandoned to the nettle;’ and truths become falsities, which are

endowed with the good of charity are ‘nations,’ and those who are endowed 
with the truths of faith are ‘peoples;’ for goods and truths are predicated

subject is vastation is manifest, for it is said an ‘eternal desolation.’"

AC 9207 [7]

‘salt’ signifies the destruction and vastation of truth (Zeph. 2:9…)."

AC 10300 [6]



"In Zephaniah…2:9…‘a place left to the nettle’ denotes the ardor and burning 
of the life of man from the love of self; a ‘pit of salt’ denotes a longing for what
is false, which, as it destroys truth and good, is called ‘a waste forever.’ It is 
said that it shall be ‘as Gomorrah,’ because by ‘Gomorrah and Sodom’ is 
signified the love of self (AC 2220)."

good and truth it is said, ‘a place abandoned to nettles, and a pit of salt, a

‘Gomorrah’ the derivative falsity, of both of which ‘desolation’ is here 
predicated, as previously was ‘overthrown.’ ‘Pride’ is the love of self; to 
‘reproach the people of Jehovah Zebaoth,’ is to bring evil upon truths; and to 
‘enlarge upon the people,’ is to bring falsity upon them."

keep this in mind and remember it when you come into the world of spirits, 
as is done after death, and you will be fully convinced."

Derived Doctrine

"I have heard the reproach of Moab..."

 The word "reproach" denotes shame and disgrace; it means to discredit, to 
dishonor, and to blame. When Rachel conceived and bore Joseph, she cried 
out that "God hath gathered my reproach." She meant that God had ended her
barrenness. In the context of Zephaniah 2:8, Moab’s reproach, or shameful 
act, was adulteration of good, and it would be removed so that the church’s 
barren state might be ended. Moab signifies the state of people in natural 
good who allow themselves to easily be led astray. (AC 3242 [3])

"…and the insults of the people of Ammon…"

"Ammon" signifies those who falsify truths and live evil lives. (AC 6405 [4])


 The insults of Ammon conveyed contempt, abuse, a maligning derision.
 The Lord heard these things. He heard their arrogant threats against Him and
His people. Read DLW 50 regarding the seriousness of such derision against 
the Divine Human.
In one sense, we get a glimpse of how little their contempt for the Lord 
accomplished. Their arrogant threats came against the "borders." Borders 
signify the lowest parts of the church. This was an attack against fixed 
boundaries that are set up around what is good so that it cannot be 
approached and injured by evils from hell. (AC 9492)



Putting It All Together

"Those who have adulterated the Word will utterly perish." (P&P)

Those who want to discredit, mock, speak arrogantly about, and shame the Word of 
the Lord will not get away with their insults. In case they think they can approach 
and harm spiritual things, the Lord reminds every listener that people with evil 
intentions can only come to the edge or border of internal spiritual things. Guards 
prevent them from spoiling all that is holy. They can attack the externals of memory-
knowledges but not the living substance of Love and Wisdom.

Accountability is front and center in these two verses. Moab is linked to Sodom. 
Ammon is linked to Gomorrah. Just as fire and brimstone fell on Sodom and 
Gomorrah, so will it fall on Moab and Ammon. To illustrate their end, the Lord likens 
them to overgrown weeds and salt pits. Theirs is to be a life of perpetual desolation.

Does this sound ominous? It depends on which side of the issue one stands on. If a 
"people" and a "nation" stand with the Lord, it is welcoming and comforting news. If 
one stands with Moab and Ammon against the "people" and "nation" of the Lord, it 
has to be distressing news.

59

There are contrasts throughout these two verses. The repetition has a purpose. The 
contrasts enable us to see both sides and choose which side we want. Think of 
Joshua’s words: "As for me and my house, we will serve the Lord." This is a call for 
dedication against those who would mock and speak arrogantly against the Lord’s 
truth.

Questions To Stimulate Reflection

1. How many lessons about salt can you recall from the Word?

2. How many good uses of salt can you recall?

3.

Is salt always a good thing? Isn’t it a poison, too?

4. Please notice that weeds and their correspondence are also mentioned 

frequently in the Word. Look for some examples.

5. This question might be more than you care to take up at this time. There has 
been a long-time discussion in the church about the eternity of the hells. 
Some would like to believe that the Lord will only allow people in hell to be 
there until they come to their senses, whereupon He will lift them into 
heaven. Others believe that hell is to eternity. What are the foundations of 
each opinion? Do the words of our verse "a perpetual desolation" answer this
debate?

6. How does the teaching about the "border" strengthen our faith and offer 

encouragement?

ZEPHANIAH 2:11

"The Lord will be awesome to them, for He will reduce to nothing all the gods of the 
earth; people shall worship Him, each one from his place, indeed all the shores of the 
nations."

Passages From The Writings

P&P



"They will perish that whoever is able may acknowledge the Lord."

AC 1158 [4]



"In Zephaniah…2:11…‘The isles of the nations’ denote nations more remote 
from the knowledges of faith."

60

AR 34



"That by ‘islands’ in the Word are signified the nations which are more 
remote from the worship of God, but which yet will draw near to it, is evident 
from these passages…" Zephaniah 2:11 is cited.

AE 50 [2]



"That ‘islands’ signify nations that are about to accede to the true worship of 
God, is evident from the following passages…" Zephaniah 2:11 is cited.

AE 406 [15]



"In Zephaniah…2:11&12…signifies that the falsities of evil will be dispersed, 
and truths and goods given to those who are in falsities indeed, but not in the 
falsities of evil; ‘the gods of the nations that He will make lean’ signify the 
falsities of evil, ‘gods’ signifying falsities, ‘nations’ evils, and ‘to make lean’ to 
remove evils from falsities…"

Derived Doctrine

"The Lord will be awesome to them…"

 Awesome is translated differently in the various translations of the Word. The
Writings use the word "terrible." The Authorized Version (King James) uses 
"dreadful." The New English Bible uses the word "fearsome."

 These words are all related to fear. Fear, holy fear, is a holy state. (AC 3719)
 The word "terrible" signifies the omnipotence and omniscience of the Lord.

(AE 298 [7])

 AC 8816 explains that those who do good indeed tremble at the presence of 

the Lord, but it is a holy tremor that precedes reception.

"He will reduce [thin] to nothing all the gods of the earth…"

 Thinning or reducing the gods of the earth signifies exposing the empty 

charity in that which was believed to have been fat, or full of charity, in its 
externals.(AC 5204)

"People shall worship Him, each one from his place, indeed all the shores of the 
nations."

 From this verse, we can derive the point that everyone’s state will provide 

some means, some extension, by which he or she can worship the Lord. P&P 
puts it this way for us: "that whoever is able may acknowledge the Lord."

61

Putting It All Together

Seeing the "awesome," "terrible," "fearsome" God is a good thing. Holy fear inspires 
and paves the way for the reception of what is holy. The awesome God will cause the 
gods of pretense to wither away to nothing. They cannot stand His presence. They 
will disintegrate because their fatness, or substance, was external; it was not based 
on eternal values. Their form had nothing of spiritual substance. Please note the 
wonderful transition in P&P. They will perish – that whoever is able – may 
acknowledge the Lord.

Our spiritual life is richer if we acknowledge the awesome God. If we carry with us a 
holy fear, we will tremble. I picture the trembling as one of excitement. We see the 
preparation accomplished by holy fear. It is the preparation to receive greater things 
then we can imagine.

The false gods are reduced to nothing.

Questions To Stimulate Reflection

1. Would you agree that God is awesome? Before you assume that the answer is 

obvious, think about how many people tend to make God small in their 
attitudes. Hell, they say, is stronger than heaven. God can't do this or that. We 
need to review our belief system and put the Lord back in the "awesome" 
category. It scares hell when we think like this. How can we, as a church, put 
the Lord back where He belongs in our lives?

2. Can you see or feel false gods waning in His presence? How?

3. Can you think of any moments when holy fear made an important difference 

in your life?

4. Some fundamentalist Christians believe there is only one way available to 
reach heaven. How does our lesson soften and enlarge that narrow view?

5. The voice of Zephaniah 2:11 declares that "each one from his place, indeed all 

the shores of the nations" shall worship Him. Doesn't this sound like an 
inclusive God of all people? What are the implications of that type of 
inclusiveness?

ZEPHANIAH 2:12-15

"You Ethiopians also, you shall be slain by My sword." And He will stretch out His hand 
against the north, destroy Assyria, and make Nineveh a desolation, as dry as the 
wilderness. The herds shall lie down in her midst, every beast of the nation. Both the 
pelican and the bittern shall lodge on the capitals of her pillars; their voice shall sing 

62

in the windows; desolation shall be at the threshold; for He will lay bare the cedar 
work. This is the rejoicing city that dwelt securely, that said in her heart, ‘I am it, and 
there is none besides me.’ How has she become a desolation, a place for beasts to lie 
down! Everyone who passes by her shall hiss and shake his fist."

and the bittern in the pomegranates,’ and is described by ‘a voice singing in 
the windows,’ and by ‘laying bare the cedar,’ which is intellectual truth. All 
these expressions are significative of such falsity."

appear from these passages…" Zephaniah 2:13-15 is cited.

AE 388 [11]



"In Zephaniah…2:13-15…This treats of self intelligence, which confirms 
falsities and evils by reasonings from knowledges (scientifica), and by 
applying to them things from the sense of the letter of the Word. ‘The north’ 
signifies the natural and sensual man, and the knowing [faculty] 
(scientificum) that belongs to it; and ‘Assyria’ signifies reasoning therefrom; 
and ‘saying in her heart, I, and none other beside me,’ signifies self-
intelligence. This makes clear what is involved in these particulars, in series, 
namely, ‘Jehovah will stretch out His hand over the north, and will destroy 
Assyria,’ signifies that He will deprive such a natural man, and its power to 
understand and reason thence, of all perception of good and understanding 
of truth; ‘the droves shall lie down in the midst of her, every wild beast of the 
nation; both the pelican, and the bittern, shall lodge in the chapiters thereof,’ 
signifies that there shall be falsities of evil, and falsities of thought and 
perception in the knowledges from the Word everywhere therein, ‘the wild 
beast of the nation’ meaning the falsity of evil, ‘pelican and bittern’ the falsity 
of thought and perception, and ‘chapiters’ the knowledges from her heart, ‘I, 
and none other besides me,’ signifies that such intelligence trusts in itself and
draws only from self (ex proprio), ‘city’ signifying doctrine from such 
intelligence; ‘how is she become a waste, a place for the wild beast to lie 
down in.’ signifies that it has nothing of truth in it but is full of falses."

64

AE 650 [56]



"In Zephaniah…2:13-15…This describes the vastations of the church by the 
falsities of doctrine which are from self-intelligence. The ‘north over which 
Jehovah will stretch out His hand’ signifies the church that is in falsities; 
‘Assyria which Jehovah will destroy’ signifies the reasonings from falsities; 
‘Nineveh which He shall make a waste, a dry place like the wilderness’ 
signifies the falsities of doctrine; ‘droves,’ ‘the wild beast of the nation,’ the 
‘pelican,’ and the ‘bittern,’ signify the affections of falsities, and falsities 
themselves interior and exterior."

AC 655



"In Zephaniah…2:14…This is said of Asshur and Nineveh; ‘Asshur’ denotes 
the understanding, here vastated; a ‘voice singing in the windows,’ reasonings
from phantasies."



"That ‘wild animal’ in the opposite sense is taken in the Word for what is not 
living, is evident from many passages, of which only the following will be

Derived Doctrine

Is there a need for derived doctrine for this section? We have some excellent 
passages that cover almost everything in these verses, but there are a few things we 
need to add to increase the depth of our understanding. We need some positive 
correspondences to contrast with the dark and foreboding opposite sense.

"…in the windows…"

 AE 675 [19] teaches that the windows of heaven signify the Divine inflowing, 

from which come intelligence and eternal life.

 AE 282 [5] teaches that "windows" signify a thorough investigation of truth.

"…lodging on the capitals of her pillars…"

 AC 3115 teaches that "lodging" (spending the night) in the positive sense 
signifies a state of abiding—as in having a state of or affection for truth.
 AE 219 [5] teaches that "capitals" (chapiters) signify superior knowledge that

helps support heavenly truths.

 AC 9674 teaches that "pillars" signify what supports heaven and the church, 

namely the goods of love and of faith from the Lord.
