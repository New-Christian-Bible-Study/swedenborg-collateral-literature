List of the Memorable Occurrences described in Swedenborg's Writings
Compiled by W.C. Henderson

Compiler's Notes (with revisions): The table, which is believed to be complete, has been constructed to show graphically the works in which Memorable Occurrences 
are inserted; which ones are repeated, and where; and in what chronological order. The numbers in the columns are the paragraph numbers used in Swedendborg's 
works. The eight works in which Memorable Occurrences are found are listed chronologically from left to right of the page. It should be noted that the Memorabilia are 
seldom contemporaneous with the works in which they appear.

Data were revised and retyped by Daniel Fitzpatrick in 1984. They were converted to Excel format by Freya Fitzpatrick in 2013, and reformatted and revised slightly by 
New Christian Bible Study editors in 2014.
