Introduction  
The New Church has a vocabulary that is entirely its own. Every subject field has its peculiar 
terminology; and as the Writings were given to convey new truth, ideas never before unfolded to the 
human mind, and as the communication of ideas requires appropriate language, the Writings contain 
many distinctive terms. These terms were selected by the Lord with the precision of wisdom. Each one 
has a very exact meaning, or group of related meanings, and was chosen by the Lord because it, and no 
other, expressed adequately the idea or ideas to be transmitted.  

     Evidently, then, it is of great importance that we should understand correctly what is meant by these 
terms they are employed in the Writings, and that we should be able to use them accurately in our own 
thinking, speaking and writing. Some are theological terms which occur frequently, here a facile 
familiarity may blind us to their profundity few are peculiar to the Writings, and therefore presuppose a 
considerable amount of specialized knowledge. Others, and these may present difficulties, are terms 
which have a different meaning in the Writings from that assigned to them by current usage.  

     In this issue we begin an occasional department, under the same title as this editorial, which will offer 
general definitions of some of the terms that make up our New Church vocabulary. That department will 
not be rightly understood or properly used, however, if the definitions presented are regarded as all-
inclusive and exhaustive, or if it is supposed that no others could be valid. It will fail in its purpose unless 
it is clearly realized that definitions are not meant to confine man's thinking to themselves, but to 
provide it with a well marked point of departure, in order that the initial idea may be gradually infilled. 

6 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Affection 

This term is defined in two ways. Philosophically, affection is said to be a change of the state of 
the  organic  substances  of  the  mind  -  an  idea  fundamental  to  the  concept  of  affection  and 
thought as substantial. Doctrinally it is defined as "what is continuous of love." What that means 
is simply this. Man does not perceive his love itself because it is present in all that he wills and 
thinks,  does  and  says;  but  in  every  state,  and  in  every  situation  he  meets,  he  is  continually 
moved by evil and falsity, or by good and truth. He is constantly acted upon by one or other of 
these; and his own evil and falsity, or good and truth, become reactive as a result. That is why 
the  Writings  speak  of  the  affection  of  truth,  not  the  affection  for  truth.  "Affections,"  on  the 
other  hand,  are  derivations  from  man's  love.  The  outermost  affections,  which  belong  to  the 
body, are called appetites and pleasures; those  which are more  interior belong to the animus 
and are called natural affections; while those which are internal are of the rational mind and are 
called spiritual affections. (See DLW 209, 291; DP 279. AC 3938. AR 875; AC 3849.) 

Afflux. 

This is a rare term, but one which marks an important distinction. Good and truth cannot flow 
into  those  who  are  in  a  state  of  hell,  but  they  do  flow  to  them  and  thus  govern  them  from 
without. This flowing to, but not into, is what is meant in the Writings by afflux; and the term is 
used  to  distinguish  clearly  between  this  operation  of  good  and  truth  and  that  other  whereby 
they  flow  into  the  mind,  which  is  called  "influx."  The  term  is  therefore  used  to  describe  the 
mode by which the Lord governs the hells; and, under the same general principle, of the flow of 
evil to the minds of those who are interiorly good but are undergoing vastation. There is another 
usage which also comes under the same general principle: that which reaches the mind from the 
natural world is said to do so by an afflux, as distinct from what comes from the spiritual world, 
which inflows.  

     A related term, and one which may therefore be noted here, is efflux, which means "to flow 
out." It is used in two ways. Good and truth from the Lord enter by influx through the internal 
man, and should then flow out through the external man into the world in the form of the uses 
of  charity.  This  flowing  out  is  what  is  meant  by  efflux,  and  the  universal  law  is  that  influx  is 
always according to efflux. The term is used in one passage  of what emanates from the hells. 
(See AC 7955; HH 543; AC 7990. AC 3646. AC 5828; LJ post. 300.) 

Appearance.  

This is a term which has in the Writings a meaning different from that which is generally given to 
it.  In  common  speech,  appearance  is  frequently  used  to  describe  an  illusion,  or  that  which  is 
other than the reality, but the Writings employ two different usages.  

     1) The Divine as it is in itself cannot be comprehended by any finite mind. Pure truth never 
exists with angel or man. Therefore Divine truth is presented in the Word, not as it is in itself, 
but as it seems to angels and men to be from their different but finite viewpoints; in the case of 

7 

 
man,  according  to  his  state  and  even  to  the  fallacies  of  the  senses,  and  thus  in  forms  from  a 
sensuous  and  human  origin  which  induce  the  idea  that  Divine  things  are  the  same  as  human 
ones.  These  accommodated  presentations  of  Divine  truth  are  what  are  called  "appearances"; 
and they are so called, not because they are illusions, but because they cause genuine truths to 
appear. In other words, they are appearings of the truth.  

     2)  In  the  other  world  spirits  sometimes  seem  to  change  their  situation  and  to  traverse 
distances when they do not. These seeming changes are  called appearances because they are 
not real.  

     Related terms are "real appearances" and "appearances not real." The phenomena of heaven 
are real appearances because they actually exist, correspond to the states of the angels, and are 
as constant as those states are; are, in fact, appearings of the real. But the phenomena of hell 
are  "appearances  not  real"  because  they  are  seen  to  be  entirely  different  when  the  light  of 
heaven enters. (See AC 3207, 1376, 4623.)  

Appropriate.  

To appropriate is to make one's own from freedom according to reason. The relation of the term 
to eating and drinking gives us the essential idea. By these processes man, from appetite, takes 
in,  prepares,  absorbs,  assimilates,  and  builds  into  the  structure  of  his  body  the  nutritious 
elements in what he swallows. Spiritually, he appropriates whatever he absorbs from love and 
builds into the structure of his mind and life. Thus whatever he wills, thinks, does and says from 
love he appropriates, both good and evil, and those things are said to be appropriated by him. 
However, that only which is appropriated in freedom remains. (See BE 69; DP 138.) 

As of Self.  

This is one of the most distinctive terms in our New Church vocabulary. It refers to a faculty of 
willing and acting, not  implanted in man but  continually adjoined with him, which is Divine in 
origin, inspiration and power, but  human in use. The exercise  of this faculty consists in acting 
entirely as of one's self, but acknowledging that any good and truth resulting are from the Lord. 
The faculty is given in order that man may not be an automaton, but many have freedom and 
thus  love  God;  and  the  disclosure  of  its  existence  shows  how  man  can  be  responsible  for  his 
regeneration although he cannot do any good of himself. (See BE 69.)  

Bonds.  

By these are meant man's affections; not because they are fetters, but because they bind man 
to what he loves and restrain him from what is contrary, thus keeping him within their bounds. 
There  are  said  in  the  Writings  to  be  three  kinds  of  bonds.  External  bonds  are  those  of  civil 
society - fear of the law and of the loss of reputation, possessions and life; exterior bonds are 
those  which  come  from  knowing  the  truths of  faith;  internal  bonds,  which  are  called  also  the 

8 

 
"bonds of conscience," are affections of good and its truth. The celestial alone have no bonds; 
they enjoy living perceptions. (See AC 3835, 81.) 

Celestial. 

In its broadest usage, this term embraces all heavenly things as distinct from earthly ones. In all 
other instances it has reference to love and good as distinct from truth and faith. Thus it refers, 
according to context, to love to the Lord; to the third heaven, which receives that love; to the 
highest  degree  of  the  human  mind,  which  receives  the  activity  of  the  third  heaven;  to  that 
kingdom of heaven which is in love; and to the men of the first church, established before the 
fall, who were regenerated by the implantation of good in the will. There are many compound 
forms. (See AC 4286, 1096; DP 32; AC 8945, 3240, 5733.)  

Charity.  

This is one of the most important and distinctive terms used in the Writings. In the world today, 
charity  is  thought  of  almost  entirely  in  terms  of  private  or  organized  relief  of  material  want. 
According  to  the  Writings,  however,  charity  is  not  an  action  at  all  -  although  it  has  no  reality 
unless it is ultimated in deeds. Charity is to will well, and to do good works is to do well from 
willing well. In itself, charity is an internal affection which consists in a man's desiring from the 
heart,  as  the  delight  of  his  life,  to  do  good  to  the  neighbor,  and  this  without  thought  of 
recompense;  and  its  essence  is  to  will  well  to  the  neighbor,  to  be  affected  with  good,  and  to 
acknowledge good as the neighbor. The life of charity is to act sincerely, justly and faithfully in 
one's office. (See TCR 374; F 13; AC 8033; HD 101.) 

Chastity.  

This term is included as one which has in the Writings a meaning different from that assigned to 
it  in  common  usage.  In  that  usage,  chastity  means  continence,  virginity,  or  celibacy,  and  is 
therefore  a  quality  that  is  lost  by  marriage.  This  definition  is  unacceptable,  both  because  it 
implies that the body is depraved and marriage impure and because it refers only to the body, 
whereas the Writings teach that chastity is essentially a state of the spirit. As the terms are used 
in the Writings, chastity and unchastity are predicated of marriages and the things that belong 
to them. Conjugial love is said to be chastity itself, and the term describes the union of one man 
with one wife when both acknowledge the Lord and each confines their love to the other. Such 
a  union  is  chaste  because  inmostly  within  it  there  is  an  aversion  to  adultery.  The  distinction 
between  chastity  and  unchastity  is  therefore  much  deeper  than  one  as  to  bodily  acts.  Before 
marriage, chastity is a proper attitude toward marriage which influences the imagination as well 
as  the  conduct  -  one  which  looks  earnestly  to  a  chaste  and  eternal  union  and  spurns  what  is 
opposed to it. (See CL 139ff, 49e.)  

9 

 
Church.  

As used by itself in the Writings, this term refers to a spiritual organization, the unit of which is 
the individual human mind. The man who has the Word and understands it rightly, 
acknowledges the Divine of the Lord, learns truths out of the Word from Him, and lives a life of 
love and charity according to them, is a particular church; and the spiritual society formed by all 
such men is the church specific - a term not actually found in the Writings, but used with good 
authority. Those who do not have the Word, but worship one God, obey His revealed will as 
they understand it, and live together in simple charity constitute the church universal; and 
these, together with the former, make up the church of the Lord or the universal church of the 
Lord. It is our belief that the church specific is not formed apart from the Writings. (See AC 8152, 
10,761; AE 20; HH 328.) 

Civil.  

This  term  is  used  of  that  part  of  man's  life  which  comes  under  regulation  by  the  laws  of  the 
state, as distinct from moral and spiritual life, which are subject to higher laws. It occurs also in a 
few  compound  forms.  Civil  good  is  the  good  of  life  in  accordance  with  the  laws  of  the  state, 
which makes man a citizen of the world; civil things are those which belong to the state and are 
conjoined with the world - those statutes, laws and regulations which bind men together so that 
a  settled  and  well  organized  society  may  be  formed;  and  civil  truths  are  those  truths  which 
relate to the things of government and of judgment in the state, and in general to justice and 
equity. (See AC 8257; Life 12; CL 130; HH 468.)       

Cognitions.  

Although this term is loosely translated "knowledges," it should be retained; it has a very exact 
meaning  and  it  indicates  an  important  distinction.  Cognitions  are  intermediate  between 
scientifics and truths. In this context,  scientifics are the  facts of the Word in the  Old and New 
Testaments and the Writings. Cognitions are those facts organized into ideas. When those ideas 
are  acknowledged  in  the  understanding  -  when  man  confirms  himself  in  them  and  lives 
according to them - they become truths. Cognitions, then, are all the ideas that we have formed 
from the Word but have not yet appropriated by bringing them into life. (See AC 5276.) 

Collateral Good.  

In ordinary  usage,  "collateral"  refers to something which has descended from the  same  stock, 
but  not  in the  direct line, and is thus connected but in a subordinate way. This idea is carried 
over  into  the  Writings,  in  which  it  is  used  to  describe  a  good  that  is  intermediate  between 
spiritual and natural good. Spiritual good inflows directly from the Lord and is therefore in direct 
line of descent. This intermediate good, although not natural, derives much from worldly things 
which appear to be good but are not, and it is therefore called "collateral good," which may be 
thought of most simply as a natural love of spiritual things. To distinguish it from the spiritual 

10 

 
good in which are those of the church specific, the good in which those of the church universal 
are is called "collateral good of a common stock." (See AC 3778, 4189, 4145.)  

Common Good.  

This term, which occurs frequently in the Writings, means the general good of society - the good 
expressed in such words as commonweal and commonwealth. It consists in the presence of the 
Divine;  in  justice,  morality,  industry,  knowledge  and  uprightness;  the  necessaries  of  life,  for 
occupations, and for protection, and in a sufficiency of wealth. (See Char. 130.) 

Conatus.  

This word means "endeavor" and is often so rendered in English translations of the Writings. In 
every  affection  and  thought,  indeed  in  every  natural  thing,  there  is  something  spiritual  -  a 
constant effort inflowing from the spiritual world to come forth and subsist by ultimating itself 
in forms of use; one which seeks to do so by setting in action the necessary active and reactive 
forces.  This  effort  is  what  is  meant  by  "conatus."  It  is  not  force  or  motion,  but  that  which 
animates force and through it initiates motion; and if it fails, activity and motion cease. In man, 
conatus is the will united with the understanding; living forces are the motor fibers; and motion 
is  action.  The  spiritual  world  is  therefore  the  world  of  conatus  and  the  natural  the  world  of 
motion. (See AC 5173: 2, 3, 8911; DLW 218, 219.)  

Concupiscence.  

Here we have another term which should be retained as marking an important distinction, even 
though  it  may  fall  strangely  on  the  unfamiliar  ear.  Concupiscence  is  voluntary  evil;  yet  not  so 
much  the  evil  of  the  will  itself  as  the  continuous  lust  of  evil,  and  therefore  the  life  that  is 
breathed into it by the loves of self and the world and that sustains it. The various and distinct 
evils  that  make  up  man's ruling  evil  are  called concupiscences;  and  the  derivations of  infernal 
love,  which  are  affections  of  evil  and  falsity,  are  called  concupiscences,  the  term  "affection" 
being reserved properly for good and truth. (See AC 10,283:12; DP 296, 106.) 

Confession.  

This term has two usages-confession of the Lord and confession of sin. In the first of these it can 
mean  simply  a  declaration  of  one's  faith  before  the  Lord,  but  interior  confession  involves 
humiliation and the affection of good. Confession of sins is to know evils, to see them in one s 
self, to acknowledge them, to make one's self guilty, and to condemn one's self on account of 
them-this as contrasted with the idea of a general confession. (See AC 2329, 3880, 8388.) 

11 

 
Conjugial.  

One  of  the  most  important  terms  in  our  New  Church  vocabulary,  "conjugial"  is  to  be 
distinguished carefully from "conjugal." The conjugial is said to be that truth which is capable of 
being conjoined with good, and that good which is capable of being conjoined with truth; and 
conjugial love is described as the affection of good in truth and the affection of truth from good, 
which descends from the marriage of good and truth in heaven. Conjugial love may therefore be 
defined as the love of wisdom in the mind of a husband for good in the mind of his wife, and the 
reciprocal love of this good for that wisdom.  

     Thus it is not a love of the proprium of the other from what is proprial in self, but the love of 
that which is from the Lord in the mind of each for that which is for Him in the other. It is not 
achieved by the  husband and wife  looking to each other, but  by both looking together to the 
Lord; for which reason it is said to go hand in hand with religion, with regeneration, and with the 
interior development of the church in the mind By the marriage of conjugial love is meant the 
union of two in thought and will, in good and truth, in mind and life; which union causes them to 
love to will and think each as the other, and to dwell together in all things of life. (See AC 3942, 
3081, 9961, 10,169.) 

Conjunction.  

Only in the Writings do we find the expression, conjunction with the Lord; and find it used, not 
of a mystical state, but of one that may be understood rationally. A common love, thought and 
purpose  are  what  bring  men  together;  and  by  conjunction  with  the  Lord  is  meant  a  state  in 
which man, from the Lord's love received as good in the will, and His wisdom received as truth 
in the understanding, is engaged finitely in the same uses as the Lord performs infinitely. It is a 
state in which the Lord is in man as the source of the good he wills, the truth he thinks and the 
uses he does, and man is in the Lord because in good and truth which are the Lord and are from 
Him.  

     It  may  be  useful  to  note  the  distinctions  among  the  terms,  union,  conjunction  and 
consociation. Union is used of two things which together make one, and is therefore reserved 
for the relation of the Divine and the Human in the Lord after glorification, and for the conjugial 
marriage  in  which  the  minds  of  husband  and  wife  make  one  mind.  Conjunction  is  used  to 
describe the regenerate man's relation with the Lord, in which man becomes a vessel receptive 
of life, whereas the Lord by union with the Divine became life itself in the Human. Consociation 
describes  the  regenerated  man's  relation  with  the  angels  as  with  brethren.  (See  TCR  725:  AR 
819; AC 2021; AR 818: EU 64.) 

Connate Good.  

The word, connate, means `existing from birth"; and the term, connate good, is therefore used 
in the Writings to describe the natural good that is born with man and which in itself is a mere 
animal good, existing also with beasts and with nations of the worst faith and life. Connate good 

12 

 
is characterized by the fact that it is interiorly evil. By this it is distinguished from spiritual good 
in the natural, which is not inborn but is acquired through regeneration, and which is said to be 
real  natural  human  good.  or  the  good  of  the  natural.  It  is  this  connate  good  that  has  been 
mistaken for genuine good by certain theories of psychology and education; theories which hold 
that  man  is  inherently  good  and  will  become  such  fully  if  there  is  no  interference  with  his 
development. (See AC 3408.)  

Conscience.  

Here is another instance of a term being used with a meaning strikingly different from that given 
to  it  in  ordinary  speech.  Conscience  is  generally  thought  of  as  an  inner  voice  which  warns  us 
when we are about  to do wrong, or reproaches when we have  already  done  so, and which is 
originally possessed by everyone-although it may be stifled. In the Writings, however, this term 
means, in its highest sense, the new will received by regeneration.  

As used in the Writings, this term means, in the highest sense, the new will received from the 
Lord by regeneration. This is conscience in its essence, which is to do evil to none and good to 
all. As thus defined, conscience is possessed only by the good; the evil have none, and the idea 
that the torments of hell are the stings of conscience is merely a pious fancy. As a perception of 
what is and what is not to be done, conscience can be possessed by all; but as it is formed with a 
man from the particular religion in which he is, and only according to internal reception thereof, 
it  is  not  uniform  and  is  not  true  of  necessity.  Thus  there  is  a  spurious  conscience  in  those 
Gentiles  who  are  in  simple  good,  and  what  is  called  a  false  conscience  with  those  in  natural 
good, the latter  being so called because  natural good is inwardly selfish, worldly  and evil. It  is 
this  that  has  been  often  mistaken  for  conscience  itself,  and  its  existence  that  has  led  men  to 
postulate a norm of conscience. But conscience is a relative thing, the bad conscience of a good 
man being the good conscience of a bad one; and the true idea of spiritual conscience is to be 
found in the teaching that it is to act according to religion and faith.  

(See AC 1033, 1076, 1077, 2144, 2831; TCR 666.) 

Consummation.  

This term refers generally to the state that exists when evil reaches its height; specifically to the 
end  of  a  religious  dispensation,  which  comes  when  there  is  no  longer  any  charity  or  faith 
because the church has turned away from the Lord entirely. Note that this end is spiritual, that 
the church itself is unaware of it, and that it may continue as an organized body although it has 
come to an end as far as performing the use of the church is concerned. (AC 2243, 2905)  

Corporeal.  

This term does not refer to the body itself but to the ultimate plan of the mind. Thus it is not 
applied to the bodily senses, but to that ultimate plane of mental life which operates through 

13 

 
them, and also to the cupidities, pleasures and appetites of the body. A man who lives only on 
the plane of these ultimate things, immersing the mind in the body, is called a corporeal man. 
(AC 911, 4038; AE 496) 

Correspondence.  

As  this  term  covers  a  fundamental  doctrine  which  is  found  only  in  the  Writings,  its  meaning 
should be clearly understood. The basic idea can be expressed very simply. Correspondence is 
both  a  causal  and  a  functional  relation  between  the  Divine  and  the  spiritual  or  between  a 
spiritual  and  a  natural  thing.  When  a  natural  object,  activity  or  phenomenon  is  the  effect  of 
which a spiritual thing is the cause, and when the two perform analogous uses to the body and 
the mind, respectively, they are said to be  in correspondence; and the natural thing is said to 
correspond to the spiritual, or to be a correspondent. Correspondence is therefore also the law 
or mode of influx. In another usage, the term means agreement that makes influx possible, as 
where it is said that man's external mind must be reduced to correspondence with the internal 
mind. (See AC 3225; AE 1080; HH 89, 107.)  

     As the terms, representative and significative, are related, it may be useful to note them here 
and  observe  the  distinctions  involved.  When  a  natural  thing  re-presents  its  cause  on  another 
plane and in another form, it is said to be a representative. Note, however, that a representative 
is,  by  definition,  not  the  thing  that  is  represented.  In  general,  things  have  a  correspondence; 
persons and their actions, in the Word, represent; and the actual words of the Scripture which 
are the symbols for things, persons and actions, signify. (See AC 3225, 2988.) 

Delights.  

Those  exterior  goods  which  are  in  the  natural,  and  which  are  felt  as  delightful  when  interior 
goods flow into that degree of the mind, are called "delights." This is done to distinguish them 
from the  interior goods of love  and affection which inflow  and produce  them. In the singular, 
however, this term refers to that which is the all of life both with those who are in heaven and 
with those who are in hell. With the former, this is good and truth; with the latter, it is evil and 
falsity. What is meant by the all of life may be seen if we consider that in the performance of 
every  necessary  action  there  is  a  delight,  without  which  the  action  might  be  left  undone  or 
would be done lifelessly. It is for this reason also that delights are described as means, that is, 
means by which, though not from which, uses are performed. (See AC 7356; TCR 570; AC 4063.)  

Desires.  

Here we have another term that is used to make a distinction. The derivations of infernal love 
are  affections  of evil  and  falsity,  and  these  are  properly  called  "concupiscences."  To  set  them 
apart from these, the derivations of heavenly love, which are affections of good and truth, are 
called  "desires."  In  ordinary  speech,  desire  often  has  an  evil  connotation,  but  in  theological 
discussion at least the term should be used as it is in the Writings. (See DP 106.) 

14 

 
Degrees.  

The doctrine of degrees is peculiar to the Writings and fundamental to an understanding of their 
philosophy. The gradations from light to shade, fine to gross, rare to dense, loud to quiet, etc., 
are  continuous  degrees,  which  are  degrees  of  one  thing-measurable  by  various  types  of 
instrumentation. Discrete degrees are the degrees of the formation or composition of one thing 
from another. They exist in all things, but each distinctly, although they make a one when taken 
together. They are related as end, cause and effect, and the only ratio between them is that of 
correspondence; that is, the higher degrees can flow into the lower ones, but not the lower into 
the higher.  

     Lower degrees have qualities not found in higher ones, but these are qualities of limitation. 
Love,  thought  and  speech  are  a  series  of  discrete  degrees.  Thought  cannot  formulate  all  that 
love  perceives,  and  speech  cannot  express  all  that  man  thinks.  However,  discrete  degrees  are 
homogeneous, and it is in the ultimate degree that all the power of a series is exerted. The three 
heavens and the three degrees of the mind are discrete series.  

     Yet it should be noted that there are discrete degrees in natural as well as in spiritual things; 
that  the  term  does  not  express  only  a  relation  between  the  spiritual  and  the  natural  or  the 
infinite and the finite. The natural atmospheres, for example, are discreted from one another. 
The designations "degrees of height" and "degrees of length" should not be taken too literally. 
(See AC 10,181; HH 38; Infi. 16; DLW 184, 256; DP 32.) 

Divine.  

By  this  term  is  meant  in  the  Writings  the  Infinite  and  Eternal  which  is  called  in  the  Word 
"Jehovah"  and  "the  Father";  the  Divine  love  and  wisdom  itself  which  is  the  esse  of  good  and 
truth. Thus it is the source from which all things are. The Divine with man is love to the Lord and 
charity  toward  the  neighbor.  The  term,  Divine,  occurs  in  many  compound  expressions,  but 
always with reference to the Divine in the Lord or to what is from Him, namely, the good and 
truth of the rational and the natural. An important compound which may be specially noted is 
"Divine proceeding," which means Divine truth within which is Divine good flowing from Divine 
love,  as  light  within  which  is  heat  proceeds  from  the  fire  of  the  sun.  The  Lord's  Divine  is 
distinguished  into  good  and  truth  because  these  can  be  received  separately  by  men.  (See  AC 
5134; DP 48, 49; AC 2023, 4696; HH 7; AC 3704.) 

Divine Endowment.  

The  terms  which  make  up  our  New  Church  vocabulary  are  not  all  taken  directly  from  the 
Writings. A few have been coined, quite legitimately, to express concepts seen in the Writings, 
and  "Divine  endowment"  is  an  example  of  this  type.  It  was  used  by  Bishop  De  Charms  in  The 
Growth of the Mind to express a conclusion drawn from a number of teachings in the Writings: 
to describe an endowment received from the Lord by every human soul at its creation by virtue 
of which man is formed into the image and likeness of God, and by virtue of which that image 

15 

 
and likeness is, in its particular formation, individual to him in order that it may be adapted to a 
specific use.  

     In other words, the Divine endowment is conceived as that which differentiates human souls. 
It is the primary cause of individuality and the third factor in determining heredity-the individual 
life-force derived by influx from the Divine which causes the soul to build the body in adaptation 
to a particular use, for which use the man was created. The fact that the term is not found in the 
Writings does not detract from it in any way; but it is useful for us to know that, together with 
other terms of this class, it is made up and is not a term of the Writings themselves although it 
expresses  something  found  in  them.  (See  The  Growth  of  the  Mind,  pp.  40-45,  60,  73f,  84; 
Revised edition, pp. 39-45, 60, 74f, 85.) 

Divine Human.  

This  term  holds  the  central  idea  in  the  theology  of  the  New  Church.  It  is  applied  to  the  Lord 
Jesus  Christ  as  He  is  after  glorification-the  Divine  love  in  a  human  form.  Note  that  the  Divine 
Human  is  not  identical  with  the  Supreme  Divine,  in  which  case  it  would  have  vanished  in  the 
Infinite.  It  is  the  body  of  Divine  truth  which  the  Lord  took  on  from  the  Father,  and  which  He 
united with the Supreme Divine as a body with a soul, between which two there is an infinitely 
perfect correspondence. The Divine Human is infinite because it is not a recipient of life, but is 
the esse of life from which life proceeds; but it is as if finite for the sake of reception. It is the 
sole object of worship in the heavens and in the church on earth. (See AC 2343, 2628, 5256; AE 
26; TCR 109.)  

Doctrine.  

Even in the New Church this term is sometimes associated with abstract theology. Nothing could 
be further from the truth! Doctrine is all that in the Word which teaches how the Lord is to be 
worshiped  and  how  men ought  to  live  that  they  may  be  withdrawn  from  hell and  introduced 
into  heaven.  Doctrine  therefore  has  a  vital  relation  to  life  and  the  good  of  life  does  not  exist 
without it. (See AC 3445) 

[…]It is[…]necessary to distinguish between the "doctrine of genuine truth" and what is known 
to us as "derived doctrine." By the former is meant that which appears plainly in the letter of 
Divine revelation, and which can be drawn thence and formulated into systematic teaching by a 
careful  comparison  of  passages  and  an  arrangement  of  them  into  a  logical  order  and  series. 
Derived  doctrine,  on  the  other  hand,  is  the  formulation  in  which  the  church  expresses  its 
understanding  of  what  the  Writings  teach.  The  difference,  and  it  is  a  vital  one,  is  that  the 
doctrine  of  genuine  truth  has  Divine  authority;  derived  doctrine  does  not,  since  it  consists  in 
human conclusions and is finite and fallible. (See SS 25.)  

16 

 
Domestic Good.  

By this is meant the good which man derives hereditarily from his parents, and into which he is 
therefore born, but which is not saving since interiorly it is evil. It is also called "natural good"; 
and  to  make  a  distinction  between  it  and  the  spiritual  good  received  from  the  Lord  by 
regeneration, that good is called the "good of the natural." Domestic good is also called connate 
good. The mistaking of natural good for the good of the natural has undoubtedly been a major 
factor in the development of the fallacy that man is born good. (See AC 3518.)  

End, Cause and Effect.  

These  philosophical  terms  occur  frequently  in  the  Writings.  End  is  the  love,  the  purpose  or 
intention of the will; cause is the means in the understanding through which the will achieves its 
purpose;  and  effect  is  the  ultimate  of  speech,  action,  sensation  or  production  in  which  the 
purpose is achieved through those means. (See AC 5608.) 

Enlightenment.  

When a man who loves truth for its own sake reads the Word for the purpose of understanding 
inflows  from  the  Lord  through  heaven  into  his 
truth  and  doing  good,  spiritual  light 
understanding; casting new light upon the knowledges therein, and enabling him to see truths 
he did not see before and to acknowledge them from internal conviction. This process is what is 
meant by enlightenment. Note that enlightenment is not internal revelation. It does not impart 
new  knowledge,  but  puts  the  knowledge  man  has  already  acquired  in  a  new  light  and  in  that 
way leads him into new truth. (See AC 9424; F. 5; SS 57.)  

Equilibrium.  

If two forces exert opposite and equal pressures upon a third thing, each cancels the other; and 
the third, if endowed with the power of action, is free to yield to one or the other as it chooses. 
Therefore it is said to be in equilibrium. As used in the Writings, the term refers to man's state 
as being so placed between heaven and hell, and also to the equal balance between heaven and 
hell which has its plane in the world of spirits. Angels and evil spirits are in the equilibrium they 
have made their own on earth. (See HH 537, 589, 591.) 

Esse, Existere, Essence.  

Here we have another series of philosophical terms. Esse is the being of a thing; existere is the 
manifestation or forthstanding of the esse; and essence is that in which the real character of a 
thing  consists-the  attributes  which  make  it  to  be  what  it  is.  These  attributes  are  spoken  of 
individually as essentials.  

17 

 
 
     Thus  the  Divine  esse  is  the  Divine  love,  the  Divine  existere  is  the  Divine  wisdom,  and  the 
Divine  essence  is  the  Divine  love  and  wisdom  together  and  related  as  esse  and  existere.  The 
Divine love and wisdom may also be spoken of separately as essentials of the Divine. Note that 
esse is more  universal than essence,  and that existere should not  be  rendered as "existence," 
which refers to the things by which the essence comes forth. (See AC 4985; TCR 36; AC 1096, 
1807.) 

Evil.  

We tend to think of evil in terms of certain words and actions, especially those forbidden in the 
second  table  of  the  Decalogue,  or  of  the  lusts  from  which  they  come.  But  these  are  only  the 
ultimate forms in which evil expresses itself. Evil, regarded in itself, is disjunction from good and 
disunion from God, and opposition to the Lord and to heaven. It is to desire to be led by self and 
not by the Lord, and to deny and will to destroy all that the Lord seeks to build. Note that evil is 
the opposite of truly human good, not of the Divine good; wherefore the Lord has power over 
evil, although man has none of himself. Note also that evil is not just the absence of good, as 
cold is the absence of heat; the teaching is that while evil is nothing in comparison with good, it 
is not nothing in itself. (See AC 4997, 6874; DP 279; CL 444.)  

Exinanition.  

This term refers to the Lord on earth and to His state of humiliation before the Father when in a 
state  of  truth  and  seemingly  separated  from  the  Divine.  Thus  it  was  a  state  of  His  human 
consciousness. (See Lord 35; Can. Rd. vi.)  

Faculty.  

This is a term used of certain things with which man is endowed by the Lord. Thus we read of 
the  faculties  of  liberty  and  rationality,  of  loving  and  becoming  wise.  In  every  instance  what  is 
meant is a potential that may or may not be developed, or may be developed in part. Faculties 
do  not  become  man's  own,  but  are  adjoined  by  the  Lord  continually,  and  it  is  in  their  right 
exercise that the Lord dwells with man. (See DLW 30, 240.) 

Faith.  

Here we have a term to which the Writings give a radically different meaning from that which it 
has in Christian theology. Faith, they teach, is neither an intellectual, historical acceptance of the 
passion and merits of Christ nor a blind assent to that which transcends the understanding, and 
it  differs  in  quality  from  the  commitment  (fiducia)  which  Luther  himself  preferred  to  mere 
assent. Faith is an internal acknowledgment and affection: an internal acknowledgment of truth 
from  sight  and  understanding  of  it,  and  an  internal  affection  of  truth  from  willing  the  truth 
because it is true; and it consists in desiring from the heart to know what is good and true for 

18 

 
the sake of life. It is therefore inseparable from life and is one with the good of charity. Indeed 
we are taught the understanding of good is what is principally called the truth of faith, and that 
faith  is  the  operation  of  the  Lord  alone  through  the  charity  in  a  man.  There  are  various 
compounds  that  should  be  briefly  noted.  Thus  historical  faith  is  that  which  rests  upon  human 
authorities; persuasive faith is belief for the sake of selfish or worldly ends; and spurious faith is 
that in which falsities  are mixed with truths. (See  F 1; HD 112; AC 36, 4605, 8034; Life 36; AR 
655; AC 2954, 1162).  

Falsity.  

This term occurs frequently in the Writings, and several distinctions are involved in the different 
ways  it  is  used.  Falsity  is  everything  that  is  contrary  to  the  truth;  and  falsities,  which  are  the 
principles and persuasions of what is false, are scientifics which resemble what is rational and 
intellectual. In general, there are two kinds of falsity-falsity from evil, and falsity producing evil. 
By the former is meant all that man thinks while he is in evil, all that favors his evil: by the latter 
is meant  any principle grounded in a man's religion which he  wrongly  believes to be true and 
which  will  lead  to  evil  when  applied.  Falsities  of  concupiscence  are  those  which  confirm  the 
things of the world and its pleasures. Falsities of ignorance exist with those who are in good as 
to life but through no fault of their own are without truths. What is contrary to truth is falsity, 
but truth applied to justify and confirm evil is what has been falsified. Fallacies are falsities with 
which evils conjoin themselves. (See AC 790, 2243, 9331, 9144; DP 220; AC 6400.) 

Finite.  

This term is applied without exception to created things. It should be noted, therefore, that the 
spiritual, though non-material, is finite. The characteristics of the finite are that there is nothing 
of  the  Divine  in  its  esse,  that  it  is  limited  by  space  and  time  or  their  spiritual  analogues,  that 
quality  and  quantity  can  be  predicated  of  it,  and  that  it  is  bounded  both  within  and  without. 
Also,  the  finite  has  a  beginning  and  an  end.  Man  indeed  lives  to  eternity,  but  he  does  so  by 
constant renewal from the Lord. (See DLW 44; DP 52; TCR 27, 29, 33; AE 629.)  

Foresight.  

This term is applied in the Writings to a particular operation or mode of the Divine Providence. 
Only that which is good is provided by the Lord; yet He knows all evil before it comes to pass, 
and provides for it. This pre-knowledge of evils is what is meant by the Divine foresight. It is to 
the  Lord  what  prudence  is  to  the  human  race,  with  the  notable  difference  that  it  is  infinite, 
infallible,  and  not  cumulative  but  simultaneous.  Divine  foresight  does  not  interfere  with  or 
qualify  human  freedom.  The  Lord  does  not  foresee  what  will  happen  because  He  has 
predetermined what shall happen; He foresees what man will do in his freedom. The term itself 
is an accommodation to the finite mind. Because all things are present to Him, and there is no 
past or future, He does not "look ahead." (See AC 3854.)  

19 

 
Form.      

Here  we  have  another  philosophical  term  which  occurs  frequently.  It  refers  to  an  organic 
receptacle in which an essence is so formed as to appear; and it does not relate to shape, but to 
the order, disposition, arrangement and relation of the parts which make a thing competent to 
its use. Thus form is said to be the same as function or use. (See TCR 52; AC 4223, 4926; LJ 12: 4; 
DLW 200, 209.) 

Freedom.  

Because of the difference between heavenly and infernal freedom, some have had difficulty in 
framing a comprehensive definition of this term. The Writings overcome this difficulty, however, 
and supply one which covers every kind of freedom by saying that freedom is to think and will 
from  affection,  and  to  act  from  liberty  according  to  what  seems  to  be  reason.  If  these  are 
heavenly, the freedom is heavenly, real, and what is called freedom itself; if they are infernal, it 
is  infernal  freedom,  only  apparent,  and  actually  non-freedom.  The  difference  is  that  in  the 
former man is led gently by the Lord according to his affections; in the latter he is driven roughly 
by  infernal  spirits  according  to  their  affections.  Note  that  the  freedom  which  is  essential  for 
regeneration is spiritual-freedom to will and think; freedom to do evil and speak falsity is rightly 
limited. Note also that freedom goes hand in hand with rationality, for which reason it cannot 
exist until man is of the age at which rationality begins. (See TCR 489; AC 4130, 5786).  

Generals, Particulars and Singulars.  

The use of these terms in the Writings is indicated by the teaching that the body, external sense 
and action are generals, the natural mind and the things that belong to it are particulars, while 
the  rational  mind  and  all  that  pertains  to  it  are  singulars.  It  is  according  to  Divine  order  that 
there should be generals and particulars, and that both should be together in every single thing; 
otherwise  particulars  cannot  exist.  In  the  case  of  man,  particulars  must  be  surrounded  by 
generals to subsist. (See AC 4345; TCR 775.) 

Glorification.  

to  glorify  is  to  make  Divine.  Glorification  is  therefore  the  process  by  which  the  Lord,  on  the 
planes of the rational, natural and sensual minds and of the body, put off by degrees the merely 
human and put on the Human from the Divine. It includes also the bringing of these planes into 
an infinitely perfect correspondence with the Supreme Divine, such as that of a Divine mind and 
body  with  a  Divine  soul.  Thus  the  term  refers  also  to  the  establishment  of  a  Divine 
consciousness  in  the  Lord's  mind,  and  to  the  process  whereby  His  Human,  from  being  a 
receptacle of life, became life itself. As that which is offered to the Lord by man, glorification is 
praise, exaltation and worship from a sincere heart. (See TCR 104; SS 99; AC 2112.)  

20 

 
God.  

By God is meant in the supreme sense the Divine above the heavens, which is the Divine good; 
in  the  internal  sense  the  Divine  in  the  heavens,  which  is  the  Divine  truth,  is  meant.  The 
distinction  made  here  rests  on  the  fact  that  Divine  truth  proceeds  from  Divine  good,  makes 
heaven, and arranges it. It should be noted also that God and the Father do not, in the spiritual 
sense, mean two persons; God means the Divine as to wisdom, and the Father means the Divine 
as  to  love.  One of  the  things  most  characteristic of New  Church terminology  is  that  we  rarely 
speak of "God," but name Him "the Lord" without the addition of other names. (See AC 7268; 
AR 21; AC 14.) 

Good.      

Good is defined in the Writings as the affection of thinking and acting according to Divine order. 
Thus  it  belongs  to  love  to  the  Lord  and  charity  toward  the  neighbor,  is  spiritual,  consists  in 
willing  and  doing  well  unselfishly,  and  is  heaven  with  man.  That  which  proceeds  from  man's 
proprium  is  never  good  and  may  actually  be  entirely  evil.  However,  what  man  loves  he  calls 
good, whether it be heavenly or infernal, because it is felt by him as such. This is what has given 
rise to the theory that good is only relative, but the Writings make clear that there is an absolute 
good. (See AC 4538, 4997, 7255; DP 279; DLW 335; TCR 38; F 14.) 

Grand Man.      

Here is another term that is found only in the Writings. The angels are organized into societies, 
and  these  into  groups,  each  one  of  which  performs  a  general  use  to  which  corresponds  the 
function  performed  by  some  member,  organ,  viscus  or  membrane  of  the  human  body.  Every 
part of the body, even every single cell, has its  heavenly counterpart in the field of use. As to 
their uses the heavens are therefore organized in the form of a man, and it is this heavenly man 
that is called the Grand Man. Note that heaven is so called from use, not from shape, though we 
may  well  suppose  that  if  it  could  be  seen  in  its entirety  it  would  appear  in  the  human  shape. 
Note  also  that  while  the  heavens  from  this  earth  constitute  a  grand  man,  the  Grand  Man  is 
made up of all the heavens from all the earths.  

     The Writings present us with three general ideas: 1) heaven as a grand man, with the world of 
spirits as the alimentary system and hell as the waste excreted from the body; 2) heaven as a 
grand  man  and  hell  as  a  great  monster;  3)  heaven,  hell  and  the  world  of  spirits  as  one  man: 
heaven being the man, the  world of spirits being the  alimentary system as to the work of the 
angels  in that world, and the  hells being those  things which are in the body but  not  of it, yet 
which serve vile uses, that is, for purification and so on. This last concept is under the teaching 
that everyone in the spiritual world must be of some use, as well those in the hells as those in 
the heavens.  

     The general idea of the Grand Man is that the Lord is within heaven and the church as the 
soul is in the body-immanent but discretely distinguished; that heaven and the church are the 

21 

 
mind and body; and that they are to the Lord what the spiritual and natural organics are to man. 
Thus the  Lord is the  soul and life of the  Grand Man; angels, spirits, and the  spiritual minds of 
men  on  earth  are  the  mind  of  that  man;  and  men  on  earth  are  its  body  and  senses.  (See  AC 
2906, 4219, 4225, 6807; U 9; TCR 119.) 

Gyres.  

These  are  mentioned  in  the  Writings  as  forms  into  which  newly  arrived  spirits  must  be 
inaugurated  that  they  may  be  initiated  into  fellowship  with  others  and  into  the  practice  of 
thinking and speaking in concord and unanimity. A gyre is a circular or spiral  motion, and the 
term is used in the Writings to describe a motion that is complete, perfect and perpetual. (See 
AC 5128.)  

Heavenly Marriage.  

This  term,  which  is  also  peculiar  to  the  Writings,  is  interiorly  descriptive  of  a  reciprocal 
conjunction of good and truth, or of the will and the understanding, which has its origin in the 
union or marriage of love and wisdom in the Lord. The heavenly marriage is effected in those 
only who have been regenerated, and it takes place in the rational of the intellectual proprium. 
Essentially it is a union in which love or good from the Lord received in the new will inspires life 
into truths in the understanding and directs them to uses, and in which those truths in their turn 
give form and quality to that love. The details are complicated, but the basic idea is that good 
from the Lord received from within by the internal way is brought into conjunction with truth 
received  from  without,  from  the  Word,  by  the  external  way,  that  is,  through  the  senses.  We 
note that this union, which descends into ultimates in the mind, is preceded by a union entirely 
internal which initiates conjunction, and to which betrothal corresponds. (See AC 3952, 2803.) 

Heredity.  

Although this term is used in Christian theology and in biology and psychology, the Writings give 
to it a new and entirely different meaning. Heredity covers all the characteristics transmitted by 
parents to their offspring. According to the Writings what are thus transmitted are tendencies-
which  are  not  imputed-to the  goods or evils  in  which  the  parents  have  confirmed themselves 
and which have become habitual with them. The lives and loves of parents cannot be inherited, 
but inclinations to them are passed on, and the sum-total of these is the parental heredity. Thus 
a state of damnation or of regeneration cannot be inherited; but we are told that the children of 
regenerating parents receive inclinations to love wisdom and the things that wisdom teaches. In 
this lies the hope of the human race. The parental heredity is twofold, and the maternal, which 
is external, is put off by regeneration, while the paternal heredity can never be eradicated. (See 
AC 1313, 4317, 4563.)  

22 

 
Heresy.  

Because this term is used so loosely, it is important that we have a clear definition of it. Such a 
definition is contained in the statement that heresy is doctrine separated from the church, for 
the essentials of the church are the acknowledgment of the Lord and of the Word and the life of 
charity.  Only  doctrines  which  would  separate  from  these  may  rightly  be  called  heresies, 
therefore;  others,  even  if  they  conflict  with  our  views,  are  only  differences  of  opinion  or  of 
interpretation. It is to be noted that heresy condemns no one; what condemns is confirmation 
of the falsity in the heresy from an evil love. Those who are in heresy as to the understanding, 
therefore, can be reformed and saved if they do not thus confirm it. (See AC 324, 6400, 3488; SS 
92; DP 259.)  

Holy.  

This  term  is  properly  predicated of  that  which  flows into man  through  heaven from  the Lord. 
Strictly speaking, therefore, the Lord Himself is not holy but Divine, and the holy is that which 
proceeds from Him. The Lord Himself is above the heavens, for He is the Divine Man in the midst 
of the spiritual sun; the Divine which proceeds out of that sun from Him in the angelic heavens is 
what is called the holy. (See AC 9956, 10472.) 

Holy Spirit.  

The  Holy  Spirit  is,  of  course,  identical  with  the  one  God,  Jesus  Christ  our  Lord.  It  is  the 
proceeding  Divine  which  instructs,  enlightens,  reforms  and  regenerates  man,  and  is  therefore 
the Divine truth from which is man's spiritual life. As the Writings point out, therefore, it is not a 
God by itself, but the operation of the one God in performing these uses. Note that by the Holy 
Spirit  is  meant  a  Divine  operation  that  could  not  take  place  before  the  glorification.  (See  AC 
9818; DLW 149; Can. HS i.)  

Human Essence.  

Here we have another important term which occurs in the doctrine of the glorification. It refers 
to something which the Lord put on by birth of Mary, but which was neither from her nor yet 
Divine when assumed: a truly human accession from which the Lord could conquer the hells and 
which He could make Divine. This was an as-of-Himself reception of the Divine love and wisdom, 
manifested in the desire to be led by the Divine and to learn truth. These formed in the Lord a 
plane of human consciousness on which, when in the state of humiliation, He could feel entirely 
separate from the Divine, and of Himself could fight against and conquer the hells. This is what 
is  meant  by  the  Human  essence,  and  it  was  this  that  was  glorified,  so  that,  from  being  a 
receptacle of life, the Lord became life itself in the Human. (See AC 1675.)  

23 

 
Human Internal.  

This rare but important term occurs in the phrase "the heaven of human internals." It refers to 
the  soul-to  the  two  superior  degrees  of  the  mind  which  are  in  the  order  of  heaven,  above 
consciousness,  incapable  of  being  modified  or  changed  by  man's  own  life,  and  the  Lord's 
dwelling place in him. It is the activities imparted to these degrees by the Lord that, in reception, 
make  the  angelic  heavens.  For  this  reason,  and  because  they  are  in  themselves  above  the 
consciousness  of  the  highest  angels,  they  belong  to  the  Lord  alone.  They  form  a  very  heaven 
which is nearest to the Lord, and this is what is meant by the heaven of human internals. (See 
AC 1999.) 

Indications of Providence.  

Here we have another term which is firmly established in our vocabulary but is nowhere to be 
found  in  the  Writings,  although  it expresses  an  idea derived  from them.  The  phrase  has  been 
taken to mean that the limits imposed by a situation, what seems possible at any given time, are 
indications  of  Providence  as  to  what  should  be  done,  and  much  has  been  said  in  the  church 
about seeking and following the indications of Providence. It is our belief that this idea should 
be approached with great caution, and in the light of the teaching that the Lord never shows or 
tells men  directly what  to do;  for  the  dictate  of men's  loves  may  cause  them  to  see  different 
indications  in  the  exigencies  of  the  same  situation.  There  are  indications  of  Providence;  but 
these, we believe, are the teachings of the Word.  

Infestation. 

This  term  is  used  only  in  connection  with  spirits  who  are  being  vastated  in  the  lower  earth. 
These are said to be infested by evils and falsities injected by the hells which are round about, to 
the end that their own evils and falsities may be removed, goods and truths be insinuated, and 
they be brought into the state of being capable of elevation into heaven. 

Thus the term refers to a special process which is so called because it is like an incessant attack 
from which there is no escape and which appears to be almost overwhelming. (See AC 7147.) 

Infinite. The  Infinite  in itself is said to be  the Divine  itself or the  Lord Himself, but  the Infinite 
from itself is the Divine proceeding or the Lord in others created from Himself, thus in men and 
angels, and this Divine is the same as the Divine Providence. It is said that of the Infinite nothing 
can be predicated except that it is. However, if we think of those things which are characteristic 
of  the  finite-beginning  and  end,  inner  and  outer  limitations,  spatial  qualities,  depreciation  in 
time, and so on-and then abstract them, we can enlarge our idea. (See DP 55.)  

Influx.  

With this term is related one of the most fundamental doctrines given in the Writings. It denotes 
the  successive  operation  of  what  is  higher  into  and  through  what  is  discretely  lower,  as  of 

24 

 
thought  into speech, will  into  action,  and  so  on.  The  essential  idea  is  that  nothing  under  God 
acts  of itself, but  through the  operation into it of something higher, and this all the way back 
through  the  scale  of  degrees  to  the Lord  Himself.  Influx  should  not  be  thought  of  in  terms of 
water being poured into a cup, but rather of a wave motion impinging upon a substance which 
reacts and is thus a receptacle. This is important because it shows that the inflowing force and 
the  receptacle  are  not  merged.  The  Divine  does  not  become  finite  in  proceeding;  yet  neither 
does man become Divine in receiving Divine influx.  

     Two pairs of related terms should be noted, first, general and particular influx. General influx, 
which is from the Lord through the order of the heavens, is into those things which are in the 
order of their life, such as animals; particular influx, which is from the Lord through angels and 
spirits, is into those  things which are  not  in  order, that is, the minds of men. Note that man's 
body is under general influx.  

     The  second  pair,  immediate  and  mediate  influx,  are  readily  distinguished.  Influx  through 
heaven  or  through  the  Word  is  mediate;  influx  from  the  Lord  into  the  human  soul,  which  is 
above the angelic heavens, is immediate. (See AC 6128, 5850, 5854, 5862, 6058, 6495).  

Innocence.  

By this term is meant willingness to be led by a power not one's own. Spiritual innocence, or the 
innocence of wisdom, consists in an interior willingness to be led by the Lord rather than by self. 
It is adjoined with man and is the Divine good proceeding and leading man to heaven. (See AC 
7902, 9938; HH 280.) 

Inspiration.  

By this term, we are told, is not meant dictation but inspiration from the Divine. The distinction 
is that whatever inflows from the Divine is Divine in itself, but passes through heaven, in which it 
becomes celestial and spiritual, and then enters the world, where it becomes worldly, but with 
the  Divine  and  what  is  heavenly  within  it.  This  definition  shows  what  is  the  nature  of  the 
inspiration of the Word and enables us to distinguish between it and what is commonly called 
the inspiration of secular writers. Inspiration is also defined as insertion into angelic societies, 
which has the same general implication, namely, insertion into the spheres through which the 
Divine proceeds. (See AC 9094; TCR 140.)  

Intellectual, The.  

The intellectual is the truth of faith. In general it is the sight of the internal man, which sees from 
the light of heaven that is from the Lord. What it sees is heavenly. The term is used also of the 
understanding. (See AC 863, 5114, 8458.) 

25 

 
Intellectual of the Church.  

The intellectual of the church, we are taught, is that when a man reads the Word, and carefully 
compares one  passage  with  another,  he  perceives  thence  what  is  to  be  believed  and  done.  It 
exists with those only who are enlightened, that is, who desire to know truths only for the sake 
of life and use. Thus the term should not be confused with what is usually called intellectualism; 
the emphasis here is on the search for truth as a means to the good of life. (See AC 6222.)  

Intellectual Truth.  

By this term is meant truth conjoined with a perception that it is so, that is, truth adjoined to 
good. This truth is distinguished from scientific truth, which is a matter of knowledge, and from 
rational truth, which is said to be scientific truth confirmed by reason. (See AC 1895, 1496.)  

Intelligence.  

According  to  the  Writings,  intelligence  is  from  the  light  of  the  world  illumined  by  the  light  of 
heaven. It consists in knowing, understanding and believing Divine truths; in perceiving inwardly 
whether  what  is  presented  is  true  or  not;  and  in  understanding  the  causes  of  things. 
Intelligence, therefore, does not require great learning, and in varying degree it is given by the 
Lord to all regenerating men. (See AC 9943; AE 198, 408.) Wisdom will be defined later, but we 
may note that it is distinguished from intelligence by two things. It is from the light of heaven; 
and it consists  in willing, loving and doing the truths which intelligence  sees and understands. 
(See AC 9943; AE 408.)  

Internal and External Man.  

These are not terms for the mind and the body, respectively. Both refer to the mind, and they 
are descriptive  of the  two minds by which man is in company with angels and with men. The 
internal man is the ruling love and its perceptions from which man mediates when alone, and by 
which  he  does  uses  in  the  spiritual  world;  the  external  man  consists  of  the  affections  and 
thoughts which are displayed by a man when he is in company, and by which he performs uses 
in this world. An important corollary is that these two minds, distinct from each other, are also 
distinct from the body. (See AC 8742; AR 641.) 

Internal Sense.  

The internal sense of the Word lies concealed within the letter and should not be confused with 
the  genuine  sense  of  the  letter.  It  is  characterized  bb  the  entire  absence  of  the  elements  of 
person, place and time, and it contains two elements, namely, affection and thought. This sense 
is  threefold.  The  inmost,  supreme  or  celestial  sense,  which  treats  of  the  Lord,  is  for  the  third 
heaven; the spiritual sense, or internal sense proper, in which the subject is the Lord's kingdom, 
is  for  the  second  heaven;  and  the  internal-historical,  spiritual-moral,  or  proximate  internal 

26 

 
sense, which describes the state as to morals and doctrine of the nation mentioned in the letter, 
is for the first heaven. (See AC 1405, 7233, 4279).  

Law.  

The nature of Divine law will be better understood if we think of it as being represented by the 
laws  of  aerodynamics,  physics  or  chemistry  rather  than  by  laws  enacted  by  legislative  bodies 
and then turned over to the judicial branch for enforcement; for the former cannot be broken, 
but the latter can. 

As is well known, a law of physics is not the statement in the textbooks but the order or relation 
of  phenomena  noted  and  described  in  the  statement.  Divine  laws  are  unchangeable  and 
unbreakable operations of Divine order, and the revelation of them in the Word is not the law 
itself  but  the  statement  of  the  law.  Thus  when  we  are  told  that  it  is  a  law  of  the  Divine 
Providence that a certain thing should be done, the teaching does not only prescribe a mode of 
conduct; it states an unalterable order with which man must co-operate if he wishes to achieve 
the  end.  Note  that  there  are  no  laws  of  nature;  Divine  laws  in  nature.  (See  AC  7186,  10119, 
7206.)  

Limbus.  

The limbus is a border, drawn from the finest things of nature, which man retains after death to 
give  fixation,  stability  and  permanence  to  his  life  in  the  spiritual  world.  Because  it  is  natural, 
even though formed from the  purest things of nature,  the limbus does  not enter the  spiritual 
world,  but  remains  within  nature  as  a  basis  for  man's  immortality;  and  as  his  character  is 
impressed upon it, it is the basis for his survival as an individual. The limbus is also referred to as 
the  cutaneous  envelope  or  border,  and  the  substances  which  constitute  it  are  the  natural 
substances of the mind. (See AC 3293, TCR 103; DLW 257, 388e; Wis. viii:7.)  

Love of Self. 

 In the form in which it is usually spoken of, this love consists in wishing well to oneself alone, 
and not to others except for the sake of self, and it is a corporeal love of exercising dominion 
over others. It was not evil in the beginning, however, but one of the three universal loves into 
which  man  was  created;  and  when  it  has  been  purified  and  subordinated  by  regeneration  it 
becomes the proper love of self care and preservation for the sake of uses, and one of the loves 
which makes man to be truly a man. (See HD 65; TCR 507.)  

Love of the World. 

 This  term  denotes  a  material  love  of  desiring  to  appropriate  to  oneself  by  every  artifice  the 
wealth and possessions of others; one which causes a man to set his heart on riches and suffer 
the world to lead him away from heaven. However, there is also a proper love of the world, but 

27 

 
by regeneration it is subordinated to the love of heaven This is an important teaching because, 
as the Writings emphasize, it is not necessary for man to renounce the world in order to enter 
the kingdom of heaven. The spiritual man continues to love the world, as he continues to love 
himself, but as a master loves a servant. Love of the world is less deadly than love of sell, but 
these two loves are the origins of all evils. (See HD 76; TCR 507.) 

Love to the Lord.  

Here we have another term which expresses a concept peculiar to the Writings and strikingly at 
variance with the one held in the world. It does not mean love of the Lord's person on account 
of His example, sufferings, and death on the cross, but love of the Divine things that are in Him 
and  from  Him.  Thus  the  term  does  not  refer  to  a  personal  affection  such  as  is  implicit  in  the 
evangelical Christian idea of the Lord as Companion, Elder Brother and Friend, but to a love that 
is  spiritual  in  origin  and  extension-believing  in  and  loving  the  Lord's  precepts  and  loving  and 
doing in sincerity what is good. (See AR 903; HH 278.)  

Love to the Neighbor.  

This also denotes an impersonal affection, that is, not love of the proprium of others and what 
proceeds from it, but love of good from the Lord in its subjects, which are men and women. It 
therefore  refers  to  love  of  uses,  which  are  goods.  This  does  not  mean  that  love  toward  the 
neighbor  is  cold  and  abstract,  for  what  we  love  in  others  anyway  is  quality  of  mind  and 
achievement,  but  that  love  is  given  to  those  qualities  which  seem  to  be  good.  The  concept 
implies wise discrimination. (See DLW 426; HH 278.)  

Masculine and Feminine.  

Although  the  world  may  suspect  that  the  distinction  between  man  and  woman  is  more  than 
biological,  it  is  not  known what  the  real  distinction  is  or  that  it  lies  so  deep  as  to  be  indelibly 
impressed on the  soul itself. According to the Writings, the inmost  of the male is love  and its 
covering is wisdom; the inmost in the female is the wisdom of the male, and its covering is love 
thence derived. The masculine consists in perceiving from the understanding and the feminine 
in  perceiving  from  the  will.  These  are  ideal  definitions,  but  the  distinction  holds  good  in  all 
conditions. (See CL 32, 168.) 

Media.  

Reference is often made in the Writings to media, or means. This term is always applied to an 
intermediate which derives something from each of the entities between which it stands, and 
which has the effect that as man draws near to the one, the other becomes subordinate to it. A 
good  example  is  the  rational,  which  stands  between  the  spiritual  and  the  natural  minds.  It 

28 

 
receives  from  both  of  these,  and  as  man  draws  near  to  the  spiritual  or  the  natural  the  other 
becomes subordinate to it. (See AC 3913.)                         

Meditation.  

As used in the Writings, this is not a synonym for reflection but a term with a distinct meaning. 
Meditation  is  a  state  of  the  interior  thought  of  the  understanding,  which  is  the  ruling  love 
thinking, into which man comes when he is alone or in his own home and thus in freedom. It is 
that mental activity in which the understanding contemplates, intends and plans the ends of the 
ruling love, and ponders and seeks means to their attainment; and it is characterized by the fact 
that in it man wills and thinks what he really loves. Meditation should be cultivated as a means 
of becoming acquainted with the internal man and of discovering those evils which will remain 
hidden even from ourselves if we are never alone. (See DLW 404; DP 61, 296.) 

Mercy.  

The universal definition of this term given in the Writings is that mercy is that into which love is 
turned when it looks upon those who are in need and grieves for their misery. Thus the Lord's 
mercy is His love toward the human race since the fall: the love behind His Providence and all its 
operations,  and  the  salvation  resulting  from  them.  It  is  universal  and  equal,  and  it  consists  in 
withdrawing  man  from  evil,  leading  him  into  good,  and  keeping  him  in  good-if,  and  as,  it  is 
received by him. (See AC 5816.)  

Merit.  

Here we have a striking example of a term being used in the Writings with a meaning radically 
different  from  that  which  it  has  in  common  usage.  Ordinarily,  "merit"  has  a  positive 
connotation.  It  stands  for  goodness  and  worth,  and  conduct  which  is  deserving  of  honor  and 
praise  is  described  as  meritorious.  In  the  Writings,  however,  they  are  said  to  seek  merit  who 
suppose that they can do good from themselves, and would demand heaven as a reward which 
they  have  earned  and  to  which  they  are  therefore  entitled,  and  their  works  are  described  as 
merit-seeking or meritorious. (See AR 86.)  

Mind.  

The mind (ntens) consists of the understanding and will, which two faculties constitute the life 
of man. They are distinct from each other, but so created as to form one; and when they do so, 
they  are  called  the  mind.  This  mind  is  what  is  called  the  internal  man,  and  it  is  within  the 
external man. Note that the mind is spiritual and that the brain is not the mind but its organ. It is 
indeed said that the mind consists of both spiritual and natural substances; but the latter, from 
which the limbus is drawn, are the substances of that organ, and affection and thought do not 

29 

 
take  place  in  them  but  in the  spiritual  substances,  and  this  by  changes  and  variations  in  their 
form and state. (See LJ 12; HD 28; TCR 156; DLW 257.) 

Moral.  

This is a term which has far wider and deeper extension in the Writings than in common usage, 
in  which  it  is  frequently  restricted  to  sexual  behavior.  As  used  by  them,  it  is  inclusive  of  the 
entire life of man with the neighbor in societies. Thus moral truths relate to the things of every 
man's life in regard to companionship and social relations - to what is sincere and right, and to 
virtues of every kind. Moral good, which is human good itself, is the rational good according to 
which man lives with other men as a brother and companion. Moral life is to act well, sincerely 
and justly in all things; and moral wisdom consists in the practice of all the virtues which look to 
life and enter into it. (See AE 182; HH 468; Char. 57; CL 164.)  

Mutual Love.  

Here we have a term which is used in various ways. It refers to the love of the neighbor more 
than oneself which is characteristic of the celestial kingdom. Elsewhere it is taken for charity, or 
spiritual  love;  and  in  other  places  it  is  contrasted  with  friendship  in  the  teaching  that  mutual 
love  regards  the  good  in  man,  and  being  directed  to  good  is  given  to  him  who  is  in  good, 
whereas  friendship  regards  the  man  for  the  sake  of  self.  (See  AC  2057;  AR  353;  AC  3875.)  A 
related term is the good of mutual love: the good characteristic of the external of the celestial 
kingdom, the celestial-natural heaven. This is said to be the affection of good for its own sake 
and the external good of innocence. (See AC 9741, 9912.)  

Natural.  

This  particular  term  refers  to  the  ultimate  in  every  series.  Thus  it  is  descriptive  of  the  first  or 
lowest heaven, of the sense of the Word in the letter, and of the ultimate degree of the human 
mind  and  of  this  and  other  worlds  in  which  creation  subsists  and  terminates.  The  life  of  the 
lowest degree of the mind, which is from the world, is called natural, and the man who lives only 
on the plane of that life is called a natural man. (See HH 31; AC 3293.) 

Neighbor.  

The general and distinctive meaning given to this term in the Writings is quite well known. The 
universal idea is that good from the Lord is the neighbor, and as the subject of that good is man, 
man is the  neighbor in the  degree in which he  receives  it. The Lord, His kingdom, the church, 
one's country, the human race,  society, the individual, and self are  the descending degrees of 
the neighbor;  and when a choice must  be  made,  the  higher degree is always to be  preferred. 
The good derive the degrees of the neighbor in this order; the evil, from self. The concept of the 

30 

 
neighbor found in the Writings calls for the exercise of wise discrimination. (See AC 9783; F 20; 
HH 390; HD 88.)  

Order.  

Order  itself  is  the  Divine  truth  that  proceeds  from the  Lord,  for  it  is  this  that makes  order on 
every plane. Order is defined as the nature of the disposition, determination and activity of the 
parts, substances or entities which constitute the form of a thing, from whence is its state. Thus 
when the substances of the mind are so disposed, determined, and activated as to receive life 
from the Lord, the mind is in the order of its life. When this is not the case, we say that the mind 
is in inverted order. So is it also with other created things as to the order of their life. (See AC 
8700; TCR 52.) 

Perception.  

Perception is said to be a certain internal sensation which is communicated by the Lord alone as 
a means of knowing whether anything is good and true. It is defined also as an internal dictate, 
with full confirmation by influx from the Lord, as to the intrinsic quality of good and truth, evil 
and falsity. Thus the perception of the church, like that of the angels, consists in seeing from the 
Lord what is good and true, not so much in regard to civil society as to love and faith toward the 
Lord. Note that perception is not given as a mode of internal or immediate revelation; it is not 
granted  apart  from  the  Word.  The  Writings  speak  also  of  "common  perception,"  so  called 
because it is universal in the spiritual world, though not given on earth, whereby the quality of 
newcomers  is  discerned  instantly  from  the  sphere  they  carry  about  with  them,  no  speech  or 
action being needed. (See AC 104, 1822, 5937, 7680; AE 307.)  

Passive.  

This term is applied in the Writings to things which are dead, that is, things which cannot act of 
themselves but can be activated by the influx of life from the Lord. Passives are therefore both 
recipients  and  reagents.  Both  of  these  ideas  are  necessary,  and  the  relation  of  passives  to 
actives is indicated in the teaching that the eyes and the ears are passive while the ether and 
the air are  active. Thus "passive" does  not mean inert; that  which is inert  is called the merely 
passive  and  is  said  to  dissipate  influx.  By  derivation  the  word  means,  to  suffer.  It  is  also 
connected with the word, patient; and reflection on what that involves can throw further light 
on the meaning of this term. (See DLW 178; TCR 110, 607; AE 616.) 

Permission.  

This  is  one  of  four  related  terms  which  make  vital  contributions  to  our  theology  and  involve 
important  distinctions.  All  the  power  of  acting  is  from  the  Lord;  but  what  is  done  by  angels, 
spirits  and  men  is  nearer  to  or more  remote  from  the  Lord  in  the  degree  that  they  intend  to 

31 

 
conform with His will or purpose to act contrary to it. Thus there  are  four distinct  qualities of 
action. What is done from love to the Lord and toward the neighbor is from will. All that is done 
from  the  same  love,  but  qualified  as  yet  by  still  active  states  of  the  proprium,  is  from  good 
pleasure. That which is done by those who are interiorly evil, but from an end of natural good, is 
from  leave.  But  what  is  done  by  the  evil  from  a  deliberate  purpose  of  evil  is  done  from 
permission. Note, however, that a permission always involves two things. The Lord permits only 
the evil which He can bend to an end of good that could not be achieved in any other way; and 
He neither wills nor concurs in the evil. This is peculiar to the Lord. He alone can permit and not 
will in the least degree, or even acquiesce in, the evil permitted. (See HD 272; DP 296.)  

Profanation.  

To profane is to deny the Lord, the Word and eternal life after they have once been interiorly 
acknowledged, or to believe in them and still live contrary to them. The essential condition of 
profanation  is  that  it  causes  good  and  evil,  truth  and  falsity,  to  become  so  inextricably 
intermingled in the interiors of the mind that they cannot be separated, with the result that the 
man can go neither to heaven nor to hell. The regenerating man has both good and evil, truth 
and falsity, in his mind; but they are separated, the good and truth being in the internal mind 
and the evil and falsity in the external. It is those only who know the truth who can profane it, 
and among them those only do so who first acknowledge and then deny. (See AC 10287, 9818.) 

Proprium. 

Like conjugial, this term is best left untranslated. It has been rendered as "own" and "ownhood," 
"self" and "selfhood"; but it has no true equivalent in English, and these attempts to find one are 
not only clumsy but also inaccurate, since man has nothing of his own. Perhaps the simplest way 
to define it is to say that man's proprium is the life that seems to be his and no other's - the life 
that  distinguishes  him  from  every  other  man  and  makes  him  a  unique  individual.  If  this  life 
inflows  from  hell,  it  makes  an  infernal  proprium;  if  it  comes  from  the  Lord  by  influx  through 
heaven, it makes  a heavenly  proprium. In each instance  the life inflows,  but  the  fact  that it is 
sensated as if self-derived makes it a proprium. (See AC 3812; CL 194; SS 60; AR 558.)  

Providence.  

The term, the Divine Providence, is inclusive of all that is done by the Lord, which is infinite and 
eternal. The Divine Providence is therefore the government of the Divine love and wisdom in the 
spiritual world and on earth, and it consists in the preservation of creation for the sake of uses 
to man and in every Divine  work which has to do with human salvation. It is predicted of the 
provision of good, and is a leading to good and guarding from evil; but as good operates through 
truth, it is also the Divine wisdom. In proceeding, it is the Lord's influx, both through heaven and 
immediately from Himself, effecting the production of uses through the spheres of procreating 
and of protecting what is procreated. In reception, it is the Divine operation in the man who has 

32 

 
removed the love of self. In general, Providence conserves what is in order and strives to restore 
to order that which is not. (See HD 267; AC 5195; AE 25.) 

Rational.  

The essential idea in this term is that of an intermediate between the spiritual and the natural - 
a  mental  plane  on which  light  from  heaven  illuminates  what  is  in the  light  of the  world.  Thus 
rational  truth  is  the  spiritual  truth  about  natural  things,  and  rational  thought  is  thought  from 
understanding  of  the  spiritual  uses  of  things.  The  rational  is  the  highest  plane  of  the  natural 
degree,  intermediate  between  the  soul  and  the  natural  mind;  and  rationality  is  the  faculty  of 
receiving light from the Lord, and of thus perceiving the relations of things to one another and 
to the Lord. The terms "natural rational" and "spiritual rational" refer to the rational before and 
after regeneration. (See AC 3314, 5150, 1944; AE 569; HH 468.)  

Ratiocination.  

More  often translated "reasoning,"  this term  describes  the  process  of  arguing  whether  Divine 
and  spiritual  things  exist  in  which  those  indulge  who  inwardly  doubt  and  deny,  and  who 
approach  such  things  from  sensuous  and  scientific  ones.  Ratiocination,  which  always  favors 
man's  principles,  takes  the  place  of  understanding  with  the  unregenerate.  (See  AC  7352;  HH 
464.) 

Receptacle.     

 By receptacles are meant the very essential forms of men. Men are forms receptive of life from 
the Lord, and the  human mind therefore consists of receiving vessels. Note,  however, that by 
this term the Writings do not mean inert vessels to be infilled but vessels which react, freely and 
responsibly, to the influx of life. (See AC 6138, 5531.)  

Reciprocal.      

This  term  relates  to  the  reaction  of  truth  to  good.  Truth  from  the  Lord  enters  the  mind  from 
without through the Word; good from the Lord inflows by an inner way. When man makes the 
truth  his  own,  or  as  if  his  own,  by  obedience  to  it,  it  reacts  with  the  good  that  inflows  from 
within,  and  this  reaction  is  what  is  meant  by  reciprocation.  It  should  be  noted  that  both  the 
action  and  the  reaction  are  of  the  Lord,  but  that  the  latter  is  effected  through  man  as  if  of 
himself. (See AC 2954; DLW 115.)  

Redemption.  

Here  is  a  theological  term  which  has  an  entirely  different  meaning  in  our  doctrine  from  that 
which is given to it in Christendom. To redeem is to buy back, and the Christian Church teaches 
that the Lord bought back the souls of the elect with the blood shed on the cross. The Writings 

33 

 
teach, however, that redemption itself was the subjugation of the hells and the arrangement of 
the heavens into order, and thus preparation for a new, spiritual church. So the passion of the 
cross  was  not  redemption,  though,  as  the  last  of  the  Lord's  temptations,  it  was  a  means  of 
redemption because of glorification. (See TCR 84.)  

Reflection.  

We  should  be  careful  to  distinguish  this  term  from  "meditation,"  which  is  the  ruling  love 
thinking. It may be defined in three ways. In act, reflection is a mental operation in which the 
mind considers, as from above, its external acts and processes and the, functioning of the body. 
In effect, it is a mental view of the things that impinge upon the mind through the senses of the 
body,  and  of  what  their  quality  is.  In  essence,  it  is  consciousness,  and  thus  the  essential  of 
thought  and sensation.  It is, therefore, the  faculty through which everything human comes to 
man, and without which he would not be man at all. (See SD 733-739.) 

Reformation.  

This is one of the major theological terms used in the Writings. Reformation is predicated of the 
understanding and is a state of thought, formed by the truth of faith, in which man looks with 
longing to the spiritual life. During it he is led by truth to good and is in a state of obedience in 
which  truth  predominates.  Man  is  in  a  state  of  reformation  when  he  sees  and  acknowledges 
that good is good and evil is evil, and thinks that good should be chosen; and the process itself is 
a  reforming  of  the  existing  content  of  the  understanding  -  a  reorganization  effected  through 
temptations by which knowledges of truth are centered in the Lord and heaven instead of in self 
and the world, and are thus prepared to receive a new will from the Lord. (See TCR 571.)  

Regeneration.  

In  its  wider  meaning,  this  term  refers  to  the  entire  process  of  man's  rebirth,  but  in  a  more 
restricted  sense  it  relates  to  that  part  of  the  process  which  follows  reformation.  As  distinct 
therefrom, regeneration is predicated of the will and is a state of love, formed by the good of 
charity, in which man becomes spiritual-natural. During it man has a perceptive understanding 
of truth from good, and is in a state of affection in which good has the dominion. He comes into 
it when he begins to shun evils and do goods, and the process consists in the establishment of a 
new will in the reformed understanding. This will, which is an entirely new structure, consists in 
the goods of remains, which are then appropriated by the natural. (See TCR 571.) 

Religion.  

Religion is frequently thought of in the world as a system of belief, which may be held without 
being practised. It is often implied that which system is embraced does not matter as long as it 
satisfies  and  one  lives  well,  and  the  idea  persists  that  religion  was  invented  by  men  out  of 

34 

 
 
necessity from wonder or fear. The essential idea, however, is that true religion is revealed and 
is of the life, but a life according to genuine doctrine. Belief and life cannot be  separated, the 
Writings teach, since a man cannot live differently than he really believes or believe differently 
than he loves and lives. (See AE 805.) 

Religiosity.  

This  term,  found  only  occasionally  outside  of  the  Writings,  is  used  by  them  to  describe  an 
organized  external  worship  which  has  no  internal  whatsoever.  Thus  they  always  speak  of  the 
"Roman  Catholic  religiosity"  rather  than  "church"  because  Rome  does  not  worship  the  Lord. 
(See AC 4440.)  

Remains. 

 Here we have another term around which is constructed an important doctrine. By "remains" 
are  meant  all  the  goods  and  truths,  together  with  their  attendant  states,  which  the  Lord  lays 
down  in  every  human  mind  without  exception  from  first  infancy  to  adult  life  as  a  basis  for 
regeneration. They are so called because they actually are remains of all the goods and truths 
which have been impressed on the mind from infancy; of the states of charity, innocence, love 
and mercy associated with them; and also of the states of attendant angels. It should be noted 
that all remains are implanted by the Lord and that the remains essential for regeneration are 
given to all. We can provide experiences in which remains may be implanted, but we do not do 
the  implanting,  and  much  that  has  been  thought  of  as  the  instilling  of  remains  is  really  the 
upbuilding of habits and attitudes. (See AC 561, 1060, 1738.) 

Repentance.      

As this term is used in the Writings, it has a very different meaning from that which is attached 
to it elsewhere. In ordinary usage it is associated with regret for and contrition over the sins of 
the past. However, the Writings define repentance as confessing one's sins before God, praying 
humbly that they may be forgiven, and then desisting from them by leading a new life according 
to the precepts of charity and faith: a process which, to be effective, must be preceded by self-
examination  which  includes  the  intentions  and  thoughts  as  they  appear  in  the  imagination  as 
well as words and deeds. Ceasing from the evils confessed is the very essence of repentance, 
and the teaching makes clear that the evils of which man truly repents are those which he shuns 
when they present themselves with delight and when he is free to commit them. (See AR 531.) 

Revelation.     

 When  revelation  is  from  the  Divine,  it  is  identical  with  the  Word.  In  its  ultimate  form  it  is 
defined as a general vessel receptive of spiritual and celestial things, and therefore the medium 

35 

 
through  which  the  conjunction  of  heaven  and  earth  is  effected.  Enlightenment  is  when  the 
Word is read and perceived. (See AC 8694, 1775.)  

Scientifics.  

Scientifics are the facts of the Word, of nature and of experience, unorganized into ideas. Thus 
they are merely vessels which are capable of receiving truths or falsities. Without them we can 
have no ideas, and therefore neither intelligence nor wisdom. (See AC 9394, 9922, 3052.)  

Scortatory.  

By this term, which is peculiar to the Writings, is meant the love of adultery when it is such that 
adultery is not held to be sin, nor to be wrong and against reason, but allowable with reason. 
This  is  the  opposite  of  conjugial  love,  and  as  that  love  is  the  essence  of  heaven,  so  is  it  the 
essence of hell. (See CL 423.)  

Sensual. 

The sensual is the ultimate of the life of man's mind and it adheres to, and coheres with, the five 
bodily  senses.  It  is  the  lowest  of  the  three  planes  which  constitute  the  natural  degree  of  the 
mind, and is the obscure life animating the senses of the body that perishes when man dies. The 
man who lives only on this plane, believing only what he can see and touch, is sensual. (See TCR 
565; AC 10,236; HD 45; AC 7693.)  

Similitude.     

 This term occurs in the doctrine of conjugial love. It refers to likenesses of mind, both internal 
and external, which originate in connate inclinations modified by education, environment and 
the persuasions that have been imbibed. For those who properly desire conjugial love the Lord 
provides similitudes, in the  life after death if not in this world. The word has sometimes been 
thought of in the singular, and it has been supposed that a similitude is, in effect, a substitute 
partner  provided  for  one  whose  true  conjugial  partner  has  failed  to  regenerate.  This  idea  is 
based on the belief that conjugial pairs are created "one for one"; but there is no proof that they 
are so provided, the term is always used in the plural, and this idea of similitudes seems to be a 
mistaken one. (See CL 227-229.) 

Soul.  

Here we have a term to which several meanings are given in the Writings. In one usage, the soul 
is identical with the spirit of man which lives after death, and is therefore the love of the will and 
the  understanding  that  is  the  man  himself.  In  another,  the  term  refers  to  the  celestial  and 
spiritual  degrees  of  the  mind,  which  are  in  the  order  and  form  of  heaven  and  are  above 

36 

 
consciousness; and in yet another it is used of man in general and in particular of the truth of his 
faith and the good of his love. (See AC 6054; DP 199; DLW 395; CL 315. Cf. AC 7021.)  

Sphere.  

Every  human  being  is  encompassed  by  an  emanation  from  his  life's  love-a  characteristic 
influence  from  the  things  proper  to  it.  This  emanation  is  what  is  meant  in  the  Writings  by  a 
sphere.  It  is,  as  it  were,  an  extension  of  the  man  himself.  Undetectable  on  earth,  spiritual 
spheres  reveal  quality  in  the  other  world,  and  are  the  basis  of  conjunctions  and  disjunctions. 
(See CL 171.) 

Spiritual.  

This word occurs in many compound terms and phrases, but it always has reference to the love 
of truth for its own sake or for the sake of the good to which it leads. It is sometimes used as 
inclusive of everything that is below the Divine and above the natural. In all other instances it 
relates to faith and truth. According to the context it may refer to love toward the neighbor; the 
second heaven, which is in that love; the middle degree of the human mind, which receives the 
activity  of  the  second  heaven;  or  the  entire  human  race  after  the  Fall,  which  has  been 
regenerated by the influx of truth into the separated understanding and the implantation of a 
new will in that understanding. The compound term, spiritual-celestial, is used of affections of 
truth in which is the affection of good; and that part of the natural heaven which is the external 
of the spiritual kingdom, and which is in obedience or the good of faith, is called the spiritual-
natural heaven. (See AC 5639, 5238, 880, 4675.)  

State.  

State is predicated of life, love, wisdom, affections and joys, and in general of good and truth. 
These  are  all  substantial, and  by  states  are meant various  qualities  of  those  substances.  Note 
that states are always finite, in an gels as in men. (See AE 16; TCR 30.)  

Storge.  

This  is  a  universal  love  which  is  neither  good  nor  evil  but  becomes  one  or  the  other.  It  exists 
from  the  love  of  the  Lord  as  the  Father  and  of  the  inmost  heaven  as  a  mother  for  all  men; 
inflows by general influx from the Lord; is received by woman and transferred from her to man; 
and is aroused by the innocence of infancy. Under orderly conditions it ceases as children grow 
up in order that they may be free, but emerges again with the birth of grandchildren. (See TCR 
431.) 

37 

 
Substance.  

Meaning literally "to stand under," this term carries as well the idea of that from which there is 
subsistence. Thus the Divine is substance itself as that from which all things subsist; everything 
that stands under the spiritual sun and above the natural is spiritual substance; and everything 
under  the  sun  of  nature  is  natural  substance.  In  essence,  Divine  substance  is  love,  spiritual 
substance  is  conatus,  natural  substance  is  motion.  Spiritual  substance  is  both  organic  and  an 
essence,  existing  by  influx  from  the  Lord,  yet  inflowing  into  the  natural.  Spiritual  substance  is 
living  because  its  essence  is  love;  natural  substance  is  dead  because  its  essence  is  pure  fire, 
wherefore it does not originate anything, but reacts. (See TCR 52.)  

Temptation.  

As used in the Writings, this term does not mean an impulse to do wrong. It refers to an assault 
upon man's ruling love which tries and tests him-an inner conflict in which his free reaction both 
shows  and  builds  his  character.  According  to  the  quality  of  his  love,  temptation  is  celestial, 
spiritual or natural; in which last instance it is not really temptation, although it may prepare for 
it. Temptation, also, is as to intellectual and voluntary things, the latter being far more severe.  

(See AC 741, 847, 3927, 4249, 8567.) 

Truth.  

Knowledge  and  truth  are  not  synonymous.  Truth  is  defined  as  the  form  of  good  and  as  that 
which qualifies good. We may think of it also as power or law. All things that are done in both 
worlds are done by the power of truth. (See AC 2954; AE 136; DLW 411.)  

Understanding.  

The understanding is defined in the Writings as the sight  of the mind. One of the  two mental 
faculties with which man is endowed, it is that in which the will is unfolded and it is formed by 
the will. Note that the understanding does not lead the will; it only instructs it. Note also that 
only the spiritual man truly has understanding; in its place the natural man has fantasy. (See AC 
9165, 4985.)  

Use.  

Because of its importance in our vocabulary it is desirable that we free this term from a certain 
confusion  that  sometimes  surrounds  it.  We  commonly  speak  of  occupations,  actions  and 
services rendered as "uses," and indeed use the term as the New Church synonym for a job. 

While there  is value  in this as a recognition that there is more  to a  job than the work and its 
rewards,  it  should  be  understood that  these things  are  the  external means  by  which  uses  are 
ultimated;  and  that  although  uses  are  performed  through  these  ultimates,  they  are  in 

38 

 
themselves interior and distinct. Use is the unique personality, the individuality of thought and 
will  build  up  by  reception  of  love  from  the  Lord  which  a  man  puts  into  his  work  and  other 
activities and transfers to others by means of them. It is, therefore, the influence toward good 
which he exerts through his work, business or profession; which is not personal, but a transfer 
through  him  of  what  is  from  the  Lord.  Use  is,  then,  the  spiritual  effect  of  the  way  we  do our 
work. (See Wis. xi; CL 183.) 

Vastation.  

This  is  the  process,  carried  out  in  the world of  spirits,  whereby  the  external evils  and  falsities 
remaining  with  the  good  are  separated,  so  that  they  may  be  prepared  for  heaven,  and 
hypocritical goods and mere knowledges of truth are taken away from the evil in order that they 
may be made ready for hell. The latter is sometimes called devastation to distinguish it from the 
former. The church is said to be vastated when nothing of charity and faith remains in it. (See AC 
411, 2694, 7474.)  

Vessel.  

The idea expressed in this term as the Writings use it is fundamental to a true concept of man; 
for man is said to be a vessel which receives life from the Lord, and the term is therefore applied 
to the will and the understanding, the rational and the natural, and the forms of which they are 
composed. 

The idea is not that of a glass, a cup or a bowl into which liquid is poured, but that of an organic 
form  which  reacts  to  an  influx  impinging  upon  it-reacts  with  or  against  the  influx,  as  the  eye 
reacts to light or the ear to sound. When this is known, it can be understood how, although the 
Divine does not finite itself in proceeding as it does in creating, the reception of influx from the 
Divine is human and finite. (See AC 3318.) 

Will.  

Like the understanding, the will, which is the other faculty that constitutes the human mind, is a 
receptacle and a reactive organ. The will is that individualized reception of, and reaction to, love 
inflowing  from  the  Lord  which  makes  the  ruling  love  and  the  man  himself.  The  native  will  is 
unsalvable;  the  new  will  is  created  in  the  reformed  understanding  by  the  descent  into  it  of 
remains, which have been stored up for that purpose. (See AC 7342; DLW 403; TCR 570.)  

Wisdom.  

Here  is  a  term which  is  predicated only  of the  life. Wisdom  consists  in  perceiving,  willing  and 
doing truths from love, and it involves an appetite for good in truth. It is therefore distinct from 

39 

 
 
knowledge and intelligence, though they may lead to wisdom and are necessary for it. (See AC 
1555, 10,336.)  

Word.  

The Word is the Lord as to the Divine truth, the Divine truth proceeding through the heavens, 
and Divine revelation in the heavens and on earth. What the Divine has revealed is with us the 
Word.  For  us,  therefore,  the  term  is  inclusive  of  the  inspired  books  of  the  Old  and  New 
Testaments and the books written by the Lord through Emanuel Swedenborg which contain the 
Heavenly Doctrine. (See AC 8200, 10,127; Verbo 35.)  

Worship.  

Internal  worship,  which  is  worship  itself,  is  a  perpetual  activity  of  love  to  the  Lord.  External 
worship is the life of charity. Public and private worship is the life of piety, and rituals are the 
garments of worship. From this it may be seen that the term, which we hold in common with all 
other churches, has for us a very different meaning. From this it may be seen also that although 
rituals are necessary they are not the essentials of worship, and that, like garments, they may be 
changed and need not be the same for all. (See AE 325; AC 7884; AE 684, 696.)

Final Note: 
The above entries bring to a close this series of general definitions, publication of which as an occasional 
department began in January, 1961. It is emphasized again now, as it was then, that the definitions 
given are not offered as all-inclusive, exhaustive, or the only ones that could be valid. Definitions are not 
meant to confine our thinking to themselves, but to serve as a well marked point of departure from 
which we may proceed to infill the initial ideas they help us to form. Unless these things are realized, 
this attempt to explain the terms which make up our New Church vocabulary will not have succeeded.
