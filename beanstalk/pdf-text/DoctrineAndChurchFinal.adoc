Preface 
For many years Dr. Hugo Odhner’s series of ten lectures 
given  in  1944–1945  on  “Doctrine  and  the  Church”  has 
been used in the Academy of the New Church Theological 
School as part of the course “The Nature of Revelation.” 
Dr. Odhner saw these lectures as “a general precursor” to 
the entire course of study of the Word.

The  universal  theme  is  our  human  response  to  the 
Word’s teaching, to Divine “Doctrine”—hence the subtitle 
“Human  Response  to  Divine  Teaching”  (added  by  me). 
How are we to be the Lord’s “church” in the light of the 
conviction that this Divine Doctrine is now represented not 
only in the Old and New Testaments, but in the revelation 
given in the theological writings of Emanuel Swedenborg 
(aka “the Writings”)? How are we to respond to this united 
body  of  revelation?  How  are  we  to  approach  it  to  gain 
light and direction from the Lord? Dr. Odhner addresses 
many issues that arise as individuals and groups of people 
make  this  effort.  How  is  faith  formed  and  how  does  it 
progress with individuals and with the collective church? 
What is the role of the priesthood? What are the scope and 
limitations of human beings’ reception of a truth that is in 
itself Divine? 

More speciﬁ cally we ﬁ nd here a systematic effort to 
articulate the view of those who have believed that the Lord 
has made His second coming in and through the Writings, 
and that this revelation marks a new dispensation that will 
result in a new era of the church. Dr. Odhner explores the 
nature and purpose of the Writings, and their relationship 
to the Old and New Testaments. He deals with these issues 

 
x

and  more  with  his  characteristic  talent  for  documenting 
his understanding from the Word. 

In  articulating  the  general  position  of  the  historic 
Academy/General Church Dr. Odhner understandably has 
in  mind  the  contrast  with  other  views  of  the  theological 
Writings  of  Swedenborg.  A  doctrinal  controversy  that 
loomed large in Dr. Odhner’s experience was the one that 
led  to  the  secession  from  the  General  Church  of  “The 
Lord’s New Church which is Nova Heirosolyma.” Some 
have felt that Dr. Odhner’s “closeness” to this issue results 
in  a  belaboring  of  some  points,  particularly  in  chapter 
nine. 

These  notes  have  been  edited  very  slightly  over  the 
years by a long series of Theological School teachers. A 
few additional references have been added here and there. 
Occasionally a quotation has been expanded to provide a 
bit more context. Rarely a word or phrase has been added 
for  clarity.  I  have  reworked  one  paragraph  and  added  a 
brief  transitional  one.  In  general,  having  looked  at  the 
oldest version I could ﬁ nd, it would appear that “99.9%” 
of  the  present  work  is  Dr.  Odhner’s.  All  the  footnotes, 
however, are mine unless noted.

The  idea  of  publishing  Dr.  Odhner’s  study  came  to 
the General Church Publication Committee from a group 
of  lay  people  who  read  it  for  a  series  of  classes. As  the 
one  currently  teaching  the Theological  School  course  in 
which it is read, I agreed to help prepare it for publication. 
The language in this edition has been revised by Robert 
Gladish, Vera Glenn, and myself. Two areas of focus were 
making the language more gender inclusive and changing 
passive voice to active. 

In  adapting  this  book  and  offering  it  to  a  wider 
readership it is our hope that it will serve as an interesting 

xi

and useful historical document. But more, the hope is that 
it  will  inspire  new  commitment  in  people  who  share  a 
conviction that the Writings are part of the Word for the 
New Church, with the power to deﬁ ne and establish that 
church—a church in which the Lord can be present in a 
new  way  and  in  whose  streets  the  nations  will  walk  in 
harmony and light. 

And the Spirit and the bride say, “Come!” And let 
him who hears say, “Come!” And let him who thirsts 
come. And whoever desires, let him take the water 
of  life  freely.  .  .  .  He  who  testiﬁ es  to  these  things 
says,  “Surely  I  am  coming  quickly.” Amen.  Even 
so, come, Lord Jesus! (Revelation 22:17, 20)

== Chapter One

The Advent of the Lord—in Doctrine

The  preface  to  the  True  Christian  Religion  notes  that 

unless the Lord should come again into the world no 
one  could  be  saved,  and  that  this,  His  second  advent,  is 
His coming “in Divine truth, which is the Word” (n. 3).  
Later,  the  same  volume  states  that  this  second  coming 
“is  effected  by  means  of  a  man  before  whom  He  has 
manifested  Himself  in  Person,  and  whom  He  has  ﬁ lled 
with His Spirit, to teach the doctrines of the New Church 
through the Word from Him” (TCR 779).  This man was 
Emanuel Swedenborg, and he wrote that from the ﬁ rst day 
of his call he had not received anything which pertained 
to the doctrines of that church from any angel, but from 
the Lord alone while reading the Word.  These doctrines 
he received with his understanding, wrote them down and 
published them by the press.
  One of these published works was entitled The New 
Jerusalem and Its Heavenly Doctrine: From Things Heard 
out of Heaven.  In it he states that this doctrine is “for the 
New Church” and is called the Heavenly Doctrine because 
it was revealed to him out of heaven (HD 7).

It  is  clear  from  this  and  many  other  statements  that 
these  doctrines,  contained  in  Swedenborg’s  theological 
writings, both those printed during his lifetime and those 
left  in  manuscript  form,  were  the  means  by  which  the 
Lord  made  His  second  advent  “in  Divine  truth  which  is 
the Word.”  Swedenborg made this clear when, by express 

 
 
2

Doctrine and the Church

command of the Lord, he wrote on two copies of the Brief 
Exposition, “This book is the Advent of the Lord.”  Only 
common sense is needed to see that it was not the paper 
and print, but the truth contained in the book that was the 
Lord’s new advent.

That  His  coming  was  “in  Divine  truth  which  is  the 
Word,” is clear from the fact that the Doctrine—although 
received  by  Swedenborg  with  his  understanding—was 
inspired  by  the  Spirit  of  the  Lord,  and  obtained  while 
reading the Word.  Indeed, the Writings teach that “by the 
Holy Spirit, is properly meant the Divine truth, thus also 
the Word” (TCR 139).  The Holy Spirit is indeed the Lord 
Himself, or His Divine operation.  The Lord operates for 
a human being’s regeneration “by means of Divine truth, 
and with Christians by means of the Word; for this is the 
only medium through which man approaches the Lord and 
into which the Lord enters” (TCR 142).

It  was  therefore  the  Lord  as  the  Word,  or  as  the 
Holy  Spirit,  that  inspired  Swedenborg  in  his  writing  the 
Doctrine.  And another phase of the same teaching appears 
when it is said that this Doctrine “is from heaven because 
it is from the spiritual sense of the Word, and the spiritual 
sense of the Word is the same with the doctrine that is in 
heaven,” the Heavenly Doctrine (HD 7).

The  Lord  thus  made  His  advent  in  the Word  and  as 
Doctrine.  “As the Lord is the Word, He is also Doctrine; 
for there exists no other doctrine which is Divine doctrine” 
(AC  2533e).    We  cite  this  to  show  that  the  Word  is  the 
only  Divine  doctrine,  and  that  the  church  must  regard 
the Word as the only source of its faith.  The Word is the 
“doctrine of faith” for the church.  And we are told that 
although  in  its  origin,  and  thus  “in  itself,”  the  “doctrine 
of faith is Divine and thus above all human apprehension, 

 
 
 
Advent of the Lord

even angelic, nevertheless it has been stated in the Word 
according  to  the  apprehension  of  people  in  a  rational 
manner” (AC 2533:2).

The doctrine of faith thus exists within the Word, and 
in itself it is incomprehensible.  It is said to be “spiritual 
from  the  celestial  origin.”   And  the  Arcana  adds,  “Be  it 
known that it is Divine truth from Divine good, and thus 
wholly Divine” (AC 2531).  But in order that this Divine 
truth may become comprehensible to people here and to 
angels,  the  Lord  accommodates  it  to  human  reason,  as 
in  the  Word  which  is  on  earth  and  in  heaven.    He  does 
this  through  appearances,  rational,  natural,  and  sensual.  
“When truths Divine are with [angels and people] in such 
appearances, they can be both received and acknowledged” 
(AC 3362).  

The doctrinal things that are from the Lord—insofar as 
they appear before created beings—are not truths purely 
Divine, but are appearances of truth; nevertheless within 
such appearances there are the truths Divine; and because 
they have those truths within them, the appearances also 
are called truths. (AC 3364)

The Word—the written Word of Divine revelation—is 
therefore Divine doctrine clothed in appearances of truth; 
and this is true not only of the Word in the sense of the letter 
on earth, but of the angelic Word or the internal senses of 
the Word.  But it is to be observed that the Divine doctrine 
is present throughout all these forms of the Word and in 
all its appearances.  In every case, the Lord gave the Word 
to convey this doctrine, and it is in an order which is the 
Divine  order,  adapted  to  convey  the  Divine  presence  to 
various human states and indeed to mold or create human 

 
 
4

Doctrine and the Church

states which might receive the Divine doctrine of faith and 
charity.  Hence we read:

the Lord is doctrine itself, that is, the Word, not only as 
to the supreme sense therein, but also as to the internal 
sense, and even as to the literal sense, for this sense is 
representative  and  signiﬁ cative  of  the  internal  sense, 
and the internal sense is representative and signiﬁ cative 
of  the  supreme  sense;  and  that  which  in  the  Word  is 
representative  and  signiﬁ cative  is  in  its  essence  that 
which is represented and signiﬁ ed, thus it is the Divine 
of the Lord; for a representative is nothing but an image 
of him who is represented and is in an image the Lord 
Himself presented to view. (AC 3393, emphasis added)

Thus “the Word, even in the letter, is Divine” (AC 3393).
This being so, “Divine doctrine is also the Word in the 
literal sense in which the things that are in the world and 
upon earth are treated of.”  Doctrine proceeding from this 
sense contains within it the interior sense, and therefore is 
Divine (AC 3712).

§ § § § §

  We  have  cited  these  teachings  to  show  that  it  is  not 
the  external  style  or  form  of  the  biblical  books  which 
endow the Word with Divinity, nor the symbolic language 
which  the  sacred  writers  anciently  employed.    What 
makes  the  Word  Divine  is  the  presence  of  the  Divine 
Doctrine.    This  Divine  Doctrine,  being  inﬁ nite  and  in 
itself  incomprehensible,  has  to  be  accommodated  to  our 
apprehension, or expressed in terms of the human mind.  
In  the  Writings,  the  Divine  Doctrine  is  adapted  to  the 
rational mind in terms of abstract thought, in sequences of 
rational ideas couched in correspondent or ﬁ tting words, 

 
Need for the Heavenly Doctrine

5

and then illustrated by examples and comparisons for the 
sake of our simpler states.  The Writings are thus another 
accommodation of the Divine Doctrine, and the Lord, the 
only  Teacher,  in  this  His  second  advent,  stands  within 
them to instruct His church.

The Need for the Heavenly Doctrine

  All Divine revelations of the past were given for the 
sake of the regeneration of humankind.   In the case of the 
Writings  we  ﬁ nd,  however,  a  Divine  revelation  given  in 
so utterly different a form from that of the Hebrew Word 
and  the  Christian  Word,  that  many  who  have  accepted 
its  truth  still  hesitate  to  class  it  as  part  of  the  “Word  of 
God.”  Why were the Writings given in so singular a form, 
resembling  in  great  measure  the  dogmatic  literature  of 
modern Europe?  It is not sufﬁ cient to point out that every 
revelation has been written in the literary forms typical to 
its age and country.  There must be other reasons.

The Old and New Testaments were couched in legends, 
history,  laws,  poetry  and  prophetical  allegory,  and  in 
biography and parable.  And both utilized the language of 
sensual and natural correspondences.  The Old Testament 
makes an appeal from sensual beauty: we feel the breath 
of miraculous awe, the power of direct command; and in 
the Gospels we are stirred with moral emotion, and have 
the sense of the persuasive dignity of the Divine person 
of Jesus the Christ walking among us on earth.  But in the 
Writings these elements are largely absent.  Swedenborg 
might  have  been  a  poet  who  would  paint  visions  of 
heaven  with  persuasive  allure  and  carry  us  off  into 
states  of  ecstasy,  away  from  the  problems  and  concerns 
of  external  life.    Instead,  he  is  a  plodding  scientist  and 

 
6

Doctrine and the Church

a practical thinker, who records his spiritual experiences 
in unadorned narratives, who analyzes human states like 
a realistic physician, and who lists the elements of every 
doctrinal  point  with  patient  precision  and  circumstantial 
logic,  without  appealing  to  any  other  emotion  than  that 
love of truth which he expects in fair-minded readers.

If the biblical Word had been adequate to meet the 
needs  of  humankind,  the Writings  would  not  have  been 
needed.  But new states had arisen which were not met by the 
Old and New Testaments.  Falsities and evils had developed, 
against which the symbolic and correspondential truths of 
the Word provided no defense. The Word had become a 
closed  book  because  the  Christian  Church  had  become 
inﬂ uenced  by  people  who  were  in  a  love  of  dominion 
and a love of self. This caused false doctrines to obscure 
and pervert the meaning that had at ﬁ rst been seen in the 
Gospel. In addition, rational minds had turned against the 
Word and the teachings of its literal sense, attacking the 
symbolism  of  the Word  which  had  come  to  be  believed 
only as literal and factual truth.  Human reason, impressed 
by an expansion of scientiﬁ c knowledge about the natural 
world, began to reject the literal sense of the Scripture and 
with  it  the  authority  and  holiness  of  the  Scripture  itself.  
Through  many  centuries,  as  the  history  of  philosophy 
testiﬁ es,  faith  had  struggled  to  maintain  itself  against  a 
tide of growing unbelief, but human reason could furnish 
no  refuge  for  the  religious  thinker.    Religion  could  give 
comfort only to the fanatic, to the ignorant and the simple 
good,  to  the  mystically-minded  pietist,  or  to  the  blind 
believer and the satisﬁ ed literalists who shut their eyes to 
the  world’s  knowledge;  and  also  to  a  host  of  hypocrites 
and self-seekers, who found in religion a way to notoriety 
or fame or power or homage.

 
Form and Purpose of the Writings

7

  Here we ﬁ nd at least one reason why the Lord would 
give a new Revelation which was not written in parables 
but  would  speak  of  God  plainly,  as  promised  in  John: 
“The time is coming when I will no longer speak to you 
in parables” (16:25).  The Writings therefore address the 
rational  mind,  opening  the  correspondences  of  Scripture 
and stating in plain words the Divine Doctrine which had 
been hidden therein.

The Form and Purpose of the Writings

It  is  obvious  that  no  church  can  accept  as  Doctrine 
anything  which  it  cannot  know  or  discern.    No  church 
obtains,  or  ever  has  obtained,  doctrine  from  the  hidden 
sense which is in its sacred books.  It sees as authoritative 
doctrine the truths which are expressed in the words of its 
revelation (De Verbo 10:7).

It is true, of course, that in the Ancient Church, when 
the language of correspondences was known and currently 
used,  symbols  and  correspondences  often  conveyed  a 
clear meaning to people, as our poetic expressions do to 
us.  But since that time, the truths known to the Ancients 
became among things unknown.  Only a few general truths 
remained, and these appeared in the Hebrew Word openly 
stated,  and  became  available  as  doctrine  for  the  Jewish 
Church:

• the concept of one God, who was the Creator and 
the omnipotent Ruler of the world and its events

• the Ten Commandments
•  the  duty  of  worship  and  love  to  God,  and  of  love 

towards one’s neighbor
• the need of repentance
• vague hints of life after death

 
 
8

Doctrine and the Church

These were almost the only spiritual truths that the Jews 
could  discern  from  their  Scriptures;  everything  else  was 
hidden by a symbolism which they could not penetrate.

The  Christian  Church  also  obtained  from  the  New 
Testament  only  the  doctrines  given  in  its  literal  sense: 
teachings  concerning  charity  and  faith  and  Divine 
providence;  concerning  the  Lord  as  the  incarnate Word; 
and concerning the Son of God who was somehow a one 
with  the  Father.    The  Gospels  openly  expressed  moral 
ideas,  and  the  parables  of  the  Lord  suggested  a  deeper 
wisdom  present  in  His  teachings  than  humans  could  at 
once  understand.    Still,  Christians  were  not  expected  to 
penetrate  with  their  understanding  to  the  spiritual  sense 
itself,  but  only  to  reach  the  truths  which  a  careful  and 
prayerful study of the various open teachings of the Gospel 
texts  brought  into  focus.    They  knew  that  very  many 
things in their Testament were not to be taken literally, but 
were to be understood in the light and spirit of the clearer 
passages.

It  was,  however,  different,  when  they  read  the  Old 
Testament.  In it they could recognize a prophetical sense, 
and they could see that it was full of types and symbols 
which preﬁ gured the life of the Lord and the establishment 
of  a  spiritual  Israel  and  a  new  Jerusalem  above.    While 
on  earth  the  Lord  opened  the  Jewish  Scriptures  to  His 
disciples,  and  revealed  certain  interior  truths  which  had 
formerly been hidden in the Law and the Prophets, so that 
those interior truths might serve the Christian for doctrine 
and for life (AE 641).

Let  us  note,  however,  that  the  internal  progress  of 
Christians, their normal growth in spiritual knowledge, was 
to be accomplished ﬁ rst through the open doctrines given 
in the New Testament, and second, through the seeing of 

 
 
 
Form and Purpose of the Writings

an interior sense in the Old Testament when the symbolism 
of  these  ancient  Scriptures  was  viewed  in  the  light  of 
Christian doctrine.  There need have been no end to the 
spiritual progress which Christians could have maintained 
by this mode.  But it was not to be accomplished through 
any discovery of a mystical sense in their own Gospels.  
When they attempted this, heresies arose which distorted 
the Christian doctrine.
  And at the end of the Christian dispensation, the Lord 
came  again  and  revealed  the  interiors  of  the  Word  and 
worship of the past churches so that these interiors might 
serve the New Church for doctrine and for life (AE 641, 
670).  The truths of this new Doctrine—hitherto hidden in 
the Old and New Testaments—are said to be “still more 
interior  Divine  truths”  than  the  things  revealed  for  the 
Christian Church, so that “people can now become wiser” 
(AE 948:2, 641e).  The New Church, from its revelation, 
receives  the  arcana  of  heaven  and  of  the  church  and  of 
the Word “revealed” or “disclosed” and presented not as 
“a sense merely natural, in which the spiritual sense lies 
concealed,” as in the Old and New Testament, which the 
Writings  call  “the Word  of  the  letter,”  but  as  “a  natural 
sense from the spiritual, which is called the internal sense, 
also  the  spiritual-natural  sense”  (AE  1061,  emphasis 
added).  The Divine purpose for the Writings’ being written 
in a doctrinal style seems therefore to be, not to provide us 
with another literal sense or a “letter” of the Word (which 
we  already  possess),  but  to  convey  to  the  rational  mind 
directly and clearly the Doctrine of heaven hidden in the 
Scriptures.
  Children  and  immature  minds  cannot  receive  the 
Writings rationally.  They can delight in the Memorabilia 
and obtain useful ideas from the doctrines and be inspired

Doctrine and the Church

to  understand  more.    But  the  Writings  are  addressed  to 
an  adult  state.   And  what  adults  who  afﬁ rmatively  read 
the  Writings  see  is  a  luminous  system  of  truths  which 
stand forth as a consistent doctrine that seems to explain 
the nature of all past revelations and gives them meaning 
and  holiness,  sheds  light  upon  the  problems  of  life,  and 
reveals  God  as  the  Divine  Human.    This  body  of  clear 
truth gives us rational peace and intellectual satisfaction, 
uplifts our thought and stirs our inmost affections, so that 
we recognize it as a rational doctrine of Divine origin—
revealed, not thought out by mortals.

Those who are born and reared within the New Church 
may  have  some  difﬁ culty  in  seeing  the  Writings  in  as 
distinct a perspective, because they may not have realized 
the  deﬁ ciencies  of  the  world  or  the  helpless  spiritual 
condition of those who do not have this Doctrine.

For let us realize that while the those of the church—
in  their  various  states—may  know  their  evils  and  are 
given  the  means  progressively  to  struggle  against  them, 
the world outside welters in evils which are unrecognized 
and  are  progressively  destructive.    The  worldly-minded 
can scarcely see any real purpose in creation or in human 
life.    They  may  know  nothing  but  irrational  doctrines 
which  offer  a  slim  hope  of  salvation  to  those  who  hold 
their  understanding  captive  to  formulas  and  phrases  or 
to the ritual demands of various churches.  They may—
from  ignorance  and  hopeless  weakness—have  become 
immersed in follies and evils of life.  They may be driven 
to  desperation  by  a  fear  of  damnation,  or  be  depressed 
by  an  utter  ignorance  of  what  may  come  after  death.  
Stiﬂ ed  by  the  stultifying  evasions  and  worse  hypocrisy 
of the churches, they may drift into idle speculations and 
phantasies—seeking  an  outlet  of  their  inner  longings  in 

 
 
Form and Purpose of the Writings

11

séances  or  the  vaporings  of  mystical  movements.   They 
may grow indifferent to religion and, beginning to doubt 
the Word and the very existence of God, turn to science as 
the only hope of humans, who, they feel, are kindred of the 
beasts.  They may take recourse in a proud sophistication, 
as cynical onlookers.  Or they may persuade themselves, 
as many others do, that they are sparks of the Divine life 
and need but shut their eyes on evil, glorying in their own 
inner purity!

Such  people,  if  the  bounds  of  their  habits  could  be 
broken and if willing to follow the call of the love of truth, 
might see in the Writings the glorious fulﬁ llment of a hope 
which they had hardly dared to harbor.

The Bible which was lost, would be found, the proofs of 
its Divinity disclosed by the revelation of its internal sense 
and by the fact of the consistent law of correspondences!

The mystery of the Godhead resolved into the simple 
truth that in the Lord Jesus Christ is the Trine of Father, 
Son, and Holy Spirit—even as Soul, Body, and Operations 
exists as a trine of essentials in humans, God’s image!

The essence of God seen as Divinely Human—Love 
itself and Wisdom itself, Source of all life, of all creation, 
and of all good and truth!
  Regeneration recognized, not as a moment of emotion 
or as a magical act of ritual, but as a reorganization of the 
natural mind around the love of the Lord, a process open to 
all!  Faith, not founded blindly on mystery, but on a seeing 
of truths, would release the reason from its bondage under 
the dictates of popes or councils!
  Mortals, not the prey of a cruel Divine predestination 
but  responsible  and  free,  and  protected  by  a  Divine 
government of ordered laws, a government which extends 
its mercy even over the hells!

 
 
 
 
12

Doctrine and the Church

  Heaven—not a dream-like vision or a vain hope, nor a 
place on earth or in the sky!  But a state of blessed purpose 
and  active  social  uses  in  a  spiritual  world  of  substantial 
and objective reality, unhampered by the bonds of space 
and time.

The last judgment—not the end of the material world, 
but a normal crisis in the spiritual evolution of the spirit 
after  death,  for  the  preservation  of  human  freedom  and 
for  the  maintenance  of  spiritual  progress  for  angels  and 
people on earth!

Science—not  discarded  as  the  devil’s  own  tool  nor 
exalted as the panacea for all human ills!  But restored as 
one of the foundations of truth, along with the symbolic 
and representative truth in the Word of God!
  Human uses, however humble, digniﬁ ed as the ﬁ elds 
of human regeneration!  And, in their complex, rising by 
degrees into discrete forms of society which ﬁ nally—in a 
spiritual view—form the Grand Man, the eternal kingdom 
of uses which is the City and Bride of God!
  And  lastly,  the  assurance  of  a  Doctrine  not  made 
by  short-sighted  humankind,  but  one  which  comes  with 
Divine  authority  and  is  so  full  of  truths  that  eternity 
would not sufﬁ ce to exhaust its many facets and its new 
applications!

§ § § § §

  Only truth in the form of rational doctrine could bring 
about the reestablishment of faith on a lasting foundation.  
We  must  recognize  the  Doctrine  of  faith  as  the  Lord’s 
unchanging  way  to  our  salvation,  and  come  to  love  that 
way.    The  fallen  and  broken  canons  (or  pillars)  of  faith 
can  be  reestablished  only  through  the  “self-evidencing 
reason  of  love”  (Canons,  Preface)—and  the  love  which 

 
 
Form and Purpose of the Writings

13

is displayed and recognized in the Doctrine is the Lord’s 
Divine love, which shines through all His provisions, as is 
manifest to those who have a love of truth.

The doctrinal form of the Writings serves to discourage 
many, save those who love truth for its own sake.  It helps to 
protect us from all manner of spirits who seek to stimulate 
in  us  various  sentiments  and  emotions  which  produce 
phantasies  in  religious  thought,  especially  the  phantasy 
that a person is led by the Holy Spirit.  When Christians, 
and  especially  preachers,  come  into  the  other  life,  they 
are  promptly  warned  against  “enthusiastic  spirits,”  who 
insinuate the wild fancy that they themselves are the Holy 
Spirit. This happens

because many of the church, who in the world believed 
that the Holy Spirit spoke through them, terrify others by 
the words of the Lord in Matthew, that to speak against 
those things which the Holy Spirit inspired into them, is 
an unpardonable sin. (TCR 138)

Some clergymen indeed believe that they are inspired 
when they speak from zeal, and that they can even “feel 
the inﬂ ux” of the Holy Spirit. And some say that no good 
works  are  matters  of  charity  unless  a  person  at  the  time 
feels the operation of the Holy Spirit and “from perception 
of  this  operation,  does  good”  (TCR  146;  SE  6104). The 
Doctrine therefore adds:

But  they  should  be  very  cautious  how  they  persuade 
themselves  that  this  zeal  .  .  .  is  the  Divine  operation 
in their hearts; for a similar, and even a warmer zeal is 
excited  in  the  breasts  of  enthusiasts  and  also  in  those 
who are in extremely false ideas of doctrine. . . . For zeal, 
viewed in itself, is a violent heating of the natural man 
. . ., [and when this zeal is from infernal love, as in many 

 
 
14

Doctrine and the Church

cases,] they shout the more vehemently and fetch deeper 
sighs from their breasts, than those who are in zeal from 
heavenly love. (TCR 146)

  Reliance  upon  doctrine  is  a  protection  against  such 
emotional  states  which  upset  the  rational  mind.    It  is 
interesting  to  note  that  the  Quakers,  who  place  much 
importance  in  “the  immediate  personal  teaching  of  the 
Holy Spirit, or ‘Light Within’ or ‘Inner Light,’” have no 
ﬁ xed doctrine.

For  doctrine  necessarily  checks  our  vagaries  of 
thought  and  limits  mystical  tendencies.    On  the  other 
hand, this tendency had no sure check in the Ancient and 
Christian  Churches,  in  that  the  Old  Testament  and  the 
New both abounded in symbolic language and prophecy 
which were not in the form of open doctrine, and which 
therefore invited endless speculation and many claims to 
a mystical insight into their hidden meaning.  And so far 
as the original true Christian doctrine lost its power, the 
way was therefore opened to a quagmire of emotional and 
enthusiastic  movements—as  many  as  are  the  cupidities 
of human vanity and the ambitions of selﬁ sh loves.  Paul 
warned  against  this  when  he  wrote:  “I  had  rather  speak 
ﬁ ve  words  with  my  understanding  than  ten  thousand 
words in an unknown tongue!”  (I Cor 14:19)  And John 
warned, “Believe not every spirit” (I John 4:1).  Yet into 
the  web  of  Christian  Church-life  there  entered  mystical 
persuasions  without  number—Gnostics,  Docetists, 
ascetics and celibates; quietists and Quakers, pietists and 
religious brooders, spiritists and Christian Scientists—all 
of whose reliance on the Word was sacriﬁ ced to a reliance 
on  the  perceptions  and  persuasive  visions  supposedly 
given to the devout person from within and by the “Holy 
Spirit.”  And even the most doctrinaire church of all—the 

 
Form and Purpose of the Writings

15

Roman  Catholic—places  ﬁ nal  authority  not  in  the  Bible 
but in tradition which, it claims, is the deciding voice of 
the Holy Spirit in the church and is formulated by popes 
and councils.

§ § § § §

The New Church cannot be founded on ﬁ ckle human 
states, or on what anyone from particular loves and fancies 
sees  in  the  Writings.    It  is  the  Writings  as  a  spiritual 
whole,  unalloyed  by  human  interpretations,  which  must 
be  accepted  if  we  are  to  receive  the  Lord  in  His  second 
advent as the Divine Doctrine.

== Chapter Two

The Acknowledgement of the Lord 
in His Second Advent

When afﬁ rmative readers of the Writings have grasped 

the extent and universality of the principles presented 
in those pages, their minds are confronted by something 
which  appears  as  a  miracle.    For  they  recognize  that  no 
one, however intelligent, could in a brief lifetime and with 
limited knowledge produce out of reasonings a system of 
doctrine which not only has an internal coherence, being 
perfectly consistent, but which also is a key that unlocks 
the  arcana  of  the  prophetic  Word  and  opens  the  doors 
upon  a  new  understanding  of  history,  of  philosophy,  of 
science, and of life itself.  It strikes readers—unless their 
prejudices  are  incurable—that  Swedenborg  must  indeed 
be  credited  when  he  repeatedly  disowns  the  authorship 
of  these Writings,  and  states  that  he  received  nothing  of 
the doctrine of the New Church from any angel but from 
the Lord alone by inspiration.  “No spirit has dared, nor 
has  any  angel  wished,”  he  wrote,  “to  tell  me  anything, 
still less to instruct me, about what is in the Word.  I have 
been taught by the Lord alone” (DP 135; see also AR Pref; 
TCR 779; De Verbo13:2).  “What has come from the Lord 
has been written, and what has come from angels has not 
been written” (AE 1183).  “They are not my works, but the 
Lord’s” (SE 6101).

 
  
18

Doctrine and the Church

If  we  do  not  accept  this  testimony  of  the  revelator 
concerning the nature of his Writings, we have no alternative 
other than to regard him either as a deliberate deceiver or 
as a dupe of evil spirits—an insane and disordered mind.  
But even the skeptics have failed to point out any mental 
disease which has clarity of rational thought and integrity 
of  character  and  a  tremendous  working-capacity  as  its 
symptoms!

Swedenborg’s  inspiration  was  obviously  different 
from  that  of  the  ancient  prophets,  although  he  was  on 
certain  occasions  permitted  to  experience  their  state.    It 
is notable that he claims for the Scriptural Word a verbal 
inspiration,  and  states  that  the  prophets,  who  wrote  in 
mere correspondences, received a verbal dictation.  As to 
his own Writings, he clearly describes a dictation of the 
spiritual sense into his rational mind—and a reception of 
the Divinely given Doctrine in his understanding; but he 
makes  no  claim  of  verbal  infallibility,  but  simply  of  the 
Divinity of the Doctrine.
  Yet  he  speaks  of  the  revelation  or  disclosure  of  the 
spiritual  sense  by  the  Lord  through  him  as  “excelling 
(praestat) all the revelations that have hitherto been made 
since the creation of the world,” because that sense is the 
very sanctuary of the Word (Inv 44).  For the Lord is in the 
spiritual sense with His Divine, while He is in the natural 
sense with His Human.
  Nor  was  the  New  Church  to  be  established  through 
miracles, which tend to compel.  Still the manifestation of 
the Lord to Swedenborg and his consequent introduction 
into the spiritual world as to spirit, sense, and life—so that 
he was granted to be in natural and spiritual light at the 
same  time—surpasses  all  miracles.    No  such  complete 

 
 
Aknowledgement of His Second Coming

19

interaction was ever before granted to a mortal, not even 
in the golden age (Inv 43, 52)!
  One  who  receives  the  Writings  must  come  to 
acknowledge the further truth stressed in them: the Lord, 
through  and  in  the  Doctrines,  has  fulﬁ lled  the  prophecy 
and  promise  of  His  second  advent.    For  the  Lord—
whenever He comes to the church—comes as Teacher, as 
Divine  Truth.    Only  as  truth  can  He  actually  enter  into 
a person more intimately than by any personal presence.  
It  might  seem  a  marvelous  miracle  to  Christians,  if  the 
Lord  in  Person  would  appear  some  day  in  the  sky  amid 
the clouds, and set aside all the laws of nature, rousing the 
dead from their graves!  But how far more glorious is His 
real second advent—as Divine Truth breaking forth from 
the  clouds  of  misunderstanding  and  fallacy  which  have 
alienated people from the Word and from heaven!  This 
is the spiritual advent such as He Himself promised when 
He spoke of the “Spirit of truth” who should teach us all 
things and speak no more in proverbs but would guide us 
into all truth, adding: “I will not leave you orphans; I will 
come to you” (John 14:18).  That would be a revelation of 
His Spirit, of His Mind; not only of His Person.  It would 
make clear the laws and reasons behind His government 
of  the  world  and  His  modes  of  salvation,  as  well  as  the 
ends of His creation and the goals of human life.  This real 
advent  was  to  be  a  revelation  of  Jesus  Christ,  the  God-
Man, the Divine Human, so that God could at last be made 
comprehensible  to  people’s  rational  minds.    Its  purpose 
was not to add to the mysteries of religion, but to disperse 
doubts and reconcile discrepancies.

Doctrine and the Church

Nature of the Truths of the Writings

  When we thus come to see in the Writings the Lord 
Himself  coming  again  to  His  church,  and  are  moved  by 
the conviction that it is the Lord who speaks in them from 
His Divine to teach His church we need to go further and 
attempt to realize what kind of authority is here implied 
and what kind of truth is here offered.  When we accept 
the  Writings,  we  accept  them  as  a  whole.    We  accept 
them—not  for  what  we,  for  private  reasons,  might  wish 
them to be, but—for what  they claim to  be.   We  cannot 
claim for them anything less or anything more.  If there 
are qualiﬁ cations, it must be the qualiﬁ cations they make 
for themselves.  If we are not ready to listen to their own 
claims  and  qualiﬁ cations,  we  cannot  justly  be  said  to 
accept them.  Whatever divergences there may be, as to 
the nature of the Writings, between different individuals 
and between different general bodies of the New Church, 
there  does  not  exist  anywhere  any  criterion  by  which 
the merit of any of these views can be primarily judged, 
except  the  actual  and  plain  statements  of  Swedenborg.  
And  whatever  goes  beyond  this—unless  it  contradicts 
these  statements—is  a  conclusion  of  the  rational  mind, 
enlightened  or  unenlightened,  and  thus  rests  on  human 
rather than Divine authority.  If it actually contradicts the 
various statements of the Writings, it should be regarded 
with doubt.

This  is  what  I  understand  to  be  the  general  position 
of  “the  Academy”1  in  its  battle  for  the  authority  of  the 

1 The “Academy” refers to a movement among nineteenth-century 
readers of the Writings who wished to stress the Divine authority of 
those works.  Some of those believers ultimately formed a separate 
organization of the New Church.

 
Nature of Truths of the Writings

21

Writings.  The Academy did not rest its position on any 
one  isolated  phrase  or  passage  from  the  Writings—for 
it is thus that heresies arise.  Such “literalism” would be 
unfair even in judging the meaning of some human author.  
Every  rational  person,  from  a  sense  of  justice,  is  averse 
to a merely literalistic interpretation of anyone’s speech.  
Fairness also dictates that we cannot “read into” anyone’s 
words something that is not said or clearly implied.  This, 
equally, would be a misinterpretation which is contrary to 
equity, or perhaps a misrepresentation, which is contrary 
to  charity  and  to  the  love  of  truth.    And  the  ﬁ rst  thing 
needed  for  the  interpretation  of  anyone’s  meaning  is  an 
attitude  of  charity.   The Academy’s  position  therefore—
that “one truth does not make a doctrine”—was to collect 
all the statements of the Writings concerning themselves, 
so that they could be compared and reﬂ ected on, and each 
be viewed in the light of all the others, as well as in their 
own original context or series, where other truths qualify 
them and explain their intended meaning.

The general nature of the truth that the Writings convey 
should be seen from the preface to the little treatise on The 
Lord (De Domino), which opens as follows:

A  revelation  has  been  made  by  the  Lord  concerning 
Heaven and Hell, concerning the Last Judgment which 
has  been  accomplished,  concerning  the  Spiritual  Sense 
of the Word; thus has been revealed the way to salvation, 
and what concerns the state of man after death; and this 
has been done fully and manifestly (plene et manifeste), 
so that any one who understands the Latin language can 
know.  All this was done and published a year ago.  But 
still the church does not care for this.

 
22

Doctrine and the Church

In  commenting  upon  the  words  in  the  Apocalypse, 
“Happy is he that keeps the words of the prophecy of this 
book,” Swedenborg was inspired to point out that although 
John  was  told,  “Seal  not  the  words  of  the  prophecy  of 
this  book,”  yet  there  are  few  things  there  that  could  be 
kept, since it was a sealed or closed book not understood.  
But  he  also  noted  that  they  are  happy  who  observe  and 
do  the  truths  or  precepts  of  doctrine  now  “opened”  and 
“manifested”  in  the  giving  of  the  spiritual  sense  of  this 
book, and that this opening was necessary at the end of the 
church that any might be saved (AR 944-947).
  And in the preface to the Brief Exposition, Swedenborg 
says:

Several works and tracts having been published by me, 
during some years past, concerning the New Jerusalem, 
by which is meant the New Church about to be established 
by the Lord; and the Apocalypse having been revealed, I 
have come to a determination to bring to light the entire 
doctrine of that church in its fullness.  But, as this is a 
work of some years, I have thought it advisable to draw 
up some sketch thereof, in order that a general idea may 
ﬁ rst be formed of that church and its doctrine; because 
when  general  principles  precede,  each  and  everything 
will afterwards appear extant in its breadth in light, for 
these enter into generals, as things homogenous into their 
receptacles.

Throughout, the Writings claim that the spiritual sense 
of the Scriptures is “disclosed” or “revealed,” and this for 
the ﬁ rst time and for the New Church (AC title, 3398:4; 
HH 1; LJ 73; AE 260:2, 957, 641:3, 948; AR 1; TCR 508, 
669).  Similarly, the doctrines of the New Church are said 
to be “continuous verities disclosed by the Lord through 

 
 
Nature of Truths of the Writings

23

the Word,” and “conﬁ rmations of them by rational things 
cause  the  understanding  to  be  opened  above  more  and 
more, and thus to be elevated into the light in which the 
angels of heaven are. . . . Wherefore it is now lawful to enter 
intellectually into the mysteries of faith” (TCR 508:5, 3).
  All this indicates that the Writings are for the instruction 
of our understandings—written in plain language which is 
directly addressed to the rational mind.

They  further  teach  that  Swedenborg  received  the 
spiritual sense by dictation.  “The internal sense,” he wrote, 
“has been dictated to me from heaven” (AC 6597e).  Yet 
it appears that it was not dictated as it was to the prophets, 
word  for  word  (cp.  SE  6062),  but  was  a  dictation  into 
the  understanding—as  an  inﬂ ux  of  enlightenment.    Nor 
was it a dictation by angels or spirits, but from the Lord.  
Swedenborg thus formulated the spiritual sense which is 
known and drawn out by the angels of heaven, formulated 
in doctrinal language, which he refers to as “the internal 
sense.”  He heads the expositions in the Arcana and other 
explanations of Scripture as “The Internal Sense” or “The 
Spiritual Sense.”  Although all the books of the Scriptural 
Word  were  not  expounded  verse  by  verse,  Swedenborg 
states  simply  that  “the  spiritual  sense  of  the  Word  has 
now been disclosed” (LJ 73), and this because the whole 
Doctrine of the New Heaven and the New Church has been 
revealed, and the means provided for seeing this Doctrine 
in the Word everywhere.
  After making certain summaries of the internal sense 
from  the  prophecy  of  Ezekiel,  Swedenborg  makes  the 
remarkable observation: “These summaries have also been 
collated with the Word in heaven, and are in conformity 
with  it”  (SS  97).   As  we  know,  in  heaven  it  is  only  the 
spiritual sense that is seen in the Word there.   The Arcana 

 
24

Doctrine and the Church

passage already cited teaches that the “Heavenly Doctrine” 
delivered in one of Swedenborg’s books is “for the New 
Church,” and is from the spiritual sense of the Word, and 
this sense “is the same with the doctrine that is in heaven” 
(HD 7).
  Yet  it  also  says  that  while  in  the  world  we  cannot 
comprehend  the  kind  or  degree  of  thought  which  the 
angels enjoy.  “Sometimes” Swedenborg was allowed, by 
a miraculous elevation of state, to hear the higher angels 
conversing among themselves, and then he “heard things 
unutterable and inexpressible.”  

Sometimes I was let into the perception and understanding 
of the subjects they were conversing upon [which were 
full  of  arcana  about  the  Lord,  redemption,  providence 
and regeneration] after which I was given to understand 
that I could not utter nor describe them by any spiritual or 
celestial expression, but that nevertheless they could be 
described even to a rational comprehension of them by 
words of natural language.  And it was told me that there 
are not any Divine arcana which may not be perceived 
and  even  expressed  also  naturally,  although  in  a  more 
general and imperfect way. (De Verbo 3:4)

It was therefore not impossible for the spiritual sense 
to  be  revealed  on  earth.    The  quintessence  and  elusive 
fragrance  and  profounder  depths  of  angelic  wisdom  and 
thought could not of course be conveyed in blunt Latin.  
But  the  doctrine  of  heaven  in  its  general  form  could  be 
expressed  in  human  words  quite  understandable  by  any 
rational  person,  and  the  general  subject  matter  of  the 
internal sense of the Scripture could be disclosed so that 
people might see their own conscious states in the light of 
heavenly  principles  which  allow  of  the  widest  practical 

 
Nature of Truths of the Writings

25

application.  Indeed, the maxims of angelic wisdom, the 
general laws of spiritual life and of the spiritual world, could 
be stated to our full comprehension of their signiﬁ cance.  
And  if,  from  an  affection  for  truth,  we  perceive  such 
heavenly truths naturally with our rational understanding, 
we may—the teaching adds—perceive and express after 
death the same things by a spiritual or a celestial mode.  

For  one  Divine  truth  naturally  perceived  and  loved,  is 
like  a  crystal  or  porcelain  vessel,  which  is  afterwards 
ﬁ lled with wine, and with such wine as was the quality of 
truth, and as it were of such a taste as was their affection 
for truth. (De Verbo 3:4)

The  “vessel”  referred  to  is  rational  truth,  which  is 
abstract  and  largely  devoid  of  sensual  imagery  or  of 
notions  of  space  and  time.    The  Writings  employ  many 
terms  of  philosophical  thought,  and  their  language 
endeavors  to  lead  us  away  from  mere  symbolism.    The 
distinction  which  Apocalypse  Explained    n.  1061  draws 
between the “merely literal sense” of the Scripture and the 
revealed explanation of Swedenborg which constitutes “a 
natural  sense  from  the  spiritual”  or  an  “internal  sense,” 
is  the  distinction  between  representative  truth  in  which 
the heavenly doctrine lies concealed and rational truth by 
which the heavenly doctrine is disclosed.
  Where, then, does the “authority” of the Writings lie?
First of all, it must be an authority that is above our 
own personal or group opinions.  An authority is something 
to  which  one  refers  with  deference,  something  outside 
ourselves  by  which  our  own  thoughts  must  be  judged 
continually—a ﬁ nal court of appeal.

Into its verdicts we must not read alien things which 
we desire to see in them, so that they may favor things to 

 
 
 
26

Doctrine and the Church

which we incline.  And since all people are prone to do 
this,  our  concepts  of  the  teachings  of  the Writings  must 
continually be modiﬁ ed and corrected by new truths and 
restatements of familiar truths which we encounter.

Secondly, the authority of the Writings stands whether 
we understand much or little of their teachings.  Yet as to 
ourselves, the Doctrines would have little authority over 
our minds if we were ignorant of their contents.  It would 
be as if we were willing to obey the Lord, but did not know 
what He wanted us to do.  To accept the Divine authority 
of the Writings, yet make no effort to read them and ﬁ nd 
their meaning, is therefore an anomaly.  On the other hand, 
if fallacies and even falsities enter into our understanding 
of the Writings, their authority is also rendered ineffective 
or annulled, even if the Lord should forgive us our errors 
so long as they do not conﬁ rm us in our evils.
  Whatever our states, the Writings remain a center of 
reference  in  the  Church.   Those  who  acknowledge  their 
Divine  authorship  will  be  in  the  “afﬁ rmative  principle,” 
the essence of which is to believe that their doctrine is true 
“because  the  Lord  has  said  so”  (AC  2568,  2588).    This 
opens the mind to receive the Holy Spirit which inspired 
these  doctrines  and  which  dwells  in  them  and  proceeds 
from them in the form of Divine truth.  This afﬁ rmative 
principle  inculcates  humility,  modesty;  it  breaks  down 
some of the pride of our self intelligence.  What we come 
to see and understand will increase our vision of the Lord, 
but the authority will still lodge, not in the things we know, 
but in the Writings themselves.

It  is  curious  how  in  past  ages  Divine  authority  has 
been  misplaced.    Among  the  Jews  and  Christians,  the 
Divine  authority  ascribed  to  Scripture  was  turned  to 
defend  as  a  scientiﬁ c  fact  that  Eve  was  formed  out  of  a 

 
 
Nature of Truths of the Writings

27

bone taken from Adam’s side, and that the earth was ﬂ at 
and had four corners.  Among Catholics, the authority of 
Councils and papal edicts derived from the idea that the 
Holy Spirit spoke through the Church as well as through 
the Word, and that the Word was indeed a dead letter which 
could be interpreted only by the Holy Spirit thus voiced 
(see AR 742e).
  By  the  placing  of  authority  in  the  appearances  or 
symbolic  expressions  of  Scripture,  the  authority  of  the 
doctrine of charity and faith was actually lost.  Doctrine was 
gradually  elaborated  out  of  correspondential  expressions 
and symbols, rather than from naked truths, and the result 
was a medley of heresies.

In the New Church, we do not anticipate such dangers 
to the same degree, although parallels exist.  The Writings 
formulate their Doctrine so plainly that it would seem to 
be difﬁ cult to evade the authority of their clear statements.  
Yet, it is remarkable that—by considerable labor—it can 
be done.  Charles Augustus Tulk did it when he interpreted 
the  Writings  through  the  philosophy  of  Idealism,  which 
denies  the  existence  of  a  material  world,  claiming  that 
world  to  be  a  projection  of  our  thoughts.   Thomas  Lake 
Harris did it when he simply claimed a further revelation—
one of celestial truths—which was to amend and elaborate 
Swedenborg’s  doctrines.    In  each  case—and  there  have 
been  many—the  Writings  have  been  approached  with 
a  prejudice,  an  interpretative  theory,  and  have  not  been 
allowed to speak for themselves.

In every age or generation, the principle of the Divine 
authority  of  the  Writings  needs  to  be  restated,  so  that  it 
may  not  become  vulnerable  to  subtle  attacks  and  gross 
misunderstandings,  and  thus  become  of  no  effect.    The 
Writings,  in  testifying  about  themselves  in  their  relation 

 
 
28

Doctrine and the Church

to  the  New  Church,  do  not  actually  use  the  expression 
“authority.”  The term implies the respect of the Church 
for  its  Divine  Doctrine,  but  it  tends  to  emphasize  the 
necessity of discipline and judgment, rather than of love 
and enlightenment.  It is in times of doubt and temptation, 
of  struggle  against  infesting  falsities,  that  we  go  to  the 
Writings as an authority and lean upon the strength of their 
very statements.  
  But these Writings are more than an authority.  They 
are a source for light and of love.  In the Old Testament, 
Jehovah spoke to the Jews in tones of command, demanding 
obedience, and there He still speaks to us in the same tone 
of authority.  In the Writings, the Lord is seen in His Divine 
Human, allowing us to cooperate with the ends and laws 
of His creation—the ends of the Divine love and wisdom.  
He  points  to  uses  of  charity  and  to  the  road  to  heaven; 
He also gives us to realize the miseries and the insanities 
of  the  hells.   Always  He  appeals  to  our  reason,  offering 
enlightenment, but stressing our freedom.  He speaks to us 
not as children, but as men and women.  And to those who 
receive His Divine truth in doctrine and in life, He speaks 
graciously, as if in fulﬁ llment of His promise: “No longer 
do I call you servants, for a servant does not know what 
his master is doing; but I have called you friends, for all 
things that I heard from My Father I have made known to 
you” (John 15:15; AE 409:10; AC 51:2).

§ § § § §

  We  have  attempted  to  point  out  that  the  Writings 
address us with doctrines which give interior Divine truths 
from  the  spiritual  sense  of  the  Scripture  in  a  complete 
and manifest form, without any other veiling than that of 
ordinary human language and the terms of rational thought.  

Nature of Truths of the Writings

29

The Writings, like the Scriptures, were expressed in words 
which  are  printed  as  objects  before  the  sight—as  letters 
and sentences.  But it is notable how very differently such 
objects  or  letters  and  words  can  be  understood,  even  in 
human literature.  It is the order among these letters and 
words that makes all the difference (AC 5094).  The letters 
are the same letters.  But in the order of the letters and in 
the order of the words we can perceive the intentions of 
the author—the ideas which the writer wishes to convey.
  We see this as we read or hear the stories of the Jewish 
Scripture and when we read the Writings or hear them read.  
Both  are  written  in  literal  form.    Our  eye  sees  the  same 
type of objects, our ears perceive the same type of sound 
waves.  In either case something enters into our memory 
and remains there.  Yet when we read the Scripture story, 
the objects as it were enter only into our sensual degree of 
the mind and are there translated into sensual ideas, into 
ideas of places and persons, of material things, scenes and 
events from the natural world, whereas what we read in 
the Writings does not thus linger on the threshold of the 
mind, but goes immediately into the interior natural and 
is converted into rational ideas.

Objects from the world enter into the external or natural 
memory  of  a  person  through  these  sensuous  things  on 
the one hand, and objects through rational things on the 
other.  These objects separate themselves in this memory.  
Those which have entered through rational things take a 
more interior place, but those which have entered through 
the  sensuous  things  have  a  more  exterior  place;  hence 
as before said the natural becomes twofold, interior and 
exterior. (AC 5094)  

30

Doctrine and the Church

Therefore a human being has been equipped with two 
memories:  one  is  called  corporeal  or  external,  which  is 
intended for the storing up of sensual ideas; and the other 
is called an interior natural memory, and is used to preserve 
rational  ideas  or  abstractions  into  which  the  notions  of 
space  and  time  and  person  do  not  so  much  enter,  and 
which can therefore be used to comprehend and describe 
spiritual things in the form of doctrines and principles.
  When  we  say,  then,  that  the  Writings  are  addressed 
to the rational mind, we simply state a fact: immediately 
on  reading  their  terms  and  sentences  we  translate  them 
(without any effort of our own or any conscious process) 
into  rational  concepts,  or  into  doctrines.    If  we  are 
novices, we may occasionally have to consult a dictionary, 
but  fortunately  it  does  not  have  to  be  a  dictionary  of 
correspondences!    And  if  we  ﬁ nd  in  the  Writings  any 
teachings which seem obscure, it is not because they are 
veiled  in  sensual  appearances  but  because  they  are  too 
abstruse.  The obscurities are only in our own minds and 
are caused partly by our ignorance and partly because we 
have difﬁ cultly in holding our earth-bound thought in  a 
state of rational elevation.

== Chapter Three

Formation of the New Church

In considering the relation of the Doctrine to the Church, 

we have discussed the reasons why the second advent 
of  the  Lord  took  place  by  the  new  revelation  of  interior 
truths  from  the  Word,  and  thus  by  the  formulation  of 
Divine Doctrine.  We pointed out that the reestablishment 
of faith in the Lord and in the Word on a lasting foundation 
required doctrine plainly addressed to the rational minds 
of human beings, and that the truth offered in the Writings 
fulﬁ lled  this  need.    “Falsities  that  have  been  conﬁ rmed 
close  the  church,”  Swedenborg  wrote,  “wherefore  truths 
rationally  understood  have  to  open  it”  (Documents 
232)2.   Acceptance  of  the  Writings  is  the  acceptance  by 
the rational mind of these manifest teachings as a whole, 
which are self-named “The Heavenly Doctrine” and also 
“the universal theology of the New Heaven and the New 
Church” (TCR Title).

These  interior  truths  of  Doctrine  are  said  to  be 
revealed “for the New Church” (HD 7, emphasis added).  
It  is  notable  that  Swedenborg  did  not  at  any  time  make 
any effort to organize a church in this world.  He wrote 
the  Doctrine  with  such  a  church  in  view—a  church 
which  would  use  these  revelations  “for  doctrine  and 
for  life”  (AE  670,  641,  948).    In  the  spiritual  world  he 
witnessed  the  formation  by  the  Lord  of  many  angelic

Doctrine and the Church

societies,  called  the  New  Jerusalem—societies  wherein 
the  heavenly  doctrine  was  acknowledged.    Whether 
his  own  books  as  such  were  known  or  not  by  all  these 
societies  is  not  directly  stated.    The  Heavenly  Doctrine 
being  the  spiritual  sense  of  the  Holy  Scriptures,  their 
teachings or their spiritual contents were known; and we 
have  instances  to  show  that  Swedenborg’s  works  were 
available to spirits in the other life—and were consulted 
even  by  gentiles.    In  the  natural  world,  Swedenborg 
distributed  the  Writings  quite  generously,  although  their 
sale was slow.  He was in personal contact with a number 
of receivers, and corresponded with others.  But we have 
no record of his having discussed the organization of the 
New Church with those receivers, beyond saying that after 
the new heavens had been formed, the New Church would 
begin to be established on earth, and that this could not be 
done through the clergy of the old church.  He suggested 
that the universities in Christendom were beginning to be 
instructed  and  that  “thence  should  come  new  ministers” 
who would take a leading part in this work (Documents 
234)3.    Some  of  the  notables  among  early  members  of 
the  New  Church  were  indeed  university  products.    But 
because  of  the  opposition  of  the  established  church  and 
the  skeptical  world,  Swedenborg’s  hope,  of  establishing 
the  New  Church  through  an  educated  clergy,  can  now 
be  fulﬁ lled  only  through  New  Church  universities.   The 
principle still holds true.

Swedenborg  thus  trusted  that  the  reception  of  the 
Doctrine would result on earth in the formation of the New 
Church,  wherein  the  Doctrine  would  be  the  rule  of  life.  
Each one of the earliest receivers was indeed a church in 
particular, insofar as his reception was genuine.  However, 

3 See Letter 7 in NewSearch.

 
Formation of the New Church

33

the establishment of the Church means the establishment 
of its uses, and the uses of the Church relate to Worship 
and Instruction—worship of the Lord in His second advent 
and  instruction  in  and  evangelization  of  the  Heavenly 
Doctrine  (AC  9925).    The  Writings  themselves  give  an 
abundance of teaching about the need of a church which 
is both internal and external.  They deﬁ ne uses which are 
to be administered by a priesthood within which there is 
proper subordination.  The role of priests is to teach the 
people and to lead them by truths to the good of life, yet 
without compulsion and without claiming “any power over 
people’s souls, since they do not know in what state the 
interiors of a person are” (HD 316).  This latter teaching 
is especially given at the close of the New Jerusalem and 
Its Heavenly Doctrine, which book is explicitly said to be 
“for the New Church.”
  As to the purpose of a new, distinct church organization 
of the New Church,  it is obviously to give  freedom and 
opportunity  to  perform  the  uses  of  the  Church  as  these 
are seen from the Writings.  Where the truth is opposed, it 
cannot be taught and lived.  We therefore are shown that 
a last judgment had to be performed in the spiritual world 
to restore freedom—spiritual freedom—in that world, and 
this by the separation of the good from the evil.  Thus we 
read:

When the end of a church is at hand, then the interiors 
of the Word, of the Church, and of worship are revealed 
and taught.  This is done that the good may be separated 
from the evil; there is a separation because the interior 
things of the Word, of the Church, and of worship, which 
are celestial and spiritual, are received by the good but 
are rejected by the evil.  Moreover, the interior things of 
the Word, which are revealed at the end of a church, are 

34

Doctrine and the Church

serviceable for doctrine and life to the new church which 
is also then established. . . . The like has been done at the 
present  time;  for  it  has  now  pleased  the  Lord  to  reveal 
many arcana of heaven, especially the internal or spiritual 
sense  of  the  Word,  which  has  heretofore  been  wholly 
unknown, and with that He has taught the genuine truths 
of doctrine. . . . A revelation is necessary at the end of the 
church, in order . . . that by means of it the good may be 
separated from the evil, and a new church established, and 
this not only in the natural world where men are but also 
in the spiritual world where spirits and angels are; for in 
both worlds there is a church, and revelation takes place 
in both, and thereby separation, as also the establishment 
of a new church. (AE 641)

This judgment and separation in the spiritual world is 
a ﬁ nal judgment on spirits, and it leads either to heaven or 
to hell.  In the natural world there is also a separation, very 
much more gradual and far from universal.  Neither is it a 
ﬁ nal judgment.  It affects only those who are brought into a 
knowledge of the Heavenly Doctrine in a state of freedom 
and  reason.   With  those  there  is  either  a  rejection  of  the 
truths  from  a  love  of  the  opposing  falsities  which  favor 
their evils, or else a defense of the Heavenly Doctrine from 
a love of the truth for its own sake, which is a love of the 
Lord or charity or spiritual uses.

Those who accept the Writings and come together to 
study their meaning and to carry them out in the uses of 
life, thereby proclaim their good intentions.  Their purpose 
is to be on the side of heaven and the Lord and, in their own 
sphere  of  responsibility,  to  combat  the  evils  and  falsities 
which  threaten  the  life  of  charity.   Thus  the  objective  of 
the Church is to rally the good, the simple good, the well-
disposed,  those  who  are  teachable  and  not  in  the  pride 

 
 
Formation of the New Church

35

of  their  own  self-intelligence,  to  rally  these  around  the 
banner of the Lord’s Divine truth as newly revealed.  This 
objective  holds  true  no  matter  how  few  of  the  salvable 
remnants of the simple good the New Church is actually 
able to attract.  It holds true even if evil people join the 
work  of  the  Church  for  purposes  of  their  own.    It  holds 
true even though the sincere members of the Church are 
from the ﬁ rst burdened with evils of heredity as grievous 
as those of others, and come into states of vacillation and 
temptation, and have to start afresh again and again in their 
endeavors to follow the Lord’s teaching and leading.
  Nor does the teaching just cited (AE 641) involve any 
claim on our part that we can know the state of the interiors 
of any one.  But everyone who enters the Church by adult 
baptism or confession of faith, confesses faith in the Lord 
in His second coming, endeavors to repent, desires to be 
regenerated, is anxious to assist in the work of the Church 
and in the extension to others of the means of salvation as 
well as in proﬁ ting themselves by this.  They also wish to 
protect the sphere of the Church from the evils that may 
arise from the self.

Thus the organized Church includes all manner of men 
and women and all manner of states, for no one can measure 
the  extent  of  any  one’s  regeneration.    This  is  known  to 
the  Lord  alone;  it  is  true  also  for  one’s  spiritual  failure.  
Nonetheless, the Church is organized and separated from 
the world in order to draw to itself those who are in the 
good of obedience to the Lord as He comes to us in the 
Divine Doctrine.  To belong to the Church is therefore a 
sign of a conscious intention to such good, even though it 
is not a proof of possessing it.  The members of the Church 
therefore take for granted that their fellow members have 
the good of doctrine and the love of truth.  So far as the  

 
36

Doctrine and the Church

Church persists in teaching the revealed Doctrine boldly 
and clearly, without compromise, and so long as the truths 
of regeneration are kept as the main subject of its thought, 
there will be a constant purging of the Church.  Those will 
leave who are not in the good of doctrine or who do not 
aspire to seek in the doctrine their bread of life or at least 
to  be  supported  by  the  sphere  and  life  of  the  Church  in 
their simple efforts to live from a religious conscience.

There is but little lasting attraction in the Doctrines of 
the New Church for those who are averse to the spiritual 
life  to  which  the  Writings  point  on  every  page.    For  to 
understand the subject matter of the Writings and persist in 
their study requires a certain elevation of mind which calls 
for  a  constant  rebuke  of  our  impatient  and  self-seeking 
sensual will.  To receive satisfaction and delight from the 
perusal of the Writings was therefore cited by Swedenborg 
as a “sign” that the reader was in a state of enlightenment 
from heaven.  “For the matters which are there treated of,” 
he wrote, “cannot be comprehended without enlightenment, 
since they do not belong to the external understanding but 
to the internal” (Documents 217)4.  It is this enlightenment 
which those of the New Church seek when they study the 
Writings—not  to  conﬁ rm  opinions  of  their  own,  but  to 
learn what the Lord there teaches.  And they do not like to 
question its existence in others.

Individual enlightenment and regeneration could exist 
even  if  there  were  no  organized  Church,  so  long  as  the 
Word and the Writings were available.  But the Church has 
to be established to promulgate the Writings and to protect 
and promote spiritual progress, which is provided by the 
Lord through the uses of the Church.

The Writings and the Word

37

In appearance, and so far as history records, the New 
Church was established by certain people, receivers of the 
Writings, who met for mutual instruction and for common 
worship  and  later  recognized  some  of  their  number 
as  ministers  and  undertook  various  uses—preaching, 
lectures, publication, education.  But in reality, the origin 
of  all  these  uses  is  found  in  the Writings  themselves,  or 
in the Lord’s teaching concerning the need for and order 
of the church.  Only so far as this church originates in the 
Writings, is there a New Church.  The Lord alone can build 
the  Church.   And  the  primary  thing  of  the  New  Church 
is therefore the acknowledgement of the Writings as the 
proximate source of its distinctive doctrines and life, and 
of all its uses.

The Writings and the Word

From  the  beginning  of  the  New  Church,  receivers 
hesitated to deﬁ ne the place of the Writings in relation to 
the  Church.    They  dissented  little  in  recognizing  a  new 
Divine  revelation,    even  among  those  who  saw  no  need 
for  a  separate  Church,  though  some  were  inclined  to 
regard  Swedenborg  more  as  an  enlightened  exponent  of 
the Word,  inspired  as  to  his  seeing  of  certain  truths,  but 
not as to his recording of his spiritual experiences.  On the 
other  hand,  some  boldly  asserted  that  the Writings  were 
as much the Word of God to the New Church as were the 
Gospels to the Christian.  If it did not owe its foundation to 
the voice of God, or to His Word given in a new form, how 
could there be a new dispensation, a New Church?  Would 
not  then  the  New  Church  be  a  mere  reform  within  the 
old, a new Christian denomination, such as the Lutheran 
Church or the Quakers or Methodists, movements founded 

 
 
38

Doctrine and the Church

upon  the  work  or  writings  of  men?    Many  New  Church 
people  were  quite  satisﬁ ed  to  have  the  Church  regarded 
as  a  Christian  denomination,  and  indeed  nourished  the 
vain  hope  that  all  the  “old”  Christian  churches  would 
eventually be permeated by the spirit of the “New Age” 
and  gradually  accept  the  essentials  of  Swedenborg’s 
teachings.  Mostly the New Church organizations avoided 
making  an  issue  of  the  question  about  the  status  of  the 
Writings,  especially  since  the  Writings  themselves  used 
the term “The Word” to refer to the Sacred Scriptures of 
the Old and New Testaments, and made no direct claim to 
the title.  Many loyal receivers feared that if a custom of 
calling the Writings “the Word” were adopted, confusion 
would follow, and the unique character of the Writings as 
the ﬁ nal revelation might be lost from view.

It was not until the development of the Academy that 
these objections were met.  At that time it became obvious 
that many in the organized New Church had left their ﬁ rst 
love  of  the  Writings  and,  while  vaguely  acknowledging 
Swedenborg’s inspiration, did not regard the teachings of 
the Writings as of Divine authority.  The result was that 
the uses of the Church suffered and various heresies began 
to invade.  Those who then began to associate themselves 
into  the  “Academy  movement”  recognized  the  need  of 
stressing before the Church that it is not Swedenborg who 
speaks in the Writings but the Lord, and that to put aside 
any of their plain teachings is to evade the Lord’s Divine 
authority.  Therefore, the Academy pointed out that since 
“the Divinity of the Word resides in its spiritual sense” (SS 
18, 19), and since “the spiritual sense of the Word is the 
doctrine of the New Church” (SS 25, 79), “this doctrine 
must be the Divine and infallible Word of the Lord” who 
had “come again in the Word, not as to the letter, but as to 

 
The Writings and the Word

39

the spirit of the letter” (“The Standard of Authority in the 
New Church,” Rev. W. H. Benade, NCL 1902:365ff).

Let  us  note  that  there  is  no  confusion  here  between 
the Writings as the Word and the Scriptures as the Word.  
It  is  not  their  literal  form  but  their  internal  contents  of 
Divine  Doctrine  which  makes  each  of  these  revelations 
the Word of God.  And lest there be any misunderstanding, 
Benade’s previously cited paper—an address given before 
the Council of Ministers in 1873—answered the question, 
“How  is  the  second  coming  of  the  Lord  in  the  Word 
accomplished?” by saying:

Not by the giving of the Word in the letter, for this had 
been done long ages before.  Not by the fulﬁ llment of the 
Word, for this had been accomplished centuries before.  
Not  by  the  provision  of  a  new  Word  in  a  literal  form, 
for this was impossible, seeing that the Lord had ﬁ lled 
every jot and title of the Word full of a Divine life, and 
so had made it Divine truth itself in last, as it was in ﬁ rst 
principles.    Not  thus  was  His  second  coming  effected, 
but  by  the  opening  of  the  Word  as  given  and  fulﬁ lled 
by  Himself;  by  a  revelation  of  its  spirit  and  life  to  the 
understandings of men; by the unfolding of its spiritual 
sense. (NCL 1902:368f)

The Writings do not make any claim that they are the 
Word in a literal sense, or a new Letter of Scripture.  But 
the  Writings  do  claim  to  be  the  Divine  Doctrine  given 
from the Lord’s own mouth.  They claim that they reveal 
and give the internal sense of the Word of Scripture, and 
that the Doctrine conforms with the Word in heaven which 
presents the spiritual and celestial senses of the Scripture 
before the angels.

 
 
40

Doctrine and the Church

The Writings thus may be called the Word of the Lord, 
even as the Word in heaven is called the Word and even as 
the Divine truth proceeding from God to create the world 
is called the Word (AC 2894, 5075, 5272).  The Writings 
teach  that  every  Divine  revelation  is  the  Word  in  that 
wider sense.  Each contains the same Divine truth and thus 
the Divine Doctrine itself.  To believe that the Revelation 
which  excels  previous  Scriptures—deﬁ nes  their  canon, 
and opens their internals and reveals their meaning—could 
be anything less than the authoritative Word of the Lord, 
was seen by the Academy to be incredible.

The Academy did not pretend that the Writings were 
identical as to the form with the Word existing in the heavens.  
The Word in the heavens is written in an angelic language 
in which every letter or symbol stands for perceptions and 
affections of the internal sense, and the angels see no other 
sense—see nothing from any natural sense (SS 71).  The 
form and the writing differ in the various heavens, yet “the 
Word  is  the  same  everywhere,”  as  to  doctrine,  although 
the angels have thence perceptions of wisdom and ideas of 
spiritual thought that are incomparably superior to those 
of people in the natural world.  But the angels do not know 
that this Word is not similar to the one which they read in 
the world, nor are they conscious that they are wiser than 
they were when on earth (De Verbo 14:2).  The Writings 
are also written or printed in letters and words, which—
like  the  angelic  Word—express  the  Heavenly  Doctrine 
or  the  spiritual  sense  of  Scripture  in  direct  fashion,  but 
in natural words.  Thus those who read the Writings may 
receive ideas of doctrine, of principles of life, of laws of 
the Divine providence and of inﬂ ux.  They receive these 
ideas  and  their  associated  affections  into  their  rational 
minds  and  perceive  them  simply  or  wisely  according  to 

 
 
The Writings and the Word

41

their states.  The Writings arrange series of truths according 
to a rational order, in which one point of doctrine follows 
another with a deﬁ nite logical purpose.  Sometimes, as in 
the Arcana Coelestia, this logical series evolves from the 
literal  sense  of  the  Scriptures.   At  other  times,  incidents 
from the spiritual world illustrate these series or conﬁ rm 
them  from  the  Word  or  from  the  sciences.    Elsewhere, 
as  in  the  True  Christian  Religion,  they  form  a  balanced 
system  of  doctrine  in  which  all  the  teachings  are  made 
into a universal whole.  But as a whole and in every part 
the Writings reveal the spiritual and celestial senses of the 
Word in “a natural sense from the spiritual” (AE 1061).  
It is the rational form of the truths of the Heavenly Word 
which is there given, not their sensual or merely natural 
form such as is presented through sensual correspondences 
or moral parables.
  Within  its  rational  teachings,  the  Writings  contain 
inﬁ nite  truth—all  the  ineffable  arcana  of  the  heavenly 
Word, whence angels derive their wisdom.  The Writings 
express  Divine  arcana  as  to  their  generals  (De  Verbo 
3:4).  And those who on earth, from an affection for truth, 
perceive  these  generals  by  their  rational  understanding, 
can,  when  they  become  spirits  or  angels,  perceive  them 
and express them in a spiritual or celestial manner.  Thus 
they  perceive  unending  particulars  and  singulars  within 
these doctrinal generals (Ibid.).  But while on earth, their 
conscious perception is limited within the natural rational 
forms of the Writings themselves.
  Much of the confusion of thought which has attended 
the  discussion  of  the  Academy’s  acknowledgment  (and 
I  cite  from  the  “Principles  of  the Academy”)  that  in  the 
Writings “is contained the very essential Word, which is 
the  Lord”  and  that  “the  Church  acknowledges  no  other 

42

Doctrine and the Church

Authority, and no other Law,” is due to our natural habit of 
thinking from appearances.  In appearance, the Writings 
are  books—utterly  separate  from  the  Scriptures.    But  in 
reality the Writings are an organized form of Divine truth.  
It  is  the  same  with  the  Word  of  the  Scriptures:  they  in 
reality are not material books, but a Divine organization 
of truths—in a form more external.  As long as we think 
of these revelations as books, we cannot see their mutual 
connection  except  vaguely.    But  if  we  regard  them 
spiritually, apart from the illusions of space and time, we 
can see that they are not separate, but are revelations of 
distinct phases of, or planes within, the one God of Divine 
truth which was indeed made incarnate in Bethlehem.  The 
Word is the Lord in His Divine made Human and is His 
Human made Divine.  In general it may be said that the 
Lord Himself is in the spiritual sense with His Divine “and 
in the natural sense with His Human” (Inv 44).  The Word 
on earth is His revelation of Himself to us here.  There we 
see Him in His accommodations to our natural minds, in 
His Human, in His embodiments of truth.
  Although this body of truth Divine is in itself eternal 
and was the Word which was in the beginning with God and 
was God, and indeed created all things, yet it was revealed 
to human apprehension only by degrees and stages.  As to 
its  Sensual  it  was  revealed  through  the  correspondential 
Word  of  the  Old  Testament,  in  sensual  ideas  molded  in 
a prophetic order to represent the coming of the Lord in 
the ﬂ esh.  As to its Divine Natural it was revealed by the 
appearance of the Lord on earth and by the testimony of 
the  New  Testament.    As  to  the  Divine  Rational,  it  was 
revealed in the Writings, which describe the gloriﬁ cation 
of the Lord’s Human, trace the mental life of the Lord on 

The Writings and the Word

43

earth, and make apprehensible the laws and reasons of the 
Divine economy of heaven.
  One’s natural mind contains and can contain only these 
three  degrees,  the  Sensual,  the  Middle  Natural  and  the 
Rational.  And when the New Church is called the crown 
of all the Churches, a dispensation which will endure to 
eternity,  it  is  also  obvious  that  the  rational  truths  which 
its  revelation  (the  Writings)  presents  are  of  the  highest 
degree which the mind of people on earth can perceive.  It 
is therefore the ﬁ nal revelation of God to the human race 
on earth, and will not be followed by another which shall 
interpret it.
  But it would be an error of tragic consequences if we 
attempted  to  divorce  this  plane  of  rational  truths  Divine 
from the New Testament which presents the Lord as He 
lived among us here, or from the Old Testament which in 
sensual imagery prophesied His Advent.  This would be 
as  impossible  as  to  withdraw  the  brain  and  the  nervous 
system from a human body and present it alone as a man—
without  heart  and  viscera  and  without  skin  and  bones!  
(See NCL 1938:164-167 for a development of this line of 
thought.)  The Writings, in all their teachings, imply the 
acceptance of the Scriptures and terminate their teachings 
in conﬁ rmations from the Word in its literal sense, just as 
the nervous ﬁ bers of the brain are terminated in the skin, 
the muscles, and the organs of sensation.

In  spiritual  aspect,  therefore,  the  Writings  are  not 
separated from the Word in the sense of the letter, but are 
its interior contents.  In our thoughts the Word of Divine 
revelation is a one coherent whole, in which every part has 
its eternal function.

Doctrine and the Church

  When the Academy voiced its faith that the Writings 
contain “the essential Word,” it did in no wise set aside the 
Old and New Testaments as of no further use.  But with 
the revelation of the Heavenly Doctrine, these Testaments 
underwent  a  transﬁ guration.    Their  Divinity  was  made 
clear.  Their purpose and special function became apparent 
when they were seen in the light of the Writings.  Their 
power  over  our  minds  was  then  increased  rather  than 
diminished.    We  saw  them  to  have  an  authority  as  the 
ultimate  embodiment  of  Divine  truth—which  before  we 
had vaguely sensed but which we could now understand—
since in the sacred words of Holy Writ was gathered all the 
wisdom of God.  This the Arcana teaches in these words:

The  literal  sense  is  by  no  means  annihilated  by  the 
internal sense, but is rather conﬁ rmed and strengthened 
thereby;  for  every  single  word  of  the  letter  obtains 
weight  and  holiness  from  the  internal  sense  which  is 
within.  Besides, the literal sense is the basis and fulcrum 
by  which  the  internal  sense  exerts  its  power,  and  with 
which  it  is  so  intimately  conjoined  that  there  is  not  an 
iota, point, or tittle in the letter of the Word which does 
not contain within it what is Divine. (AC 9349)

  Now,  the  teaching  is  that  illustration  is  effected  by 
means of truths nakedly seen, but that the conjunction is 
effected through truths clothed in ultimate appearances and 
correspondences, such as are in the sense of the letter.  The 
sense of the letter effects a conjunction of heaven with those 
of the Church.  Swedenborg refers to having a thousand 
experiences which proved to him that “the sense of the letter 
of our Word” produces this effect; and he adds that “the 
spiritual sense, without the accompanying natural sense, 
does  not  communicate  with  heaven”  (De  Verbo  18:3).  

The Writings and the Word

45

He  observed  that  when  spirits  in  the  world  of  spirits 
bring forward any passage according to the sense of the 
letter  they  immediately  excite  some  heavenly  society  to 
conjunction with them (AE 816:2), although this is not the 
case when they bring forward something from the spiritual 
sense without the sense of the letter (De Verbo 20:2).  The 
reason,  of  course,  is  that  the  appearances  of  the  letter 
are sensual correspondences which suggest to the angels 
inﬁ nitely more things of the spiritual sense than human or 
spirit apprehends as naked truths.  “If the Word had been 
written  otherwise,  no  conjunction  with  man  would  have 
been  possible”  (AE  816:2).    Sometimes  evil  spirits  and 
those  in  various  heresies  abuse  this  communication  and 
thus seek a temporary favor and protection from heaven 
(AE 832:2).

In the acceptance of the literal sense of the Word, all 
the states of the Church and of heaven ﬁ nd a common ﬁ eld 
of use and cooperation.  Conjunction is effected through 
common externals.  This is a law of life.  Love has this law 
inscribed  upon  it,  when  it  desires  the  physical  nearness, 
the  actual  touch  of  the  ones  it  loves,  and  longs  to  build 
a  common  home  for  them.    And  because  the  power  of 
conjunction lies in externals, in ultimates, the Lord came 
on earth as a Man among mortals, and gave His teachings a 
fulﬁ llment of symbolic prophecy, yet one veiled in parable.  
To  all  well-disposed  people  He  presents  Himself  in  the 
Word as to His Divine Human, as Jesus Christ, offering 
them conjunction with Himself.  Sensual people apprehend 
sensually what He is and what He offers.  Natural people 
apprehend Him naturally, and those who are truly rational 
can be taught from His Divine Rational (AC 4715).  But 
all see Him in the literal sense in the ultimate Human form 
common to all people.

 
46

Doctrine and the Church

  As  to  this  general  truth  concerning  His  ﬁ rst  advent, 
the New Church draws its doctrine from the literal sense 
of the Scripture.  Indeed it was so that the Lord drew all 
the doctrines of the Writings at the hands of Swedenborg.  
The  Writings  also  repeatedly  stress  that  the  doctrine  of 
the Church, unless collected and then conﬁ rmed from the 
sense of the letter of the Word, has no value, no authority, 
no power, because it does not then “communicate” with 
heaven (De Verbo 18:4, 20:2-3, 5).

It is of vital importance to the Church that this teaching 

be clearly understood:

 All things of the doctrine of the church are to be conﬁ rmed 
by the sense of the letter of the Word, and whatever of 
doctrine is not conﬁ rmed from the sense of the letter of the 
Word has no power. Doctrine conﬁ rmed by the sense of 
the letter as to genuine truth, has power.  The appearance 
of Divine truth also has power, though less, so far as it 
can agree with genuine truth; but the sense of the letter of 
the Word falsiﬁ ed has no power.  It closes and does not 
open heaven. (De Verbo 20:5  emphasis added) 

This is one phase of the teaching.  The other phase is that 
the genuine truths in the literal sense are from the spiritual 
sense,  while  the  appearances  themselves  constitute  the 
merely  natural  sense.    It  is  further  disclosed  that  the 
doctrine  of  genuine  truths  is  now  revealed  and  already 
gathered  into  the  Heavenly  Doctrine  given  to  the  New 
Church.

To  the  New  Church,  then,  is  given  the  threefold 
Word, the doctrine of genuine truth, and also something 
of the science of correspondences whereby the externals 
of the Word may be understood.  What use is the Church 
to make of these revelations?  How can we receive their 

 
 
The Writings and the Word

47

internal content?  What are the orderly modes by which 
the  Church,  its  priests,  and  its  people,  are  able  to  draw 
their water of life and their bread of life from the Word?  
How can the New Church avoid the tragic perversions of 
doctrine such as overtook the Christian Church?  What are 
the conditions for enlightenment and what is the function 
and place of our rational minds in the process?

In later chapters, I shall attempt to give some of the 

answers which the Writings offer to these questions.

when  viewed 

interiorly,  are 

We  showed  in  a  preceding  section  that  the Writings, 

so  organically 
connected  with  the  Old  and  New  Testaments  that  these 
Three  Revelations  make  one  body  of  Divine  Truth:  the 
Writings  being  the  external  presentation  to  our  rational 
understanding of that same truth which in the Scriptures 
lies concealed as an undercurrent of a spiritual sense.

It  is  upon  this  entire  threefold  Word  that  the  New 
Church  is  founded.    No  one  can  dispute  the  general 
statement that “the church is from the Word” (TCR 243).  
Every church is distinguished primarily by the revelations 
which  it  acknowledges  as  containing  its  charter  and  the 
source of its being.  Christian churches are all founded on 
the  testimony  of  the  Gospels  and  on  the  Old  Testament 
prophecies, and Jewish churches on the Law given through 
Moses.

“The Church is from the Word.”  Yet it must also be 
admitted  that,  in  a  sense,  “the  Word  does  not  make  the 
church”  (TCR  244)!    The  Christian  Church  has  always 
been nominally founded upon the New Testament; yet in 
the course of the centuries it split up into many churches 
of very different character both as to teachings and as to 
life.  The church, as to state and quality, is according to 
the  understanding  of  the Word  among  those  who  are  in 
the church.  Indeed, the state of the church is determined 
by  those  truths  of  faith  and  goods  of  charity  which  it 

 
 
 
 
50

Doctrine and the Church

apprehends as taught in the literal sense of the Word.  If 
the people of the church do not read the Word, the states 
among  them  are  not  states  of  the  church,  but  states  of 
alien origin—states of the world, states which partake of 
ignorance  and  error;  and  the  same  is  the  case  when  the 
Word  is  read  but  not  understood.   And  the  Word  is  not 
understood  if  it  is  read  in  the  light  of  false  doctrines  or 
false principles of interpretation.

Therefore  the  True  Christian  Religion  states  that 
although a church is according to its doctrine, “still doctrine 
does not establish (instaurat) the church, but integrity and 
purity of doctrine, consequently the understanding of the 
Word” (n. 245).  Doctrine must be “integer,” untouched, 
undiminished,  complete,  whole,  entire,  sound,  if  it  is  to 
establish  the  church  among  people!    The  church  is  not 
instituted by those who pick out speciﬁ c points of doctrine 
that carry some particular promise or appeal to some passing 
state, and then ignore other phases of the teachings.  This 
is one reason why a priesthood must be placed in charge 
of the instruction of the church, a priesthood whose ofﬁ ce 
it is to see to it that not only the truths which appear to us 
are taught but that the whole doctrine is presented.  The 
revealed Doctrine must be “untouched”—must be handed 
on from generation to generation so that its spiritual truth 
can be rendered up immune from the rational (AC 2533).  
Purity of doctrine is said to establish the church, not doctrine 
mixed up with human opinions and novelties which cover 
over the purpose latent in the original Revelation.  Human 
opinions  and  interpretations  must  indeed  be  resorted  to 
in  our  thought,  but  these  must  never  be  confused  with 
the  Divine  Doctrine  itself,  but  must  be  under  constant 
judgment  and  scrutiny  and  must  never  lay  claim  to  any 
other than rational authority.

 
Doctrine and the Church 

51

Since  it  is  “integrity  and  purity  of  doctrine”  which 
institute the church, this calls for a true understanding of the 
Word.  It implies that we must place our faith in the revealed 
Doctrine as an untouched whole and allow that Doctrine 
to speak to us and inﬂ uence our thinking and acting.  For 
while it may be said that sound and pure Doctrine is what 
makes the church in general, it is faith and life according 
to faith that institutes the particular church within each of 
us (TCR 245).  Each must have an understanding of the 
Word  and  obtain  this  understanding  in  the  ﬁ rst  instance 
from the church as a whole or from doctrine as this exists 
in  the  church,  and  in  the  second  instance  from  doctrine 
which one ﬁ nds in the Word (AC 5402, 6047.2-3, 6822, 
8993.4).

The Word is the Word whether anyone understands it 
or not, since in the supreme sense it is the Divine Doctrine 
itself  which  is  above  the  comprehension  of  any  ﬁ nite 
person or even angel, being the inﬁ nite understanding of 
the Lord Himself.  The Word in the forms that we know 
it—as the Scriptures and the Writings—is the Divine truth 
in accommodated forms, and is likewise the Word whether 
we understand it or not.  Yet the Word, if not understood, 
becomes to us a dead letter, and if falsiﬁ ed as to meaning, it 
becomes no longer truth with those who falsify it (SS 77). 
The  Lord  is  indeed  present  in  the Word  with  those  who 
read it, but cannot conjoin Himself with them except so far 
as they understand something of what they read (SS 78).  
For it is by understanding that we see the Lord in the order 
of the inspired ideas of the Word.  The understanding is 
our spiritual eyes.

Be it known, that all the truths of the Word, which are 
the truths of heaven and of the church, can be seen by 
the  understanding,  in  heaven  spiritually,  in  the  world 

 
 
52

Doctrine and the Church

rationally.  For a truly human understanding is the sight 
itself  of  these  truths,  for  it  is  separated  from  what  is 
material,  and  when  separated  from  what  is  material  it 
sees truths as clearly as the eye sees objects; it sees truths 
as  it  loves  them,  for  as  it  loves  them  it  is  enlightened.     
(AE 1100e)

Truths in the heavens are spiritual objects which appear 
before  the  angels  more  clearly  than  natural  objects  do 
before men.  (AE 831:4; cf. 260)

From  creation,  the  human  body  is  equipped  with 
the  organs  of  sight  and  the  faculty  of  seeing  in  natural 
life.    Similarly  the  mind  or  spirit  is  also  given  a  faculty 
of  seeing—but  of  seeing  in  spiritual  light.    The  faculty 
is given for us to use, but is not from us nor is it ours; it 
belongs, like every faculty, to the Lord.  The seeing is ours 
but the power is the Lord’s.  We are therefore taught that 
the eyes really do not see from themselves, but from the 
spirit, and  the spirit does not see from itself, but from a 
still more interior sight, that of our rational.

Nay,  neither  does  this  see  of  itself,  but  does  so  from  a 
still more internal sight, which is that of the internal man 
. . . And even this does not see of itself, for it is the Lord 
who sees through the internal man, and He is the Only 
One who sees because He is the Only One who lives, and 
He it is who gives man the ability to see, and this in such 
a manner that it appears to him as if he saw of himself. 
Such is the case with inﬂ ux. (AC 1954:2)

The  understanding  is  our  organ  for  spiritual  seeing, 
and all the truths of the Word are spiritual objects which 
by  a  spiritual  mode  affect  the  understanding,  and  cause 
the understanding to assume the form or image of some  

 
 
Appearances and Naked Truths

53

aspect of Divine order, so far as we consent.  We then feel 
that we see truths, or receive truths.  Actually, however, 
what occurs is that our mind has been affected or modiﬁ ed 
by the truth.  Just as physical objects which we see do not, 
on  account  of  our  seeing  them,  enter  into  our  brain  but 
remain in the outer world, so, in our spiritual seeing, the 
truths of the Word remain in the Word, and the mind has 
merely been furnished with a new state.  This impression 
invites  an  inﬂ ux  of  life  from  heaven,  but  in  a  different 
form,  a  new  life—an  inﬂ ux  of  good  and  truth  from  the 
Lord.  For we are only vessels receptive of life.  We are not 
the “inﬂ ux” which affects the vessel.  And indeed, since 
we—as organic vessels—have not made ourselves, we are 
not even the vessels, but merely the state of the vessels, 
such as they are at any given time.  (See chapter 10 below.) 
And this state is the product of our exercise of liberty and 
rationality.  It is built up by our consent or refusal to be 
inﬂ uenced by the truth which affects us from without and 
by the good which affects us from within.

Thus the understanding of the Word makes the state of 

the church with us.

Appearances and Naked Truths

The  Word  is  Divine,  and  so  are  the  inﬁ nite  truths 
which  it  contains.    Indeed,  every  truth  is  Divine  and 
inﬁ nite, even though presented in the Word through ﬁ nite 
accommodations  which  enable  us  to  distinguish  it  from 
other truths so that it may affect our ﬁ nite understanding.  
And when we read the Word, the Divine and inﬁ nite truth 
proceeds from the Lord to us to build in our understanding 
an  abode  for  its  inﬂ ux  and  Divine  presence.    Thus  the 
Word  radiates  light  and  heat.    And  we  are  taught  that 

 
 
54

Doctrine and the Church

from the Word the Divine teaching of Doctrine proceeds 
on  every  plane;  and  even  the  Doctrine  which  proceeds 
from the literal sense of the Word is wholly Divine—in its 
proceeding (AC 3712).

It is by means of its ﬁ nite accommodations or by its 
being clothed in sensual, natural, and rational appearances, 
that  the Word  can  affect  our  understanding,  or—what  is 
the  same—that  we  can  understand  the  Word,  or  see  its 
meaning,  just  as  pure  light  reveals  nothing  to  our  eyes 
unless it is refracted in colors and reﬂ ected from objects.  
This, we are informed, is the primary reason why the Word 
of  the  Scriptures  was  written  by  correspondences  and 
representations,  symbols  and  parables.   And  for  similar 
reasons, the Writings are couched in rational language with 
arguments and expositions, and the angelic Word is written 
in ﬁ nite symbols of a still higher type.  All these things are 
accommodations to ﬁ nite minds—minds which live in the 
realm of appearances, either natural or rational.
  At the same time, appearances are necessary to prevent 
the thoughts of human or angel becoming, as it were, lost 
in inﬁ nity—which would lead to insanity.  The literal sense 
of the Word, as it exists in the Sacred Scriptures, is also 
ﬁ lled with grosser sensual appearances to prevent us from 
entering into its interior truths without due preparation lest 
we should profane these interior truths.
  Nonetheless,  “all  the  things  which  have  to  do  with 
man’s life and thus with his salvation, are naked” in the 
Scriptures;  and  in  many  places  where  they  are  clothed 
by  mere  correspondences  these  essential  truths  “show 
through, as objects are seen by a woman through a thin silk 
veil before her face” (TCR 229).  The Word in the sense of 
its letter is therefore likened to one clothed whose face and 
hands are bare (SS 55).  “Hence it may be evident,” we 

 
Appearances and Naked Truths

55

read in De Verbo, “that there is no lack, but that man can 
ﬁ nd and see naked truths even in the letter of the Word.  
These parts of the Word serve for the church’s doctrine, 
because in themselves they are spiritual-natural truths” (n. 
10:7).   Thus  “the  doctrine  of  genuine  truth  may  also  be 
fully drawn from the literal sense of the Word” (SS 55).
  On  the  other  hand,  heresies  arise  from  mistaking 
the  appearances  of  truth,  or  the  clothing,  for  the  naked 
truth  (AE  816,  1089:2).    This  mistake  is  pardoned 
when  committed  innocently.    In  fact,  heresies  do  not 
by  themselves  condemn  a  person;  but  an  evil  life,  and 
conﬁ rmations of the falsities in the heresy from the Word 
and  by  reasonings  from  the  pride  of  intelligence—these 
condemn.    People  are  born  into  the  religions  of  their 
parents and on account of their later occupations they are 
usually unable to withdraw from its falsities.  But to live 
wickedly,  and  conﬁ rm  falsities  to  the  destruction  of  the 
genuine truth, that is another matter; since the falsity then 
coheres after death with the love of what is one’s own and 
with pride in one’s wisdom (SS 92).
  We are therefore forewarned to see whether a thing is 
true before we begin to conﬁ rm it, and not to rush to conﬁ rm 
everything we happen to like (SS 91).  There is no great 
hurry  in  spiritual  matters,  and  common  sense  can  often 
come to our rescue in recognizing the difference between 
appearances  and  genuine  truths.    To  speak  according  to 
apparent truths is allowed to all of us, for obvious reasons.  
But to think from conﬁ rmed appearances against the truth 
is to blunt and darken the understanding (SS 95).

The  appearances,  comparisons,  similitudes,  and 
correspondences used in the literal sense of the Word as 
an accommodation to simple states are particularly likely 
to be adapted to conﬁ rm any principle of religion and thus 

 
56

Doctrine and the Church

also any heresy.  This has caused the Bible to be derided 
as  the  “Book  of  Heresies”  (AC  10276:8).    But  it  is  not 
the  function  of  correspondences  to  teach,  but  only  to 
corroborate what is already taught.  The teaching is to be 
found in the naked truths, and “appearances of truth can 
be understood only from passages where the naked truths 
stand out; out of these doctrine can be formed by one who 
is enlightened by the Lord, and according to that doctrine 
all other things can be explained” (AE 816:2).
  Why, then, was it necessary that the Word be written 
in  appearances  and  correspondences,  and  not  in  naked 
truths?  Several reasons have already been alluded to, but in 
addition this is given: through the Word in its literal sense 
there may be a conjunction with heaven.  For humans have 
few truths in common with the angels, and can receive but 
relatively few; and if, through the Writings, they receive 
many, yet they perceive only their most general aspects.  In 
the Old and New Testaments, however, inﬁ nite truths are 
represented in the correspondential symbols of the literal 
sense,  and  these  form  a  medium  by  which  the  heavens, 
who understand the spiritual meaning, can cohabit with all 
who think of the natural sense (AE 816:2).

It is important to notice that people could always ﬁ nd 
naked  truths  in  the  Scriptures,  provided  there  was  with 
them  something  of  innocence  and  a  willingness  to  be 
led—a  simple  faith  in  the  Lord.   These  truths  of  saving 
power  also  entered  into  the  teachings  of  consummated 
churches, which still teach the ten commandments and the 
duty  of  repentance,  and  many  other  truths,  to  which  the 
simple good listen with eager hearts, while the falsities of 
these  churches  make  only  a  superﬁ cial  impression  upon 
them.

 
Appearances and Naked Truths

57

  But it is not a sufﬁ cient protection against falsities to 
know a few naked truths.  The Word in its letter cannot be 
understood until the clear and patent truths of religion are 
gathered together into a doctrine of genuine truths, in the 
light of which the Word can be read and interpreted.  And 
when false doctrines have usurped the throne and rule the 
thinking of a church, the Word is more and more shut up, 
until it becomes full of apparent contradictions, and doubts 
begin to tear down faith.  It then becomes more and more 
difﬁ cult to distinguish naked truths from apparent truths, 
and still more difﬁ cult to gather up a doctrine of genuine 
truth.  But “the things which are impossible with men are 
possible with God” (Luke 18:27).

This  was  why  the  Lord  raised  up  Swedenborg  and 
enlightened his mind by a special Divine inspiration to see 
and collect out of the Old and New Testaments the naked 
truths which were required, and from these formed for the 
New  Church  a  doctrine  of  genuine  truth  in  the  light  of 
which the Word could be understood.  The Lord did this 
according to the very order in which people should proceed 
to ﬁ nd genuine truth.  Even as the Lord as the Word was 
made ﬂ esh by being born and educated in human fashion, 
so He now came again in the Word of the Scriptures by the 
very mode in which people should have sought for Him.  
In both these cases, however, He did what no human could 
ever do.  At His ﬁ rst advent He gloriﬁ ed His Human.  At 
His second advent He revealed the spiritual sense of His 
Word and laid bare the arcana of the spiritual world.

Doctrine and the Church

The Doctrine of Genuine Truth

The  Writings  contrast  genuine  truth  with  truth  not 
genuine.  They show that the truths and goods with those 
outside the Church are not genuine, and that only within the 
Church which has the Word can truth and good be genuine 
(AC  9255,  10212).   Truth  is  not  genuine  where  there  is 
ignorance and falsity, as with the Gentiles.  Yet good can 
lie concealed in truths even if they are not genuine, and 
these non-genuine truths can then be accepted by the Lord 
as  genuine  (AC  9258),  although  it  is  intimated  that  one 
who is devoid of any genuine truths can advance only to 
the  threshold  of  heaven  (AE  798:8).    The  Writings  also 
mention that

… there are some who are in genuine truths, some who 
are in truths not genuine, and some who are in falsities; 
and yet they who are in genuine truths are often damned, 
while they who are in truths not genuine, and also they 
who are in falsities, are often saved. (AC 9192)

We cite this “paradox” in order to show that genuine truth 
can  be  with  a  person  irrespective  of  his  or  her  interior 
state.  It can come to the understanding without affecting 
the will.  It can be seen and even acknowledged, yet never 
be lived.

It is important to make this clear, since the Writings 
state deﬁ nitely and repeatedly that “the doctrine of genuine 
truth has now been revealed”—a statement which would be 
considerably weakened if this doctrine were not intelligible 
to every rational mind.  The Writings give the doctrine of 
genuine  truth  in  a  series  of  volumes  which  contain  one 
doctrine after another, each point being drawn from naked 
truths found in the Holy Scripture and then conﬁ rmed by 
other  Scriptural  teachings  either  naked  or  clothed.    But 

 
 
Doctrine of Genuine Truth

59

the fact that the Writings cite these passages in groups or 
singly,  does  not  take  them  out  of  their  original  context 
in the Scriptures.  It merely establishes new connections 
between the various truths in the literal sense and places 
them  in  mutual  relations  to  some  central  principle.    It 
reveals an order of truths not before recognized, an internal 
substratum of meaning which binds them all together as a 
living body with a Soul and Spirit not manifest before.

The  “doctrine  of  genuine  truth”  is  therefore  nothing 
else than the naked truths visible in the sense of the letter 
of  the  Scriptures  placed  in  their  proper  connection  and 
order.  When so ordered, these truths appear as a doctrine 
of love and charity, which is the sum and substance of “all 
the law and the prophets.”

This  is  the  true  doctrine  of  the  literal  sense  of  the 
Word, consistently taught as the two great commandments.  
And it is again and again emphasized in the Writings that 
doctrine  is  and  must  be  drawn  from  the  literal  sense  of 
the Word.  It may therefore be surprising that we should 
come across repeated teachings in the Writings which state 
what  appears  to  be  quite  the  contrary,  namely,  that  “the 
internal sense is the genuine doctrine itself of the church” 
and that “they who understand the Word according to the 
internal sense know the true doctrine itself” (WH 11:3), 
nay, that the Heavenly Doctrine which gives the doctrine 
of genuine truth, is from the spiritual sense (HD 7).  “The 
internal  sense  teaches  this  doctrine  itself;  and  he  who 
knows  this  doctrine  has  the  internal  sense  of  the Word” 
(AC 10276:8).
  But  there  is  really  no  contradiction  here.    For  the 
doctrine of genuine truth is formed from passages in the 
letter of the Word where the truths of the spiritual sense 
stand forth naked without clothing; and “where the Word 

 
 
60

Doctrine and the Church

is thus naked, there its goods and truths appear naked as 
in  heaven,  thus  such  as  they  are  in  the  spiritual  sense” 
(AE  778:6).   And  these  naked  truths  “are  in  themselves 
spiritual-natural  truths”  and  “serve  for  the  church’s 
doctrine”  (De Verbo  10:7).   This  is  exactly  what  is  said 
of the Writings, which consist throughout of naked truths 
which the rational mind can grasp (AE 1061; HD 7).

Since the naked truths in the Scriptures are really the 
shining forth of the spiritual sense in the natural sense, it is 
permissible to speak of them as belonging to either.  Thus 
the Writings sometimes urge the necessity of drawing all 
doctrine from the literal sense of the Word, and at other 
times show the danger of forming doctrinal opinions from 
the  appearances  or  the  correspondential  clothing  of  the 
literal sense.

The  naked  truths  which  make  up  the  true  doctrinal 
contents  of  the  literal  sense  are  therefore  identiﬁ ed  as 
the outcropping spiritual sense, or the natural form of the 
spiritual sense.  All the clear teachings about the unity of 
God—about love to the Lord and charity to the neighbor, 
repentance,  the  incarnation,  the  existence  of  heaven  and 
hell—are of the spiritual sense in the letter.  And when we 
read the rest of the Scripture in the light of such teachings, 
many  of  the  parables  and  symbolic  representations  of 
the  letter  become  transparent  from  within.    When,  for 
example,  we  see  the  clear  teaching  that  God  is  love,  a 
heavenly Father, we also see that when we read that God 
punishes and that He is angry and even creates evil, this is 
according to the human appearance.

The  doctrine  of  the  church  in  many  things  therefore 
“recedes from the literal sense of the Word” (AC 9025:2).  
The literal sense—in such a context—means the clothing 
of sensual correspondences.  When the literal sense means 

 
 
 
Doctrine of Genuine Truth

61

this, we can say that “the spiritual sense does not appear in 
the sense of the letter” (SS 5).

Since  there  are  two  different  usages  for  the  phrase 
“literal  sense,”  there  are  also  two  different  deﬁ nitions 
given to the expression “the spiritual sense.”  In one set of 
teachings, the spiritual sense is described as hidden within 
the  letter  and  known  only  in  heaven.    In  another,  the 
spiritual sense is deﬁ ned as identical with the true doctrine 
of the church (AC 9025:2).  Thus we read:

From  the  sense  of  the  letter  of  the Word  any  doctrinal 
thing whatever can be hatched . . . but not so if doctrine 
is formed from the internal sense.  The internal sense is 
not only that sense which lies concealed in the external 
sense . . . but is also that which results from a number 
of passages of the sense of the letter rightly collated and 
which is discerned by those who are enlightened by the 
Lord in respect to their intellectual.  For the enlightened 
intellectual  discriminates  between  apparent 
truths 
and  real  truths,  especially  between  falsities  and  truths 
(AC 7233:3)

  And those are enlightened who see that love of the Lord 
and charity are the essentials of the church.  These people 
learn, and priests teach, from doctrine and not merely from 
the appearances of the letter. Thus, by unfolding the literal 
truths, they come to understand also things which belong 
to  the  spiritual  person,  whereas  others  are  inclined  to 
invalidate spiritual truths by insisting on the appearances 
of the letter.
  Doctrine can unfold external truths, such as are of the 
literal sense, so that spiritual-natural truths become visible.  
A priest does this when he collects and compares various 
open teachings in the Word and by the doctrine thus formed 

 
62

Doctrine and the Church

explains some obscure text or parable or some symbolic or 
prophetic statement not before understood.  For the New 
Church, the doctrine of genuine truth has already been thus 
collected in the Writings, and therefore the Scriptures can 
now be unfolded with ease by anyone whose intellectual is 
enlightened and who knows something about the science 
of correspondences.

The Writings give the spiritual sense of certain parts 
of the Word directly and clearly.  Other parts of Scripture 
they do not directly explain; but still they give the doctrine 
of  genuine  truth  in  fullness,  and  from  this  the  spiritual 
sense  can  be  unfolded,  although  many  human  elements 
may  interfere:  incomplete  knowledge  of  the  doctrine; 
lack  of  illustration;  or  ignorance  of  the  correspondences 
employed in the text.

The  spiritual  sense  revealed  in  the  Writings  is  not 
the  internal  sense  itself  such  as  the  angels  see  it,  which 
is couched solely in spiritual ideas, but is the “spiritual-
natural  sense”  (AE  1061;  De  Verbo  10:7).    Nor  could 
any  preacher  presume  to  claim  that  his  expositions  of 
the  Word,  or  his  doctrinal  presentations—which  have 
authority  only  so  far  as  they  consist  of  acknowledged 
truths—are anything more than truths from the spiritual-
natural  sense  of  the  Word—that  sense  in  which  angelic 
ideas can be rationally conveyed to people in the general 
forms of doctrine (see AC 8443).

The Danger of Drawing Doctrine from 
Correspondences

The  Writings  give  particular  warnings  against 
the  notion  that  doctrine  can  be  gathered  by  means  of 
correspondences;  or  that  one  can  construct  a  spiritual 

 
 
 
Danger of Drawing Doctrine

63

sense from correspondences.  True doctrine comes from 
naked  truths  which  are  visible  to  the  church  and  which 
cannot  be  disputed.    What  is  obscure  or  questionable  is 
therefore to be left for further examination and should not 
be made essential.  Perhaps the time will come when it will 
be understood, when enlightenment will be increased.

It would be the height of folly to interpret any one’s 
thought from one’s most obscure words.  Fairness dictates 
that we judge meaning by clear and explicit utterances.  In 
the same fashion, it is unfair to formulate doctrines from 
the correspondences of the Word, instead of attempting to 
interpret the doctrine from clearer statements.  The Writings 
therefore  teach  that  the  function  of  correspondences  is 
simply to illustrate and corroborate and conﬁ rm what the 
doctrine teaches (SS 56).  Unfortunately, they can conﬁ rm 
falsities as well as truths.

No  one  can  see  the  spiritual  sense  except  from  the 
doctrine of genuine truth; from this doctrine the spiritual 
sense  can  be  seen,  when  there  is  some  knowledge  of 
correspondences. He who is in false doctrine cannot see 
anything of the spiritual sense. He draws out and applies 
the correspondences which he sees to the falsities of his 
doctrine;  and  thus  he  can  still  more  falsify  the  Word. 
Wherefore  the  true  spiritual  sense  of  the Word  is  from 
the Lord alone. This is the reason why it is not permitted 
anyone in the natural world, nor in the spiritual world, to 
investigate the spiritual sense of the Word from the sense 
of its letter, unless he is wholly in the doctrine of Divine 
truth  and  in  enlightenment  from  the  Lord.  Wherefore 
from  the  doctrine  of  Divine  truth  conﬁ rmed  from  the 
sense  of  the  letter  of  the  Word,  the  spiritual  sense  can 
be  seen,  but  doctrine  can  never  ﬁ rst  be  seen  from  the 
spiritual  sense.  He  thinks  falsely  who  says  within 

 
64

Doctrine and the Church

himself, I know many correspondences, I can know the 
true doctrine of the Divine Word, the spiritual sense will 
teach it to me.  This cannot be done.  But, as has been said, 
let him say with himself, I know the doctrine of Divine 
truth, now I can see the spiritual sense, provided I know 
correspondences.  But still this must be in enlightenment 
from the Lord, because the spiritual sense is Divine truth 
itself in its light, and is meant by glory, and the sense of 
the letter by a cloud in passages in the Word where these 
are mentioned. (De Verbo 21:1-2)

== Chapter Five

The Derivation of the Heavenly Doctrine from 
the Literal Sense

In connection with the New Jerusalem, the Apocalypse 

Explained states that “the doctrine of the New Church 
which is signiﬁ ed by that city, is solely from the sense of 
the  letter  of  the Word”  (898).    For  this  reason  “the  wall 
of  the  city  had  twelve  foundations,”  to  signify  that  “the 
Word, in the sense of the letter, contains all things of the 
Doctrine of the New Church” (AE 902), and that in these 
foundations were “written the names of the twelve apostles, 
to represent “all things of doctrine” (AE 903).  The wall 
of the city was of jasper and the foundations were adorned 
with  precious  stones,  to  signify  that,  with  those  of  the 
New Church, all things of doctrine from the literal sense 
of the Word will be translucent and will appear in light, 
according to reception (AE 911, 914).  Elsewhere the True 
Christian  Religion  states  that  the  external  of  the  Word, 
or the sense of its letter, “is like a wall with foundations, 
which encompasses a city and protects it” (n. 217).

The Heavenly Doctrine of the New Jerusalem, as to its 
structure, its walls or fundamental tenets, was derived from 
the literal sense, thus from the Old and New Testaments.  
From other teachings it is evident that it was constructed 
out  of  the  naked  truths  or  genuine  truths  which  actually 
are from the spiritual sense shining through the heavy veil 
of  correspondences,  even  as  the  soul  manifests  itself  in 
the human body.  It is also said that the New Jerusalem 

 
 
 
66

Doctrine and the Church

descended  out  of  heaven,  but  it  had  to  descend  into  the 
Word in its literal sense and manifest itself there, for the 
soul cannot manifest itself except in and through its body.
This  may  be  illustrated  by  an  infant  whose  bodily 
form we see and whose human soul we discern in various 
ways, but whose mind, spirit, or character we know little 
of until he or she grows up and begins to express them in 
speech and writing.  All the potentialities were there from 
the beginning, but lay hidden.

In  a  similar  way,  the  same  Doctrine  which  is  given 
as new to the New Church, “was indeed given before in 
the Word [but] could not be seen” (Lord 65).  In the Old 
Testament, interior truths rarely stand forth to view (AC 
3373:2); the New Testament gives more interior truths (AE 
948, 641, 670).  But the Writings now present all the open 
truths of the Word in fullness, organized into a doctrine of 
genuine truth, in the light of which the literal sense itself 
becomes translucent and begins to speak with greater and 
deeper meaning.  And the truths which are nakedly visible 
in the literal sense of the Scriptures are the same with those 
seen in the Writings, and have the same spiritual-natural 
quality  and  carry  the  same  conviction  to  our  rational 
minds.    It  is  also  true  that  every  genuine  truth  in  the 
Writings is not only drawn from open Scriptural teachings 
but is conﬁ rmed and corroborated by a number of passages 
from the literal sense, both open and clothed, so that the 
doctrine of the Writings is intimately interwoven with the 
rest of the Word.  Even abstruse doctrines, such as those 
of creation and of the spiritual world and of the discrete 
degrees of the mind, rest upon Scriptural evidence.
  No  Christian,  without 
leading  and 
inspiration  which  the  Lord  vouchsafed  Swedenborg, 
could have constructed a New Jerusalem, or a doctrine as 

the  Divine 

 
 
Heavenly Doctrine from the Literal Sense

67

comprehensive, from the naked passages of the Scripture.  
But  the  New  Jerusalem  was  held  up  as  a  distant  goal 
before  the  early  Christians,  and,  although  they  were 
unable to see any spiritual sense in their own Gospels or 
in the Apocalypse, yet from naked teachings in the New 
Testament they did see something of a spiritual meaning 
in  the  Law  and  the  Prophets  (see  Hebrews  8-10).   And 
they  could,  and  to  some  extent  did,  construct  from  the 
naked truths a doctrine of genuine truth adequate to their 
spiritual needs.  If heresies had not torn the Church asunder 
even in its tender beginnings, they could have come into 
increasingly greater spiritual light (AC 4489:3; TCR 109, 
378).  When Christianity declined and the charity of many 
waxed cold and faith became mostly blind and verbal, the 
open truths of the Word were more and more hidden by 
false interpretations, and the literal sense became only a 
ﬁ eld of conﬁ rmations for contending heresies.  Therefore 
Christians  could  not  any  more  construct  any  adequate 
doctrine of genuine truth, and the Lord made His second 
advent to restore this doctrine in its Divine clarity.

The  Lord  then  did  what  humans  could  never  have 
done.    He  restored  the  knowledge  of  correspondences 
and through this revealed the spiritual sense of the entire 
Word.

It  is  important  to  observe  the  manner  in  which  the 
Lord introduced Swedenborg into the science or doctrine 
of correspondences.  He gradually opened Swedenborg’s 
spiritual  senses  so  that  he  could  compare  spiritual 
and  natural  things  and  see  how  spirits  and  angels  rest 
their  thoughts  upon  the  corresponding  natural  ideas  of 
people  in  this  world.    At  the  same  time,  the  Lord  also 
led  Swedenborg  to  study  the  Scriptures,  to  compare  all 
the  passages  where  the  same  symbols  appear,  and  thus 

 
 
68

Doctrine and the Church

to recognize the consistency of their usage.  And by this 
mode of comparing passages, Swedenborg was led to an 
increasing  understanding  of  the  naked  or  genuine  truths 
of doctrine, which furnished the key to the meaning of the 
correspondences.  This part of Swedenborg’s preparation 
occupied many years and involved his making an biblical 
index  in  which  he  noted  the  correspondences  of  names 
and words, and also provided a running commentary now 
known by its English title, The Word Explained.

The spiritual sense and the doctrine of genuine truth 
were disclosed to Swedenborg by Divine inspiration while 
he  “read  the  Word,”  and  not  merely  read,  but  studied.  
For  knowledge  comes  by  study,  not  by  inspiration.  
Knowledge was necessary before inspiration could become 
Revelation!

Drawing Doctrine by Comparison of Passages

Even as the inspired Swedenborg was led to ﬁ nd the 
spiritual sense through a comparison of those passages of 
the literal sense of the Word in which the genuine truths of 
the internal sense are not covered up by symbolism but are 
openly addressed to human reason, so the Writings direct 
all of us to go to the Word and draw out thence doctrine 
which  may  serve  us  to  see  something  of  the  spiritual 
meaning of the Word, and aid in the life of regeneration.  
For  without  doctrine  constructed  from  the  naked  truths 
we  will  be  led  away  into  all  manner  of  errors  to  which 
ignorance and willfulness draw us.  Without such doctrine 
as a lamp we would remain in whatever ideas have been 
given us and would never progress to understand the less 
obvious  truths  of  revelation  (SS  41).    Without  doctrine 
formed  by  comparing  the  truths  of  revelation  with  each 

 
 
Drawing Doctrine by Comparision

69

other and by reading doubtful passages in the light of clear 
doctrines, we would remain in confusion as to the meaning 
of much in the Word which yet might assist us greatly to 
see the will and the way of God.

The priesthood (which is given the chief responsibility 
for maintaining the integrity and purity of this doctrine of 
the church) therefore proceeds in the study of the Word by 
collecting  and  comparing  all  the  clear  teachings  which 
bear upon each subject.  To proceed in the opposite fashion, 
and  seize  upon  some  strange  or  obscure  statement  and 
twist all other teachings to agree with it, or to nullify those 
clear teachings by reading some arbitrary correspondential 
meaning into the text, would lead to endless confusion and 
error.

The  genuine  truths  of  the  Word,  in  contrast  with 
the  appearances  or  sensual  correspondences,  are  of  the 
spiritual sense in the letter, and are called spiritual-natural 
truths (De Verbo 10:7).  It is from these that doctrine is to 
be formed or drawn, and when rightly formed it is really 
doctrine from the internal sense of the Word, and serves 
for building the conscience of the internal church.

Consider whether anyone can know the Divine truths of 
the Word in the literal sense, except by doctrine drawn 
thence; and that if he have not doctrine for a lamp he is 
carried away into errors.…  The doctrine which should 
be for a lamp is what the internal sense teaches, thus it 
is  the  internal  sense  itself  which  in  some  measure  lies 
open to everyone who is in the external from the internal, 
that is, whose internal man is open, although he does not 
know what the internal sense is. (AC 10400)

Even  in  this  world  one  is  in  the  internal  sense  of  the 
Word when he is in the genuine doctrine of the Church 

 
 
70

Doctrine and the Church

as  to  faith  and  life;  for  by  means  of  this  doctrine,  the 
internal sense of the Word is then inscribed on both his 
understanding and his will. (AC 9430)

He who knows this doctrine has the internal sense of the 
Word. (AC 10276:8)

The truth of the internal sense of the Word is the same 
with  the  genuine  truth  of  the  doctrine  of  faith  of  the 
Church. (AC 9035)

And  nothing  else  of  the  spiritual  sense  can  be  seen  by 
those on earth!

For this reason we are told that a conscience can be 
formed with those in every dogma, even with gentiles, but 
that it is better in proportion as its truths approach more 
nearly to the genuine truths of faith (AC 2053:2).  Those 
of  the  internal  church  know  more  things  of  the  internal 
sense of the Word and their good is therefore qualiﬁ ed by 
interior truths such as are of the internal sense, by which 
their  conscience  is  formed  (AC  7840,  1098).    In  every 
case, conscience is formed from truths seen and known.  
Even interior truths can of course be known by the evil, 
but they are not received and therefore they do not form 
any conscience (AC 2531).

The  Word  is  said  to  be  supported—or  its  power  in 
the  church  is  said  to  be  supported—by  doctrine,  which, 
however, must be drawn from the Word.  This is represented 
by  Aaron’s  and  Hur’s  supporting  the  hands  of  Moses 
when he held out the rod of God during the battle with the 
Amalekites.  The literal sense, separated from the genuine 
truths of the spiritual sense which shine forth through it, is 
not doctrine itself, but consists of correspondences which 
can be twisted to conﬁ rm any fanatical idea.  If we read 
Scripture  from  a  doctrine  that  comes  from  some  other 

 
 
Drawing Doctrine by Comparision

71

source  than  the  Word,  we  do  not  support  the  Word,  but 
pervert  it,  and  we  pass  by  its  real  teachings  (AC  9424).  
On the other hand, they who, in a state of enlightenment, 
have collected genuine doctrine from the Word, when they 
read the Word

see  truths  everywhere  which  agree  and  see  nothing  at 
all repugnant: for they do not stick in such things of the 
Word  as  are  expressed  according  to  appearances  and 
according to the common apprehension of man, because 
they know that if the appearances are unfolded or as it 
were  unswathed,  the  naked  truth  is  therein  laid  open. 
(AC 9424)

With  them,  therefore,  doctrine  supports  the  Word,  and 
defends it and the Church from the ravages of those evil 
spirits who are called “Amalekites,” who infuse falsities of 
interior and hidden evil which especially assault the goods 
of faith.  And this happens suddenly, in the moments of 
our greatest weakness, never when we are in the vigor of 
resistance (AC 8593).  Against these genii, who attack the 
good of the church and indirectly the Word, doctrine from 
genuine truths is the only defense.  For those of the spiritual 
church,  and  the  church  in  general,  alternately  come  into 
states of obscurity and thus into weakness of faith, since 
self and the world are considered; and then, unless there 
is a renewal of genuine doctrine from the Word, the Word 
loses its power—as with Moses when his hands were not 
upheld by Aaron and Hur (AC 8607).

Doctrine and the Church

Drawing Doctrine from the Writings

  When instructing us that doctrine is to be drawn from 
the naked truths which stand forth in the sense of the letter 
of the Word, the Writings speciﬁ cally refer to the Old and 
New  Testaments.    But  since  the  Lord  has  now  Himself 
drawn  forth  these  naked  truths  and  presented  them  as  a 
doctrine of genuine truth in the Writings, those of the New 
Church  go  directly  to  these  Writings  for  their  doctrine, 
rather than collect Scripture passages.  In our childhood, 
we learn the open teachings of the Scriptures, and we build 
up our ﬁ rst doctrine from the literal sense.  But the adult 
who draws doctrinal concepts directly from the Writings, 
does  not  thereby  divorce  them  from  the  whole  ﬁ eld  of 
thought which the literal sense presents.  The Doctrine of 
the Lord’s Gloriﬁ cation cannot be divorced from the literal 
facts  of  the  incarnation.    The  Doctrine  of  Regeneration 
is  simply  drawn  from  the  naked  truths  concerning  how 
a  person  is  born  again  of  water  and  of  the  Spirit.    The 
Writings make this clear by constant citations.  Thus we 
draw doctrine through the Writings from the literal sense 
of Scripture.  The body of Divine Revelation is one and 
indivisible.

This  is  recognized  by  the  priest  who,  in  preaching, 
collects  spiritual-natural  truths  both  from  the  Biblical 
Word  and  from  the  Writings  and  by  their  means  opens 
the selected text of the literal sense, so that we may see 
the doctrine of love and charity in its accommodation to 
progressive human states and in its place in the symbolic 
order  of  regenerate  life.    It  is  in  the  literal  sense  of  the 
Word that the naked spiritual-natural truths of doctrine can 
be seen in their ultimate order and human connection, in 
their  holiness,  and  in  their  power  (De Verbo  18:4,  20:2-
3,5;  AE 1087, 1088).

Enlightenment and Doctrine

In all the teachings about the presence of naked truths 
in the Word and our ability to draw these truths from the 
Word  and  to  form  a  genuine  doctrine  sufﬁ cient  for  our 
needs so that we actually see something of truth from the 
spiritual  sense,  there  is  a  special  proviso—a  condition.  
This condition is not that we should know that there is an 
internal sense within the Word or know what it is like; for 
even those who do not have the doctrine about the spiritual 
sense can perceive spiritual-natural truths, which are mainly 
truths of the doctrine of love and charity (AC 10400).  Nor 
do  we  need  to  know  the  doctrine  of  correspondences  in 
order to see such truths.  But the condition is that we should 
be in something of spiritual light, light which comes from 
the Lord out of heaven and causes what the Writings call 
“illustration” or “enlightenment” or “illumination.”
  Common sense tells us that for seeing there must be 
light!  It also tells us that light derives from heat or from 
an inner activation of a substance.  For any kind of mental 
or  spiritual  seeing  there  must  be  some  kind  of  mental 
“light.”    And  this  mental  light  must  also  originate  in  a 
spiritual heat—a ﬂ ame of interest, affection, or love.  The 
old saying that “the wish is father to the thought” is usually 
employed as a warning that our thoughts are apt to be bent 
to ﬁ t in with the dictates of our heart; but nonetheless it 
illustrates the universal law that some affection or love is 
necessary if we are to think.  What we have no affection 
for,  or  what  our  loves  or  ambitions  have  no  use  for,  we 
discard from our thoughts.
  Humans ﬁ nd this very convenient.  When they are in 
the delight of some evil love, truth has little weight with 
them.  They dismiss facts which “stare them in the face,” 
while  conﬁ rming  their  intentions  or  bolstering  up  their 

 
74

Doctrine and the Church

position with specious arguments based on appearances.  
They  view  all  things,  all  people,  in  the  deceptive  light 
of their ruling love, and ﬁ nd actual pleasure in deluding 
themselves and others.  If they could not, they would ﬁ nd 
themselves in misery.
  But  if  this  were  the  whole  picture,  the  human  lot 
would be hopeless.  For from heredity our love is evil, and 
from that love we could see nothing but phantasies—the 
phantasies of self.  We would view the world as revolving 
around ourselves and as a servant of self, and value others 
only so far as they did us honor.  For this reason, the Lord 
provides  that  we  should  be  furnished  with  “remains”  or 
deep-seated states of innocence and charity unconsciously 
formed in infancy, which enable us to think as of ourselves 
from  others  or  from  truths  of  civil,  moral,  and  spiritual 
origin, and to be affected by the loves which other people 
and spirits have, and thus to view things in a light borrowed 
from others.  By this means we are enabled to have our 
understanding  built  up  separately  from  our  own  selﬁ sh 
will.
  Much is said in the Writings about this human faculty 
to  “understand  what  is  good  and  true  even  when  we 
do  not  will  it.”    This  is  provided  in  order  that  we  may 
become free to be reformed and regenerated, and therefore 
this faculty exists with the evil as well as with the good 
(AC  3539:6).    The  understanding  can  be  elevated  into 
the  light  of  heaven  and  we  can  thus  appear  as  wise;  yet 
whatever  of  the  understanding  transcends  our  love,  is 
not  really  or  permanently  our  own  (DLW  368).    This 
elevation  is  possible  from  a  love  of  knowing  and  being 
wise  even  when  there  is  no  love  of  applying  the  truths 
to life, or of shunning evils as sins.  The light by which 
we  see  is  indeed  from  heaven,  but  heaven  is  not  in  us.  

Enlightenment and Doctrine

75

As  soon  as  our  own  love  is  aroused,  and  our  own  will 
or  ambition  asserts  itself,  another  light  is  kindled  which 
distorts the truth.  It may indeed appear as a very brilliant 
and  exceptional  light  which  brings  with  it  a  sense  of 
ﬂ attery and achievement, and even leads us into fanatical 
enthusiasms (AC 6865:3).
  When  the  Writings  speak  of  enlightenment  being 
necessary  for  the  seeing  of  truths  and  goods  from  the 
internal  sense,  which  stands  forth  when  a  number  of 
passages of the letter are rightly collated (AC 7233), they 
refer  to  enlightenment  by  the  Lord.   And  a  person  is  so 
enlightened “when he is in the love of truth for the truth’s 
sake and for the sake of the uses of life, and not merely for 
the sake of self and the world” (AC 9424:2).  For genuine 
love of truth has charity in it, and love to the Lord; and 
thus it communicates with heaven.
  Now the Arcana notes that “they who are enlightened 
concerning  truths  are  those  few  who  are  in  the  doctrine 
and at the same time in the life of truth” (9186:3, emphasis 
added).  They who are in the true doctrine are indeed few, 
when  the  large  mass  of  humanity  is  considered.    And 
among these few not all are regenerating.  Still fewer are 
those  who  actually  gather  and  construct  for  themselves 
doctrine  from  the Word  in  order  to  read  the Word  in  its 
own  light.    For  mostly,  those  who  seek  enlightenment 
inquire from the Word only to learn whether the doctrine 
given by others and received by the congregation, agrees 
with the Word.  If they ﬁ nd that it does not, they dissent, 
but take care lest they disturb the church.  To the things 
which  agree  with  the Word,  they  assent.    In  such  a  way 
a doctrine develops which they take as their own (SS 59; 
AC 6047:2, 6822, 5432e). 

76

Doctrine and the Church

But  this  takes  place  only  with  those  who,  not  being 
distracted by the affairs of the world, have ability to see.  
These,  if  they  love  truths  because  they  are  truths  and 
make  them  uses  of  life,  are  in  enlightenment  from  the 
Lord.  Others who are in any life according to truths, can 
learn from them. (SS 59)

It clearly appears from this that not all who are within 
the church are necessarily “enlightened.”  And of course 
there  are  various  kinds  and  degrees  of  enlightenment.  
One type is that which is proper to the clergy who are not 
“distracted by the affairs of the world” (SS 59; cf. Faith 
30; TCR 354:3; AC 1295, 8981:3-4) and who, by virtue of 
preparation  and  ordination,  consultation  and  study,  have 
a  professional  illustration,  which  becomes  genuine  only 
if they love truths spiritually.  The enlightenment in their 
case, as always, comes from their putting the truth before 
self.  Similarly, all those of the New Church have a type of 
enlightenment by virtue of the Writings.  One can claim to 
be a New Churchperson, but one does not in spirit belong 
to the New Church unless one has a love of truth and—
so far—is in some state of regeneration, at least as to the 
rational, which is the ﬁ rst thing to be regenerated.  Hence 
we read:

It  is  granted  to  the  people  of  the  New  Church  that  is 
called  the  Holy  Jerusalem  to  behold  the  Divine  truths 
that are in the Word, not sensually, that is, according to 
appearances,  but  spiritually,  that  is,  according  to  their 
essences; for this reason the internal sense of the Word, 
which is spiritual and is solely for those who will be of 
that church, has been disclosed . . . Those who are of that 
church are enlightened by the spiritual light of the Word 
by inﬂ ux from the Lord out of heaven, for the reason that 

 
Enlightenment and Doctrine

77

they acknowledge the Divine in the Lord’s Human and 
are in the spiritual affection of truth from Him.  They and 
no others receive the spiritual light which is continually 
inﬂ owing . . . with all who read the Word.  From this they 
have enlightenment. . . . All who are of that Church have 
the understanding enlightened. (AE 759)

It  is  sufﬁ ciently  clear  that  this  does  not  refer  to  the 
membership of any church-body, but of all in this world 
and  in  the  spiritual  world  who  receive  the  Lord  in  His 
second advent.  For what other purpose did the Lord come 
if not to enlighten humans and spirits?

Every receiver of the New Church, while reading the 
Writings and the Word, may at times experience the feeling 
as if his or her understanding were elevated and illustrated 
by their truths.  The light of heaven and something of its 
heat seem to affect us; but only so far as we think as from 
ourselves,  from  knowledges,  which  are  in  natural  light.  
We  cannot  perceive  the  inﬂ ux  or  its  origin.    Yet  there 
are indications—however elusive—that we have been in 
enlightenment (AC 10551:2, 346; SS 41; DLW 252, 256; 
DP  169).    What  we  are  unable  to  determine  is  whether 
this state of illustration was due to a temporary elevation 
of  the  understanding  in  the  sphere  of  others  or  was  due 
to the opening in us of the spiritual degree by a love of 
spiritual uses which the Lord causes to be formed with the 
regenerate.  The humility which comes of self-knowledge 
makes us hesitate to do more than hope that the light will 
prove constant, or will at least return.

It is notable that the Word instructs each one “according 
to  his  ends  and  affections”  (AC  3436).    Illustration  is 
therefore applied to the uses of people, making it possible 
for  them  to  recognize  the  truths  and  principles  which 
might  assist  them  to  apply  charity  with  judgment  in  the 

 
 
78

Doctrine and the Church

varied  situations  of  their  lives.   A  clergyman,  therefore, 
would pretend to little illustration as to the many ﬁ elds of 
secular life, except so far as they concern him as a citizen; 
and the laity would hesitate to formulate abstract doctrine, 
since they have only a private responsibility in matters of 
doctrine (AC 6822).  It is the love of uses which determines 
the ﬁ eld of one’s enlightenment.

The illustration of the clergy is also modiﬁ ed by the 
perception  which  each  priest  has  according  to  the  states 
of his mind formed by doctrinals.  If these doctrinals be 
true,  the  perception  becomes  clear  from  the  illustration 
of  the  Divine  light;  but  if  false,  there  will  be  obscurity, 
although by conﬁ rmations it may appear clear in the light 
of infatuation.  Illustration may also be turned into various 
kinds  of  heat,  according  to  a  one’s  disposition,  for  evil 
delights excite a zeal with is inwardly unmerciful, while 
the  delights  of  a  good  love,  though  they  may  outwardly 
blaze  and  thunder,  contain  charity  and  kindness  within.  
Thus, with the priest, illustration, which is from the Lord, 
is qualiﬁ ed by his perception and by his disposition, and 
these  three  elements  determine  the  instruction  which  he 
receives and imparts (TCR 155).

Self-conscious “Enlightenment”

Enlightenment is a gift of God—like the manna of Israel, 
fresh each morning.  It cannot be obtained by solicitude 
(AC  8478)  or  hoarded  by  the  self-conscious  proprium5 

5  The  word  “proprium”  is  taken  from  the  Latin.  It  means  “what  is 
one’s own,” or “what belongs to one.” It is used to refer to our sense 
of self, that sense of our personal identity. This sense of self is corrupt 
from birth by virtue of our hereditary inclination for evil. It causes us 
to  instinctively  attribute  life  to  ourselves,  and  causes  us  to  suppose 

 
 
Self-conscious “Enlightenment”

79

for later states, for thereby it breeds falsities (AC 8481).   
And—like the “good of truth” 6—it “cannot long remain 
pure” with one of the spiritual church (AC 8487:2).  As 
soon as we claim to possess it, it vanishes away.

To  receive  illustration,  therefore,  we  must  shun  the 
temptation of regarding truths from ends of honor, gain, 
or reputation (AC 10551:3).  In seeking the truths which 
are of life, our task is simply to “gather the interior sense 
of  the  Word  from  various  passages  where  the  sense  of 
the  letter  is  explained”  and  to  compare  them  carefully, 
reﬂ ecting upon them with a prayer to the Lord for leading 
(AC 10028:2, 6222:3, 7233, 3436).  We are careful not to 

that we are the source and judge of good and evil. With regeneration 
we are given a new proprium that acknowledges that all good is the 
Lord’s. This is called the “heavenly (celestial) proprium” (see chapter 
10).
6 The “good of truth” or “good from truth” is a term that the Heavenly 
Doctrine uses to characterize the ﬁ rst phase of regeneration with us. 
In this phase, through the discipline of our understanding we are given 
a good in our life and will that is a result of our efforts to apply the 
truth. The “good of truth” is contrasted with the “truth of good” or 
“truth from good.” This term characterizes the second phase in regen-
eration, when we are able to act more spontaneously from a new will. 
We then see truth in a new way from the state of good that we’re able 
to receive from the Lord. (See chapter 8, section on “New Truth—the 
Only Truth  of  the  Church,”  pp.  121-125.) This  process  of  having  a 
new will of good given through the work of the understanding is the 
way  of  the  spiritual  person—as  opposed  to  the  way  of  the  celestial 
person of the Most Ancient Church. The “good of truth” is also called 
“spiritual  good,”  because  the  spiritual  person  is  regenerated  (given 
good)  through  the  understanding  of  truth.   The  celestial  person,  by 
contrast, began with a sound will and grew from there in the percep-
tion of truth by which he afﬁ rmed the good that ﬂ owed in to the will.

 
80

Doctrine and the Church

rely too conﬁ dently on our own state.  We humbly grant 
that others, who may differ from us, might also enjoy the 
gift of enlightenment.
  And  yet!    How  we  have  conjured  with  that  word!  
How often have we not sought to overawe each other by 
the claim of being more “enlightened!”  How apt are we 
to  fawn  before  someone  who  assumes  a  pose  of  greater 
profundity  or  makes  the  pretense  of  greater  sanctity  or 
more interior perception!  
  When  arguments  from  common  sense  run  out,  we 
will  therefore  attempt  to  dismiss  all  opposition  by  the 
bold claim that we are more enlightened or have a deeper 
insight into the matter; or, perhaps, that we are guided by 
an inner light which none but we and our kind can see.  In 
the Christian Church there arose repeatedly teachers and 
sects which claimed special enlightenment.  Some called 
themselves “Gnostics” and some “Illuminati.”  All tended 
to set aside the naked teachings of the Word, sometimes by 
substituting an inner or mystical sense or some idealistic 
philosophy  by  which  they  even  denied  the  Lord’s  sole 
Divinity or the actuality of His advent in the ﬂ esh.  For 
when dependence is placed upon an alleged illustration or 
an inner light, the authority of the Scriptures is shattered.  
Such movements contributed to the decline of Christianity 
as  much  as  did  crude  literalism.    The  Lord  had  already 
warned that this would be the case:

For false christs and false prophets will arise and show 
great signs and wonders, so as to deceive, if possible, even 
the elect.  See, I have told you beforehand.  Therefore if 
they say to you “Look, He is in the desert!” do not go 
out; or “Look, He is in the inner rooms!” do not believe 
it.  For as the lightning comes from the east and ﬂ ashes 

Self-conscious “Enlightenment”

81

to the west, so also will the coming of the Son of Man be. 
(Matthew 24:24-27)

The  doctrine  of  Divine  truth  is  one  of  naked  truths 
which shall be clear as lightning, and perceptible both to 
the good and the evil, even though the evil will not receive 
it, nor even retain it, because with them it will dissipate.  
Doctrine  in  the  church  must  therefore  be  judged  by  its 
ﬁ delity  to  the  naked  truths  of  revelation,  and  not  by  the 
supposed enlightenment of its proponents, or by whether 
it  is  put  forth  as  “interior”  or  “spiritual”  or  “celestial.”  
What is in the “secret chambers” of others’ minds we do 
not  know—nor  what  is  their  state  of  good  from  which 
their perceptions spring or by which their enlightenment 
is conditioned.  Besides, even those who are interiorly in 
illustration  may  be  sadly  misinformed  and  ignorant  and 
mistaken.    They  may  be  in  enlightenment  about  some 
things,  seen  in  certain  states,  and  be  in  obscurity  about 
other things, or while in other states.  Especially are we 
warned  against  judging  one’s  spiritual  state  (which  is 
known to the Lord alone) or the state of the church around 
us, since this no one on earth can do and only the Lord can 
reveal it (CL 523; LJ 41: AE 453, 386:10).

If we accept doctrine on the testimony of only those 
whom  we  regard  as  “enlightened,”  faith  becomes  mere 
persuasion.   And  since  we  cannot  know  for  certain  who 
has genuine illustration and who does not, the truth of a 
doctrine taught in the church cannot be ascertained to our 
rational satisfaction except by our going to the Word for 
ourselves and seeking enlightenment from its naked truths.  
This  is  impossible  for  many,  who  because  of  simplicity 
prefer to rely on others.  Nor can it be done in childhood 
or  before  the  rational  mind  has  become  stabilized  and 
knowledge and experience have increased so that mature 

 
 
82

Doctrine and the Church

judgment and discernment are possible.  Until that time, 
our  faith  is  largely  a  faith  in  authority,  or  a  “historical” 
faith.7

7  “Historical  faith”  (ﬁ des  historica)  is  an  immature  faith,  based  on 
what others have recounted to us (—perhaps why called “historica”) 
rather than on our own investigation, experience, and rational convic-
tion (see Faith 1; AR 838; AE 242.5, 250.9, 815.4, 9).

== Chapter Six

The Function of Historical Faith8

In all phases of human life, there has always been, and 

will continue to be, a subtle conﬂ ict between the Past and 
the Present, between tradition and independent thought, a 
conﬂ ict which sometimes breaks out into open rebellion 
while at other times it ends in the surrender of the mind to 
the dead hand of dogma or custom.  It is the ancient rivalry 
between  society  and  the  individual,  between  order  and 
freedom.  Every generation comes to recognize not only 
that the Past is its mother and teacher and guide, the source 
of a greater store of wisdom than any one generation can 
garner, but also that people indisputably inherit the faults 
of the Past and suffer from its mistakes.  And even under 
the  best  of  circumstances  it  is  plain  that  human  beings 
are  not  responsible  solely  to  guard  the  wisdom  of  the 
Past and to hand it on blindly, but also to appreciate and 
understand it and apply it to the problems of Today with a 
new illustration.

There is not much to choose between a blind insistence 
on  custom  or  dogma,  and  a  contemptuous  rejection  of 
that  tradition  which  embodies  the  experience  of  the 
past.  Tyranny and rebellion are equally ugly, and each is 
permitted only because of the hardness of human hearts.  
Growth does not come from such cruel combats, but from 
the gradual adjustments between the new and the old.  In 
the  tissue  of  every  normal  life  the  free  patterns  of  our 

8 See p. 82 for a deﬁ nition of this unique concept.

 
 
 
84

Doctrine and the Church

thoughts are—like a weft—interwoven upon the warp of 
tradition,  and  both  are,  ﬁ rmly  but  gently,  stretched  over 
the loom of experience.

Therefore  the  only  commandment  which  carries  a 
promise  says,  “Honor  your  father  and  your  mother,  that 
your days may be long upon the land which the Lord your 
God  is  giving  you.”    Each  generation  must  respect  the 
past, must learn from its parents, must have an afﬁ rmation 
toward their faith, their opinion, and the customs and ways 
which they approve.  It is so that the foundations of human 
life are laid in an atmosphere of conﬁ dence and trust.

The Lord has provided that the proprium of children, 
their  self-will  and  desire  for  self-leading,  should  not 
assert itself at once in tender years.  If it did, and children 
claimed  independence  prematurely—before  they  could 
learn  that  in  reality  all  independence  is  merely  relative 
and an appearance—they could learn nothing and would 
not even survive the results of their own mistakes.  The 
Lord therefore leads infants into delights of innocence—
delights  which  come  when  others  do  things  for  them 
or  tell  them  what  to  do.    The  “remains”  of  such  states 
linger throughout life, and are the basis for an afﬁ rmative 
response towards parents and teachers and towards those 
in authority.  Inmostly, this is a beginning of a love of the 
Lord and an obedience to His commandments.
  Along with this, there begin by degrees to form in the 
child’s mind a loyalty and affection for the church and its 
instruction.  It is necessary that this conﬁ dence in the church 
should be free of all doubts and reservations, and parents 
must be on guard lest their own critical comments should 
confuse the minds of children in whom the foundations of 
faith are being laid.

 
 
 
The Priesthood

85

There  is  special  need  for  care  that  the  faith  of  the 
young should not suffer when they are becoming aware of 
the apparent contradictions in the literal sense of the Word 
and yet are not ready to enter into the interior truths of the 
spiritual  sense.    The  church  is  the  spiritual  Mother,  but 
the Word is the heavenly Father.  Both must be honored, 
the Word because it is the Divine source of all truth and 
good  and  the  church  because,  through  her,  we  receive 
nourishment  and  protection  in  adaptation  to  our  state.  It 
is  the  function  of  the  church  to  feed  the  minds  of  those 
who depend upon it, or—as we say—who “belong” to the 
church.  And for this reason the priests of the church are 
called “pastors” or shepherds, and the people are called a 
ﬂ ock.

The Priesthood

The  church  is  organized  with  this  use  in  view—that 
we may be led by truths to the good of life.  This use is the 
essential use of the priesthood.  And the love from which 
the priesthood is to perform it is the love of the salvation 
and health of souls (Life 39; Charity 160).  This love ought 
to be present in all those of the church.  If it were not, the 
priesthood would receive no support, and there would be 
no church and no organized uses.  But in the priesthood this 
love takes a specialized form, as is necessary whenever a 
use is to be preserved and perpetuated.

The Writings point out that the use exists before the 
form (DLW 46), as the soul before the body.  In fact, the 
use, or the need, is what creates the form.  It is so with all 
the organs of the human body, it is so in the development 
of human society, and it is so in the church.  The need of 
a  priesthood  is  obvious.    In  patriarchal  times,  the  oldest 

 
 
 
86

Doctrine and the Church

man or the head of the clan or tribe, served as priest; later, 
the  responsibility  for  ordering  the  worship  and  spiritual 
instruction of the people was placed upon men specially 
prepared and ordained.  The priestly ofﬁ ce, as every other 
use, ofﬁ ce, or profession, has frequently become perverted, 
by a love of dominion or a lust for lucre or worldly honors.  
But this fact does not take away the need for such an ofﬁ ce. 
In the present state of society, the interests of religion could 
not be maintained without an organized church, which sees 
to it that what is Divine and what pertains to heaven and 
thus  spiritual  and  moral  life  may  be  among  us  (Charity 
130,  131,  135).   And  the  Heavenly  Doctrines  teach  that 
order cannot be kept in the world without governors who 
are to observe all things which are done according to order 
and those which are done contrary to order, and who see 
that rewards and punishments encourage good and restrain 
evil.  Governors of ecclesiastical affairs are called priests, 
who among themselves also have order and subordination, 
lest,  from  caprice  or  ignorance,  someone  permit  evils 
which would destroy the proper order (HD 311-319).

The function of priests is to teach people the way to 
heaven  and  also  to  lead  them  there.   And  they  ought  to 
teach them according to the doctrine of their church from 
the Word.  This doctrine they should ﬁ nd in the Word by 
comparing  the  lucid  teachings  in  the  literal  sense  with 
each  other;  and  if  they  do  this  in  a  state  of  illustration, 
or from the affection for truth, the resulting doctrine will 
indeed disclose and embody something of the spirit of the 
Word.    “The  true  doctrine  of  the  church”  is  indeed  “the 
internal  sense,”  and  it  is  from  this  that  priests  ought  to 
teach, if they are to teach from the enlightenment of their 
ofﬁ ce (AC 9025).  A clergyman is therefore inaugurated at 
his ordination by a promise of the Holy Spirit and by the 

 
The Priesthood

87

representation of its transfer, by the laying on of hands; but 
enlightenment is received by him according to the faith of 
his life (Canons 36:7; TCR 146, 155).
  We are therefore taught that, if the church is in a state 
of order, the Holy Spirit, or the Divine truth of the Word, 
which is the source of enlightenment, passes from the Lord 
into the clergy and through them into the laity9 (Canons 
36;  see also Canons H.S. iv. footnote).  For doctrine which 
is  drawn  in  enlightenment  is  the  doctrine  of  love  and 
charity, and this opens the minds of those who receive it 
to illustration from the internal sense of the Word, or from 
the very spirit of truth which shall guide us into all truth.  
This  Spirit  is  indeed  the  Divine,  proceeding  as  spiritual 
light and heat.  And according as we receive the doctrine 
of truth taught from the Word through preaching, we may 
thus be affected by enlightenment.  This is the essence of all 
priestly uses.  If the church is not in order (either because 
the clergy is not in illustration or because its uses are not 
recognized), this channel of enlightenment is closed, and 
the Holy Spirit can then proceed only through individuals 
who may be in illustration while they read the Word.

It  is  notable  that  “the  Word  must  needs  be  taught 
mediately through parents, teachers, books, and especially 
the  reading  of  it.    Nevertheless  it  is  not  taught  by  these 
[agencies],  but  by  the  Lord  through  them.    And  this 
preachers  know  .  .  . They  are  able  to  declare  the Word, 
indeed, and to bring it to the understanding of many, but 
not  to  the  heart  of  anyone;  and  what  is  not  in  the  heart 

9  More accurately: “passes from the Lord by means of the clergy to 
the laity” (a Domino per clericum procedat ad laicum).  Per is bet-
ter translated “by means of” here rather than “through.” The clergy 
are not so much a conduit, as “through”  might imply, as they are a 
means by which the Lord passes directly into the laity, as suggested 
in Canons 36.5.

perishes in the understanding.” Thence it is clear that “one 
is  led  and  taught  immediately  by  the  Lord  when  this  is 
done from the Word” (DP 172:6).

The Doctrine of One’s Church

The  ofﬁ ce  of  the  priesthood  is  of  Divine  origin  and 
has  a  Divine  representation.    But  its  uses  are  performed 
by fallible men who cannot invariably be in equal states of 
illustration nor in the clear sight of all aspects of doctrine 
and life.  Even in a truly living church, not all of its priests 
are  necessarily  in  illustration  from  the  Lord;  those  who 
are not take the doctrine of their church from others.  If 
this be a doctrine of genuine truth, priests may still be the 
medium  for  transmitting  illustration  to  the  people.    For 
it  is  the  doctrine,  not  the  priest,  which  evokes  an  inﬂ ux 
of  spiritual  light.    “The  priestly  ofﬁ ce  itself  is  holy, 
whatever be the quality of him who ministers.  Hence it is 
that the Word which an evil man teaches is equally holy, 
also the sacrament of baptism, and the Holy Supper, and 
the  like”  (AC  3670;  cf.  10309).    Such  priests  “have  no 
communication with heaven in themselves; but those who 
hear and take in the words from their mouths have it, if 
they are in a pious and holy internal; for it matters not from 
whom the voice of good and truth ﬂ ows forth, provided 
their life is not manifestly wicked, for this causes scandal” 
(AC  4311:3;  cf.  AC  10735).    Scandal  breaks  down  all 
respect  for  the  church  and  thus  destroys  the  afﬁ rmative 
attitude which is essential if instruction is to be received.
  Despite the fallibility of the men who are in the ofﬁ ce 
of  the  priesthood,  it  is  an  institution  which  protects  the 
doctrine of the church from perversion.  It is thus directly 
stated:

 
Doctrine of One’s Church

89

Good can be insinuated into another by any one in the 
land,  but  not  truth,  except  by  those  who  are  teaching 
ministers.  If others do it, heresies arise, and the church 
is  disturbed  and  torn  asunder.    Charity  is  practiced,  if 
through the truth which is of the church, the neighbor is 
led to good. . . . Everyone must ﬁ rst obtain for himself 
truth from the doctrine of the church, and afterward from 
the Word of the Lord; this must be the truth of his faith. 
(AC 6822)

  What is here called “the doctrine of the church” refers 
to the doctrine of people’s own church-body, the doctrine 
actually taught by its priests.  Such doctrine is necessary, 
and this even if it is accompanied by false teachings.  For 
it is still bound to bring out certain general truths from the 
Word, by which the simple can proﬁ t.  Thus the Lord said, 
“the scribes and the Pharisees sit in Moses’ seat.  Therefore 
whatever they tell you to observe, that observe and do, but 
do not according to their works; for they say, and do not 
do” (Matthew 23:2, 3; cf. LJ 59).  It is in mercy provided 
that something of the good of truth, or spiritual good,10 can 
be formed with every person if he lives according to the 
doctrine of his own church (AC 8042, 8521, 8311).  When 
the end is to do what is good, even falsities, believed from 
the innocence of ignorance, may be accepted by the Lord 
for truths (AC 7887, 9258).

Falsities  of  doctrine  do  indeed  tend  to  conﬁ rm  evil 
rather than good.  Yet we cannot be introduced into any 
truth whatsoever unless we are ﬁ rst induced to think from 
others.  And since “those of the spiritual church have no 
perception of truth Divine,” the people of our present race 
must instead be furnished with “conscience, which is formed 

10 See footnote 6 on page 79 re the term “good of truth.”

 
90

Doctrine and the Church

from the truth and good which they have acknowledged 
within their own church, of whatever kind these may be” 
(AC  7233).    No  one  can  know  from  intuition,  nor  from 
perception, whether a “truth” is true (AC 4844:3, 3388).  
And  especially  in  adolescence,  one  “ought”  therefore  to 
procure  the  truths  of  faith  from  doctrinal  things,  having 
faith in those who have drawn them from the Divine Word, 
“because as yet he has not the judgment which will enable 
him to see them for himself from the Word” (AC 5402).

It  is  especially  dangerous  to  spiritual  life  lightly  to 
extinguish a faith so formed, even though it be a faith in 
the teachings of others, for along with what may possibly 
be  erroneous,  we  might  thus  cast  away  the  very  truth 
itself.  Especially in youth, we need a doctrine—even if it 
be borrowed—by which to maintain our faith in the Word, 
for doctrine is required to explain the many appearances 
and  apparent  contradictions  of  the  literal  sense  without 
injury  to  the  holiness  of  the  Word  (AC  9039).    And  it 
is  most  likely  that  if  we  reject  the  doctrine  of  our  own 
church, or the “faith of his fathers,” we are only placing 
ourselves  under  the  tutelage  of  others  or  of  some  other 
church—those  in  whose  enlightenment  we  trust.    For 
historical faith is the only faith of which we are capable 
until  we  attain  to  a  rational  perspective  and  are  able  to 
commence regenerate life.

For this reason, we learn that, the Lord never breaks the 
faith of childhood, but as far as possible bends it (AC 9039).  
He bends our faith by leading it by natural affections and 
delights—by “intermediate goods.”  Childhood and tender 
years  are  overshadowed  and  protected  from  violence  by 
natural  loves  for  family  and  friends,  by  loyalties  and 
by  social  bonds  of  various  kinds.    These  affections  or 
“domestic goods” are corporeal and natural and worldly, 

 
 
Doctrine of One’s Church

91

and interiorly they center—more or less unconsciously—
around self.  Yet they serve as bridges by which adolescents 
pass over into an appreciation of others and of their social, 
moral, and spiritual environment, becoming afﬁ rmative to 
the church and to the spiritual gifts which the church offers 
(AC  3518,  4063,  3982,  4145).    But  it  is  also  important 
that  these  mediating  goods  do  not  become  so  conﬁ rmed 
that  they  come  to  dominate  life.    For  this  would  arrest 
spiritual development.  The purpose why children are held 
so dependent upon home and school and are so immersed 
in  these  natural  affections,  is  that  they  may  thereby  be 
led to an afﬁ rmative attitude towards the doctrine of their 
church, which must be the starting-point of spiritual life.

If,  on  the  other  hand,  youths  simply  accept  what 
others  tell  them  to  believe,  and  do  what  the  moral  code 
dictates, yet never from choice reﬂ ect about eternal life or 
think about the salvation of their soul—but indulge only 
in worldly loves, in dreams of pleasure, and in ambitions 
for prosperity and success—then the path of reformation 
becomes arduous. For then, the Arcana informs us, they 
can  be  reformed  only  through  combats  and  struggles, 
anxieties, hardships and misfortunes, which cause worldly 
loves to subside so that they can be touched by spiritual 
good—not  deeply  enough  so  that  they  will  make  such 
good their own, but enough to conﬁ rm themselves in the 
truth of the doctrine of their church (AC 8981).  Thus they 
may be “reformed,” yet not “regenerated.”  They cannot be 
brought into an affection for truth, but only into obedience 
to the doctrine of their church.  They cannot be led to the 
good of spiritual life, but only to certain good delights of 
natural life (AC 8987).
  Human  states  are  so  varied  and  so  complicated 
by  hereditary  genius  and  temperaments  as  well  as  by 

 
92

circumstances  and  free  decisions  that  they  refuse  to  be 
neatly classiﬁ ed.  Gradations and kinds of faith, too many 
by far to enumerate, differ in their content of truth or in 
their  spurious  or  persuasive  character  (TCR  344-346).  
Reception of the teachings of one’s church will always be 
partial, as far as the understanding is concerned, and one 
carries  into  life  only  what  one  understands.    Faith  may 
be only apparent, or of the memory alone.  It may even 
be hypocritical.  It may be forced, or persuasive.  People 
may read their own misunderstandings into the tenets of 
their  church,  either  perverting  its  truth  into  dire  falsities 
and fantasies, or reading their own truths into some creed 
that reeks of falsehoods; or they may modify its falsities in 
the light of common sense to turn a deaf ear to what might 
be contrary to their concept of charity or reason.
  When  people  become  adults  and  the  rational  mind 
begins to rule thinking, they may come to recognize the 
simple  fact  that  the  doctrines  of  a  church  are  not  true 
merely because the heads of the church have said so and 
their  followers  afﬁ rm  it  (AC  6047).    They  may  realize 
that the tendency of those in a church is to acknowledge 
the  principles  which  its  founders  have  promulgated    
(AC 7233), and they may suspect that very few read the 
Word from any affection for truth but that most do so from 
an  affection  for  conﬁ rming  from  the Word  the  doctrines 
of  the  church  within  which  they  were  born  (AC  6047).  
They may see that the true function of the “doctrine of a 
church” and the function of its shepherds is to lead people 
to  the  Word,  the  fountain  of  living  waters,  the  wells  of 
salvation.

Danger of Conﬁ rming

93

The Danger of Conﬁ rming

To all who are in truths it is allowable to conﬁ rm them 
by rational and sensual things, and particularly by things 
from the Word (HH 455e; AC 5008:6).  But throughout, 
the Writings warn against conﬁ rming the doctrine of one’s 
church  from  the  Word  before  one  inquires  whether  it  is 
true.  There is of course nothing dangerous in desiring to 
begin to support the uses of the church-body to which we 
belong as soon as we are able to do so and begin to see the 
spiritual  purpose  behind  them.   To  delay  giving  support 
and cooperation until we can be assured in our own minds 
that we no longer depend upon the faith of others but have 
expunged everything of “historical faith” from our minds, 
would  be  singularly  foolish,  and  is  likely  to  be  only  an 
evasion of responsibility.  For all our lives we will bear the 
marks of historical faith, and will be somewhat inﬂ uenced 
by tradition and education.
  But  we  are  warned  not  to  be  satisﬁ ed  with  merely 
second-hand instruction, not to accept our religion merely 
as a hereditary prejudice.  If we conﬁ rm truths of doctrine 
without inquiring from the Word whether they are really 
the teachings of Revelation, we can have no clear sight as 
to what we should build up into a conscience to furnish 
spiritual  motives  for  our  actions.    In  order  to  purify  our 
motives,  we  must  analyze  our  reasons  for  doing  things, 
and learn to love truth and good for the sake of truth and 
for the sake of the uses of life, and not merely because the 
acceptance of the truth caters to self-respect or reputation 
or  furthers  our  social  advantages.    No  matter  how  true 
the doctrine of the church may be, it is easy to conﬁ rm it 
merely from reasons of proprium and to wrap it up in our 
natural affections and to defend it from personal prejudice 
or  because  it  is  the  easiest  thing  to  do  or  because  one’s 

 
94

Doctrine and the Church

pride of expressed opinion dictates it.  Everyone associates 
pride and self-intelligence with what one has once said or 
thought.

Such conﬁ rmation of doctrinal opinions by the Word 
is  done,  usually,  by  the  selection  of  passages  which  are 
out of their context and not connected with all the other 
teachings on the subject.  They are therefore “one-sided,” 
or viewed obliquely.  The light in which such conﬁ rmation 
is effected is called “sensual lumen,” and appears dark in 
the view of heaven.  But, to those who are in it, it appears 
resplendent, and falsities viewed in its light appear exactly 
like truths, “and even more true than truth itself,” because 
the fallacies of the senses join in (AC 5008:6, 6222:2, 5, 
6865:3).

If  we  simply  conﬁ rm  the  doctrine  of  our  historical 
faith  from  natural  loves,  our  faith  becomes  not  only 
unperceptive and external, and unable to see into the real 
essence  of  things,  but  it  becomes  brittle  and  vulnerable.  
It  becomes  such  that  it  cannot  apply  itself  to  varying 
circumstances.  It makes externals unduly important and 
tends to judge others without mercy.  It will be sensitive to 
any criticism, and tends to divide the church into partisan 
groups.  And since such faith rests upon personalities, it 
may perish—and with it perhaps the hope of ever reaching 
the truth—in which case one’s conﬁ dence in the leadership 
of the church could be shaken.
  Conﬁ dence  in  the  illustration  of  others  is  in  itself 
necessary  and  wholesome.    It  keeps  the  mind  receptive.  
It  inculcates  humility.    It  is  the  beginning  of  faith.    But 
it does not furnish a lasting criterion of truth, nor does it 
make faith spiritual and rational.  It does not make faith 
one’s own.

 
 
Use of Doubts

95

The Use of Doubts

Therefore  it  is  permitted  that  at  the  beginning  of 
adult life, when we begin to feel responsible for the use 
of spiritual gifts of freedom and reason and truth, we are 
wont to come into states of doubt.  If we are afﬁ rmative 
to  spiritual  truth,  this  doubt  is  not  a  critical  attitude  but 
essentially a realization that we have accepted truth from 
what  may  be  merely  selﬁ sh  and  worldly  motives.    This 
may blind us to the truth or to some aspects of the truth, and 
possibly cause us to misunderstand the instruction which 
we have received.  And we are then moved to go directly 
to the Word and search for the truth therein, making sure 
that  we  read  the  Word  in  its  own  light,  from  the  naked 
truths  therein,  and  not  from  any  doctrine  or  principle  of 
alien origin, nor from mere appearances which would tend 
to confuse and distract.

It is according to the laws of order that no one ought to be 
persuaded about truth in a moment . . . Nor ought truth be 
so conﬁ rmed in a moment as to leave no doubt whatever 
about it; because truth so impressed becomes persuasive 
truth, and is devoid of any extension and of any yielding 
quality.  (AC 7298; for a more complete explanation, see 
entire  number  and  Exodus  story  regarding Aaron’s  rod 
becoming a serpent.)

The  rational  mind  needs  time  to  digest  calmly  what  is 
offered  it.  And  therefore,  when  a  truth  is  presented  to 
good spirits in the other life, something opposite is soon 
afterwards  presented  which  causes  doubt  and  affords  a 
contrast, so that they can “collect reasons and thus bring 
the truth into their minds rationally” (AC 7298).

There should be no haste in so important a matter as that 
of ﬁ nding the real truth (AC 9039).  Haste and impatience 

 
 
96

Doctrine and the Church

belong  to  time  and  space,  and  take  away  illustration.  
Impatience is often a sign of immaturity, for the rational 
mind suspends judgment to allow for sufﬁ cient reﬂ ection.  
It  does  not  act  on  impulse.    Nor  should  there  be  undue 
concern  or  anxiety,  since  if  the  Lord  is  approached  and 
petitioned, He will give leading and enlightenment in His 
good time.  No time is lost, for people have many things 
that they can do from charity to others and from love for 
the Lord and the church; and in all their life-time they will 
never settle all the questions of doctrinal truth.  Indeed we 
are  warned  that  the  ability  to  settle  differences  between 
matters of faith within the church, comes by degrees, and 
is given only with those of more advanced age who may 
have the interiors of their minds enlightened (AC 6766).
  Yet any rational person can explore the Word and thus 
form a faith in genuine truth which he or she feels to be 
the doctrine taught in the Word by the Lord Himself, and 
which  therefore  rests  on  one’s  pronouncement.   All  that 
is required is the desire to have the Lord teach us.  Our 
object then is not to prove or disprove what we may have 
been taught, or to bolster our conceit by ﬁ nding novelties, 
or  to  settle  the  more  intricate  questions  which  perhaps 
puzzle the more mature minds of the church.  (Spiritual 
Experiences notes that new scruples and difﬁ culties will 
continue to occur to our ﬁ nite minds even to eternity.  No 
truth can be understood inﬁ nitely!  nos. 3667, 1955)  But 
our  object  is  to  ﬁ nd  a  doctrine  of  life—that  doctrine  of 
love  and  charity  which  is  the  very  spirit  and  purpose  of 
all Revelation, and which is the spiritual sense as it stands 
forth before those who seek it from a love of truth for the 
sake of the uses of life.
  And  those  who  seek  shall  ﬁ nd.    How  much  of 
spiritual-natural  truth  we  may  ﬁ nd  while  here  on  earth, 

Use of Doubts

97

will  however  depend  on  many  things.    Worldly  duties 
and occupations are a limiting factor (TCR 354; SS 59).  
If the doctrine of the church is not one of genuine truth, 
our mind will also be held back, for it is not possible for 
us to divest ourselves from all its falsities.  Besides this, 
the good within a person—the good of truth11—is formed 
by conjunction with the truth received within the church; 
and thus—even though we may see new truths from the 
Word  by  an  enlightenment  of  our  understanding—our 
new will cannot be affected by it except as we progress in 
regenerate life and are at the same time enlightened “in a 
special manner”  (AC 7233:2).
  But what we cannot receive in this world, in a conscious 
way, may yet be inscribed upon us interiorly—and stored 
up as heavenly riches which will await us in the other life.  
The important thing is that we have received faith in the 
Lord  from  the  Lord,  not  from  others.   Truth  seen  in  the 
Word  from  illustration  is  seen  in  freedom,  because  it  is 
seen from the love of truth.  This love opens the mind to 
the Divine truth proceeding from the Lord.

== Chapter Seven

The Formation of Faith
We have pointed out in previous sections:

a)  that the Heavenly Doctrine is the revelation of 

the spiritual-natural from and in the Word
b)  that these spiritual-natural truths appear in the 

literal sense of Scripture as naked truths

c)  that these truths are one with the spiritual sense 

of Scripture

d)  that doctrine for the church and those of the  
church is to be drawn from these spiritual-
natural truths and thus drawn out of the literal 
sense, yet may also be spoken of as doctrine 
from the out-cropping spiritual sense

e)  that doctrine cannot be rightly drawn unless we  

are in a state of illustration from the Lord;

f)  that doctrine drawn from the Word by 

enlightened people is a doctrine of genuine 
truth, and thus a medium for the enlightenment 
of those of the church according to their state
g)  that the priesthood should serve as an orderly 

medium for the promulgation of the doctrine of 
genuine truth and thus for enlightenment

h)  that when the doctrine presented in the church 
is ﬁ rst received it is taken on historical faith, or 
on the “say-so” of those who are considered to 
be enlightened

 
 
100

Doctrine and the Church

i)  that this historical faith is normal and necessary 
in childhood and youth, but that it is no test of 
truth and is not yet our own

j)  that historical faith (which is possible even with 
the evil) can be conﬁ rmed from merely natural 
affections and in a merely sensual light, which 
is disorderly and dangerous

k)  that we must therefore go to the Word ourselves 

and search it with a prayer to the Lord for 
enlightenment

l)  and, lastly that it is not the Word as such but 
the understanding of the Word—or the purity 
and integrity of doctrine—that makes and 
establishes the church. But in the individual the 
church is instituted by “a faith according to the 
truths, and a life according to the goods, which 
[one] derives from the Word and applies to 
oneself” (TCR 245).

§ § § § §

Thus the church is varied in every person according to 
one’s faith and life.  Yet there are two ways of procuring the 
truths which are of faith: one way is through the doctrines 
of the church, conﬁ rmed because others have taught them; 
the other way is through the Word, which we consult when 
we have sufﬁ cient judgment to be able to see truths with 
our own eyes (AC 5402).  The ﬁ rst way does not lead into 
a faith of one’s own, nor actually into a faith in the Word, 
but into a faith in others; and this is not permanent.  But 
whatever truths we procure for ourselves from the Word, 
we come to believe because they are from the Divine, and 
thus we believe and conﬁ rm “from a faith given from the 
Divine” (AC 5402).

 
 
 
 Formation of Faith

101

There  is  no  pretense  in  the Writings  that  people  can 
suddenly  free  themselves  from  all  that  they  have  been 
taught by others and approach the Word with an altogether 
empty  mind.    Not  only  would  this  be  impossible,  but  it 
would be unhealthy.  For through the teachings of others 
many  remains  are  implanted  which  in  providence  guide 
one’s  whole  life.    But  a  church  may  be  judged  by  its 
willingness  to  lead  its  people  to  the Word  of  God.   The 
true  function  of  “the  doctrine  of  the  church”  is  to  open 
the Word for all, and this occurs when genuine truths are 
taught and when the Word is given as the ﬁ nal authority.

This  is  the  reason  why  the  ﬁ rst  “principle”  of  the 
Academy proclaims that in the Writings “is contained the 
very essential Word, which is the Lord,” and that “from 
them the Lord speaks to His church,” and that “the church 
acknowledges no other authority and no other law.”  All 
the  Academy  “principles”  are  thus  relegated  into  their 
place,  as  a  statement  of  various  “doctrinals”  which  the 
church has recognized as taught within the Writings and 
has preached as a protection against various falsities and 
evils which infested the church.  Such principles are not 
a “Divine” doctrine, but have weight and validity because 
each of us may for ourselves draw them from the Writings 
and  then  conﬁ rm  them  further  by  the  Writings,  by  the 
literal  sense  of  the Word,  by  reason,  and  by  experience.  
Only what we see for ourselves in the Writings as a part 
of  the  Divine  Doctrine  partakes  of  the  Divine  authority 
which the Writings possess.

The  ﬁ rst  acknowledgment  which 

the  doctrine 
of  the  church  should  inculcate  is  that  we  should 
believe the Word:

The  acknowledgment  of  what  is  Divine  is  the  ﬁ rst 
thing; for then an idea of holiness is present which gives 

 
 
 
102

Doctrine and the Church

universal  conﬁ rmation  to  each  and  everything  that  is 
said,  even  though  it  be  not  comprehended.  (AC  3388, 
emphasis added)

[Truth]  for  the  ﬁ rst  time  becomes  manifest  when  [a 
person]  believes  from  a  simple  heart  that  it  is  truth 
because so said by the Lord. Then the shades of fallacies 
are dispersed, and then nothing in him prevents him from 
apprehending it. (AC 1911:6)

The true order is that a person should know or be wise 
from  the  Lord,  that  is,  from  His  Word;  then  all  things 
follow  in  proper  order,  and  then  he  is  also  illustrated 
in  rational  and  scientiﬁ c  things.  [One  is  therefore  not] 
forbidden to learn the sciences, since they are useful and 
pleasant in life; [nor is one] prohibited from thinking and 
speaking as the learned do in the world; . . . he must do 
so, however, from this principle, that the Word of God 
ought to be believed. (AC 129)

“A person is ruled by the principles he adopts, even 
though they be most false” (AC 129).  It is vital, therefore, 
that  he  should  approach  the  Word  with  this  as  his  only 
principle: that all principles should be formed from things 
seen in the Word.
  We are taught that those who read the Word without 
doctrine as a lamp “are in the dark concerning every truth, 
and their mind is wandering and uncertain, prone to errors.  
They easily fall into heresies which they also embrace if 
favor or authority supports them and their reputation is not 
endangered” (TCR 228; SS 52).  But the same is said of 
those who read the Word from a false principle previously 
assumed, whether it be some doctrine adopted from others 
or one invented by themselves.  The doctrine which must 
serve as a lamp must be drawn from the Word—from the 

 
Formation of Faith

103

Word  in  its  clear  and  naked  statements.    It  could  not  be 
expected  of  us  that  we  should  form  our  conscience  and 
faith  except  from  such  truths  as  plainly  appear  in  the 
Scripture  and  in  the  Writings.    What  seems  difﬁ cult, 
uncertain,  or  obscure,  we  should  set  aside  for  future 
meditation and study, confessing it to contain truths which 
we are not yet ready to understand.  It is from clear and 
transparent teachings that we build our faith, conscience, 
and conviction.  These truths we see to be from the Lord, 
and not from any human.  These truths are also spiritual-
natural truths—truths from the spiritual sense.  Those of 
the external church see few and gather few such truths, and 
few make up their conscience.  But those of the internal 
church, who are moved by the spiritual affection for truth, 
receive many such truths into their conscience.
  We  are  cautioned  against  thinking  that  the  spiritual 
sense of the Word is that sense which we would draw to 
conﬁ rm  the  ecclesiastical  dogma  of  our  denomination 
(TCR  194).    As  we  have  shown,  it  is  easy  to  conﬁ rm 
views  in  which  one  has  pride  or  to  which  one  has  been 
committed.  But the spiritual sense can be seen as genuine 
truths in the literal sense when an affection for truth leads 
us to hear from the Word the Lord’s directions as to how 
to live a life of charity and use, and thus come to love the 
way of the Lord and the Lord Himself.
  No  special  “open  sesame”  is  required  for  us  to  be 
instructed  by  the  Lord  from  the  Word,  no  complicated 
credal  formula,  no  high  degree  of  learning.    Indeed  the 
Writings  frequently  state  that  the  simple  often  see  the 
essentials of the Word more clearly than the learned.  The 
Word is not closed to those who look for the doctrine of 
charity, and who search it from the affection for truth.  For 
each of us is instructed according to his or her state.

Doctrine and the Church

Natural Faith and Spiritual Faith

It  is  a  law  of  order  that  a  person  by  his  own  exertion 
and power should procure for himself faith by means of 
truths from the Word, and yet should believe that not a 
grain of faith is from himself but from God. (TCR 71:3)

This  power  or  faculty  is  from  the  Lord,  yet  we  feel 
it to be our own.  What we thus procure from the Word, 
by  thinking  of  its  truths  naturally  and,  so  far  as  he  can, 
rationally,  is  natural  faith,  and  is  at  ﬁ rst  knowledge, 
thought,  and  persuasion.    But  in  those  who  believe  in 
the  Lord  and  shun  evils  as  sins  against  Him  it  becomes 
conviction, trust, and conﬁ dence; it is ﬁ lled with the Divine 
Spiritual  essence—and  becomes  “spiritual-natural  and, 
through charity, living” (TCR 137:5, 339).  It is perfected 
according to the abundance and coherence of truths, and 
thus becomes luminous, more evident, clearer, and more 
and  more  alienated  from  evils,  from  the  allurements  of 
the  eyes,  and  from  the  lusts  of  the  ﬂ esh  (TCR  352).    It 
becomes “not only a treasure in the heart but also a jewel 
in the mouth” (TCR 379).

Those who search the Word from an affection for truth, 
imploring  the  Lord  that  in  His  light  they  may  see  light, 
procure  the  things  of  faith  “from  the  genuine  fountain”; 
and  those  things  which  people  thus  acknowledge  as 
God’s  own  teaching,  build  up  the  conscience  and  “are 
appropriated  to  [them]  by  the  Divine”  (AC  5402).   And 
since  they  recognize  the  right  of  every  individual  to  do 
the same, “such do not disturb any one within the church, 
nor  ever  condemn  others,  knowing  that  every  one,  who 
is  a  church,  lives  from  his  own  faith”  (AC  5432).   This 
freedom of conscience is also protected in the church.  A 
person  should  be  pardoned  for  “denying  this  or  that  to

105

be  Divine  truth  from  the  Word  in  the  Church,  provided 
he  believes  that  in  the Word  are  Divine  truths”  (Canons 
37:9).    Therefore  the  Lord  said  that  “whosoever  speaks 
a word against the Son of Man, it shall be forgiven him” 
(Matthew  12:32).    “The  Son  of  Man  is  the  Divine  truth 
from the Word in the Church, and this can be seen by all” 
(Canons 37:9).  And “he who believes otherwise than the 
priest,” we read, “and makes no disturbance, ought to be 
left in peace; but one who makes a disturbance, ought to 
be separated; for this also is of order, for the sake of which 
the priesthood is established” (HD 318; AC 6047, 6822; 
cf. SE 3462 for an example of evil priests).

Interdenominational Relations

In  this  connection  we  must  emphasize  that  the  civil 
state  usually  guarantees  religious  liberty  or  tolerance  in 
varying  ways.    The  existence  of  many  religions  and  of 
denominations within these religions affords an ultimate 
for  the  spiritual  which  should  be  respected  in  everyone.  
The  church  must  also  recognize  that  doctrinal  errors  do 
not condemn people, even if—through such errors—they 
injure the spiritual life of others, so long as this injury is 
not  done  from  purpose  and  with  knowledge  of  its  evil 
effect.  Those who have entire faith in their religion though 
this is based on falsity, and who reason against truths and 
goods and persuade “as heretics often do who by scruples 
of conscience become zealots,” may not be doing so from 
any  evil  affection.    For  such,  charity  dictates  that  we 
prepare “cities of refuge.”  The order of the church must of 
course be protected when disturbance arises: for without 
order there is no true freedom; but that same order makes 
clear that we have no right or power to decide the inner 

 
106

Doctrine and the Church

motives or the spiritual state of those who differ from us 
(AC 9011).
  At times we may indeed all need such cities of refuge; 
for  we  cannot  always  discern  when  we  do  some  injury 
to the minds of others, especially by truth separated from 
good.  Truth, when we take merit in it, is like an axe-blade 
which may ﬂ y off the handle during the hewing of wood; 
and  when  we  are  deep  in  some  religious  controversy, 
as  in  a  deep  forest,  we  might  harm  the  spiritual  state  of 
others by too much zeal—wounding them unintentionally 
(Deuteronomy 19:4-5; AC 9011).  If we do, we must take 
refuge in the understanding charity of others.

Intellectual differences alone do not cause schisms and 
divisions within a church as long as the Divinity of the Lord 
and the holiness of the Word are acknowledged as well as 
a life of charity (AC 3451).  There may, however, be many 
organizations  in  the  church,  and  yet—as  in  the Ancient 
Church—a  general  state  of  harmony  (AC  1799,  2982).  
Such variety would bring perfection, and is comparable to 
the various diadems or jewels in a king’s crown (DP 259; 
AR 66, 73; TCR 763).  This is possible so far as the church 
refrains from claiming a Divine authority for the teachings 
of its leaders or priests or for the special principles of its 
founders or for the ideas and opinions of any person, but 
places  Divine  authority  in  the  Lord’s  Revelation—the 
Scriptures  and  the  Writings—admitting  that  others  also 
may have illustration from the Lord, and refraining from 
the  spirit  of  accusation  and  internal  judgment.    Fairness 
and  appreciation—and  forgiveness—are  ultimates  of 
charity which we must never forget.  “It is not angelic to 
enquire into the evils with a person unless the goods be 
enquired into at the same time” (AC 10381).  It is so that 

 
Controversies

107

we  should  judge,  for  it  is  so  that  we  would  wish  to  be 
judged.

Controversies

The  Writings  also  warn  us  against  the  loss  of 
enlightenment  which  may  come  to  those  who  engage 
in  controversies.    After  witnessing  a  debate  among 
spirits, Swedenborg says: “I noticed that some, after the 
disagreement, were so much in the dark that they did not 
know what was true—something that is likely to happen 
with  truths  that  are  argued  about  for  a  long  time,  which 
are  darkened,  so  that  the  debaters  are  afterwards  blind 
to  the  very  truth”  (SE  1937).  He  speaks  of  “those  who 
work  hard  in  disputes,  who  present,  and  even  make  up 
as  counter-arguments,  countless  points  that  agree  with 
their  premises  and  propositions,  and  in  so  doing,    more 
and  more  close  off  the  inward  meaning”  (SE  1953).    In 
such debates the general truth which should be held as the 
key premise “is overshadowed when one is too intensely 
bent  on  disputes,  for  then  the  truth  is  obscured”  and  so 
far is lost (SE 1955). The truth is obscured because there 
can  always  be  more  objections  raised  than  there  is  time 
and possibility to answer!  And there is also the tendency 
to  pay  more  attention  to  people’s  words,  than  to  their 
meaning (SE 1955).  The same occurs also with learned 
critics who in studying the Scripture gather a false sense 
from the bare words and so spoil the contextual meaning 
(SE 2041, 1950).

 
108

Doctrine and the Church

Individual Faith

  All who, from an affection for truth, explore the Word 
to see whether the doctrines they have been taught are true, 
and  then  ﬁ nd  that  these  do  not  coincide  with  the  truths 
which they see in the Word, are warned to “take heed lest 
[they] disturb the church” (AC 6047).
  But in a genuine church, the results of one’s sincere 
and rational search for truths in the Word are not likely to 
be such that such a search causes disturbance.  Individual 
study results in a faith which does not any more depend on 
the opinions of others or the leadership of others, but still 
accords with the doctrine of the church in all essentials, 
and differs only in respect to those ﬁ elds of inquiry which 
are  not  yet  clear,  and  which  need  to  be  the  subject  of 
further study within the church.  We must not think that 
because our faith is no longer dependent on others or on 
the authority of others, we are no longer dependent upon 
the administrations of the church and upon its teachings.  
A babe in the womb depends on the blood-supply of the 
mother.  When born it suckles her milk.  When weaned, 
the  child  must  still  look  to  the  mother  for  food.   When, 
therefore,  we  read  in  an  isolated  passage  in  the  Arcana 
that one “who has attained to spiritual good has no more 
need of doctrinals which are from others”—being in the 
end to which doctrinals are the means—we cannot infer 
that  the  regenerate  have  no  need  for  doctrine  but  see 
doctrine not in the light of others, or as an imposed rule 
of thinking, but seek the truth from a love of charity and 
use  (AC  5997).   And  they  ﬁ nd  this  truth—which  is  the 
doctrine of their life—in the Word and thence also in the 
doctrinal  instruction  of  the  church,  seeing  it  there  with 
a  greater  perception  of  its  truth  than  before.    They  then 

Function of the Rational

109

return to the Word to conﬁ rm it so that they may see it not 
as the doctrine of any person but as the truth of God.

The Function of the Rational

The formation of a personal faith and free conviction 
comes  about  when  we  have  acquired  knowledge  and 
judgment,  and  thus  when  we  come  into  adult  life.   Age 
is  necessary  to  mature  the  reason,  for  while  from  birth 
a  person  has  the  faculty  of  rationality,  there  is  only  a 
rudimentary  development  of  it  in  childhood  (AC  1893).  
While  children  also  have  freedom,  they  do  not  attain  to 
rational freedom until they have become civil, moral, and 
rational,  which  they  do  by  a  right  education  (TCR  564; 
DP 317; AR 161e).

It is through the rational that we are introduced into 
the Church.  By the rational, the natural self can think from 
cognitions12 and knowledges, and thus set things in their 
proper series and relationship, “and analytically dispose, 
discuss, separate and join, and at last draw conclusions.”  
This rational develops according as we use it for the ends 
which  we  love.    The  interior  thought  of  the  natural  self 
from  the  inﬂ ux  of  the  life  of  heaven  introduces  us  into 
spiritual thought, and makes us a church (AE 569:6).
  Rational people are able to understand truths if they so 
wish—even if they are evil.  But evil causes the rational 
to  be  closed  up  by  falsities.    Swedenborg  was  therefore 
permitted  to  use  rational  arguments  to  conﬁ rm  spiritual 
truths  in  order  to  disperse  such  falsities  (HH  455).   The 
rational is built up by means of instruction and through the 

12 Swedenborg distinguishes cognitiones (“cognitions”)—higher level 
knowledge, concepts—from scientia, knowledge that is simply held 
as fact.

Doctrine and the Church

elevation of the understanding above the native will which 
is  evil  and  sensual.    Through  this  elevation  we  can  see 
truths which are opposed to our evil ambitions and lusts, 
and  a  new  will  (which  begins  as  the  “good  of  truth”13) 
then  may  be  formed  by  the  Lord  in  our  understanding, 
from  which  we  can  enter  into  states  of  repentance  and 
reformation.

It is clear, therefore, that no one can become spiritual 
unless one ﬁ rst becomes rational.  For the Spiritual itself 
is  the  Divine  light  of  heaven,  and  this  must  inﬂ ow  into 
us  through  the  rational  if  we  are  to  be  affected  by  it 
(AE 654:15-16, 731:31, 995).  We become rational through 
truths,  civil,  moral,  and  spiritual,  and  from  the  spiritual 
truths  we  obtain  from  the  Word  and  through  doctrine.  
“In things purely rational, moral, and spiritual, truths are 
seen from the light of truth itself,” if we do not conﬁ rm 
ourselves in falsities.  Thus we can “think analytically, can 
form conclusions about what is just and right in judicial 
affairs, can see what is honorable in moral life, and good 
in spiritual life” (DP 317).  The perception of justice and 
rectitude  is  called  “common  sense,”  because  it  exists 
“naturally”; but at this day—owing to inherited evils—the 
perception of spiritual truth and celestial good do not exist 
naturally but can be given only as the fruit of regeneration 
(SEm 4644).
  Although the rational mind is needed to see truth, it 
does not follow that it is to be the ﬁ nal arbiter and judge of 
Truth itself, anymore than the eye is the judge of natural 
truth.   The  rational  is  only  the  receptacle  of  the  light  of 
heaven,  or  the  vessel  which  is  affected  by  truths.   And 
it  receives  truths  only  when  it  is  permitted  to  function 
normally, or when it is not closed by falsities or impeded 

13 See footnote 6 on page 79 re the term “good of truth.”

 
Doctrine and Reason

111

by ignorance or diverted by evil loves.  And even in its 
most perfect state, the human rational is ﬁ nite—limited; it 
can be affected by the Divine truth which is inﬁ nite, but it 
can never comprehend it or come to possess it.

Doctrine and Reason

The  Writings  therefore  show  that  a  person  cannot, 
by  reason  alone,  obtain  faith,  nor  construct  a  religion 
by systematic reasonings on the basis of merely sensual 
evidence.  What is called “natural theology” does not exist, 
for spiritual truths come only by way of Divine Revelation 
(De Verbo 6:1-5).).  Yet Swedenborg, himself fortiﬁ ed by 
a belief in Scripture, did seek to establish by reasonings 
that  God,  or  the  Inﬁ nite,  was  the  ﬁ nal  cause  of  creation 
(see De Inﬁ nito, published in 1734), admitting, however, 
that  while  the  existence  of  the  Inﬁ nite  could  be  proved 
by rational arguments to one willing to follow them, the 
quality of the Divine could be learned only from the Word.  
The will to believe can alone open the rational to receive 
the  truth.    Such  a  willingness  to  see  implies  a  certain 
innocence and humility, which is needful for learning.

For the formulation of faith, the Word and its Divine 
Doctrine  must  be  accepted  as  something  that  is  above 
one’s  human  reason.    One  must  see  “that  the  doctrinal 
things of faith are in their entirety from the Divine which 
is inﬁ nitely above the human rational” (AC 2519).  It is 
this process of conviction—not only that the ﬁ nal truth is 
higher than our understanding, but that God has actually 
revealed  His  essence  of  love  and  wisdom  and  the  laws 
of His government in the revealed Doctrine—that makes 
for faith.  Spiritual truth may at ﬁ rst be received because 
it is called Divine, and later because it is seen as Divine.  

 
 
112

Doctrine and the Church

But “the beginning must not be made from scientiﬁ cs” or 
by  reasonings  about  the  Divine  from  earthly,  corporeal, 
or material things; for thus truth is brought into negative 
light from a sense of the pride of one’s opinion and a love 
of self and the world (AC 6047; HH 353).  For reasoners 
then  do  not  want  to  see  truths  from  the  Lord,  but  from 
themselves. 

Still  the  Lord  wills  that  one  should  not  only  think  and 
speak about Divine things but should also reason about 
them . . . and this . . . reasoning, provided that it has for 
its end that the truth may be seen, may be said to be from 
the Lord with a person; but it is from the person until he 
sees the truth and acknowledges it. (DP 219)

“To look upon the doctrine of faith from the things of 
reason is not to believe in the Word or in the doctrine thence 
derived, until one is persuaded from rational things that it 
is so” (AC 2568).  The Arcana states that this is the wrong 
order, and that “the doctrine would become null and void, 
if the rational were consulted as to its content” (AC 2516, 
2538).   The  doctrine  here  meant  is  the  Divine  Doctrine, 
or the Word and the Writings.  Human teachings, which 
rest  upon  the  rational  abilities  of  those  who  propound 
them, must be subject to rational criticisms as well as be 
compared with the Word itself.  But the spiritual truth of 
the  Word  “must  be  rendered  up  without  taint  [immune] 
from the rational” (AC 2538).  For Divine doctrine is null 
and void so far as we take what is human as the ground of 
belief.
  What  then  is  the  function  of  the  rational?    It  is  to 
receive the doctrine of faith (AC 2519).  Truths of doctrine 
are therefore rational in form. They are accommodations 
of spiritual truth to human reason, as rational appearances 

 
Doctrine and Reason

113

of truth, or truth stripped of merely sensual appearances 
such  as  characterize  the  literal  sense  of  the Word  of  the 
Old and New Testaments.  The doctrine of genuine truth 
which  agrees  with  the  spiritual  sense,  also  agrees  with 
sound  reason,  with  the  laws  of  thought  impressed  by 
creation upon the rational mind, and with the order of the 
inﬂ ux of life through every human soul (TCR 8, 10, 12; 
AC 1308).  Every falsity goes counter to the laws of the 
rational mind.

The  ﬁ nal  source  of  all  falsity  is  evil.    Evil  invades 
the  rational,  and  seeks  to  divert  our  powers  of  thinking 
into conﬁ rmations of selﬁ shness and pride, using sensual 
appearances  as  its  special  tools.    Instead  of  rational 
thought,  it  substitutes  “ratiocinations.”    This  apparent 
“rational”  may  indeed  make  use  of  truths,  but  it  weighs 
the teachings of Revelation by its own measure and selects 
only such truths as will condone its own states, prejudices, 
and  opinions.    It  can  do  so  in  a  number  of  ways—by 
adding as well as by subtracting, by insufﬁ cient analysis 
or by false synthesis!  It can do so by blinding itself to the 
context-meaning and connection of the revealed doctrine.  
It can ﬁ nd some mode of interpretation which renders the 
doctrine void and null.  It can insist on drawing doctrine 
by  “correspondences”—or  claim  inner  meanings  which 
reverse  or  nullify  the  sense  of  the  naked  teachings  or 
genuine truths of the Word.  All such modes are condemned 
because  they  involve  “consulting  the  rational,”  and  thus 
they contort the doctrine.

For this reason the Writings say that when the church 
is being established, the doctrinal things of good and truth 
must be collected into a one—lest there be a defect and 
the human rational begins to supply what is lacking.  For 

 
 
114

Doctrine and the Church

this reason the church is provided with a Divine revelation 
which contains all such doctrinals (AC 3786).

Nunc Licet!14

The general truth which reconciles all these teachings 
concerning the rational is that there are two principles of 
thought—the afﬁ rmative and the negative.  The negative 
principle is to deny everything, unless convinced by such 
things  as  may  be  comprehended  or  felt;  and  this  leads 
people toward stupidity and madness, which increases the 
more  they  consult  rational,  scientiﬁ c,  and  philosophical 
things,  since  no  one  can  from  lower  things  comprehend 
higher things, such as celestial and spiritual, and, still less, 
the Divine things which transcend the understanding.  But 
those who, from an affection for truth, are in the afﬁ rmative 
principle,  begin  by  afﬁ rming  what  belongs  to  doctrine 
from the Word, and their ideas become fuller and wiser by 
the things of reason, philosophy, and science (AC 2568, 
3913).  They do not deny a thing merely because they do 
not  fully  understand  it,  and  therefore  they  can  continue 
to learn (see SE 2651, 2545, 3602, 3614; AC 129, 6047, 
1072).

For  where  an  affection  for  truth  is  present,  spiritual 
truths  can  be  comprehended,  recognized,  and  received 
more and more fully, although never inﬁ nitely!  The angels 
therefore totally reject the dogma that the understanding is 
under  the  obedience  of  faith.    For  they  say,  “What  is  a 
belief,  without  seeing  whether  a  thing  is  true?”   And  if 
anyone demands a blind acceptance, they reply: “Do you 
consider yourself God whom I ought to believe?  Or do 
you think me so insane as to believe an assertion in which 

14 “Now it is permitted.”

 
 
Nunc Licet

115

I do not see any truth?”  And so the dogmatist has to retire.  
“Angelic wisdom consists in this uniquely, that they see 
and comprehend that which they think” (Faith 3, 4)
  Nevertheless, those who are anchored to an historical 
or  persuasive  faith  in  the  doctrine  of  their  church  are 
afraid of using their understanding in matters of religion, 
but believe that such doctrine should be received without 
any  mental  view  on  the  part  of  the  rational  (AC  3394).  
This  attitude  protects  the  simple  against  attacks  upon 
their  faith,  and  is  urged  by  many  churches.    Indeed  the 
Writings  point  out  that  because  the  doctrines  of  the  old 
Christian churches are formed not from the Word but from 
one’s own self-intelligence, it is very dangerous to enter 
into them by the understanding, which would thus either 
conﬁ rm these falsities by the Word or else reject religion 
along with them.  Hence in Providence it was permitted 
that the Catholics took the Bible away from the laity and 
that  the  Protestants  told  their  people  that  doctrine  is  not 
necessarily rational (TCR 508).  But to those who are in 
the afﬁ rmative to the Lord, this advocacy of blind faith is 
both unfair and hurtful, since it takes people’s freedom of 
thought away and may bind their conscience to ideas that 
are most  heretical (AC 3394).

In  the  New  Church  “it  is  permitted  to  enter  with 
the  understanding  and  penetrate  into  all  her  secrets  and 
also  to  conﬁ rm  them  by  the  Word.”    The  reason  is  that 
“her  doctrinals  are  continuous  truths,  laid  open  by  the 
Word,”(TCR 505:5)  They are not cryptic sayings, hidden 
in parable, nor ambiguous in meaning, but bare truths in 
rational form, intended to elevate and enlighten the rational 
mind.    Within  them  shines  the  light  of  heaven  and  the 
glory of God who provides humans with reason.  This is 
meant by the inscription on the temple in heaven, “NUNC 

 
LICET,” and by the fact that the veil of its sanctuary was 
removed (TCR 508).

Doctrinal Progress

The New Church is assured that it is now allowed to enter 

intellectually into the mysteries of the Word which has 
heretofore  been  closed  up,  and  to  conﬁ rm  the  arcana  of 
faith by the Word and by rational things, and that this will 
open the understanding more and more, and elevate it into 
angelic  light  (TCR  508).    This  is  an  encouragement  for 
those of the New Church—laymen as well as ministers—
to make a progressive study of doctrine.  The New Church 
is  to  endure  forever,  and  the  wisdom  of  the  future  will 
rest upon the interior Divine truths given in the Writings.  
These  teach  that  “in  the  measure  that  interior  things  are 
revealed can a person become wiser; for to become interior 
is to become wiser” (AE 641e, 948e).

The  Church  cannot  at  once  comprehend  all  the 
teachings  given  in  its  Revelation.    As  a  matter  of  fact, 
few have even read all the parts of the Writings, and still 
fewer  have  studied  them.    Many  of  the  Writings  which 
Swedenborg himself did not publish found their way into 
print quite late.  The Spiritual Diary ( now referred to as 
Spiritual Experiences) was ﬁ rst published in Latin nearly 
a century after it was written, and translations into English 
followed slowly. 

It  is  natural  that  the  doctrinal  understanding  of  the 
Church was at ﬁ rst confused.  Generations of systematic 
teaching  by  the  priesthood  were  needed  to  counteract 
the  inﬂ uence  of  alien  doctrines  and  philosophies  and  to

guide the organized Church into a progressive study of the 
Writings.    From  the  beginning,  movements,  both  within 
and  outside  the  Church,  mingled  the  teachings  of  the 
Writings with various fads, fancies, and prejudices.  Thus 
we  ﬁ nd  groups  devoted  to  Mesmerism  and  Faith-cure, 
Free  Masonry  and  mysticism, Theosophy  and  Spiritism, 
Idealism (Tulkism) and Phrenology.  “Christian Science” 
  Modern 
was  strongly  inﬂ uenced  by  Swedenborg. 
Spiritualism claims him as its father and prophet.  We also 
ﬁ nd  Non-separatists  and  Anti-ecclesiastics  among  New 
Church  receivers.    Various  communitarian  ventures  like 
the “transcendentalistic” Brook Farm and the Fourierism 
of  last  century  were  colored  by  New  Church  thought.15  
We  ﬁ nd  “Celestialism”  of  varying  types  parading  in 
Swedenborgian garb, as in the case of Thomas Lake Harris 
and  Wm.  Henry  Holcombe;  or  in  more  moderate  and 
intellectual form, in that of Thomas Worcester.  In those 
cases,  the  authority  of  the  Writings  was  either  rejected 
and  questioned,  or  else  invoked  only  when  convenient, 
or,  as  in  some  instances,  annulled  by  a  novel  mode  of 
interpretation.

Generals and Particulars

“Wherever  there  is  any  church  there  arise  heresies, 
because  while  people  are  thinking  about  one  article  of 
faith they make it the chief thing” (AC 362).

It is with the beginning of a Church as it is in the ﬁ rst 
states of a person who is to be regenerated, that doctrinal

entiﬁ c Association, Bryn Athyn, Pa, 1983.

things  are  being  amassed  in  the  memory  without  any 
order.  The Arcana likens this chaos to “a mess of pottage” 
and teaches that only good, in the form of the affection of 
truth, can reduce doctrinal concepts into order (AC 3316).  
It also explains that the ﬁ rst truths to be ordered by this 
affection are general truths; and afterwards the particulars 
and  singulars  within  these  generals  are  introduced  into 
good and thus ordered (AC 4345).  So it is when a person 
is growing up.  So it is when a person begins to regenerate.  
And  so  it  is  in  the  growth  of  the  Church,  and  in  the 
understanding of doctrine.
  No  progress  into  interior  truth  is  possible  until  the 
generals are reduced into order.  Generals are what hold 
the  particulars  together  in  order  (AC  3057:3).    If  the 
generals are destroyed, the particulars also dissipate and 
seep out, like wine from a broken bottle (AC 7646e).  The 
most  ancient  people  readily  perceived  that  whatever  did 
not agree with the general was wrong (AC 597:2).

The  ﬁ rst  general  of  the  Church  is  afﬁ rmation 
(AC  3923).    The  general  acceptance  of  all  things  in 
the  Word  is  thus  the  ﬁ rst,  and  hence  no  doctrinal  thing 
whatsoever from the Word is to be denied (AC 3452).  To 
start  with  denial  is  to  close  the  understanding.    For  this 
reason  we  inculcate  a  faith  in  the  holiness  and  truth  of 
the  literal  sense  of  the  Word,  and  commence  with  the 
Scriptures when we teach children doctrine.  And all the 
things  of  the  literal  sense  may  be  called  generals,  for  it 
abounds with general truth, as concerning the omnipotence 
of God, concerning Providence, Creation, and obedience 
to His laws (AC 245).  These generals must ﬁ rst be learned, 
and we continue to speak according to them, even when 
they  have  been  inﬁ lled  with  myriad  particulars  which 
qualify them and give them deeper meaning (AC 6071).

Doctrine and the Church

The letter of the Word, couches these generals in worldly 
appearances, to which many fallacies and sensual illusions 
adhere.  Thus, while showing that God in an omnipotent 
Creator, the Word also describes Him as punishing, and as 
being pleased with the odor of sacriﬁ ces, and as repenting 
that  He  made  humankind.    It  is  allowable  to  speak  and 
think in terms of such appearances, so long as we do not 
intentionally  deny  the  interior  truths—that  He  is  mercy 
and justice itself.  Innumerable undiscerned particulars of 
spiritual truth are here presented only as a general concept 
or as a whole.  People can sense the drift or order of these 
particulars  in  the  general,  and  this  order  is  what  affects 
them as “holiness” (AC 3438e).  But they cannot see the 
particulars  themselves—unless  they  come  into  greater 
enlightenment.

The  Writings  reveal  the  internal  sense  with  its 
innumerable  particulars.    But  even  these  particulars—
scattered over a great many volumes—need to be contained 
in generals of doctrine, and are therefore arranged under 
general  headings,  each  doctrine  being  presented  in 
compact  generalized  statements.    In  the  introduction  to 
the Brief Exposition, Swedenborg explains that this work 
was published so that “a general idea” might be formed of 
the New Church and its Doctrine, “because when generals 
precede,  each  and  everything  will  afterwards  appear 
extant in its breadth in light, for these things enter into the 
generals as things homogeneous into their receptacles.”

There can be no affection for particulars, unless generals 
have ﬁ rst entered with affection (AC 5454).  Particulars 
would  otherwise  cause  boredom  or  tedium—or  may  not 
even be received.  This is so in every ﬁ eld of knowledge.  
We could not grasp the higher mathematics unless we had 
ﬁ rst learned arithmetic; nor would we willingly listen to 

 
 
Only Truth of the Church 

121

some  detailed  lecture  on  pathology  unless  we  had  some 
interest in anatomy.

It is said of a church founded on false principles, that, 

in its beginning, it knows

only the generals of doctrine; for it is then in its simplicity, 
and as it were in its childhood.  But in course of time it 
adds  particulars,  in  part  conﬁ rmations  of  the  generals, 
and  in  part  additions  (which  however  are  not  contrary 
to the generals), and also explanations to reconcile open 
contradictions  and  to  prevent  clashing  against  what 
common sense dictates. (AC 4720)

A  church  founded  on  genuine  truth  follows  a  parallel 
course, in that it also begins with generals and proceeds 
into particulars.  Each general principle or doctrine is like 
a father, and the particulars are its offspring.

New Truth—the Only Truth of the Church

  A  church  cannot  remain  in  generals  alone,  without 
danger  of  stagnation  and  eventual  decay.    Health  is 
indicated  by  growth,  external  and  internal.    General 
concepts of doctrine will indeed remain the same from age 
to age, even as our human form does not essentially alter 
as we grow to maturity.  But the understanding of these 
general  doctrines  must  be  inﬁ lled  with  continually  new 
perceptions of truth—drawn from the Word itself.  There 
is need for continually new truth.  The Lord in His second 
Advent said, “Behold, I make all things new”!

The word “new” is very enticing.  It suggests novelties, 
innovations,  surprises,  something  different  and  unheard 
of,  something  which  makes  what  we  already  possess 
worthless  and  superseded.    But  it  also  means  “fresh,” 
as  water  from  a  living  fountain.   And  it  is  in  that  latter 
sense—I believe—that the New Church can be perpetually 

 
 
122

Doctrine and the Church

“new,” however many centuries and millennia may go by.  
As to its doctrines, they were once new when the Writings 
were published, but are no longer new to the world which 
passed  them  by  long  ago  in  a  hurry  for  other  novelties 
and inventions.  To the Church, the Writings are and will 
always  be  new,  because  through  them  course  the  fresh 
currents  of  living  waters,  of  light  which  pours  out  from 
the  Sun  of  heaven,  to  renew  and  refresh  and  create  and 
regenerate.
  And  the  Church  will  remain  the  “New  Church”  just 
so  long  as  it  goes  to  this  fountain  head  for  its  doctrine 
of life and faith.  And this must be done by individuals.  
No generation can rest upon the traditions of the past, or 
merely accept—passively—the doctrine of the Church as 
delivered by its teachers and priests.  Generals of doctrine 
must  indeed  be  so  delivered  and  accepted;  but  for  the 
life and growth of the Church there must be continually 
new illustration directly “from the genuine fountain,” by 
a  new  analysis  of  the  meaning  of  the  Writings  for  each 
new age and state, from an affection of truth which will 
discern visions of new uses to the neighbor and new ways 
to express love to the Lord.

This  is  what  the  Arcana  means  in  noting  that 
“Benjamin” signiﬁ es “new truth,” which “is the only truth 
of  the  Church,”  because  only  it  can  “make  man  to  be  a 
church”  (AC  5806).    This  “new”  truth  is  the  truth  from 
good.  For when we, by truths of doctrine drawn from the 
Word, have been led to good, we then view things from this 
good, which is called “spiritual good” or “Christian good.”  
And then one “not only sees from good the truths which 
he knew before, but he also produces from it new truths 
which  he  did  not  and  could  not  know  before”—“truths 
which differ greatly from the truths he knew previously: 

 
Only Truth of the Church

123

for those he then knew had but little life, while those which 
he now acquires have life from good” (AC 5804).
  Common sense tells us that it is the love of uses, the 
desire for charity and the life of religion, that can open our 
eyes  to  perceive  the  real  meaning  of  the  things  we  may 
read in the Word and the Writings.  And when the Church 
undertakes  new  uses—such  as  those  of  education  or 
worship—it brings into focus new ﬁ elds of doctrine which 
formerly had been passed by.  Where previously we had 
noticed only generals, we then will ﬁ nd many particulars.  
We will ﬁ nd them in the Writings, but it will seem as if 
they were our own productions—our own thoughts.

To  each  individual,  the  Word  becomes  a  revelation 
when read with something of illustration.  The Word then 
speaks  to  each  in  a  new  way.    But  the  teaching  is,  that 
those who are in truth and not in good, go to the Word to 
conﬁ rm by its Divine authority the things which they have 
been taught by others, while those who are in good (i.e., 
an affection of truth or good) are actually “taught” from 
the Word.  To the latter there is then “revelation,” which is 
manifest as a certain internal consent that a thing is true, 
and as a setting of the mind at rest in an acknowledgment 
of  faith  (AC  8694).    This  comes  from  heaven  where 
the  angels  perceive  the  spiritual  sense  of  the  Word  and 
communicate  something  of  their  delight  to  us,  who—in 
accordance with our knowledge—see only what appears 
from that sense in the literal sense.

The  Arcana  distinguishes  between  two  kinds  of 
truth, both of which proceed from the Lord.  One is truth 
proceeding mediately through angels or through the learned 
and enlightened, and this may enter the understanding even 
of those who are not regenerate, and who are in historical 
faith only (AC 7055).  The other kind of truth is said to 

 
 
124

Doctrine and the Church

proceed immediately from the Lord, and appears in heaven 
as light united to heat (AC 7056).  It is Divine truth, but it 
inﬂ ows into every one’s inmost, furnishes the faculties of 
willing and thinking, and gives light but not perception.  It 
ﬂ ows into one’s will, by an interior way, acting as good, 
not  as  truth  (AC  8690,  6148,  8707,  7056).    Such  truth 
proceeding immediately from the Lord is that Word which 
is the light of humans, which shines in darkness and the 
darkness  comprehends  it  not,  but  which  yet  is  “the  true 
Light which lights every man that comes into the world” 
(John 1:4-9).
  Neither  of  these  inﬂ uxes,  by  itself,  can  give  us  any 
perception  of  the  presence  of  the  Lord  in  the  Divine 
Word.    One  gives  the  faculty  by  which  we  can  elevate 
our  understanding  into  the  light  of  heaven,  and  be 
free  to  use  our  will  as  of  ourselves.   The  other  gives  us 
knowledge of doctrine.  But so far as our will is conjoined 
with  our  understanding  so  that  the  will  wills  good  and 
the  understanding  conﬁ rms  it  by  truth,  so  far  the  truth 
proceeding  immediately  from  the  Divine  of  the  Lord  is 
conjoined  with  the  truth  which  proceeds  mediately,  and 
we then become perceptive and can be instructed by the 
Lord in the particulars or singulars of doctrine (AC 7055-
7058).

The  truth  we  thus  perceive  from  the  Word  is  that 
new truth which is “the only truth of the Church,” and is 
signiﬁ ed  by  “Benjamin.”    It  is  what  continually  renews 
the vitality of the Church and will lead into new and ever 
clearer perceptions of uses.  It is the only measure of the 
internal progress of the Church.  The signs of its presence 
are that we see truths with clarity, and see that we perform 
uses from affection.  But no one can judge the state of the 

 
Growth in Doctrinal Knowledge

125

Church in this respect.  All we can do is to rejoice in these 
indications or be warned by their absence.

Growth in Doctrinal Knowledge

The “new truth” signiﬁ ed by “Benjamin” may not be 
new in form.  Familiar truths found in the Writings may 
appear as quite “new” when read in the light of affection.  
But besides this internal progress, a healthy Church must 
maintain  a  tangible  development  in  the  knowledge  and 
application  of  Doctrine.    The  various  ﬁ elds  of  doctrine 
present  in  the Writings  need  to  be  studied,  especially  in 
respect  to  the  uses  which  the  Church  undertakes,  and 
also  with  reference  to  new  situations  and  new  worldly 
knowledge and changes in popular thinking.

The teaching that doctrine is to be drawn by a careful 
comparison  of  many  passages  in  the  Word  in  which 
the  internal  sense  is  clearly  stated  (AC  7233,  9025; 
De  Verbo  10:7),  gives  us  the  principle  for  developing 
the intellectual of the Church (AC 6222).  We ﬁ nd these 
naked  truths,  called  spiritual-natural,  in  profusion  in  the 
Writings,  and  they  are  ﬁ rst  to  be  drawn  and  studied  by 
analysis  and  then  ordered  into  a  synthesis.    Analytical 
thought is the sign of the rational faculty, and the Writings 
constantly  utilize  and  appeal  to  it.    It  is  from  spiritual 
light  that  the  understanding  “sees  and  perceives  rational 
things analytically” (TCR 365e).  True doctrine is always 
rational, and must be studied by rational processes.

The  early Academy  teachers  therefore  employed  the 
analytical method in doctrinal studies, gathering from the 
Writings all the teachings on any subject in question—with 
due  respect  to  the  context—and  drawing  interpretative 
conclusions only after the whole evidence was examined.  

 
 
 
126

Doctrine and the Church

In  each  ﬁ eld  they  allowed  the  clear  or  indisputable 
teachings to serve as a key for the understanding of what 
was  more  obscure  or  paradoxical,  and  were  careful  to 
preserve the general truths.  Sanity as well as safety lies 
in not denying generals.  As a result of such studies, many 
particulars and many universals came to light which have 
enriched the thought of the Church.  But the chief fruit of 
this professional study of theology was the crystallization 
of  a  clear  and  incontrovertible  body  of general  doctrine 
which serves as a strong bulwark against the intrusion of 
falsities into the Church.

These generals of doctrine can be apprehended by all, 
and in them there is agreement, for they can easily be seen 
in the Writings.  If any contradict or deny such generals, the 
Church is likely to be disturbed.  But as to the particulars 
which  illustrate,  explain,  and  inﬁ ll  these  generals,  there 
may be divergence and difference of opinion, and tentative 
interpretations  may  be  advanced.    For  these  particulars 
cannot be seen by all, nor are they known by all, nor are 
there any who know them all!
  Yet it is in the ﬁ eld of these particulars that progress 
will  lie.    For  the  known  generals  will  grow  to  embrace 
more  and  more  particulars  as  the  study  of  the  Writings 
develops.  Every ﬁ eld of inquiry will also uncover more 
particulars, and these will in turn form new generals.  New 
uses—such as that of education—will call forth from the 
Writings  new  general  doctrines  containing  particular 
truths  not  before  noticed.   And  in  all  the  ages  to  come, 
these generals of truth will not alter, even if their contents 
be understood and applied with ever more interior wisdom 
and in widely different ways.

 
Applications of Doctrine

127

Applications of Doctrine

It is understood within the Church that while priests 
should  be  put  under  no  external  bond  in  the  exercise 
of  their  ofﬁ ce,  and  especially  in  the  preaching  of  the 
Doctrine, so “they ought to compel no one.”  They should 
teach what the Word and the revealed Doctrines contain 
and  by  truths  lead  to  the  good  of  life  (HD  318).    They 
are, of course, to maintain the order of the Church.  But 
if  the  clergy  were  to  make  particular  applications  of 
doctrine  to  the  lives  of  individuals—telling  them  what 
to do under speciﬁ c circumstances—this would savor of 
compulsion.  Applications to the uses of life are therefore 
left  to  each  individual  of  the  Church,  so  far  as  this  is 
possible.  The freedom of the individual is necessary for 
true reciprocation.

This  same  freedom  must  be  observed  in  the ﬁ eld  of 
natural truth.  The Church cannot dictate the application of 
Doctrine to the realms of medicine, or law, or the natural 
sciences.    This  in  no  wise  means  that  Doctrine  has  no 
relation to these ﬁ elds of knowledge.  Revealed principles 
are universal and have application to every use and to every 
science.  But this application must be made by the medium 
of an interpretative philosophy which the laborers in each 
ﬁ eld  must  form  for  themselves,  a  philosophy  which  not 
only  reconciles  the  things  of  their  experience  with  their 
doctrinal  understanding,  but  which  also enlightens  them 
in their use to see the manner in which it may best serve 
the life of charity and the glory of God.
  But by the same token, it behooves those who labor 
in  the  ﬁ elds  of  science  and  the  uses  of  the  world  to  be 
cautious  how  they  seek  to  impose  upon  the  Church  the 
special  theories  of  the  individual  philosophy  which 
they  may  have  drawn  from  their  experience.    For  these 

 
 
128

Doctrine and the Church

things—if insisted on—may bring in doubts, perplexities, 
and divisions which injure charity and faith.  In the realm 
of natural truth the Church must be held in freedom not 
only  from  priestly  domination  but  from  lay  dogmatism 
and  professional  dictation.    There  must  be  room  in  the 
Church for a variety of philosophies, for several schools of 
medical opinion, for diverse brands of social and political 
thinking, for different interpretations of natural science.

The  matter  does  not  rest  here,  however.    To  place 
religion  in  one  compartment  of  the  mind,  and  to  think, 
each one as one pleases, with the rest of the mind, offers 
no  solution.    For  freedom—and  much  patience—are 
necessary in the thought of the Church on these subjects, 
especially  in  order  that  progress  may  be  made  towards 
a  gradual  uniﬁ cation:  the  formation  of  New  Church 
philosophies which will increasingly allow the light of the 
universal truths and principles of the Writings to shine upon 
all ﬁ elds of knowledge and order them in such a manner 
that they will conﬁ rm Revelation and illustrate it on the 
natural plane.  “Scientiﬁ cs, in themselves, are neither true 
nor  false.”    They  are  likened  to  spiritual  wealth  which 
becomes true or false, depending upon its application and 
use  (AC  6917).    When  the  sciences  conﬁ rm  truths,  we 
are  illuminated  by  them;  otherwise,  they  make  us  blind 
(SE 2523).

Two Foundations of Truth

The  Christian  Church,  especially  in  modern  times, 
has seen a severe conﬂ ict between science and religious 
faith.  Such a conﬂ ict is in part the result of the inevitable 
opposition between appearance and reality.  In Christendom 
the struggle was mainly occasioned by the fact that science 

 
 
Two Foundations of Truth

129

had  penetrated  beyond  some  of  the  grosser  appearances 
of nature and discovered certain natural truths, while the 
Church had failed to penetrate the sensual appearances of 
the  literal  sense  of  the  Scripture,  and  thus  failed  to  see 
the  doctrine  of  genuine  truth  for  the  sake  of  which  the 
Word was given.  Therefore the Church insisted that Faith 
demands  a  blind  acceptance  of  the  literal  statements  of 
Scripture  concerning  the  manner  of  creation,  geology, 
the  early  history  of  humankind,  the  ﬂ ood  of  Noah,  and 
the  motion  of  the  sun  and  the  planets,  and  insisted  that 
Science  was  the  foe  of  Religion.    Science,  on  the  other 
hand, encouraged a rationalistic attitude which tended not 
only to modify religious beliefs but also to deny the need 
of religion altogether.

The  Writings,  however,  show  that  there  is  no  real 
contradiction between natural truth and spiritual truth, or 
between true Science and Divine Revelation.  The Word of 
God is the primary foundation of truth.  But nature, which 
is the creation of God in which He also reveals Himself, is 
the second foundation of truth (SE 5709, 5710).  Both the 
Word and Nature are swathed in appearances which must 
be opened up if we are to see the genuine truths.

It  is  well  known  that  the  sensual  appearances  or 
seemingly  contradictory  phenomena  of  nature  must  be 
studied by careful analysis in order that we may assume 
hypotheses and formulate physical laws. We then test these 
by experience against all given data before we conﬁ rm and 
adopt them as explanations of the workings of the universe.  
The Scriptures of the Old and New Testaments are written 
in sensual and natural appearances taken from nature, but 
with the purpose to convey and clothe the genuine truths 
of the spiritual sense.  They are therefore representative 
truth,  or  symbolic  truth,  not  intended  to  teach  physical 

 
 
130

Doctrine and the Church

laws  but  spiritual  laws.    And  when  the  Writings  were 
given to reveal these spiritual laws openly to the rational 
mind and in terms of genuine truths, their object was not 
to disclose new physical facts, such as people can discover 
for themselves, but to convey principles or doctrines by 
which  such  facts  may  illustrate  spiritual  laws,  and  the 
universe be increasingly a mirror of the purposes of God 
and of the ways of His Providence.

The Writings convey their doctrines by what is called 
“rational appearances” and also refer for conﬁ rmation to 
the sensual appearances or “correspondential” expressions 
of  the  Scriptures.    Rational  appearances  reveal  rather 
than  hide  genuine  truths  but  utilize  both  the  truths  and 
the  appearances  of  nature  to  illustrate  the  principle 
which  is  set  forth.    Things  of  science  and  of  legend,  of 
experience  and  reason,  of  law  and  appearance;  parables 
and comparisons, history and human instances from both 
worlds—the  Writings  use  all  to  make  the  spiritual  truth 
clear to people’s natural minds.  The rational person can 
see spiritual truth only by its relation to such things.  But 
if we are rational we will also seek to distinguish between 
facts of true science and conﬁ rmations from appearances.  
What we today may regard as a fact may in years to come 
be  regarded  as  an  appearance.   And  yet  many  scientiﬁ c 
allusions  in  the  Writings,  which  a  century  ago  were  in 
doubt, are now accepted as factual in the learned world.
  We  would  be  bold  indeed  to  attempt  to  deﬁ ne  the 
lines  within  which  theology  and  science  should  conﬁ ne 
themselves  lest  one  transgress  upon  the  precincts  of  the 
other.    But  between  the  doctrines  of  religion  and  the 
investigations of science there stretches the broad ﬁ eld of 
philosophy where both may forage and explore and meet 
each other on mutual ground.  It is the hope of the New 

 
Two Foundations of Truth

131

Church that in this free ﬁ eld of thought “rational things” 
may conﬁ rm the opened mysteries of the Word and may 
elevate the understanding of the natural self “into the light 
of heaven” (TCR 508).

== Chapter Nine

The Search For Interior Truths

Growth in the understanding of doctrine is associated 

in  our  minds  with  an  advance  towards  interiors 
(AC  4345; AE  641e).    Even  as  the  individual  passes  on 
from the generals of childhood into the particulars of adult 
comprehension, or from external truths to interior truths, so 
the Church looks to an ever more interior understanding of 
the general doctrines of the Scriptures and the Writings.
  But  this  search  for  interior  truths  is  attended  with 
many  dangers,  invited  by  the  impatience  and  vanity  of 
the natural self which detests to acknowledge ignorance.  
All  the  hells  also  conspire  to  break  down  the  protection 
offered by general truths, either by having us reject them 
or by changing their meaning, or by throwing in the doubt 
that they are no longer needed.

It  is  sometimes  suggested  that  the  Writings,  despite 
their  comprehensive  and  universal  nature,  could  not 
sufﬁ ce to serve all the generations of the unending future 
as  their  source  of  spiritual  light.    Thousands  of  years 
from  now,  would  not  the  truths  of  doctrine  which  these 
Writings disclose be so familiar and hackneyed that they 
would  no  more  inspire  us?    Would  their  truth  not  be 
exhausted?  Even now, do not we in the Church sometimes 
come  to  feel  a  boredom  in  reading  the  Doctrines,  with 
their frequent repetitions?

16 This chapter was not part of HLO’s original work, but he added it 
later.

Doctrine and the Church

The question has its parallels: How could two conjugial 
partners17 consort to all eternity without becoming wearied?  
Or how can anyone live in heaven forever without losing 
the zest of life?  It must be conceded, however, that the 
same  sun  and  the  same  earth  bring  much  variety  in  the 
course  of  a  lifetime.   The  variety  is  especially  traceable 
to  the  fact  that  we  change  and  are,  as  it  were,  reborn 
continually.    The  Writings  yield  new  meanings  to  us  in 
our  shifting  states  and  advancing  years,  although  their 
doctrines  remain  precisely  the  same  as  when  we  were 
young.  The laws of nature give us no less satisfaction after 
they have become familiar—so why should the principles 
of spiritual life give us less?  In the vast future people will 
still need to repent and to regenerate by the same mode as 
we.  And whatever the increase in their perfection, there 
could be no revelation given to their rational minds in any 
other than doctrinal or rational terms.
  Not satisﬁ ed with “complacency” about the people of 
the future, some have advanced the idea that the Writings 
are written in correspondential form, so that there is a great 
deal  more  truth  contained  in  them  than  can  be  seen  by 
a study of what they plainly express: deeper truth which 
cannot be mined except by translating the Writings with 
the help of the science of correspondences into an entirely 
new  series  of  ideas.    This  would  be  a  discretely  higher 
degree of truth, constituting a new “spiritual sense” such 
as that in heaven, and so be suitable for the regenerate and 
for future ages.

17 “Conjugial” is a rendering of the Latin conjugialis, which means 
“married love.” Since this is not a very common word in classical or 
neo-classical Latin some have supposed it was used to convey the spe-
cial concept of married love which is taught in the Heavenly Doctrine, 
and set it apart from common conceptions.  

 
Search for Interior Truths

135

Involved in this reasoning there are many difﬁ culties—a 

few of which will be noted.

The ﬁ rst of these is that the Writings do nowhere teach 
or even intimate that their text is to be treated as a new literal 
sense to be interpreted by correspondences.  To make such 
an assumption is of course easy enough, and it is similarly 
easy to conﬁ rm it by various appearances.  But this nulliﬁ es 
the  teaching  concerning  the  nature  and  purpose  of  the 
Writings.  Instead of showing how the Writings “surpass 
all the revelations that have hitherto been made since the 
creation of the world,” it reduces them to the plane of a 
merely correspondential ultimate such as we already have 
in the prophetic Word (Inv 44).  In practice, the theory that 
the Writings—like the Old Testament—can be understood 
only  by  the  science  of  correspondences,  will  lead  to  the 
rejection of any teaching in the Doctrine which happens to 
come into doubt, as the doctrine of the priesthood or the 
doctrine of the incarnation, or the doctrine concerning the 
differences  between  the  spiritual  and  the  natural,  or  the 
doctrine concerning conjugial love.
  Common  sense  realizes  that  if  the  Writings  do  not 
make  a  functional  one  with  the  Scriptures  (as  the  brain 
does with its body) but are only another literal sense that 
is still veiled by sensual correspondences, a further Divine 
revelation  will  be  required  to  open  their  inner  meaning.  
And it may be observed that the scarcity of genuine truths 
in the Old Testament is due to the veiling of the doctrine 
in  sensual  correspondences,  while  the  New  Testament 
presents many more genuine truths because this veiling, 
in  the  Gospels,  is  thinner.    The  Writings  clearly  reveal 
not  only  general  truths  but  innumerable  particulars;  and 
they  also  give  the  science  of  correspondences,  but  with 
the avowed purpose of opening the sensual veiling of the 

 
 
136

Doctrine and the Church

literal sense of Scripture so that its spiritual sense may be 
disclosed in terms of rational thought.

The employment of the science of correspondences in 
its proper plane, for the removal of the sensual appearances 
of  the  Scriptural Word,  is  indeed  part  of  the  function  of 
the  Church.    The  priesthood  consistently  expounds  the 
Scripture in the light of the naked teachings found therein 
and in the Writings, and thus displays the “internal sense” 
of some chapter or text.  But no new doctrine is obtained 
by this exposition.  The science of correspondences is not 
intended  to  disclose  new  doctrine,  but  only  to  illustrate 
and corroborate doctrine already known (TCR 208, 230; 
De Verbo 21:1, 7:6-8; SS 26, 56).  Since the Word is in the 
form of the Divine Human of the Lord, when we see the 
spiritual-natural truths of doctrine reﬂ ected and mirrored 
in  the  series  of  things  in  the  literal  sense,  we  can  also 
see  how  the  states  of  our  spiritual  life  progress  in  their 
order.  The connections of all human states become more 
clear when they are brought into reference with ultimates. 
Therefore all the Writings, and indeed all the wisdom of 
the heavens, rest upon the Word in its literal sense as upon 
a common foundation wherein all things of heaven and the 
Church are conjoined with power and holiness.

The internal sense seen from the exposition of Scripture 
is  as  “interior”  as  any  truth  which  humans  can  perceive 
while on earth.  Even if we should disregard the purpose 
of  the  Writings  and  the  true  order  of  drawing  doctrine, 
and reduce them to a merely literal sense, translating their 
words as if they were “mere correspondences,” and reading 
some new doctrine out of them, this doctrine would have to 
be expressed in the same rational language and could not 
convey any truth higher or more interior than that which 
is actually already expressed in the Writings themselves,

and which can be evolved from the Scripture by ordinary 
exposition.

The Limitations of Human Thought

The reasons for this lie not only in the nature of the 
Writings  but  also  in  the  differences  of  human  thought 
before  and  after  the  death  of  the  body,  and  also  in  the 
degrees of truth.  There is truth that can be perceived by 
angels, but not yet by humans on earth.  Thus we read in 
the Arcana Coelestia:

Truth  Divine  in  the  ﬁ rst  degree  and  also  in  the  second 
is  what  proceeds  immediately  from  the  Lord.    This  is 
above the angelic understanding.  But truth Divine in the 
third degree is such as is in the inmost or third heaven.  
This is such that it cannot in the least be apprehended by 
men.  Truth Divine in the fourth degree is such as is in 
the middle or second heaven; neither is this intelligible 
to man.  But truth Divine in the ﬁ fth degree is such as is 
in the ultimate or ﬁ rst heaven.  This may be perceived 
for  a  while  (aliquantisper18)  by  a  man  while  he  is  in 
illustration, but still it is such that in great part it cannot 
be  expressed  by  human  words;  and  when  it  falls  into 
ideas  it  produces  the  faculty  of  perceiving  and  also  of 
believing  that  a  thing  is  so.    Truth  Divine  in  the  sixth 
degree, however, is such as is with man, accommodated 
to  his  apperception;  so  is  the  sense  of  the  letter  of  the 
Word. (AC 8443; See the diagram in appendix 1.)

some slight extent: HH 210.

 
138

Doctrine and the Church

  Although  in  states  of  illustration  we  may  feel 
something  of  affection  and  conviction  from  the  “ﬁ fth 
degree”—which  is  that  of  the  lowest  heaven  and  yet  so 
ineffable that it cannot be put into adequate words—while 
on earth we are thus limited as to our conscious thought to 
what is called the “sixth degree” of truth Divine.
  How can this be while yet the Writings give the spiritual 
sense in plain language—sometimes the spiritual-natural 
sense, sometimes the spiritual, sometimes the celestial or 
Supreme sense?  The answer is that the Writings express 
the  subject  matter  of  the  internal  sense  as  it  is  seen  in 
the various heavens, yet express this in terms of natural-
rational ideas, adapted to the rational thought of our natural 
mind.  No one on earth—even if inspired—could express 
the spiritual truths of heaven in terms of angelic ideas, or 
even consciously perceive truth Divine of the third or even 
the fourth degree!  No angel—even if it were possible for 
one  to  descend  on  earth—could  impart  to  us  the  truths 
of  the  spiritual  sense  as  the  angels  conceive  it  by  ideas 
of  angelic  wisdom,  for  such  ideas  would  be  beyond  our 
conscious grasp (CL 326-329).
  Yet a partial exception is made in the case of the ideas 
of  the  lowest  heaven.    These  may—we  surmise—affect 
our conscious states under certain conditions.  The reason 
for  this  is  that  in  the  ultimate  heaven  the  Word  is  seen 
as  to  its  “internal-historical”  sense,  which  is  spiritual-
natural  (AC  4279,  9407).   Truth,  in  that  heaven,  is  seen 
in  its  relation  to  persons,  times,  and  places.   The  angels 
of that heaven indeed think spiritually, but their thought 
depends on objective representations.  They have charity, 
but it is attached to personal loyalties and associated with 
friendship  and  the  thought  of  something  of  reward  or 

Limitations of Human Thought

139

merit.  In many ways, their life resembles the states of the 
regenerate on earth (AE 834).

For  human  ideas  about  spiritual  things  develop  in 
historical fashion—as the internal history of our life—on 
the  background  of  personal  situations.    Our  ideas  about 
charity, justice, wisdom, about evil and falsity, repentance 
and  regeneration,  will  and  understanding,  the  Word, 
inﬂ ux, degrees—all these take form along with our human 
experiences; we know them as the internal phase of natural 
life, and they are inseparable from attached ideas of time 
and space and person.
  But although there is some kinship between a person’s 
rational thought and the thought of the angels of the ﬁ rst 
heaven, there are also marked differences.  For from being 
“natural,” every one becomes “spiritual”—by death: 

The natural man, in everything of his thought and speech, 
and in everything of his will and action, has, for a subject, 
matter, space, time, and quantity, these things with him 
being  ﬁ xed  and  static  (stata),  while  without  them  he 
would have no notion of thought and speech therefrom, 
nor  any  affection  of  will  and  action  from  these.    The 
spiritual man, or spirit, does not possess the above things 
for subjects, but only for objects. (D.Wis 7:5 emphasis 
added)

This  means  that  the  objective  creation  that  surrounds 
angels  and  spirits  in  apparent  space  and  time,  can  be 
thought  of  only  as  the  appearances  of  states  of  love 
and wisdom, so that the notion of space and time is not 
involved  in  that  from  which  spirits  and  angels  think.  
Their  ideas  are  therefore  so  wholly  different  from  ours 
that  “they  entirely  transcend  them  and  do  not  fall  into 
natural ideas, except sometimes into the interior rational 

 
140

Doctrine and the Church

sight, and this no otherwise than through the abstraction or 
removal of quantities from qualities” (ibid.).  Thus angelic 
wisdom is incomprehensible and ineffable to us.  And the 
employments and functions of the angels can thus not be 
described in words of our mortal tongues.

The Quality of Natural Thought

The  Writings  show  that  “all  the  thought  which  man 
has” in this world is “founded” upon ideas of time, space, 
and natural things (HH 169).  Thus “the idea of space and 
time is in almost everything of thought with man, so long as 
he is in the world” (AC 3387:3).  Without such an idea we 
“cannot think anything at all,” nor comprehend anything 
of Divine things (AC 3938).  On earth, spaces and times 
enter into our thoughts and bind them and distinguish them 
from the spiritual thoughts of the angels (AE 1219:5).  “To 
think spiritually is to think without time and space, and to 
think naturally is to think with time and space; for to every 
idea of natural thought there adheres something from time 
and space; but not to any spiritual idea” (CL 328:2).  Thus 
space  and  time  cannot  be  divorced  from  a  person  as  a 
thinking “subject” (D.Wis 7:5).
  As  soon  as  a  we  tried  to  think  without  some  basis 
for  our  thought  in  time  and  space,  we  would  lapse  into 
unconsciousness; our thought would turn into a blank, and 
we would be unable to distinguish any ideas (AE 625:4).  
But  this  does  not  mean  that  our  thought  consists  solely 
of  sensual  or  material  ideas,  which  even  animals  have.  
Human  beings  are  also  capable  of  abstract  or  rational 
ideas, which however have to be sustained and connected 
by  means  of  the  sensual  ideas  of  space  and  time  and 

 
Quality of Natural Thought

141

person and quantity, if they are to be conscious of them 
(AC 5110:3).

In the “higher thought in which we are when we revolve 
natural, civil, moral, and spiritual things in interior rational 
light,” ideas of time and space have been removed to the 
side and spiritual light allowed to ﬂ ow in and enlighten (AR 
947).  We can thus think “almost abstractly from natural 
things”  (AC  9828).    We  may  entertain  ideas  about  God 
and heaven: as when we think of God as love itself and 
wisdom itself.  Yet this abstraction is attached to a mental 
picture of the Lord as ﬁ nite Man or to a visualization of His 
love as a ﬁ ery Sun and His wisdom as proceeding light—
thus  to  natural  ideas  acquired  from  correspondence  and 
resting in space and time (AE 1124:2).  We cannot think 
of spiritual and Divine things except analogically or in an 
image (AC 2520).  But we are encouraged to remove from 
our thought—by acknowledgment and rational consent—
the idea of space and ﬁ niteness which adhere from nature 
to our idea of God:

Every  one  who  has  understanding  is  able  to  transcend 
in  thought  these  things  which  are  proper  to  nature. 
(DLW 69, emphasis added)

Creation 
itself  cannot  be  brought  within  one’s 
comprehension  unless  space  and  time  are  removed 
from  the  thought;  but  if  these  are  removed  it  can  be 
comprehended.  Remove these if you can or as much as 
you can . . . and you will perceive. (DLW 155)

Do  not,  I  entreat  you,  confuse  your  ideas  with  time 
and  space  .  .  .  for  the  Divine  is  not  in  time  and  space. 
(DLW 51, cf. 285, 81, 82, 111, 7, 71, 300; DP 46-51)

 
142

Doctrine and the Church

  A part of the mind, called the interior natural memory, 
is especially devoted to abstractions and thus to doctrine, to 
philosophical things, and other immaterial ideas.  It supplies 
“the objects for interior speculation” (SE 3258).19
  But  rational  speculation  and  the  attempt  to  remove 
sensual  ideas,  do  not  by  themselves  make  our  thought 
spiritual.    We  can  go  insane  by  too  much  abstraction 
(CL 207).  And in the attempt, abstract not only time and 
space from spiritual things, but also substantiality!  This 
makes  these  spiritual  things  a  vacuum—a  nothing—of 
which  nothing  can  be  predicated  (DLW  373e,  81,  82; 
LJP 263, 265).

The ambition to lift oneself into exalted states beyond 
ordinary  human  experiences,  has  caused  many  to  turn 
“mystics,”  who  believe  that  they  have  foretastes  of 
heaven in states of ecstasy where the mind goes blank—
as with the contemplation of the inﬁ nite—and the soul is 
enveloped in an aura of visionary bliss.  The state of the 
mystic, like that of various religious fanatics, is induced 
by “enthusiastic spirits” who roam the world of spirits in 
search of adulation.  The exaltation which the mystic feels 
is an imitation of an angelic state, a sense as if heavenly 
wisdom  and  a  beatiﬁ c  vision  were  at  last  attained.    But 
no clear or expressible ideas ever crystallize out of such 
sensations.

19 Though SE 3258 does not mention “immaterial ideas,” it is speak-
ing of spirits from “Mercury” which are said elsewhere to correspond 
to the “memory of immaterial things” (AC 7170). 
Note  that  the  general  teaching  is  that  we  do  not  think  consciously 
in  immaterial  ideas  until  after  death  (AC  10604.2,  3223).  We  do 
think from immaterial ideas (AC 4408, 5497); yet they are in spiri-
tual light which falls into natural light and there becomes conscious 
(AC 5614:4, 10551:5; HD 39).

 
Interior Degrees of the Mind

143

The Interior Degrees of the Mind

The Writings bring the mystically inclined among us 
back to common sense when they state that “the natural 
mind of a person can be elevated even to the light of heaven 
in which angels are, and can perceive naturally, thus not 
so  fully,  what  the  angels  perceive  spiritually.    Still  the 
natural mind of a person cannot be raised into the angelic 
light  itself”  (DLW  257,  emphasis  added).    Since  all  are 
endowed from creation and thence by birth with a mind 
of  three  degrees—answering  to  the  three  heavens—they 
can indeed be elevated into angelic wisdom and possess 
it  even  while  they  live  in  the  world;  but  it  is  only  after 
death, and only if they become angels, that they “enter into 
that  wisdom”  (DLW  239)  “perceptibly  and  manifestly” 
(DP 32:3).  Swedenborg tells of a man of mediocre learning 
whom he knew on earth, who later, in heaven, spoke with 
a profound wisdom beyond the grasp of mortals.  Because 
he  had  on  earth  worshiped  the  Lord  and  applied  to  life 
the precepts of the Word, he had been raised into the third 
degree of love and wisdom (DLW 239).  Probably ignorant 
of the Writings, he had seen genuine truth in the Scripture 
from a celestial love of uses.

Every normal adult is equipped to be elevated to receive 
light  from  the  heavens,  even  if  the  spiritual  or  celestial 
degrees are not opened in him or her.  For the natural mind 
can “rise up by continuity around the two higher degrees” 
which are transparent to heavenly light, and thus it receives 
through these higher degrees an illumination which grows 
steadily more lucid and pure as it ascends (DLW 259, 266, 
255, 256, 258).

Illustration  is  thus  given,  at  ﬁ rst,  as  a  free  gift 
(DLW  150).    People  may  apprehend  truths  of  celestial 
degree and type—truths such as a love to the Lord would 

 
 
 
144

Doctrine and the Church

perceptively accept.  Or they may admire and understand 
truths  of  charity,  which  are  in  origin  spiritual.   All  this 
however “in a natural manner.”

It  is  the  human  rational  that  can  be  so  elevated.  
Therefore the rational of the natural self “is in appearance 
as if of three degrees” (DLW 258, emphasis added), since it 
can perceive naturally what the angels of the three discrete 
heavens perceive spiritually.  This is only an “appearance,” 
for  in  the  unregenerate  mind  they  are  not  discrete  inter 
se.20  The fact that our thought can be elevated warrants 
no conclusion as to our being “rational from the celestial” 
or “rational from the spiritual.”  This no one can know of 
oneself  or  of  another.    It  would  be  high  presumption  to 
decide whether one’s will is raised into spiritual heat and 
thus whether the interior degrees are opened (DLW 258).
  Only in heaven does it become clear what degree has 
been opened in someone while on earth (DLW 203).  “So 
long as man lives in the world, he knows nothing of the 
opening of these degrees within him,” because he thinks, 
wills, and acts consciously from the natural degree, and the 
communication of the spiritual with the natural is not felt, 
not sensed (DLW 238, 252; D.Wis 8).  Yet, unbeknownst 
to such a one, the spiritual mind, if it is opened, is being 
ﬁ lled with thousands of arcana of wisdom and thousands 
of delights of love into which one will come after death.  
These are the treasures laid up in heaven, where moth and 
rust cannot corrupt (DLW 252).

Supersensible Thought

  Modern writers sometimes refer to our “subconscious 
mind,” into which they roughly group not only slumbering 

20 Latin for “between themselves.”

 
Supersensible Thought

145

memories and certain unconscious rational processes, but 
also  the  hidden  instincts  of  heredity  and  the  suppressed 
passions of the will.  But since the term “thinking” is usually 
associated with “consciousness,” it may be surprising to 
ﬁ nd in the Writings a large body of teachings which show 
that there is an interior thought active in the mind of which 
we  are  utterly  unaware.    It  is  this  supersensible  thought 
that  furnishes  the  interior  and  unconscious  degrees  of 
our  mind  when  these  have  been  opened  by  regeneration 
(AE 625:5).  It enables us after death to think and speak 
like  the  angels,  without  any  instruction  (AC  4104),  and 
to  know  the  internal  sense  of  the  Word.    Even  during 
our earth-life our internal self receives the internal sense 
unknowingly,  while  we  take  the  Word  according  to  its 
literal  sense  (AC  4280,  5614:3,  10551:5).    Our  internal 
self is thus in like perception with the angels, and “is of 
itself in the internal sense of the Word” although we may 
not even know what the internal sense is, but see some of 
its genuine truths only in the literal sense in our states of 
illustration (AC 10400).  Such truths are elevated from our 
memory and transformed into spiritual ideas (AE 790:8).
  But we cannot perceive those things which we think 
in our spirit (HH 356:2); because the ideas of such angelic 
thought are intellectual or spiritual, and are devoid of such 
objects as are in the natural world (AC 10237).21  They are 
therefore  incomprehensible  to  the  natural  self  (HH  314; 
AE  625:4).    This  is  indeed  provided,  lest  there  be  an 
interference between the thoughts of people and of spirits, 
and they would become conscious of each other (SE 199; 
TCR  475).    Yet  these  super-conscious  spiritual  ideas 

21  HLO  seems  to  be  taking  “intellectual”  here  (intellectuale  in 
AC  10237:3)  in  a  more  specialized  sense  than  simply  pertaining  to 
the  understanding. cf. AC 1901, 1904, 2053.

146

Doctrine and the Church

(which  come  to  us  though  the  angels  among  whom  we 
are) ﬂ ow into our natural thought and clothe themselves 
in  correspondent  natural  ideas,  which  thus  “overshadow 
the spiritual” (AC 5614).  In these natural forms they can 
come to our manifest perception and can be “puriﬁ ed by 
truths of faith” (AC 10237 emphasis added; AE 790:8; cf. 
HD 39; LJ 18).  It is reasonable to suppose that those of the 
New Church would here be at an advantage, owing to the 
abundance of spiritual-natural truths in the Writings.  We 
are aided to think spiritually by the assistance of abstract 
or immaterial ideas such as those of the doctrines when we 
see these in spiritual light.22  Spiritual light can then inﬂ ow 
into rational light and rational light into sensual light.  The 
inﬂ ux of spiritual ideas into our supersensible thinking we 
would  feel  only  as  affection  (TCR  475;  DLW  252);  but 
the  perceptions  which  would  spring  from  this  affection 
would be continually puriﬁ ed by a conscious reference to 
the general doctrines which the Writings lay down as the 
criterion for all our ideas (AC 10237).

Interior Degrees of Truth with the Writings

The ineffable interiors of the Word, although implanted 
while we read it in the world from an affection for truth, 
are not opened for our conscious use until after we have 
been separated from the natural degree, which is effected 
through the death of the body (DP 172:5; D. Wis viii).

The Writings, in their relation to the Sacred Scriptures, 
are the interior-natural degree of the Word.  [See diagram 
in Appendix 1.]   Therefore the rational ideas in which the 
Writings are formulated must also contain discrete degrees 

22 We think from immaterial ideas while in the natural world, but not 
consciously in them. See footnote 19 for refs.  

 
 
Interior Degrees of Truth

147

of truth imperceptible to a person on earth, and answering 
to the three heavens.  This discretely higher content is a 
one with the Word in heaven—the third, fourth, and ﬁ fth 
degrees of Truth Divine.  The Writings, with their abstract 
doctrine  never  quite  separated  from  a  framework  of 
natural illustrations, comparisons, and conﬁ rmations from 
the literal sense and from nature, belong within the sixth 
degree (AC 8443).

In  reading  the  Writings  in  a  state  of  illustration,  we 
would perceive something of the truth Divine as it is in its 
ﬁ fth degree or descent, or in the ultimate heaven.  But this 
comes mostly as an internal, clear, and joyful consent to 
the truth which we see taught, and is scarcely expressible 
in  words  and  can  hardly  be  conveyed  to  others  in  this 
world.  Such enlightenment, however, is necessary if we 
are  to  understand  the  substantial  reality  of  the  spiritual 
world  which  is  beyond  space  and  time,  or  the  character 
of  the  angels  and  the  meaning  of  charity,  mutual  love, 
forgiveness, innocence, etc.  Rational ideas must become 
converted  into  spiritual-rational  ideas!    Without  such 
illustration what would the Arcana exposition of the Lord’s 
gloriﬁ cation  and  of  the  process  of  regeneration  become, 
except  so  many  words!    We  would  not  receive  the  real 
idea-contents of the internal sense, and the doctrine would 
not “live.”

Those  in  heaven  understand  every  doctrine  given  in 
the  Writings  more  interiorly  and  wisely  than  on  earth.  
Even an abstract truth, such as “God is One,” would have 
a  discretely  different  meaning  and  be  associated  with  a 
different but corresponding and enriching ﬁ eld of concepts 
in  each  heaven;  yet  all  accept  the  same  doctrine.    Both 
the celestial doctrine of love to the Lord and the spiritual 
doctrine of charity are in all the heavens, but they affect 

 
 
148

Doctrine and the Church

the  angels  differently  according  to  the  quality  of  their 
ideas (cf. HD 107).  The angels of the third heaven think 
from ends, those of the lower heavens from causes or from 
effects, but all can think about ends and about causes and 
about effects (DLW 202).  The celestial have no thoughts as 
we understand thoughts, but perceptions of what they see 
and hear, and variations of affections.  The spiritual have 
only  immaterial  ideas,  and  the  objects  of  their  thoughts 
are  spiritual.    The  ideas  of  the  higher  angels  entirely 
“transcend” those of the lower heavens (AC 8920).  Yet 
these angels do not realize that such discrete differences 
exist;  nor  are  angels  aware  that  they  are  any  wiser  than 
they were in the world (De Verbo 14:2; CL 326-329).

Each truth within the Writings, as seen from heaven, 
is full of arcana within arcana, which Swedenborg could 
describe  only  as  “variations  and  changes  of  state  of 
heavenly  light  and  ﬂ ame  by  which  angelic  speech  and 
thought are carried on” (AC 8920e).  And if the reader be 
enlightened, these things would become implanted in the 
internal self.  “But what is there transacted, is unknown to 
the natural, for it is above its sphere of observation.  . . . 
The Lord disposes all such things entirely without man’s 
knowledge” (AC 3570:2; cf. AE 625:5).

Development in Doctrinal Understanding

  Apart  from  this  ﬁ eld  of  angelic  ideas,  the  Writings 
contain no “internal sense.”  To attempt to expound their 
text by the science of correspondences, is foreign to the 
nature of the Writings; it would open them to perversion by 
irresponsible and fanciful ideas, and destroy their function 
and authority.

 
Development in Understanding

149

Progress  in  doctrinal  understanding  lies  along  other 
lines.    The  rule  is  given  that  the  interior  meaning  of 
Scripture  should  be  gathered  from  various  passages 
where the literal sense is explained.  It is thus that general 
doctrine  is  formed,  sound  and  pure,  by  the  enlightened, 
for  those  of  the  external  church.    But  “truths  still  more 
interior  are  afterwards  drawn  forth  by  those  who  are 
enlightened,” to serve as doctrine for those of the internal 
church (AC 10028:2).

The  same  general  principle  applies  in  the  study  of 
the  Writings.    The  “truths  still  more  interior,”  to  which 
such studies lead, mean truths divested of natural ideas—
of  time,  space,  and  personality—such  as  adhere  to  our 
thought from the natural world and from sensual cupidities.  
For  such  gross  ideas  tend  to  obscure  our  recognition  of 
universals,  and  to  limit  the  applications  of  the  truth  to 
temporary circumstances.
  But  note:   This  process  of  freeing  our  thought  from 
grosser  things  is  an  elevation  of  the  understanding  by 
continuity,  not  by  any  discrete  degrees,  nor  with  any 
pretense of arriving at the angelic ideas which must remain 
imperceptible  in  the  world.    The  enlightened  readers  of 
the  Writings  seek  for  principles.    They  do  not  stick  in 
mere illustrations or historical details and draw not only 
direct  information  but  the  principles  or  the  governing 
universals  which  cast  a  new  light  upon  all  the  doctrines 
and upon all human life.  For until we see the “universal,” 
our  applications  of  general  truths  remain  awkward  and 
insufﬁ cient  to  changing  states.   These  principles  are  the 
eternal  things  which  know  no  age  or  clime:  the  keys  of 
the wisdom of life; the gates of the future; the windows of 
eternity.

Doctrine and the Church

This recognition of universals is the fruit of illustration 
and the way of progress.  It does not dishonor the general 
truths,  for  it  conﬁ rms  them  and  sees  their  power  and 
place.    It  does  not  destroy,  but  widens,  the  authority  of 
the Writings.  It points to new uses of charity and gives 
a  new  insight  into  the  inﬁ nity  of  the  revealed  truth  and 
its  sufﬁ ciency  for  every  age  to  come,  demonstrating,  as 
nothing else, that the Writings contain the very wisdom of 
God, the Divine Doctrine for the ever-New Church.

== Chapter Ten

Human Reception of the Divine Doctrine

The Divine Doctrine which is within the Word and is 

the Word, is given to humans and angels with the end 
in view that it may be the medium of conjunction between 
God  and  humankind.   The  reciprocal  conjunction  of  the 
Lord and His creatures is the end and purpose of creation.  
It is, to us, unthinkable that a merciful God should create 
humankind and then fail to provide the necessary medium 
by which He could reveal Himself and the purposes of life 
to them but leave them alone in darkness and confusion.  
On  other  planets,  He  reveals  Himself  in  various  ways 
through  angelic  media,  and  also—as  in  most  ancient 
times on earth—through the order of nature itself and of 
unperverted human life, an order which represents Divine 
and heavenly laws.  But in our earth, after the celestial seed 
perished, the Word was given in written form, as doctrine 
that  could  reform  the  understanding  and  thus  provide  a 
new basis for the Lord’s inﬂ ux with people.

Thus we read:

There  must  be  something  from  the  Lord  which  can  be 
received by a person, by which there can be conjunction 
and thence eternal life. (AR 200)

By the Word there is conjunction of the Lord with a person, 
and of a person with the Lord, and by that conjunction 
there is life. (AR 200)

 
 
 
152

Doctrine and the Church

No  one  however  feels  and  perceives  the  Divine  life  in 
the Word but he who is in the spiritual affection of truth 
when he reads it; for he is in conjunction with the Lord 
through the Word. (AR 200)

The Lord’s conjunction with a human being is by means 
of  His  Divine  truth,  and  this  truth  is  of  the  Lord  in  a 
person, thus is the Lord, and is by no means the person’s, 
consequently is not the person.  One, indeed, feels it as 
his own, but still it is not his, for it is not united to him, 
but adjoined. (AR 222, emphasis added) 

Thus the Divine truth of the Word is with humans, yet 
is never to be confused with them.  Indeed, all good and 
all  truth  are  from  the  Lord,  and  “what  is  from  the  Lord 
remains the Lord’s with the recipients.  For what is from 
the Lord is Divine, which can never become man’s own” 
(AR 758).

It  is  of  utmost  concern  that  this  Divine  presence 
with us—the Divine which is adjoined to us—should be 
distinguished from that which is a recipient.  For we are 
warned that “he who attributes to himself what is Divine 
as  his  own  (ut  proprium),  not  only  deﬁ les  it,  but  also 
profanes it” (AR 758).  And in distinguishing the Divine 
from the recipient, we must take account of the teaching 
that “the Divine can be with a man, but not in the man’s 
proprium, for man’s proprium is nothing but evil” (Ibid.).

The Idea of One’s Inner “Divinity”

The Writings often stress the necessity of understanding 
the manner in which the Divine is present within us.  For 
from  a  false  notion  of  this  relation  of  God  and  humans, 
ﬂ ow  all  the  main  errors  of  religion  (Inv  26).    We  may 

 
 
 
Idea of One’s Inner “Divinity”

153

ignore  the  Divine  as  the  source  of  our  life  and  conﬁ rm 
ourselves in the belief that we will, think, act, and speak 
from  our  own  power—thus  that  we  live  from  ourselves.  
This would cause us to ascribe merit to ourselves for all 
good done, and this amounts to a denial of God.
  But  this  supposition  (that  we  live  from  ourselves  or 
that the life which is within us is our life) may take another 
form.  We may come to believe that we, as thinking and 
willing subjects, are Divine; that when we think what we 
believe are truths, or when we do good, it is the “Divine-
in-us” that is thinking or acting.  Such people thus identify 
their  states  of  thought  and  affection  with  the  enabling 
inﬂ ux,  and  thus  with  the  Divine  source  of  life,  which 
is  God.   This  idea  causes  the  thoughts  to  tie  themselves 
into “a Gordian knot” of fallacies, entangling in it all the 
judgments of the mind or “constructing a labyrinth from 
which the mind can never, by any thread of reason, retrace 
its way” (ISB 11).  It even results in the monstrous error 
of  the Antediluvians  and  of  many  at  this  day,  especially 
in nations descended from the corrupted Ancient Church, 
that God transfused or transcribed Himself into humans, 
or  that  life  was  so  “increated”  in  them  that  everyone  is 
or  can  become  a  Deity,  possessing  a  Divine  essence 
(TCR 461, 470; DLW 116, 130; Inv 26; ISB 11).  This was 
the whispering of the Serpent—people would “be as gods, 
knowing good and evil.”  Thus we read of the perverted 
Nephilim—the “giants” who lived before the Flood: “They 
were of such a genius as to imbue direful persuasions . . . 
supposing  themselves  to  be  as  gods,  and  that  whatever 
they thought was Divine” (AC 562; SE 3583).

154

Doctrine and the Church

The “Total Depravity” Doctrine

  On the other hand, some may so insist on the idea of 
our “total depravity” as to deprive us of any free agency in 
spiritual things, claiming that we are stocks and stones in all 
matters relating to salvation, and unable to cooperate with 
the Holy Spirit in our conversion (TCR 464).  From such 
conceptions ﬂ ows the belief that every one is predestined 
by  God  either  to  heaven  or  to  hell,  and  that  one  has  no 
part in determining one’s ultimate fate: thus making God 
responsible and thus the Author of evil as well as of good.  
This doctrine—which logically implies that, at the Lord’s 
arbitrary  pleasure  or  by  a  special  gift  of  grace,  humans 
may be imputed with the Lord’s merit, whether they have 
lived well or ill—the Writings call “the ﬁ ery ﬂ ying serpent 
in the church,” since it abolishes religion and makes the 
Commandments of no effect (TCR 487; DP 322-330, 338-
340).    For,  according  to  this  “total  depravity”  dogma,  if 
we  are  saved  it  is  not  because  of  our  free  choice  or  our 
voluntary  reception  of  the  inﬂ ux  of  Divine  power,  nor 
because  every  one  has  the  freedom  to  shun  evils  and  to 
think  and  obey  truths,  but  because  God  grants  to  His 
elect by a special favor “grace” to believe and freedom to 
cooperate.  The Lord would thus not only inﬂ ow with good 
and truth, but would also in humans receive that inﬂ ux!

Humans as Receptacles

  Against both those extremes of fallacy—the one, that 
people are in inner fact, Divine; and the other, that they are 
totally depraved and devoid of the freedom to receive good 
and truth from God—the Writings lift a voice in solemn and 
deﬁ nite warnings.  It is notable that while the latter of these 
views is held as dogma by “orthodox” Christian churches 

Humans as Receptacles

155

(compare also the views of scientiﬁ c “determinists”), the 
ﬁ rst is that to which incline the more speculative systems 
of  thought,  such  as  Theosophy,  Pantheism,  Mysticism, 
and  Christian  Science.    Both  extremes—which  have  a 
strange tendency to meet—are founded on a truth which is 
wrongly applied and thus has been falsiﬁ ed.  It is a truth 
that the Divine operates within us.  It is also a truth that 
we  in  ourselves  are  dead  and  have  no  life  in  ourselves, 
and that our proprium is nothing but evil.  But no one truth 
can make a doctrine.  The quality of a doctrine depends on 
how we coordinate truths and see them in relation to each 
other.  The Writings develop a doctrine of human reception 
which  not  only  satisﬁ es  the  requirements  of  philosophy, 
taking into account the abstract relation of the Inﬁ nite to 
the ﬁ nite, but also satisﬁ es the practical requirements of 
religion  and  common  sense,  by  which  we  may  see  our 
relation to the God whom we worship.  Having to do with 
the presence of God, this doctrine must be approached in 
elevation of mind and in utmost humility.  
  But human life, with its obligations, is not conducted 
in the rariﬁ ed realm of abstractions.  Humans, as they know 
themselves,  are  complex  beings.    Into  one’s  conscious 
mind,  which  one  feels  as  one’s  “self,”  there  enter  the 
inﬂ uxes  of  life  which  manifest  themselves  as  manifold 
and contradictory impulses; and upon this “self” presses 
from without the equally varied afﬂ ux of sensations.  Yet 
we feel all these as parts of ourselves, and when we act we 
seem to ourselves to act from our mind as a general whole, 
in freedom and as responsible beings.

Life is not in us, but ﬂ ows in from God, and “is varied 
and  modiﬁ ed  according  to  the  organization  induced  on 
man through his love and attitude” (AR 875).  Everyone 
is  born  with  a  soul  or  inmost  in  which  the  Lord’s  life 

 
156

Doctrine and the Church

is  received  without  perversion,  but  with  a  hereditary 
proprium in which the inﬂ owing life manifests its action as 
“self-love” and “love of the world,” thus as evil affections.  
This native will, and the thoughts which ﬂ ow from it and 
gather around it, is what we regard as “ourselves,” as our 
own, our “proprium.”  This “proprium” is the abode of evil 
and of falsity, and receives an inﬂ ux of life as it has been 
perverted in the hells.  But besides this, we are given—
through the soul—the ability to separate the understanding 
from  this  native  will,  and  to  think  from  others,  to  learn 
truths  of  doctrine  from  the Word  and  from  teachers  and 
associates.    This  teaching,  which  we  can  receive  under 
the inﬂ uence of certain “remains” or unanalyzed states of 
good which affect us from heaven (mostly while we are 
unaware), forms in the understanding certain knowledges 
and states of thought that are not under the dominance of 
our evil will, but can be an ark of salvation for us, a means 
of contact with heaven and the Lord.
  And through this truth in the understanding—just so 
far as we will shun the evils of our “proprial will”—we 
can receive (we are told) a new will, which is born not of 
man, nor of the ﬂ esh, but of God; a new will which we feel 
to be our own, but which is not from our “proprium.”  It is, 
instead, from the inﬂ ux of the Lord’s life, and we feel it as 
charity and faith and innocence—thus as good affections 
and as true thoughts.

This is a gift of God.  It is the human consciousness—
but  lifted  up  among  the  things  of  Divine  order,  thus 
among truths and goods such as are taught in the Word.  
These things, which are of Divine order, we thus feel as 
part of our own life.  We accept the truths of doctrine as 
our own ideas, yet we know, on reﬂ ection, that they come 
from the Lord.  We strive to see these truths more clearly 

Celestial Proprium 

157

and  seek  to  separate  them,  so  far  as  we  can,  from  the 
preconceptions to which the pride of our own “proprium” 
or self-intelligence leads us and from the fallacies which 
the senses induce and worldly appearances and ambitions 
engender.

The Writings describe this new will as a “Conscience 
of good and truth” (HD 139).  But as if to emphasize that 
we are aware only of a superﬁ cial part of this new will, 
they teach that our conscious cooperation with the Lord’s 
work of puriﬁ cation is conﬁ ned to the natural mind, and 
that—so  far  as  we  shun  the  evil  intentions  which  we 
discern—the Lord at the same time removes the lusts of 
evil from the unseen interiors which are beyond the sight 
of mortals, preparing and furnishing the spiritual degrees 
of the mind unknown to us, for use hereafter in the eternal 
world.

The Celestial Proprium

The new will, and the new character which develops 
around  it,  is  called  a  “new”  or  “heavenly  proprium,” 
or  “the  angelic  proprium”—always  in  contrast  to  the 
unregenerate proprium or the native will, which even with 
angels remains nothing but evil and falsity.  It is the “new 
proprium” of the regenerate individual.  Yet the Writings 
note  that  angels  are  withheld  from  their  own  proprium 
and  “are  kept  in  the  Lord’s  Proprium  which  is  good 
itself” (HH 591), and also that “in proportion” as the old 
proprium is removed, so far the angels can receive love and 
wisdom, that is the Lord, in themselves; but if they should 
believe that these are in them they would fall from heaven 
(DLW 114, 116).  Angels are in fact “lifted” by the Lord 
into  His  Proprium.    The  celestial  proprium  is  therefore 

 
 
158

Doctrine and the Church

said to be “the Lord’s alone,” but to be “appropriated to 
those  who  are  in  good  and  thence  in  truth”  (AC  3813).  
When we are in the freedom of self-compulsion, the Lord 
can then operate into us, and can “create” a new proprium 
which we “acquire” while it is “formed in the endeavor of  
thought” (AC 1937).  The Lord wills this to appear to us 
as our own, although it is not ours (Ibid.).
  Now  let  us  not  be  mystiﬁ ed  by  words.    The  word 
“proprium”  simply  means  own,  that  which  belongs  to 
one, is proper to one, one’s property.  It may mean one’s 
own will, one’s own wisdom, one’s own plan or design, 
or (literally) one’s own house or possession or kingdom.  
“From Divine Love, the Lord continually wishes to give 
what is His (suum) to man; and, according as man is able 
to receive, He gives” (SEm 4681).  He wishes to introduce 
us into the world which He created, into the heavens which 
He has prepared, into the wisdom which He continually 
reveals  and  into  the  love  which  He  unceasingly  pours 
forth.    He  desires  to  lift  our  life  and  consciousness  into 
a new and perfect order—place us in the realm of Divine 
laws of order and charity and truth—so that ﬁ nite minds 
can ﬁ nd the protection, health, and blessedness which only 
what is the Lord’s own can furnish.  Hence He desires that 
we may leave selﬁ shness and self-delusion, which are the 
only things we have ever considered as “our” own and as 
really worthwhile.  To remove us from that “possessive” 
attitude which we from ourselves always adopt and which 
never leads to blessedness (even in heaven), the Lord asks 
us to use as our own all the things of Heaven and earth, 
all the things, the laws, the substances of creation, but to 
remember,  on  reﬂ ection,  that,  after  all,  they  are  all  the 
Lord’s  own!    We  may  use  all  the  truths  of  the  Word  as 
our  own  ideas,  as  part  of  our  thoughts;  we  may  use  the 

Angelic Imperfections

159

inﬂ uxes of love and charity as our own affections.  But we 
must use them as gifts of God—giving Him all the praise, 
the credit, the glory and thanksgiving.

The  Lord—if  we  do  this—will  (mirabile  dictu!) 
count what we do and think and will as “ours”—as a new 
“proprium.”  The character we form by regeneration will 
be counted as ours, although all that we do is to consent 
to truth and to receive good and use powers given from 
above!

Angelic Imperfections

  But  we  noted  here  that  the  old  “proprium”  is  not 
utterly  removed  from  regenerate  people,  nor  even  from 
the angel, when the Lord elevates them to heaven into the 
things which belong to the Lord’s “own.”  It is true that by 
regeneration they are given not only a new will and a new 
understanding, but also—“if you will believe it”—a new 
body for their spirit (D.Wis 4:2).  “The former things are 
not abolished, however, but removed in such a way as not 
to appear” or interfere.

The angel, as a personality, is therefore not described 
as having any Divine perfection or purity.  Human states 
are never Divine.  Human reception of Divine truth and 
good is ever imperfect.  “With man there is no pure good, 
or good not mingled with evil; nor pure truth, or truth not 
mingled with falsity” (AC 3993);  “no truth Divine,” but 
only appearances of truth to which fallacies of sense and 
falsities of evil loves adjoin themselves (AC 2053).  Yet 
the Lord conjoins Himself to people in this their impurity! 
(Ibid.)  Innocence makes truth seem pure (AC 7902).  But 
“neither with a person nor indeed with any angel are any 
truths  ever  pure”  or  devoid  of  fallacies  (AC  3207;  cf. 

 
 
160

Doctrine and the Church

2053).  Heaven is not pure in the Lord’s sight (AC 2249:4, 
4295:2, 6373, 4803).  “With people or angels, no love can 
ever become pure” (CL 71:2; cf. 145, 146).  “Every angel 
. . . thinks truth and does good as if from himself, and this, 
according to the state of the angel, is mixed and not pure; 
wherefore the wise  in heaven must judge when the simple 
are in doubt or swerve from what is just” (CL 207).

The  teaching  therefore  is  that  the  new  proprium  of 
humans arises by the Lord’s vivifying their proprium by 
His  Own23—thus  by  the  Divine  insinuating  charity  and 
innocence  into  the  deformed  human  proprium  (AC  164, 
149), so that it may appear good and beautiful.  Thus there 
is a continuity of our sense of personality: we do not feel 
conscious of the changes in ourselves.  We retain all the 
good and all the evil which we have ever done—inscribed 
on  memory  and  disposition.    Still,  goods  are  never  so 
mixed with evils that the Lord cannot effect a separation 
(DP 227; AC 2256).  For the Lord disposes our faults into 
so  wonderful  an  order  that  they  are  associated  but  not 
linked—that  is,  “not  conjoined  together,  still  less  united 
into a one,” but only “adjoined and applied to one another.” 
The evil and false things remain at the circumference of 
our minds and the good and true things hold the central 
position (AC 3993:13).   So far as we detest evils, the Lord 
raises  us  above  our  proprium  into  our  spiritual  internal, 
although we perceive this only by our turning away from 
thinking evils and by a new delight in uses (AE 945:2).

Each angel, as well as each person, possesses a natural 
mind  which  is  vitiated  by  evils  and  falsities,  but  which 
is reformed through regeneration (D.Wis 4) and reduced 
by the Lord into partial correspondence (SE 2157-2159).  

23  Or  “by  His  proprium”  (cf.  AC  149:2,  8409,  10035:2;  HH  341, 
591). 

 
 
Angelic Imperfections

161

This natural mind is made obsequious to the things which 
the Lord has stored up in the spiritual and celestial minds; 
thus the state of the angel may be compared to a rainbow in 
which the colors arise from interacting black and white—
the black coming from one’s evils (SE 3473).  The angelic 
life is one of variable light—from the glory of morning to 
the relative obscurities of evening states (AC 8487).
  No angels therefore would claim to be infallible, even 
though  they,  far  more  keenly  than  people  in  the  natural 
world,  can  perceive  when  they  fall  back  into  proprial 
states (Faith 4).24  The angels are humble people and know 
that there is nothing in them that can be conjoined with the 
Lord, and nothing which is Divine.  But they also know 
that  the  Lord  has  given  all  a  faculty  to  be  affected  by 
Divine truths and that the Lord, through these, can furnish 
a place for Himself in them.

The Writings speak of God’s presence with men and 
angels in different ways: the Lord is said to abide in the 
inmost  of  the  spirit,  which  is  called  the  human  internal 
and which is above the heavens and beyond the reach of 
thought and will (AC 1999).  The Lord is said to inﬂ ow 
with mutual love through this internal causing an utter self-
abnegation with the angel (AC 1594, 1745).  The Lord is 
present  in  the  faculties  of  liberty  and  rationality  with  a 
human being—for these are “of the Lord” with a person 
on earth, an angel, or devil.  But the Lord is also present 
in  whatsoever  is  in  Divine  order;  and  this,  in  the  mind, 
consists in truths rightly disposed under good (AC 5703:2).  
By creation, we were “made Divine order in form”—i.e. 
formed as an image of God (LJ 9; TCR 65, 66).  After the 

24 HLO notes that an exception should be made when an angel serves 
as “an Angel of Jehovah,” when his own personality is put to sleep. 
See AC 1745, 1925, 6831; AR 938.

 
162

Doctrine and the Church

Fall, this order had to be reconstituted by means of truths, 
for Divine truths are laws of order (HH 523).

The  whole  universe  was  created  into  Divine  order, 
and  is  therefore  “as  to  essence  and  order  the  fullness  of 
God” (TCR 63:2).  But this never meant that the universe 
was Divine! or that any part of it, spiritual or natural, was 
or is the Divine, proceeding!  For the created universe is 
not “continuous” from God, but is a production from the 
Divine;  and  the  Divine  cannot  produce  another  Divine 
(DLW 53, 55; DP 219).
  Neither  were  humans  ever  Divine  in  whole  or  in 
part—nor can they ever become so.  Yet the impress of the 
Divine truths of the Word upon them is the operation of 
the Divine, proceeding to restore the Divine order in their 
minds, as it already exists in their souls; so that they may 
be images and likenesses of God.

The “Esse” of Humankind

  A person is “not life, but a receptacle of life.”  “The 
whole human being is nothing else but a form organized 
for  the  reception”  of  love  and  wisdom  from  God.    The 
material body is not the person, and is only a temporary 
loan.  The spirit is also made of ﬁ nite substances, but from 
the  spiritual  world  (TCR  470).    It  would  seem  that  we, 
then, are spiritual organisms.  But the Writings probe even 
deeper  than  this.    They  show  that  this  spiritual  organic 
which passes for “human” is really not one’s own, but a 
tool provided for one, and that the only thing that can be 
called one’s own, is the quality which has been impressed 
upon this organism of the mind owing to one’s individual 
reception  of  life  (DP  308,  309).    “The  esse  of  a  human 
being,” the Writings teach, “is nothing else than receiving” 

 
Reception of Divine Doctrine

163

(AC 3938:2; Conv 9).  Nothing of will and thought are a 
part of the individual “except the state of receiving what 
ﬂ ows in” (TCR 461).  Good and truth are Divine, and the 
evil and the false are infernal, and all ﬂ ow into humans.  
But  these  formative  forces  do  not  constitute  them.   The 
human  is  reception—a  ﬁ nite  state  of  reception,  formed 
with the individual’s own consent (AC 3157e).  Reception 
is the reciprocal response to inﬂ ux (AC 8439).

Reception of the Divine Doctrine

  Because the human is ﬁ nite, one might doubt that one 
could become a receptacle of the Divine which is inﬁ nite, 
or of the Divine Doctrine, since the ﬁ nite cannot “contain” 
or “comprehend” what is inﬁ nite (TCR 33; DP 53).  Yet the 
Divine Doctrine proceeds from the Lord, is accommodated 
by the Word, and is received by human understanding (see 
AC 3712).  This is indeed a reception of what is eternal and 
inﬁ nite.  For the Divine Doctrine is the Word in its esse, 
in its existere, and in its proceeding.25  It is the Inﬁ nite  a 
se26—God with us (DP 52).  It reaches human beings; yet 
we are not made either inﬁ nite or eternal by this, nor does 
our thought “contain” the inﬁ nite, but merely recognizes 
it.  The truth affects us—and there is created in us, if we 
consent in freedom, a state which we feel as a reciprocal 
response of acknowledgment and affection, by which we 
seem to receive the truth as our own. Nevertheless, being 

25 “In its esse”—i.e. in its being or essential nature.  “In its existere”—
i.e. in its coming into expression. “In its proceeding”—i.e. in its adapt-
ing Itself to “reach” those outside of Itself.
26 a se—“from itself”—that is, the Divine not as it is in itself but as it 
makes itself present in ﬁ nite things.

164

Doctrine and the Church

Divine and inﬁ nite, it cannot be appropriated to us but can 
only be adjoined (Charity 102; DP 285:2; AR 854:2).

The Divine truth, and the Divine good within it, are not 
made ours nor part of us; for they are an inﬂ ux.  What is 
appropriated is a free state of response.  Good and truth are 
Divine.  But the human’s responsive state, which one calls 
“good” and “truth,” is not Divine.  It is a state of the new 
angelic  proprium,  which  is  a  lifting  up  of  ﬁ nite  humans 
into that order which is the Lord’s: a state of conjunction 
(or “adjunction”) with the Lord, which we feel and use as 
our love, our wisdom, our understanding, our delight, our 
human life.  This is the reason that the angelic proprium 
is said to be “created” by the Lord (AC 1937:6).  And it is 
these angelic states of reception of good and truth which 
are seen as real and substantial creations around the angels 
in heaven, reﬂ ecting every shade of variety in the mixed 
states of the angels.  Even in hell, such distorted creations 
as are there derive substance and a measure of reality from 
an involuntary reception of the Lord’s life in the souls of 
the devils.

These states of reception with angels and humans are 
called by the name of that which is received, or that which 
is the cause of their existence.  Thus the Writings speak 
of the ﬁ nite wisdom of the angels, of our ruling love, of 
human  good  and  human  truth  (D.Wis  12:4:2; AC  3362, 
3387, 3408, 3175).  And so we ought to speak (DLW 53).  
Even the angels speak so.  But insofar as angels believe 
that this state of reception is the Divine good or the Divine 
truth, or that anything of their state is really Divine, so far 
the angelic is no longer in them (DLW 116).

It is equally fatal to attribute the reception to God.  It is 
indeed taught that the “reception and the reciprocal in man 
are from the Lord” (Life 102), but this is explained to mean 

 
 
 
Reception of Divine Doctrine

165

that the power or the faculty of liberty and rationality, and 
“the reciprocal regarded in its own faculty,” are given by 
the Lord27 (DP 88; AE 644:23; DLW 116).

If  the  reception  of  heavenly  things  were  the  Lord’s, 
or  were  Divine,  we  would  have  no  freedom.    Our  only 
choice would be evil; if we chose good, it would be the 
Lord choosing in us.  Certain spirits were infested by the 
idea that “all that proceeds from a human being proceeds 
from his proprium, and this from birth is evil”; but they 
were  reassured  that  we  are  neither  the  good  inﬂ owing 
from the Lord, nor the evil inﬂ owing from the hells: we 
are nothing “except the state of receiving what ﬂ ows in.”  
How, Swedenborg asked them, could the Lord have told 
us to produce works of charity and told us that we would 
be  judged  according  to  our  works,  “if  all  that  proceeds 
from a person were meritorious and thus evil”? (TCR 461)  
This does not mean that we do good from ourselves: “if 
you  do  good  from  the  Word,  do  you  not  do  it  from  the 
Lord, from His mouth and will?” (TCR 506)

Thus the Writings allow no place in our thought for the 
old doctrine of total depravity.  We are given the freedom 
to think and act as if of ourselves either from the Lord or 
from the hells.  Our choice is our own.  If the Lord could 
do  our  choosing,  every  one  would  be  saved!    But  this 
would make us inanimate machines—puppets, incapable 
of reciprocating the Lord’s love.

27 ”reciprocum in sua facultate spectatum”  (DLW 116).  We might 
translate this: “the reciprocal viewed in respect to its ability.”  This 
phrase actually continues “non sit ejus sed Domini”—“is not his (i.e. 
the angel’s) but is the Lord’s.”  “Is the Lord’s” sounds stronger than 
HLO’s “[is] given by the Lord.”  But HLO stays closer to the word-
ing  of  this  passage  when  he  returns  to  it  in  the ﬁ nal  section  of  this 
chapter.

Doctrine and the Church

Conjunction with the Lord28

The  Lord  can  dwell  with  ﬁ nite  beings  only  in  what 
is  His  Own  with  them—not  in  their  proprium,  for  even 
if this proprium were good, it would be ﬁ nite (DLW 114; 
cf.  DP  53:3).    The  Lord  is  present  with  a  human  being 
through His inﬁ nite proceeding, or the “Inﬁ nite from itself” 
(a Se), which is “adjoined” to the ﬁ nite by contiguity or 
touch.  There is no commingling or confusion between the 
inﬁ nite and the ﬁ nite. The life from God is thus constantly 
“adjoined”  to  us  (TCR  718;  Charity  102;  DLW  52,  53; 
DP 52-54, 57e, 58e, 285:2).
  What  then  is  it  that  “proceeds”  from  the  Lord,  that 
is  adjoined  to  us  and  resides  with  us,  that  enables  Him 
to be present with us and forms the basis of conjunction 
between us and the inﬁ nite God? The answer is knowledge 
from the Word, when it is understood, loved, and lived.

“The Lord does not dwell with an empty person, that 
is,  with  a  person  who  does  not  know  His  truths  and  do 
them.” He dwells in “truths from good” (AC 10645:3; cf. 
deV 12). He “ﬂ ows into those things in a person which the 
person knows, not into things which he does not know” 
(AC 9088:2). “The conjunction of the Lord with a human 
being and of a human being with the Lord is in those things 
of  the  Lord  which  are  called  ‘His  words’  (John  15:7)” 
(DLW 116). The truths of Divine Doctrine are the Inﬁ nite 
and Eternal things of the Lord that are accommodated for 
our reception. These may be in an individual’s mind—in 
his  or  her  understanding—as  mere  knowledge.  In  this 
case it may be said that “He came unto His own, but His 
own received Him not” (John 1:11). The Lord can present 

28 In the mimeographed Theological School Notes the page on which 
this section begins is marked “(Revised 1957).” 

 
 
Conjunction with the Lord

167

Himself to a human being in such knowledge. He “can be 
present  and  dwell  in  the  ultimate  truths  from  the  Word, 
inasmuch as ultimate truths also are His, and are Himself” 
(AE 726:7). This passage is referring to people who live 
according to these truths, yet the Lord’s Divine power in 
ultimates  can  “inﬁ ll  those  who  are  in  knowledge  of  the 
Lord even if in a contrary faith” (SE 5934). By means of 
the  truths  of  revelation—which  are  appearances  of  truth 
within which the Inﬁ nite truth Divine is present—the Lord 
can approach every human being.  But if any conjunction 
is to take place, an individual must receive in freedom and 
thus respond to the Lord’s love. 

For  conjunction,  there  must  be  love.  And  since 
innocence  is  the  essence  of  all  good  and  of  all  love,  it 
is  therefore  also  said  that  “the  good  of  innocence  is  the 
only  thing  that  receives  the  Lord”  (AC  10131).  The 
Lord  is  innocence  itself  (AC  2305)  and  “the  good  of 
innocence  is  Divine  good  itself  from  the  Lord  with  a 
human being” (AC 9262:2; cf. 9338:6). By innocence is 
meant a willingness to be led by the Lord: for this ushers 
in a state of consent and reciprocation, by which reception 
takes place. The reciprocation is not Divine, although “the 
reciprocal considered in itself”—the power to reciprocate 
or the faculty of liberty and rationality—is the Lord’s and 
is the Lord with a human being (DLW 116; cp. DP 88ff; 
AE 644e). 

The angels of heaven are recipients of truth in good . . . 
The Lord does not dwell in an angel except in His own 
with him. It is the same with a person in the natural world, 
for the Divine must be in what is Divine, not in what is 
proper (proprio) to any other. (AC 9338:6)

 
168

Doctrine and the Church

The  Lord’s  conjunction  with  a  human  being  is  by  His 
Divine truth, and this in a person is the Lord’s, thus is the 
Lord, and is by no means the person’s, consequently is 
not the person. The person indeed feels it as his own, but 
still it is not his, for it is not united to him but is adjoined. 
(AR 222-223)

It is this state of ﬁ nite reception or response which the 
Lord can love. The essence of love is to love others outside 
of oneself (TCR 43). The state of reception, which is the 
esse of a human being, is not Divine, but is “outside” of 
the Divine—thus not continuous from God.  For people in 
the natural world and angels “have in their esse nothing of 
God which is God” (DLW 55, 56; AR 55, 222:3; DP 58e, 
285).  The Lord cannot love or be conjoined with others in 
whom there is anything of the Divine! For this would be 
God loving Himself in others: a “Love-of-Self-itself”—of 
which not an iota could possibly exist in God! (See DLW 
47-49.) The Lord’s love of humankind must therefore be 
a love of that in us which is neither Divine nor inﬁ nite, 
but which is yet made possible by the Divine. It must be 
a  love  of  that  ﬁ nite  state  of  free  reception  of  good  and 
truth  which  He  fosters  in  us  and  gradually  builds  up  as 
a  new  and  angelic  proprium  in  which  goods  and  truths 
may appear as if our own, so that we may as of ourselves 
depart  from  our  evil  nature  and  cooperate  mutually  and 
reciprocally with the spiritual laws of God. In this way we 
can enter freely into the joy of our Lord (TCR 371).

The appropriation of the Lord’s life comes from His love 
and mercy toward the universal human race, in that He 
wills to give Himself to everyone, and all that is His, and 
in that He actually does give them insofar as they receive, 
that is to say, insofar as they are in the life of good and 
in  the  life  of  truth,  as  being  likenesses  and  images  of 
Him. And  since  such  a  Divine  endeavor  is  continually 
proceeding from the Lord, . . . His life is appropriated. 
(AC 3742)
