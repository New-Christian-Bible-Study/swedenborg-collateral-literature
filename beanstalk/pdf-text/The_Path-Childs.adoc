NOTE FROM THE AUTHOR

The Theological Writings of Emanuel Swedenborg are quoted
and referred to throughout this book as the source for much of the
information about the inner life of Jesus. However, these Writings
do not tell of the Lord’s inner life in a continuous way, because they
also  refer  to  the  life  of  human  beings  and  to  churches.  So  from
study  and  reflection,  I  have  filled  in  some  gaps.  With  the  same
approach I also have matched descriptions of the Lord’s inner life
with known incidents in His life on earth.

INTRODUCTION

"For  if  you  believed  Moses,  you  would  believe  Me,  for  he

wrote about Me" (John 5:46).

The  New  Testament  is  silent  about  much  of  Jesus’  life  as  an
infant and child. What was happening then? What was He experi-
encing?

We are all aware of the Christmas story: the promised birth of
John  the  Baptist,  the  annunciation  to  Mary,  the  Lord's  birth  in
Bethlehem. We  know  that  first  the  shepherds  came  to  adore  Him
and  that  later  the  magi  from  the  East  arrived  with  their  gifts. We
recall that shortly after the wise men left, Joseph was warned in a
dream by night to flee into Egypt with Mary and the infant Jesus.
How old was the child Jesus when He left Egypt? What did He
learn there? We know only that when it was safe, Joseph, Mary, and
Jesus returned to Canaan. Joseph by-passed Jerusalem because he
feared Archelaus  who  now  ruled  there  as  successor  to  his  father,
Herod. The family went back to Nazareth.

What  happened  between  the  time  that  the  Lord  returned  to
Nazareth and the time that He was twelve years old? These are vital
years  in  His  growing  up,  but  again  we  know  nothing  about  them
from  the  gospels. At  age  twelve,  Jesus  traveled  with  Joseph  and
Mary  down  to  Jerusalem  so  that  the  family  might  observe  the
Passover feast. On their journey home, Joseph and Mary realized
that Jesus was not with the caravan. They rushed back to Jerusalem
and  sought  frantically  for  Him  for  three  days.  Finally  they  found
Him in the temple, speaking and listening to the teachers there and
showing wisdom that "astonished" those who heard Him.

The  next  time  we  hear  of  Jesus,  He  is  thirty.  Eighteen  years
have passed. What happened during these years? It seems that the
Lord had stayed in Egypt for about three years before returning to

8

INTRODUCTION

Nazareth  with  Joseph  and  Mary.  If  this  is  accurate,  nine  years
passed  in  Nazareth  between  the  ages  of  three  and  twelve.  Nine
years and eighteen years – twenty-seven years of Jesus’ life, and of
these we know next to nothing from the New Testament.

For  believing  Christians  this  is  one  of  the  mysteries  of  the
Bible. Obviously these were vital years in His development. We are
told  that  He  "increased  in  wisdom  and  stature,  and  in  favor  with
God and men" (Luke 2:52). We are also told in Mark (6:3) that He
took up the trade of carpentry: "Is not this the carpenter?"

These gaps in the history of the Lord's life on earth have led to
many legends. Some say He went to the lost tribes of Israel; others
that He traveled to the Orient and taught there. But these are sim-
ply guesses. There is no conclusive evidence.

During His ministry on earth the Lord promised that He would

disclose more.

"I  still  have  many  things  to  say  to  you,  but  you  cannot  bear
them  now.  However,  when  He,  the  Spirit  of Truth,  has  come,  He
will guide you into all truth" (John 16:12,13).

On  the  walk  to  Emmaus  with  two  of  His  followers  on  Easter

afternoon, the Lord responded to their terrible anxieties:

"Ought  not  Christ  to  have  suffered  these  things,  and  to  enter
into His glory?" And beginning at Moses and all the Prophets, He
expounded  to  them  in  all  the  Scriptures  the  things  concerning
Himself (Luke 24:26,27).

Later these two followers said, "Did not our heart burn within
us while He talked with us on the road, and while He opened the
Scriptures to us?" (Luke 24:32)

What did Jesus tell them? Did He reveal how, within the Old

9

THE PATH

Testament,  Moses  and  the  Prophets  speak  about  His  own  life  on
earth?

Later in Luke we read that Jesus also unfolded the Scriptures to

His disciples on Easter evening. He said to them, 

"These are the words which I spoke to you while I was still with
you, that all things might be fulfilled which were written in the Law
of Moses and the Prophets and the Psalms concerning Me." And He
opened  their  understanding  that  they  might  comprehend  the
Scriptures (Luke 24:44,45).

He told them the things written within the Old Testament con-
cerning Himself. Somehow, the books of Moses, the Psalms, and
the Prophets teach of the Lord's life on earth. If they speak of His
states and education and experiences here, do they tell us what hap-
pened during those missing years?

I believe that the Lord’s answers to these questions are in the
Theological Writings of Emanuel Swedenborg. From these works,
called by many simply "The Writings," we learn that within the sto-
ries  of  the  Old  Testament  lie  hidden  stories  which  treat  of  the
Lord’s  lifetime  on  earth  in  great  depth  and  detail.  But  the  Old
Testament does not treat of the Lord's outer history – the day-by-
day outward events of His life. Rather, it deals with His inner his-
tory, that is, His loves and His struggles, and the development of
His  mind  and  character.  This  highest  "sense"  or  meaning  in  the
Bible tells of the successive mental states of His infancy, childhood,
youth, and then His entire life on earth.

But  before  relating  the  inner  story  of  Jesus  Christ,  I  will  first
treat of what Jesus Christ came on earth to achieve. Why, indeed,
did "the Word become flesh"? (John 1:14)

The young virgin Mary was at first frightened and bewildered
by the appearance of the angel Gabriel, announcing that she would
give  birth  to  the  Savior  of  humankind.  And  yet,  despite  being

10

INTRODUCTION

unable  to  fully  understand  what  this  event  would  mean,  she
answered willingly from her heart: "Behold the maidservant of the
Lord! Let it be to me according to your word" (Luke 1:38).

By this willingness, Mary was able to serve God, but not only
by providing a mother’s arms to hold and care for the infant Jesus.
By coming through a finite human mother, Jehovah God was able
to  inherit  both  a  material  body  and  all  the  finite  tendencies  and
weaknesses  that  make  human  beings  vulnerable  to  evil.  Though
Mary herself was sweet and good, she held within her, as all finite
humans  do,  the  imperfections  that  can  allow  a  person  to  be  led
astray.

Only by means of such a birth could Jehovah God come all the
way down to the level at which humans were struggling. Though
Jesus visibly cast out many demons during His life on earth, this
was only a glimpse of a much larger picture. The influence of evil
spirits from hell on human hearts and minds had swelled tremen-
dously.  The  cruelty  and  ignorance  that  the  hells  were  inspiring
threatened to cut off all contact between humankind and its God.
And  so  Jehovah  came  down  to  us  as  Jesus,  born  into  the  human
condition  through  a  finite  human  mother.  Only  there  could  He
dwell with us, to face the pain and confusion and ignorance that had
been attacking the human race. Only there could He work to con-
front  these  hellish  forces,  and  forge  a  path  back  to  love,  wisdom
and peace which we can follow after Him.

Emanuel Swedenborg, an eighteenth-century scientific genius,
was  prepared  during  the  first  part  of  his  life  to  become  a  scribe
through whom the Lord would reveal "the Spirit of truth." In 1748,
after a powerful vision of Christ, Swedenborg was divinely inspired
to  write  a  series  of  books  about  the  deeper  meanings  contained
within the stories of Genesis and Exodus. These books are entitled
Arcana  Coelestia (abbreviation  AC)  which  in  Latin  means
Heavenly Secrets.

The Arcana begins by describing the inner meaning or "internal

11

THE PATH

sense"  of  the  stories  of  creation: Adam  and  Eve,  Cain  and Abel,
Noah  and  the  flood,  and  the  tower  of  Babel.  For  instance,  in  the
internal sense the stories of creation are the stories of our spiritual
creation - of our regeneration, or rebirth, in seven "days" or seven
major stages.

But then, in describing the inner meanings in chapter twelve of
Genesis, the Arcana takes on a new focus. It begins to tell the story
of the Lord's life on earth, from His birth and first infantile aware-
ness to the completion of His Divine mission. This is revealed in
the  inner  meaning  of  the  stories  of  Abraham,  Isaac,  Jacob,  and
Joseph.

Chapter One

THE BIRTH AND INFANCY OF JESUS

THE CALL OF ABRAM
GENESIS 12, VERSES 1-7

Jehovah tells Abram to leave Haran.

Abram takes his wife and family to Canaan.

Jehovah appears again to Abram, promising the land
of Canaan to his descendants.

Abram builds an altar to Jehovah.

To  read  about  Genesis  chapter  12  in  the  Arcana  Coelestia of
Swedenborg  is  to  discover  a  new  world,  for  one  finds,  as  if  by  a
Divine miracle, that Abram’s life viewed from within is the story of
the Lord’s infancy, childhood, and youth. The lives of the follow-
ing patriarchs — Isaac, Jacob, and Joseph — represent later stages
in His life on earth. They reveal His adult states or frame of mind,
leading up to the final temptations, His crucifixion, and the glory of
Easter.

The  infant  Jesus’  first  mental  awareness  is  represented  by
Jehovah’s  appearing  to Abram  and  calling  him  out  of  Haran  to  a
land that “I will cause you to see.”

Genesis 12 says:
“And  Jehovah  said  to Abram,  ‘Go  away  from  your  land,

17

THE PATH, CHAPTER 1

and  from  the  place  of  your  nativity  and  from  your  father’s
house, to the land that I will cause you to see. And I will make
you a great nation. . . .’ And Abram went as Jehovah had told
him. . . .And they came to go into the land of Canaan; and into
the land of Canaan they came” (Gen. 12:1-5 passim).

Abram directly symbolizes or represents the Lord Jesus Christ,
here as a newborn infant. Who is this child? He is a person unique
in the history of the earth. He is Jehovah, Who “bowed the heavens
and came down” (Psalm 18:9) to be born of a virgin mother. This
child’s Soul is Divine, for it is Jehovah Himself. But the body He
assumes from Mary is finite and human. His heredity is unique in
being Divine from the Father and human from the mother.

Between the soul and body stands the mind, and it is affected
by each. What kind of mind will this child have? As a tiny babe in
the  manger  at  Bethlehem,  He  is  like  any  other  infant  in  outward
appearance. He is innocent and helpless, needing love and care. But
inwardly He is a Wonder Child. Gabriel announces His birth to the
shepherds, and the heavenly hosts sing with joy. They know this is
Jehovah, born on earth, and that He has come to save humankind,
a people suffering in misery.

In the stories of the Word of God or Bible, any place or city rep-
resents  or  “corresponds”  to  a  state  of  mind,  or  to  affections  and
thoughts. The infant Jesus is born in Bethlehem of Judea. Why is
Jesus born in this tiny Judean village? The Writings of Swedenborg
respond:

“The reason why the Lord was born in Bethlehem and not else-
where  is  that  He  alone  was  born  a  spiritual-celestial  man,  but  all
others are born natural, with the capacity to become either celestial
or spiritual by regeneration from the Lord” (AC 4594).

“Spiritual” refers to things concerned with the spirit, with a spe-
cial  emphasis  on  the  quality  of  truth.  “Celestial”  refers  to  even
deeper, more heavenly aspects of the spirit, which have to do with

18

THE BIRTH AND INFANCY OF JESUS

goodness  and  love.  We  humans  are  born  “natural,”  meaning  that
our first concerns have to do with worldly and physical things. We
have to learn and grow to achieve appreciation of things of the spir-
it. The Lord, on the other hand, is born a “spiritual-celestial” per-
son  and  Bethlehem  symbolizes  a  spiritual-celestial  state  of  mind.
“Spiritual-celestial”  describes  an  ability  to  experience  heavenly
qualities of love, touched by an enlightened understanding.

In His inner mind Jesus is born with a love for the salvation of
humankind: this love is celestial (AC 2034, 2077, 1434). With this
love comes a spiritual inborn and intuitive ability to perceive truth.
Being  born  spiritual-celestial  is  a  gift  given  to  the  infant  Jesus
Christ alone. He is born with the love of rescuing us and is open to
perceptions about how to do this.

Where did this spiritual-celestial quality come from? The Word
says, “He bowed the heavens and came down” (Psalm 18:9). That
is, His Soul implanted in this infant’s mind the loves and wisdom
of  the  angels  of  the  highest  heavens  (see  AC  6371).  He  is  born
angelic in the inner level of His mind.

This blessing of the spiritual-celestial in Jesus is from His Soul,
but this is hidden deeply within. He gradually becomes aware of its
power and depth as He grows, as He fights the hells and conquers.
Most of the time as He is growing up, Jesus’ awareness is on this
plane  that  is  called  His  “human  essence,”  which  is  His  spiritual-
celestial nature.

From  this  plane  of  awareness  Jesus  reaches  up  to  His  Soul.
Gradually  this  human  essence,  his  love  for  saving  humankind,
matures, deepens, and draws nearer and nearer to the Divine Love
of saving souls that is within Him. Jesus longs to become One with
His Soul, His Father. In this He is uplifted also by the angels, for
the celestial kingdom is within Him. But in the human part of His
heredity that He received through Mary, a finite human mother, He
has to combat inclinations toward the same hellish desires that we
finite humans have to fight.

19

THE PATH, CHAPTER 1

Jesus is a child born with pure love. How this love is developed
is revealed in the inner meaning of Genesis as it unfolds the com-
plete story of Abraham’s life.

The  infant  Jesus’  first  awareness  is  unlike  that  of  any  other
child.  With  other  infants  this  first  awareness  is  a  sense  impres-
sion,  perhaps  of  the  mother  or  of  being  fed,  tied  to  an  innocent
willingness to be led. With the infant Jesus, His first awareness is
that  He  is  living  in  the  level  of  sensing  things  with  His  body.
There now comes a call to leave these lower things and to ascend
to heavenly love. His higher mind is urging the infant to ascend
to love itself, even to love for serving humankind. This is repre-
sented by Jehovah’s call to Abram, telling him to leave Haran
and travel to Canaan — to leave lower things and to ascend to
celestial love.

This  call  is  almost  incomprehensible  (AC  1414).  Can  a  tiny
infant feel such desire to love? Only when His Soul is Divine and
His infant mind is like the angels’. This call to Abram symbolizes
an inner voice calling to Jesus, urging Him upwards.

In the New Testament nativity story this may be symbolized by
the  circumcision  and  naming  of  the  child  “Jesus.”  Circumcision
represents the removal of evil desires (AC 2039), and the promise
of regeneration or rebirth. For the infant Jesus, circumcision repre-
sents a Divine call to leave corporeal or bodily things and ascend to
love  itself,  even  to  the  Divine  itself.  Most  deeply,  it  is  a  call  to
become Divine.

Jesus’ circumcision stirs the heavens with hope; it is the prom-
ise that He will be the Savior, the Rescuer of humankind from its
desperately fallen state.

Jesus  responds  to  Jehovah’s  call,  leaving  lower  bodily  things
and  traveling  toward  the  celestial  itself.  We  read  in  Genesis  12,
“and into the land of Canaan they came” (Gen. 1:5). This rep-
resents  that  Jesus  “attained  to  the  celestial  things  of  love”  (AC
1438). Canaan represents heaven and also represents the Divine as

20

THE BIRTH AND INFANCY OF JESUS

the  origin  of  all  things.  The  infant  Jesus  was  looking  upward  to
Divine Love.

The celestial things of love are the inmost keys to life. Every
infant  is  surrounded  by  celestial  states  of  innocence  and  of  love
toward  the  Lord.  Infants  live  in  a  garden  of  love  where  the  best
things  of  life  are  implanted  without  knowledge  being  involved.
These are the innocent qualities called “remains”. Feelings of love
and  peace  “remain”  hidden  within  us  our  whole  lives.  These
“remains” are protected, and are awakened in us by the angels at
various times in our lives. Remains enable us to be truly human and
to shun evil as adults, and be saved. Gifts from the Lord and our
link to heaven, they go back to a time when we are not even aware
of evil. This term “remains” (or “remnants”) for the innocent states
of  infancy  is  found  especially  in  the  early  Arcana (AC  8,  1906,
1555 et al).

The Lord as an infant also comes into celestial states of mind,
but  with  Him  they  are  of  a  unique  quality.  For  together  with  the
celestial  angels  who  are  present  with  all  other  infants,  the  baby
Jesus  has  the  Divine  Soul  Itself  present,  for  the  celestial  Seed  is
within Him.

This  infant  is  specially  endowed  and  Divinely  protected.
Imagine how the hells lust to attack and destroy Him in these ear-
liest states. But they cannot. They cannot even approach closely, for
the Divine Soul protects Him. 

At the same time, this infant has inherited tendencies to evil.
In this early innocent state these are quiescent, but they are pres-
ent  in  His  external  heredity  received  through  His  mother.  In
Divine  order  this  must  be  so,  for  the  Lord  was  born  on  earth  to
meet  the  hells  in  combat,  and  they  need  to  have  access  to  Him.
This is represented by the phrase: “and the Canaanite was then
in the land” (AC 1444).

“And Jehovah appeared to Abram. . . and there he built an
altar  to  Jehovah Who  appeared  to  him”  (Gen.  12:7). It  would

21

THE PATH, CHAPTER 1

follow  from  the  whole  purpose  of  the  life  of  Jesus  that  Jehovah
would appear to Him (see AC 1445). The altar Abram built is Jesus’
initial worship of Jehovah.

What  an  awe-inspiring  experience  this  is  for  the  infant  Jesus.
His  Soul,  Jehovah,  the  God  of  all  creation,  appears  to  Him.  His
reaction is one of intense love and of worship. The appearing may
well  have  been  through  an  angel,  but  the  Soul,  the  Divine  Love,
shines through this angel. This vision is not a matter of intellectual
realization  with  Jesus;  it  is  a  vision  seen  and  perceived  by  His
infantile heart (AC 1464).

Perhaps in the New Testament this vision happened at the time
of the presentation of the infant Jesus in the temple at Jerusalem on
the fortieth day. This temple is a symbol of Jehovah. To bring Jesus
to the temple is a picture of Jesus coming into the presence of His
Soul, Jehovah. The sacrifice made then by Mary and Joseph paral-
lels the worship of Abram at the altar.

Every infant experiences a state corresponding to the appearing
of Jehovah to Abram. The sensations of an infant are said to come
together in time to form the first clear, conscious concept. In most
cases this would be a concept of the mother who feeds and nour-
ishes the newborn. Highest celestial affections center on this aware-
ness of the mother who stands in place of God. This is deeply mov-
ing to the infant and forms the basis of future concepts of and love
for  the  Lord  Himself.  It  is  one  of  the  most  powerful  moments  in
human  life,  secret  and  hidden  though  it  is,  and  its  importance  is
hard  to  overstate.  The  call  of  Abram  out  of  Haran  finds  in  this
awareness its completion in each human being.

With Jesus Christ the call and the awareness of Jehovah are of
great clarity, for in His case it is Jehovah God Himself who appears.
This is unique. It is a preparation for His Divine mission.

Then they journey further, to the south.

Later, because of a famine, they go to Egypt.

Abram left Shechem in Canaan and journeyed to the moun-
tains  east  of  Bethel. These  mountains  represent  further  states  of
love the infant Jesus experiences and the light that comes from this
love. Abram then traveled toward the “south” (Genesis 12:9).
The south represents a state of wisdom. Within Himself the Lord
now starts moving toward wisdom, and this for the first time in His
earliest life (see AC 1457). He is to advance into learning knowl-
edge and then into wisdom, and this will be a lifetime process.

The New Testament story implies that after Jesus is presented
in the temple, Joseph and Mary return with Him to Bethlehem and
there find a home in which to live. There the wise men from the east
come to find the babe. They “fell down and worshiped Him. And
when  they  had  opened  their  treasures,  they  presented  unto  Him

23

THE PATH, CHAPTER 2

gifts: gold, frankincense and myrrh” (Matt. 2:11). These gifts rep-
resent their love, faith, and obedience.

The  wise  men  are  among  the  last  people  of  an  Ancient
Church,  and  they  know  Who  this  child  is.  In  laying  down  their
gifts,  they  express  awe  together  with  humility  and  adoration.
Their actions are especially appropriate at this time, for now the
infant Lord is just starting His journey into wisdom. The coming
of  the  wise  men  to  the  child  may  parallel  Abram’s  journeying
toward “the south.”

After  the  wise  men  leave,  the  angel  of  the  Lord  appears  to
Joseph  “in  a  dream,  saying,  ‘Arise,  take  the  young  child  and  His
mother,  flee  into  Egypt,  and  stay  there  until  I  bring  you  word’  ”
(Luke 2:13). So also, Abram traveled down into Egypt. “And there
was a famine in the land; and Abram went down into Egypt to
sojourn there, for the famine in the land was serious” (Gen. 12:
10). With the infant Jesus the famine is a lack of knowledge, or of
clear cognitions. Cognitions are knowledges relating to interior or
spiritual  things.  He  is  also  openly  threatened  by  Herod’s  wrath,
which expresses the animosity of the hells.

Jesus is in a state of deep hunger for instruction and for inner
cognitions.  His  Soul  and  angel-like  mind  exert  strong  influence,
and the infant, young as He is, is ready to learn. He has precocity
far beyond that of any child genius who ever lived (see AC 1464).
This  superior  genius  is  without  conceit.  Instead,  He  is  love
itself, a love of others more than of self. How touching it would be
to know Him then, a being of unselfish love and yet of incompara-
ble  genius.  Mary  and  Joseph  are  deeply  moved  and  affected  by
Him,  as  all  caring  parents  are  by  the  sphere  of  innocence  around
their  infants  (see  CL  395).  But  with  the  infant  Jesus,  His  Soul  is
Innocence itself.

Abram’s traveling down into Egypt and “sojourning” there rep-
resent the Lord’s instruction and gaining knowledge from the Word
of  God.  This  Word  exists  in  the  Old  Testament  and  in  an  older

24

THE EARLY EDUCATION OF JESUS CHRIST

Ancient Word1, as well as other ancient knowledge, including the
hidden  symbolism  in  nature  itself.  For  Egypt  symbolizes  knowl-
edge and cognitions. The child Jesus wills to learn only from the
Word,  for  this  was  opened  for  Him  to  its  highest  level,  where
Jehovah is (see AC 1461).

The Lord is very young when He begins to receive this instruc-
tion. His special genius and His purpose for being on earth make
this possible. How wonderful it must be for this infant-child to start
to learn from the Old Testament in ways we never dream of. Many
levels of meaning would be opened up to Him by His Soul. He also
learns  from  “correspondences”  which  are  hidden  spiritual  causes
and meanings of natural objects. This is an ancient knowledge that
the  first  people  on  earth  used  in  a  Golden Age  long  ago,  and  the
angels learn in this way even today (AC 1805-1808).

How the child Jesus learns, in an outward way, we do not know.
We  are  not  told  how  He  is  taught  to  read.  We  do  know  that  He
learns from the Word of God alone. He learns in order that He may
love more effectively — to inform fully His burning love for the
salvation of humankind. Yet at the same time, He is only a child,
and He has some of the limitations of other children.

One  limitation  Jesus  shows  is  that  He  becomes  almost  enrap-
tured  by  the  wondrous  cognitions  and  knowledge  He  is  learning
(AC  1495).  He  loves  these  concepts  for  the  visions  and  joys  that
they bring Him. For a time He becomes unaware that He is learning
for the sake of uplifting others. This happens in Providence from His
Soul, so that He learns this wonderful knowledge with great swift-
ness and eagerness. But later He is made aware that He must rise
above loving this knowledge merely for the sake of the delight that
it gives Him. He must yield up that delight to a higher one, a delight

Moses was acquainted with this Ancient Word. From it He acquired the symbolic stories of
creation, Adam and Eve, Noah, and the Tower of Babel. Moses also refers to portions of the
Ancient Word in Numbers 21:14, 15, 27-30, and references are made in 2 Samuel 1:17, 18
and Joshua 10:12,13 (cf. TCR 264-266)] 

25

THE PATH, CHAPTER 2

in learning for the sake of loving others. Knowledge is not an end in
itself but a means of showing kindness to others out of genuine love.
The Lord now learns this, and perceives it in His heart.

He  feels  “grief”  at  this  loss  of  delight  in  sheer  knowledge.
Nevertheless, He makes this sacrifice and comes instead into a far
higher and more delightful state of the deepest love for others (AC
1492, see also AC 1462:6).

ABRAM AND LOT SEPARATE
GENESIS 13

After the famine, Abram and his family return
to Canaan.

The herdsman for both Abram and Lot, Abram’s 
nephew, fight over the land.

Once Lot has left, Jehovah shows Abram the land 
and promises the land to him and his descendants.

After the famine eased, Abram and his entire family went up
out of Egypt and returned to the land of Canaan. So too, after
Herod dies, the child Jesus leaves Egypt and returns to Canaan.

Biblical scholars estimate that Jesus was taken up out of Egypt
at about age three. They use the approximate time Herod died and
was  succeeded  by  Archelaus  as  the  basis  for  their  estimate.  We
don’t know when the Lord’s actual state of special focus on gain-
ing knowledge, represented by Egypt, comes to a conclusion. One
would think He is far older than three years, but we judge by our
own finite concepts of mental progress. Certainly the Lord as a boy
goes on learning while in Nazareth, but the level of learning then is
on a celestial or inmost plane rather than the lower plane symbol-
ized by Egypt.

As  a  young  boy  in  Nazareth,  the  Lord  experiences  heavenly

states. The Arcana says of Abram traveling back up to Canaan: 

26

THE EARLY EDUCATION OF JESUS CHRIST

“Described here is the state of His external man as it existed in
childhood when it was first endowed with facts and cognitions —
how it moved on from these more and more towards conjunction
with the Internal” (AC 1536).

The “external man” is the Lord’s conscious awareness as a boy;
the “Internal” is His Soul, Jehovah — the God of all creation. As
He draws nearer to His Divine Soul while a young boy, He leaves
Egypt and enters into “celestial light” — the light of innocent love.
This is represented by the phrase “Abram went up. . .toward the
south,” the “south” symbolizing celestial light.

Although the Lord draws closer to His Soul, He is still only a
boy in many ways, and “worldly things” are present with Him (AC
1557). These are not actual evils — the Lord never had actual evils
—  but  they  are  worldly  interests.  We  can  picture  Him  then  as  a
young  boy  in  Nazareth,  in  appearance  like  other  boys,  but  filled
with a tender celestial love (AC 1545) and having a unique strength
and perception.

That “there was strife between Abram’s herdsmen and Lot’s
herdsmen” and that “the Canaanite and the Perizzite were then
dwelling in the land” represent hereditary evil tendencies present
in  Jesus  inherited  through  His  mother  (AC  1573:3).  To  face  and
conquer the hells the Lord needs to experience temptations, and the
hells have access to Him through His inherited tendencies that were
taken on by being born to a finite human mother.

Lot symbolizes Jesus’ outer consciousness or sensory awareness
(see AC 1541), that is, His awareness from His bodily senses. This
is  at  the  early  stages  of  Jesus’  learning  process,  and  He  is  indeed
very young. “Herdsmen” or shepherds symbolize “those who teach”
(AC 1571). That there is strife between Abram’s herdsmen and Lot’s
herdsmen  shows  a  picture  of  the  disagreement  between  what  is
“teaching” the internal level of young Jesus and what is “teaching”
His external level. The deeper part of Jesus is being taught by celes-
tial  love  coming  from  Jehovah,  and  the  external  part  of  Jesus  is

27

THE PATH, CHAPTER 2

being taught by what He is sensing outwardly. At this time, the two
points  of  view  are  not  in  agreement.  Evil  influences  that  come
through  Jesus’  finite  maternal  heredity  are  clouding  His  sensory
awareness, tempting Him to false and confused ideas.

Perhaps an example of this occurs as young Jesus is first taught
the rituals of worship (see AC 1572). At that time, in the culture in
which Jesus was growing up, strict adherence to the outer Jewish
rituals took precedence over true inner worship of the heart. These
cultural values, even if taught by kind and obedient guardians such
as Mary and Joseph, are not compatible with the truth that Jesus’
Divine Soul is teaching – that true worship is first a matter of the
heart.  Later,  the  adult  Jesus  will  speak  about  this  to  the  crowds
many times. But now the young boy must begin to separate con-
flicts between His outer learning and His inner learning.

As  frequently  happens  in  His  development,  the  boy  Jesus  is
shown  a  vision.  His  Soul  illuminates  how  beautiful  His  external
level will be when fully joined with His internal love, Jehovah. This
is described when “Lot lifted up his eyes and saw all the plain of
Jordan  that  it  was  all  well  watered.  .  .  .” Here,  Jehovah  flows
strongly into the boy Jesus’ mind, and there is a harmony. At these
times  the  Lord  comes  into  a  state  of  oneness  with  His  Soul  (AC
1583). He experiences the sweet uplifting that the future complet-
ed state of oneness will bring. The beauty of that state was as “the
garden of Jehovah” (Gen. 13:10).

“And Jehovah said to Abram after Lot had been separated
from him, ‘Lift up your eyes now and look from the place where
you are, towards the north, and towards the south, and towards
the east, and towards the west’ ” (Gen. 13:14).

At this time the child Jesus is in a state that allows Him, from
His Soul, to see things to come. Looking toward the north, south,
east, and west means to see all people, as many as there are in the

28

THE EARLY EDUCATION OF JESUS CHRIST

universe (AC 1601). Those Jesus sees in the north are people who
are in darkness in regard to spiritual truths and knowledges; those
in the south are people who are in spiritual light. Those in the east
are people who lived in the past, and also those in celestial love,
while those in the west are people who will live in the future (AC
1605). Jehovah gives the boy the ability to see all people who are
or will be in heaven: from the past, the present, and the future. What
great joy this brings to this Divine boy whose whole longing is to
lead people to heaven! He is being shown His prayers fulfilled. The
past and future can be seen clearly only by God, and in this case the
human essence within the boy Jesus experiences a glimpse of this
Divine all-seeing power.

THE FIRST TEMPTATIONS OF JESUS

THE BATTLE OF THE KINGS
GENESIS 14

In the land where Abram lives there is an alliance of 
four kings and an opposing alliance of five kings.

The alliance of the four kings defeats the alliance
of the five kings.

Chedorlaomer, one of the kings in the four-king 
alliance, captures Lot, who lives in Sodom.

One citizen of Sodom escapes and tells Abram about 
the capture of Lot.

Abram attacks and defeats Chedorlaomer, freeing Lot.

Two kings in the land of Canaan meet and thank 
Abram when he returns from defeating 
Chedorlaomer.

Once the child Jesus has this vision of the north, south, east and
west — of the past and future — it is inevitable that the hells will
attack. They hate a love that undermines them, and they especially
hate the Lord’s love for the salvation of the whole of humankind.

30

THE FIRST TEMPTATIONS OF JESUS

The Lord’s vision of His purposes fulfilled is a declaration of war
to the devils and satans. But Jesus is only in early childhood. Can
the hells attack Him then?

An answer is found in Greek mythology. When attacked by two
spotted serpents sent by a jealous Hera, Hercules — then an infant
in his cradle — destroyed them with his bare hands. In mythology,
Hercules was the strongest man who ever lived. The ancients, those
living in the distant past, knew from an Ancient Word that in His
earliest  childhood  the  Lord  would  confront  the  hells  for  the  first
time. That this actually happened is revealed in the internal sense of
Genesis 14.

The  alliance  of  four  kings  (Amraphel,  king  of  Shinar;
Arioch,  king  of  Ellasar;  Chedorlaomer,  king  of  Elam;  and
Tidal,  king  of  nations) represents  the  qualities  within  the  child
Jesus from which He will wage His first wars against the hells. The
opposing alliance of five kings (led by the kings of Sodom and
Gomorrah) represents the evil desires and false persuasions (AC
1663) that the Lord will fight against. These are not minor combats.
They are crucial to the salvation of the people of this planet.

Temptations are cyclical. They come, go, and return later. The
Lord’s first temptations occur now, in childhood. They come again
on deeper planes. Each time, He conquers, and each time He estab-
lishes a more complete union with His Soul. This temptation com-
bat happens with inner agony every time, for the height of His love
for others provokes the hells to a vicious depth of attack.

Prior to the war between the four kings and the five, the good
kings  (under  Chedorlaomer)  had  been  victorious  in  many  battles
with evil nations. These nations included the most cruel on earth,
said  to  be  of  a  “similar  kind  to  the  Nephilim”  (AC  1673).  The
“Nephilim” are symbolic of some of the worst devils in existence,
the inhabitants of the lowest hells. Inevitably they attack the Lord
as early in His life as possible, for they wish to approach Him when
He is most vulnerable, and they are permitted to do so.

31

THE PATH, CHAPTER 3

Dreadful  persuasions  filled  those  tribes  who  lived  before  the
“flood”  (the  symbolic  end  of  the  Church  of  those  times  —  the
“flood”  of  false  ideas  depicted  in  the  Noah  story),  especially  the
Nephilim. Their persuasions were dark and poisonous lies.

“Such were the unspeakably horrible nations against whom the
Lord  fought  in  earliest  childhood,  and  whom  He  overcame. And
unless the Lord by His coming into the world had overcome them,
nobody at all would be alive today on this planet” (AC 1673:2).

When the Lord fights these hells, He still has humanly childish
qualities. He fights partially from a sense of merit, or self-credit, as
we do in our own earliest temptations (AC 1661:3-5). But this merit
is there in innocence and ignorance. In innocence lies the greatest
spiritual power. The hells fall back before it.

When He is a child, the Lord’s sense of merit is akin to our own;
that  is,  when  we  believe  to  be  functioning  from  our  own  power
instead of God’s power. At first, the child Jesus is not clearly aware
that  He  is  fighting  from  the  power  of  His  Divine  Soul.  But  later,
when fully joined to His Soul, Jesus would become Merit itself in
a  pure  and  good  sense,  with  no  negative  connotation.  He  alone,
when glorified, is Good itself. All of our good is from Him.

The four kings prevailed in every battle, including the final
great battle against the evil alliance of five kings. These battles
of the good alliance represent the temptations that the Lord experi-
ences  in  childhood,  about  which  nothing  is  recorded  in  the  New
Testament (AC 1690).

What might these trials be like for the child Jesus? Though evil
spirits had lurked nearby from the moment He was born, Jehovah
did not permit them to attack. Just as with us, Jehovah does not per-
mit  temptations,  or  attacks  by  the  forces  of  hell,  until  Jesus  first
learns  something  about  the  distinctions  between  good  and  evil.
With us, these full assaults do not happen until adulthood. But with

32

THE FIRST TEMPTATIONS OF JESUS

this  boy,  our  Savior,  they  happen  in  youngest  childhood.  Once
Jesus has gained some initial knowledge and insight, the hells are
let loose, and they attack with a vengeance.

The devils that attack the child Jesus are similar to the Nephilim
(AC 1673). These spirits especially want to snuff out in their vic-
tim all ability to think, to possess the victim’s will and understand-
ing,  so  that  the  victim  feels  scarcely  alive.  Just  as  Jesus’  mind  is
first  opening  and  learning  truth,  wicked  spirits  work  to  suffocate
that new understanding, to negate true ideas, to cry out that “it is
not  so”  and  instead  insert  their  poisonous  lies.  They  try  with  all
their might to stop young Jesus from thinking the truth and seeing
what is good.

As  finite  humans,  we  feel  such  dire  attacks  of  temptations
only as a dull pain. Young Jesus, however, has incredible depth of
perceptive awareness from His Divine Soul and His celestial love.
He  feels  these  attacks  acutely,  severely,  as  sharp  and  torturous
pain.  Perhaps  He  feels  these  attacks  of  the  hells,  both  against
Himself and also in the events going on around Him in the streets
of Nazareth. Perhaps this small boy feels, with acute perception,
the  intensity  of  the  unkindness  and  false  ideas  that  the  hells  are
inflicting on others. Because His deepest love is for the happiness
of  humankind,  these  perceptions  and  temptations  fill  Him  with
great pain.

But these wicked spirits do not conquer Jesus. Using what good
and truth He has gained (the alliance of four kings), though it is not
yet pure, the boy faces and resists these intense false persuasions.
The alliance of four kings is victorious, though some members of
the evil alliance of five kings escape into the mountains, waiting to
bring trouble at a later time.

The Lord’s intense love for humankind and His desire to save
us are demonstrated by His willingness to endure these trials, and
the  fact  that  they  begin  for  Him  in  what  for  others  is  the  age  of
innocence and ignorance. He is born with a love for our salvation,

33

THE PATH, CHAPTER 3

and fostering this is to be His inmost joy (AC 2034). This is what
sustains Him in childhood.

However, not all of His states are those of temptations or trial.
Jesus has delightful times when He is at One with His Father, and
in this there is a joy inconceivable to us.

The  Old  Testament  account  of  the  battles  representing  these
earliest temptations says that Abram’s nephew Lot was captured
by  Chedorlaomer  and  taken  north  near  Damascus. Lot  repre-
sents the Lord’s external level, or His sensory awareness (see AC
1698).  Chedorlaomer,  who  symbolizes  a  sense  of  merit  or  self-
credit,  captures  this.  Though  a  battle  has  been  won,  the  Lord’s
external level is captured by a sense of having won the battle on His
own, without the power of His Divine Soul. Captivity by merit is a
limited  state  and  has  a  strong  degree  of  self-love  within  it  (AC
3993:9-11). Such merit has its place in the beginning of “regenera-
tion” or the lifelong process of being spiritually reborn, but if we
are ever to become angels it must eventually be removed. The Lord
here shows the way.

In the Lord’s case, there is an almost immediate perception by
His interior mind (represented by Abram the Hebrew) that the cap-
tivity by merit has taken place. The Word says that “one who had
escaped came and told it to Abram the Hebrew” (Gen.14: 13).
The “one who had escaped” is a perception by the child Jesus—a
perception from an inner plane of goodness—that it is wrong to be
captivated by merit. As a child He sees this, and He wishes to free
Himself from this entrapment (AC 1702, 1707:5).

Feeling  merit  is  a  potent  enchantment,  but  it  has  its  uses. We
need  it  to  get  us  through  many  states  and  many  spiritual  battles.
This is especially true in infancy and childhood, when a sense of
merit  or  self-credit  is  appropriate  and  needed  (see  AC  1667:2).
With such merit, “The ignorance excuses, and the innocence makes
it  appear  good”  (Ibid.)  Children  hunger  for  appropriate  praise;  it
will  lead  them  later  to  praise  of  the  Lord  (see  AC  1661).

34

THE FIRST TEMPTATIONS OF JESUS

Recognition of merit’s usefulness is a key element behind the “self-
esteem” movement that is popular today. But when the Lord feels
merit, He eventually puts it aside. The time comes when we must
also put aside childish things. Otherwise we will be captivated by
merit  and  carried  away  into  the  north,  into  the  deep  obscurity  of
spiritual night. However, when merit is recognized as narcissistic
and is rejected, the Lord walks into our hearts. He shares His own
experience with us.

Abram fought against Chedorlaomer and his allies at night,
conquering  them  with  only  318  trained  warriors. It  was,  it
seems, a surprise attack, and the victory was complete. They liber-
ated Lot and his family and belongings and allowed them to be
returned to the land of Canaan. This is a triumph. Lot, that is, the
Lord’s  external  awareness,  is  freed  from  all  sense  of  merit.  This
brings an influx of joy to the child. His very Soul comes down to
bless Him. These victories of the Lord in His first temptations are
crucial to His whole life on earth, to His future of becoming One
with His Soul.

When Abram and Lot returned to the land of Canaan, they
were greeted by a number of kings. But one person there, a mys-
terious figure, seems to come out of nowhere.

“And Melchizedek, king of Salem, brought out bread and wine,
and  he  was  priest  to  God  most  high. And  he  blessed Abram”
(Gen. 14:18-19).

Melchizedek represents the celestial level within the Lord. The
Divine blesses the child after this stunning victory (AC 1725), and
the bread and wine given to Abram prefigure the Holy Supper. The
Lord gains Divine “remains” in these earliest victories (AC 1734),
and in the victories does not use or retain any of the methods or
tactics  or  motivations  of  the  hells  (AC  1739-1748),  as  when
Abram says to the King of Sodom “. . .nor anything that is yours

35

THE PATH, CHAPTER 3

will I take” (Gen. 14:23). It is the same with His invitation to us:
if we turn to Him in dire temptation, He will lead us to victory and
freedom.

COMFORT AND INSIGHTS FOR

THE CHILD JESUS

THE VISION OF THE STARS
GENESIS 15

Jehovah comes to Abram in a vision and makes a 
promise to him that his descendants will be in
number like the stars in the sky.

“After these events, the word of Jehovah came to Abram in
a vision, saying, ‘Fear not, Abram, I am a shield to you, your
exceeding great reward’ ” (Gen. 15:1).

The  Lord  in  earliest  childhood  has  just  experienced  His  first
temptations,  and  they  have  involved  strong  love  and  powerful
despair. The conflicts are “directed against the love He cherished
toward  the  entire  human  race”  (AC  1778).  Jehovah  then  inflows
into the child Jesus with comfort: “Fear not, Abram, I am a shield
to  you”  (Gen.  15:1). This  comfort  comes  “in  a  vision,”  a  vision
which brings an “inmost revelation” (AC 1784).

After these events the child Jesus laments that there is no spiri-
tual  depth  in  the  church  on  earth.  This  is  embodied  in  Abram’s
words  “seeing  I  go  childless”  (Gen.  15:2). Jesus  can  only  see  a
church of an external nature without inner heart. Would this be His

37

THE PATH, CHAPTER 4

heir?  Would  there  be  no  real  celestial  love,  no  mutual  love  and
heavenly kindness? He can see that “there was no internal dimen-
sion to the church” (AC 1797).

Jehovah then re-assures Jesus, promising that there will be an
heir or future church with people in celestial love and love of the
neighbor (AC 1800). A living church will be reborn on earth. Jesus
(or Abram, His representative) is shown this in a vivid way.

Picture the Lord as a young boy, perhaps younger than twelve,
going out at night beyond the outskirts of Nazareth in Galilee. His
Soul leads Him to look up at the stars. The atmosphere is crystal
clear, and the young child sees myriads of stars. His Soul then gives
Him, as he gazes upward, a “mental view of the universe.”

We  now  know  that  one  galaxy  holds  millions  of  stars.  And
though it seems incredible, there are millions of galaxies. Jesus also
sees, through the correspondence of these stars, the billions of peo-
ple who have become angels in the universe, for each star symbol-
izes a society of angels. Jehovah says to Jesus in internal conversa-
tion, “See all these millions of stars. That is how many angels, past,
present and future, there are and will be” (see AC 1805, 1810).

Learning from “correspondences” is a way of using the relation-
ship of all things of heaven with all things on earth. This method of
seeing — of using physical things to learn about spiritual things —
is a whole method or paradigm of insight. It is not an entirely new
paradigm, for it was known to the Most Ancient people and to the
people of the Ancient Church as well. But it has long since been for-
gotten. Jehovah uses correspondences here in teaching Jesus.

The two worlds, natural and spiritual, marvelously co-respond
to  each  other.  The  people  of  the  Most  Ancient  Church  on  earth
knew  instinctively  that  our  earthly  sun  corresponds  to  the  Sun  in
heaven, or to the Lord’s Love. They instinctively knew the corre-
spondences  of  mountains,  seas,  lakes,  meadows,  woods,  flowers,
animals, birds, and, in fact, all things of creation.

A touch of this instinctive feeling or perception is left with us

38

COMFORT AND INSIGHTS FOR THE CHILD JESUS

today,  perhaps  from  our  remains  or  from  the  very  order  of  our
souls. We see a soaring snowcapped mountain and sense its power.
We  do  not  know  without  instruction  that  high  mountains  corre-
spond to love of the Lord, a love soaring to the skies, yet we seem
to feel something of this. We sense that the outer heights of nature
symbolize inner heights of the mind and heart. So also when we see
sparkling waters on an ocean or lake, delight touches us and we feel
their beauty. We do not know without instruction that such waters
correspond to living truths, but nevertheless we feel a delight. And
so  it  is  with  gardens,  woods,  graceful  animals,  and  many  other
things of nature.

The Writings of Emanuel Swedenborg reveal a myriad of cor-
respondences,  and  knowing  correspondences  can  greatly  enhance
the effect that nature has on our minds and hearts. From this new
knowledge given to Swedenborg, it can be more than an occasion-
al  instinctive  feeling;  it  can  again  become  the  “knowledge  of
knowledges” (NJHD 261, AC 1806, 1807).

What the Lord sees that night, when Jehovah brings Him (rep-
resented by Abram) outside, and says, “Look now towards heav-
en  and  count  the  stars,  if  you  are  able  to  count  them”  (Gen.
15:5) stands as a prophecy for this new knowledge being used in a
New  Church  on  earth.  Jesus  is  inspired  and  encouraged  by  this
vision.

When the boy Jesus sees this vision, He knows that the count-
less stars represent all the good in heaven and on earth. After His
first  temptations,  this  reassurance  means  much  to  Him.  Abram
“believed in Jehovah, and Jehovah reckoned it to him as right-
eousness” (Gen. 15:6).

“What is meant here by “believing in Jehovah” is that the Lord
was filled repeatedly with an inmost confidence and faith. He was
shown, and He believed, that because it was pure love from which
He  was  fighting  for  the  salvation  of  the  whole  human  race,  He

39

THE PATH, CHAPTER 4

could not be anything but victorious” (AC 1812).

The Lord offers this same hope for us in our temptations. His
pure  love,  glorified,  conquers  death,  and  rises  in  resurrection.
Because of this, when our bodies die, His Divine love also lifts us
up. No force can resist this.

THE FIRST RATIONAL OF THE LORD

Chapter Five

AS A CHILD

ISHMAEL
GENESIS 16

Sarai, Abram’s wife, is unable to have a child, so she 
has her servant Hagar conceive a child from Abram.

Hagar gives birth to a son named Ishmael.

Hagar now feels superior to her mistress.
Sarai is disturbed by this, and tries to humble her. 
Hagar runs away.

An angel appears to Hagar and tells her to return 
to Sarai. The angel also tells her that Ishmael 
will be a wild man, struggling against everyone.

Ishmael represents the first “rational,” or first reasoning ability, of
the Lord and of ourselves. Understanding the nature of this first rea-
soning ability is not a minor issue. For if Ishmael is allowed to be the
primary heir, if he is allowed to rule unchallenged, then spiritually our
civilization will perish. Ishmael the mocker would supplant the future
Isaac, the future son of Abram and Sarai, who symbolizes true or spir-
itual  thinking.  Humanity  begins  in  the  inmost  of  this  true  rational,
which is the “Isaac” reasoning ability, not the “Ishmael” (AC 2194).
Who is Ishmael spiritually? What is his role? The drama in the

41

THE PATH, CHAPTER 5

Genesis story (chapter 16) gives the key. Since Sarai was barren,
it was necessary that Ishmael be born to provide an heir at this
time. Since the Lord wishes to walk the pathway of human devel-
opment, Ishmael, the temporary heir, must be born to Him also. He
too,  before  achieving  a  spiritual  rationality,  comes  into  this  first
rational. How the Lord handles this lower-level rational is a key to
the future establishment of a New Church on this earth.

Jesus  is  aware  of  a  deep  lack  within  Himself  (AC  1892). The
child does not yet have a true or Divine rational level of His mind.
He feels this barrenness and yearns for a true inner level of thinking.
Jesus  yearns  to  understand  the  Divine  purpose  and  nature  of
creation fully and deeply. He wishes for this, not for His own sake,
but because He knows this capability is needed to save us. To save
humankind  is  His  love,  His  life.  But  Sarai,  who  symbolizes  pure
and heavenly truth allied to the goodness in Him, was barren. The
pure truth deep within young Jesus was not yet able to produce a
rational way of thinking. Spiritually rational thinking is the inter-
mediary that can join heavenly and worldly knowledge.

When  Sarai  saw  she  was  barren,  she  went  to Abram  and
said: “See now, Jehovah has restrained me from bearing chil-
dren. Please, go in to my maid; perhaps I shall obtain children
by her” (Gen. 16:2). “So Hagar bore Abram a son; and Abram
named his son. . .Ishmael” (Gen. 16:15). Deep within Him, Jesus
perceives that He cannot produce a reasoning ability straight from
His  love  of  pure,  heavenly  truth  (Sarai).  There  must  be  an  outer
basis.  A  love  for  external  knowledge,  learned  from  the  world
around Him, must be joined to His Divine Internal (Abram). Hagar,
who is brought to Abram by Sarai herself, represents this love for
external knowledge, and it is from this that the Lord’s first rational
thinking is born. This is an outer reasoning, thinking from worldly
knowledge.

When is this “Ishmael rational” born within Him? I believe He
is  younger  than  twelve  years  old.  The  second  or  Isaac  rational

42

THE FIRST RATIONAL OF THE LORD AS A CHILD

seems to be speaking in the temple when the Lord is twelve. For all
who  heard  Jesus  then  “were  astonished  at  His  understanding  and
answers” (Luke 2:47). And He said to Joseph and Mary, “Did you
not know that I must be about My Father’s business?” or literally,
“in my Father’s things?” (Luke 2:49).

If  there  had  been  no  hereditary  evil  in  the  human  race,  the
Divine rational would, at the right time, have been born immedi-
ately with the Lord. Sarai would not have been barren. But the Lord
took on hereditary evil tendencies with His birth from Mary. He did
this deliberately so that He might experience our pathway and out
of love show us the way.

That  a  love  of  worldly  knowledge  (Hagar)  is  the  mother  of
Ishmael fits his representation exactly. This initial ability to reason,
the  “first  rational,”  is  only  from  a  natural  level.  It  comes  from  a
marriage  of  an  internal  love  with  strong  outer  curiosity. The  first
rational is necessary for mental progress, because the ability to rea-
son is the first step toward deeper thinking, and toward finally see-
ing spiritual truths.

Unfortunately for us, we have hereditary evil tendencies. With
us, these tendencies bring conceit to this reasoning ability. That is
why  the  name  “Ishmael”  has  a  pejorative  ring  to  it. As  the Word
puts it, Ishmael “will be a wild-ass man; his hand will be against
all, and the hand of all against him; and he will dwell in oppo-
sition to all his brothers” (Gen. 17:12).

This  first  rational  in  us  typically  first  appears  as  childhood  is
ending  and  young  adulthood  beginning.  What  is  a  person  like  in
this state?

“He is quick to find fault, makes no allowances, is against all,
regards everyone as being in error, is instantly prepared to rebuke,
to chasten, and to punish, shows no pity, does not apply himself and
makes no effort to redirect people’s thinking; for he views every-
thing from the standpoint of truth, and nothing from the standpoint

43

THE PATH, CHAPTER 5

of good. In short, he is a hard person” (AC 1949:2).

An  even  lower  element  in  this  first  reasoning  is  seen  when  it
does  not  acknowledge  truth,  but  rather  reasons  from  the  senses
alone and is negative to all spiritual truth.

What  might  this  “Ishmael  rational”  look  like  in  the  young
Jesus? Once He is actively and eagerly gaining knowledge from the
world around Him and forming His first rational conclusions, Jesus
feels the stirring of disturbing tendencies in His finite human hered-
ity. From this maternal heredity arise inclinations to judge and crit-
icize,  to  make  conclusions  based  on  outer  evidence  alone,  and  to
scoff at deep, inner truth. In Genesis, this scoffing is first repre-
sented  by  the  fact  that  Hagar  “despised”  her  barren  mistress
once  she found  herself  pregnant.  This  first  rational  state  (AC
1911) lacks respect for deep, inner truth that can’t be “proved” by
outer evidence.

From  His  deep,  inner  love  of  spiritual  truth  (Sarai)  Jesus  is
greatly  upset  by  the  arrogance  attached  to  this  first  rational  level
(pregnant  Hagar). In  Genesis,  Sarai  complains  to  Abram  of
Hagar’s behavior, and Abram gives her permission to deal with
her  handmaid  in  any  way  she  sees  fit.  And  so  “Sarai  deals
harshly with Hagar,” or in other words “humbles her.”

Jesus’ internal level (Abram) enables Him, from His deep love
of heavenly truth (Sarai), to subjugate this outer reasoning ability
and to work to drive out the negative attitudes and lack of respect
that attach themselves to it. This involves much conflict within the
young Jesus, and so it is said that Sarai deals harshly with Hagar.

At first, this first rational level in Jesus does not want to be sub-
jugated, and so it is said that Hagar runs away from her mistress,
Sarai. But then, in the wilderness, the Angel of Jehovah comes
to Hagar, and speaks to her. The Angel tells Hagar to go back
and submit to her mistress, and then describes the nature of the
son that will be born to her. As Hagar listens, she softens, and

44

THE FIRST RATIONAL OF THE LORD AS A CHILD

marvels at the power of the “God Who Sees.”

The voice of Jehovah, represented by the Angel, comes down
into the first rational stirrings within the mind of young Jesus. His
Divine Soul enlightens Jesus as to what this first reasoning ability
will  be  like  if  it  does  not  submit  to  the  guidance  of  inner  truth,
which holds the things of God and heavenly love above the things
of the world. If this first rational does submit to higher truth, then
it will multiply and grow, learning more and more wonders from
the natural world which reflect the glory of its Creator. The Angel
promises Hagar that if she respects and obeys her mistress, God
will multiply her descendants exceedingly (Gen. 16:10).

Jesus marvels at the wisdom of this, and willingly allows this
new rational level to be subjugated and cleansed by His deep love
of spiritual truth. Hagar obediently returns to her mistress.

Every mentally sound child or youth comes into the use of rea-
son. This gift can either turn us away from the Lord or open us up
to Him with new breadth. When it is said that the human, the true
human, begins in the “inmost of the rational” (AC 2194), it means
that the highest part of our intelligence is to think, to understand,
and to comprehend things above our senses. If we see from a heav-
enly love, then the rational becomes fully alive to the beauty of the
Lord  and  of  creation.  The  Writings  of  Swedenborg  speak  to  this
highest level of the human mind — to the rational that sees from
kindness or love.

Ishmael  was  to  be  cast  out,  and  Isaac  was  to  take  his  place.
Therefore the first rational is to be expelled, and the second or spir-
itual  rational  is  to  take  its  place  (AC  1949:2,  1950).  The  cynical
qualities and the hard nature of the first reasoning ability must be
shunned and removed before we can be truly human. The one thing
that softens the hardness of that initial way of thinking is goodness
— the good of kindness. This is the heart of the second rational.

The  Lord  as  a  boy  thinks  from  higher  truth  and  from  higher
love, and from these He subdues the evil tendencies that affect His

45

THE PATH, CHAPTER 5

first reasoning. Because He does this, He makes it possible for us
to do the same. With the Lord’s help we are able to fight against
false reason — reason that is tied to conceit. Our minds can become
free to see and love Divine truth. “If you abide in My Word, then
you are My disciples indeed, and you shall know the truth, and the
truth shall make you free” (John 8:31,32). The Lord as a boy paves
the way for us. In the temple at age twelve, He shows the results of
this: “All who heard Him were astonished at His understanding and
answers” (Luke 2:47).

At every step of His growth and glorification, the Lord reveals
Divine principles. His first perception as an infant, that we are to
ascend from lower things to higher ones, is the key to life. We are
here on earth to ascend to heaven. In overcoming the cruel, persua-
sive, and controlling spirits called the Nephilim in His first tempta-
tions, He shows the path of rebirth for us and helps to clear the way.
In viewing the stars He not only sees the future angelic heaven, but
also shows a new way of thinking, by which we can use external
things to see spiritual or internal things.

In His subduing of the first rational, the Lord indicates the path
to true thinking, and to being truly human. If we reason from outer
evidence alone, received through our senses, we will never believe.
This first rational thinking is Ishmael, and it is a rebel. But if love
or kindness comes to us, the Lord opens our eyes, just as His eyes
open from love in order to see the Ishmael rational for what it is. If
we are willing to acknowledge a hard truth — that it is conceit that
blinds our eyes — and then shun that arrogance and pray for the
Lord’s  enlightenment,  we  will  “perceive  what  is  true”  from  the
Lord’s influx and light (see AC 6047).

The negative principle, thinking from the senses and from con-
ceit, has viciously attacked churches in the past. It also destroys our
own individual perception or sight of truth. Our arrogance does not
like to admit this, true though it is.

But  the  affirmative  principle,  thinking  from  the  Lord’s  light,

46

THE FIRST RATIONAL OF THE LORD AS A CHILD

opens our eyes (Ibid.). This is a promise to each of us, and it is true.
In the journey and development of the Lord as a boy, Isaac replaces
Ishmael.

THE SALVATION OF HUMANKIND

A COVENANT
GENESIS 17

Jehovah makes a covenant with Abram, that he will 
be a father of many nations, and Jehovah changes 
his name to Abraham.

The sign of the covenant between Jehovah and 
Abraham, as well as his descendants, is that 
Abraham and his descendants will be circumcised.

Abraham, Ishmael and all the men of his house 
are circumcised.

Jehovah is Love itself. He, in essence, is the deepest possible
love for others, the desire to be one with them, and to make them
happy from Himself (see TCR 43). Jesus as a boy was not yet One
with Jehovah. But He, too, was moved by deep love — a love for
the  saving  of  each  of  us.  It  is  easy  to  use  the  term  “love.”  But
Jesus’ love is so tender, so gentle, that it is only in our own most
sensitive moments that we can perceive something of His nature
(AC 2077:1,2).

In Genesis 17 Jehovah makes a covenant with Abram. This
covenant pledges a closer union of Jehovah and the human part or

48

THE SALVATION OF HUMAN KIND

human essence of Jesus. Jesus the boy is growing up. “He increased
in wisdom and stature and in favor with God and men” (Luke 2:52).
He has reasoning ability, represented by Ishmael. He has subordi-
nated  His  reasoning  to  the  higher  love  within  Him,  bringing  in
Isaac as the future new heir. This brings Jesus closer to His Soul,
Jehovah, and leads to the covenant spoken of in this chapter.

A  special  event  now  happens.  Jehovah  said  to Abram,  “no
longer will your name be called Abram, but your name will be
Abraham,  for  I  have  made  you  the  father  of  a  multitude  of
nations”  (Gen.  17:5). This  means  that  Jesus  “will  cast  off  the
[finite] human” and that “He will put on the Divine” (AC 2008).
This  does  not  happen  instantaneously.  It  is  accomplished  step  by
step (AC 2010). The letter “h” was here added to Abram’s name.
This letter represents what is Divine, and therefore what is gently
yet powerfully loving. Sarai also had “h” added to her name, with
similar meaning.

The Lord as an infant, child, and youth is the most loving and
caring person ever present on this earth. Now, in becoming nearer
to the Divine itself, He becomes even more loving. This does not
mean  that  we  lose  Him.  He  becomes  closer  to  us,  more  compas-
sionate,  and  finally  Divinely  loving.  This  is  vital.  By  becoming
Divine  even  in  His  Human,  He  puts  on  powers  and  qualities  no
mortal person has. He has the power to make His love for us truly
effective. He is with us now, where we live, love, think and feel. He
lifts us up from death. He lifts us up, if we are willing, from inner
spiritual death. He cannot do this effectively in His human essence
before  He  becomes  Divine.  This  addition  of  the  letter  “h”  to
Abram’s name is cause for joy.

Because the Lord was born on earth, where He “glorified” or
made Divine His rational, His natural, His sensuous, and His very
body, He becomes present with us in a way never before possible.
He becomes present to save us.

The  sign  of  the  covenant  between  Jehovah  and Abraham

49

THE PATH, CHAPTER 6

was  circumcision  (Gen.  17:10). It  was  also  a  covenant  between
Abraham and his “seed” or descendants. Spiritually this covenant is
between  the  Lord  and  all  people,  and  it  leads  to  each  person’s
rebirth,  for  all  that  are  willing.  Circumcision  symbolizes  “the
removal and rejection of those things that were impeding and defil-
ing  celestial  love”  (AC  2039).  To  reject,  from  the  Lord’s  power,
those lusts and evils that impede our deepest love is to circumcise
the heart. 

Jehovah’s covenant with Abraham led to the further covenant
with us. As we circumcise our hearts with deep prayer to the Lord,
He inflows into us with the three most vital loves in creation: con-
jugial love, the love of infants, and mutual love or love for society
(Ibid.). The term “conjugial love” is one that Swedenborg uses to
describe a love between married partners that is spiritual and heav-
enly in quality. Conjugial is the principal of all good loves. Within
it are the highest uses and most tender receptions of the Lord. In its
essence, conjugial love is love of the Lord received. A husband and
wife who look in innocence to the Lord receive conjugial love, and
from  this  flows  their  love  of  infants  and  love  of  their  children’s
innocence.

What is more beautiful to see than the love between a devoted
husband and wife? This love comes as a result of the union between
the Lord’s Divine, the part that is Jehovah, and the Human, the part
that came on earth as Jesus. The Lord’s inmost joy was to foresee
that out of the union of the Divine and Human in Himself would
come  individual  rebirths  in  many,  many  human  hearts,  including
the future reception of true marriage love (AC 2034, 2039).

== Chapter Seven

“HIS MERCY IS FOREVER” 

ISAAC’S BIRTH FORETOLD
GENESIS 18

Jehovah appears to Abraham as three men (angels), 
and Abraham and Sarah feed them.

Jehovah tells Abraham that he and Sarah will have
a child.

When the angels are going to leave, Abraham looks 
toward Sodom with them, and discusses with 
Jehovah His plan to destroy Sodom.

Abraham begs Jehovah to spare the city.

In  these  days  in  Nazareth  the  boy  Jesus  is  open  to  learning
from His Soul. This openness is represented first by Jehovah and
His  three  angels’  visiting  Abraham  in  Mamre;  second,  by
Jehovah’s  message  to  Abraham  and  Sarah  about  Isaac’s  future
conception  and  birth;  and  finally  by  Jehovah’s  and  Abraham’s
looking down upon Sodom and Gomorrah, and Abraham’s plead-
ing with Jehovah that they be spared. These three events describe
Jesus’  learning  about  the  perfect  Oneness  in  God,  the  coming

51

THE PATH, CHAPTER 7

birth  of  His  Divine  rational  level,  and  about  the  extent  of
Jehovah’s mercy.

“And  Jehovah  appeared  to Abraham  in  the  oak-groves  of
Mamre, and he was sitting in the tent door, as the day was get-
ting warmer” (Gen. 18:1). By “the day getting warmer” is meant
symbolically  that  unselfish  love  is  becoming  stronger  in  Jesus.
From this increasing love He is open to learning. “And he lifted up
his eyes and saw, and behold, three men standing over him. And
he saw, and ran from the tent door to meet them, and bowed
towards  the  ground”  (Gen.  18:2). Jesus,  like Abraham’s  vision
many years earlier, sees three angels standing before Him, and He
realizes these three represent the trinity in God.

He recognizes that He will now learn from His Soul more about
the One God — about God’s unity and the trinity within Him. He
feels humbled by this instruction, but also feels great joy. He loves
to learn these things, especially from His Soul Who He knows is
Love itself.

Think  of  the  distance,  the  immeasurable  difference,  between
God and a finite human being. God is Infinite Divine Love itself.
We are finite, yet still human in His image. Jesus at this time has a
comparable separation between Himself and His Divine Soul as far
as His human essence is concerned.

As Abraham is speaking here, he represents the Lord as to His
“human before it was made Divine” (AC 2154). This is compara-
ble to our separation from God, but with the Lord as a boy there are
marked differences. He is born with a love for saving others. His
Soul is Divine – God. Nevertheless, as to His human essence at this
point, He is still finite.

Now Jehovah has drawn near, appearing to Jesus in a vision. The
boy is deeply moved, and desires that Jehovah stay and teach Him,
and be close to Him. Abraham, representing the boy Jesus, asked
the angels or Jehovah to stay and refresh themselves, and said
that He would prepare food and drink for them (Gen. 18:4-8).

52

“HIS MERCY IS FOREVER”

This symbolizes how the Divine accommodates itself to communi-
cate  with  the  child. And  the  boy  Jesus  also  comes  into  a  special
state so that He can directly communicate with His Soul. You feel
the  strong  wishes  of  the  two  to  reach  to  communicate  with  each
other. The Divine draws nearer to the boy by putting on something
natural, and the boy draws nearer to His Soul by putting on some-
thing celestial (AC 2137).

There  is  a  rich  and  full  communication.  The  Word  says  that
“Abraham stood before the angels [or Jehovah] under the tree,
and they ate” (Gen. 18:8). The key words “and they ate” signify
this communication of Jehovah and the boy. This brings Jesus spe-
cial  happiness  (AC  2147),  because  He  is  taught  clearly  how  His
purpose on earth may be fulfilled. He is further taught how He will
become  One  with  His  Soul,  and  how  this  union  will  lead  to  the
Holy  Spirit  being  sent  out  from  Him.  This  is  the  trinity  in  One
Person. By this union, when He has become the Divine Human, He
will proceed to redeem and save countless human beings, and hope-
fully each one of us.

When  this  first  instruction  is  completed,  Jehovah  turns  to  the
second phase of the child’s instruction. This instruction is about the
conception and birth of Isaac, or the Divine rational, and that His
rational  was  to  “cast  off  the  human  and  be  made  Divine”  (AC
2138). This step is vital to His goals. Without a glorified rational,
the  Lord  would  lack  the  means  to  save  humankind.  The  Ishmael
within Him cannot do this. He sees His own present inadequacies,
His strong need for a true rational or ability to reason from a heav-
enly perspective, and He wishes intensely for its birth.

Jehovah told Abraham that Sarah his wife would bear a son
in  about  a  year’s  time.  Sarah  overheard  this  promise  and
laughed in disbelief. She thought that she and Abraham were
far too old to have a child. Her disbelief illustrates our own lack
of trust in the Lord’s inner miracles.

In our lower states we find it incredible that something higher

53

THE PATH, CHAPTER 7

and more beautiful can be born within us. The birth of the Lord in
the human heart seems unbelievable at times. The coming of living
faith to us as adults seems incredible. To this the Lord our Creator
and Father says, “Will anything be too wonderful for Jehovah?”
(Gen. 18:14). Don’t we experience miracles? Don’t we fall in love?
Isn’t faith born in our hearts?

One  part  of  Jesus  cannot  believe  the  Divine  rational  will  be
born in Him. Here, Sarah represents “merely human rational truth
present  within  the  Lord”  (AC  2139). This  merely  human  rational
truth laughs at Divine truth, for Divine truth is beyond its compre-
hension  (AC  2139).  His  Soul  then  reveals  to  Jesus  the  fact  that
despite the limitations of His finite human heredity, a Divine ration-
al will soon be born within Him.

In the history of the human race this birth of the Divine ration-
al with the boy Jesus has startling meaning, for it brings the Divine
Human into reality on the plane of His rational level. From this glo-
rified rational, from that time until eternity, comes the salvation of
each person. Within the child there is recognition of this, and sur-
passing joy and gratitude, for this birth was to change the world.

It is true that further development is needed to make this Divine

birth complete, but the miracle is about to take place.

The  third  phase  of  Jesus’  being  taught  by  Jehovah  is  now  to
begin.  It  concerns  the  nature  of  good  and  evil  within  humankind.
Jehovah’s and Abraham’s going to the plateau edge and looking
down on Sodom and Gomorrah represents a viewing of the state
of the human race. These cities had fallen into terrible perversions,
and now an examination of their states was about to take place, and
judgment if necessary. Abraham pleaded with Jehovah to spare
Sodom and Gomorrah from destruction. He begged Jehovah to
spare  them  if  there  were  fifty  good  people  there,  then  if  there
were forty-five, then if there were fewer and fewer, even down
to ten. Abraham’s pleading represents Jesus’ great love and concern
for  humankind,  and  His  fear  that  no  one  could  be  saved.  For

54

“HIS MERCY IS FOREVER”

Jehovah  showed Abraham  “the  face  of  Sodom”  (Gen.  18:16),
which represents the evil within human hearts.

At times we tend to look upon evil simplistically. We know it is
destructive, a terribly negative force; yet we often fail to see the full
cruelty and hate within it. Jesus is about to see this, with Jehovah
His Soul at His side. Upon viewing it, “He wished to depart from
that perception” (AC 2222). He is born with a love for our salva-
tion. His very heart, His very nature, is to love each human being.
Now He is seeing the depth of evil in humankind. The effect of see-
ing this is direct: He is “struck with horror” (Ibid.). He wishes to
withdraw from the vision.

Yet this child is born to be our Savior. To fulfill His mission, the
Lord  on  earth  has  to  know  fully  both  the  evil  and  good  states  of
human beings. For the sake of fulfilling His love, He has to know
the truth. Then He knows how to help each of us. He must confront
a reality that He at first does not wish to face. But He does face it,
out of His love. At the same time, as a boy, He has only a limited
perception of the mercy of His Soul, of Jehovah. He doesn’t really
know how His Soul, which He feels then as separate from Himself,
will react to this awful sight of evil.

Jesus cannot bear to have His love utterly defeated by human
evil; He cares too much, loves too deeply. But what if this is the
only possibility? In His present state of development He does not
know that His Soul, Jehovah, is mercy itself. In His still ignorant
and limited but compassionate Human, He begs Jehovah to save as
many as possible. He tries to “intercede” for humankind, unaware
that Jehovah always judges from goodness and works to bring into
heaven all that are willing to respond.

The boy Jesus, with Jehovah, now views the various states of
humankind throughout the earth, from the most regenerate, or spir-
itually  developed,  to  the  least  regenerate,  and  then  to  those  con-
firmed  in  evil.  The  descending  numbers  for  which  Jesus  pleads
with Jehovah to spare the human race (fifty, forty-five, forty, thirty,

55

THE PATH, CHAPTER 7

twenty, and ten) represent lesser and lesser degrees of good within
various  people  on  earth.  By  means  of  this  looking  at  humankind
together  with  His  Soul,  the  boy  Jesus  is  to  learn  many  beautiful
things, and He has the chance for His human love to be strength-
ened in a tender way.

Abraham  first  pleaded  with  Jehovah  to  spare  Sodom  if
there were only fifty good people there. The number “fifty” rep-
resents  those  people  on  earth  who  have  in  their  hearts  true  ideas
filled  with  goodness  (AC  2261).  Jehovah  said,  yes,  Sodom  (or
humankind) would be spared, or saved, for the sake of such inno-
cent good people.

Humankind is also spared if there are those who have less good
than those represented by “fifty,” but whose goodness is joined with
truth. These are the “forty-five” (AC 2269). Those who are victori-
ous in temptations, greater or lesser, are also causes for humankind’s
salvation — “forty” and “thirty” (AC 2272-3, AC 2276).

The Lord’s entire goal is the salvation both of individuals and
of human life on this planet as a whole. Therefore this planet will
be spared for the sake of children and their salvation, and for the
sake of Gentiles who walk in innocence, surely many millions of
people (represented by “twenty”).

How  gentle  Jehovah’s  mercy  is!  And  this  is  to  become  the
mercy  of  Jesus  Christ  as  He  becomes  One  with  His  Soul.  In  his
final plea, Abraham asks that Sodom be spared for the sake of ten
good  people.  The  number  “ten”  represents  the  qualities  of  inno-
cence and goodness that remain from childhood. If there are those
who  have  not  destroyed  these  innocent  “remains”  through  con-
firmed choices of evil, then they too will be elevated into heaven.
Every decent human being is at times depressed over his or her
evil. We feel then that there is nothing good enough within us to ever
achieve heaven. This type of humility is not bad for us if we don’t
then  give  in  to  evil.  Instead,  we  may  think  about  the  sparing  of
Sodom  for  only  “ten,”  and  pray  to  the  Lord  for  His  presence  and

56

“HIS MERCY IS FOREVER”

help. His mercy is infinite and deeply loving. What He is saying here
to each of us is, “I love you, and will save you, if you are only will-
ing.” We need only to respond from the heart and show this by obey-
ing His commandments, for this preserves our hidden innocence.

Jehovah’s  power  to  save  is  astounding  and  far  beyond  any
finite, human mercy. Jesus learns this on that spiritual plateau over-
looking  the  whole  realm  of  human  life,  just  as Abraham  looked
down from the Judean plateau upon the Salt Sea valley. To Jesus it
is deeply moving and fulfilling of His love for human beings. When
Jehovah or the three angels then leave Him, Jesus is in a state of
inmost  joy.  He  sees  that  many,  many  will  be  saved,  and  that  His
purposes on earth will be fulfilled.

LOT SAVED
Genesis 19

The story shifts to Lot, Abraham’s nephew, who lives 
in the city of Sodom.

Two angels visit Lot in his home, and the home is 
attacked by the people of Sodom.

Lot and his family flee; Sodom and Gomorrah
are destroyed.

Chapter 19 of Genesis tells of the visit of two angels to Lot
in Sodom, to lead him and his immediate family out of the city.
Judgment  was  coming  upon  this  depraved  city,  but  first,  any
good people were to flee to the mountain for safety.

In the Divine drama of the Lord’s boyhood on earth, this is a
prophecy  of  a  fulfillment  of  His  love  for  the  salvation  of
humankind. In the rescuing of Lot and his daughters from Sodom,
Jesus sees the present and future salvation of uncounted millions of
human beings. He is moved at heart, but at the same time He sees

57

THE PATH, CHAPTER 7

the inevitable reality that evil (Sodom) rushes to its own self-judg-
ment. He also realizes that some people will turn back from good
and truth, and profane them, just as Lot’s wife turned back to look
at Sodom and turned into a pillar of salt. He wishes it were not so.
He strongly desires the salvation of all, but He sees more and more
clearly  that  there  must  be  spiritual  freedom  if  people  are  to  be
human and responsive.

The primary theme of this chapter is rescue and salvation. It is
realistic and vital that evil and good be separated in order to protect
what is good. But the Lord always reaches out to rescue any will-
ing person. Lot was freed. We may be freed. Jesus learns more here
about the nature of Divine compassion, and reaches up in His heart
towards it.

THE ORIGIN OF DOCTRINE

ABRAHAM, SARAH, AND ABIMELECH
GENESIS 20

The story shifts back to Abraham and Sarah, who 
travel south to Gerar.

Abraham tells Abimelech, the king of Gerar, that 
Sarah is his sister, for fear that Abimelech will kill 
him to take Sarah for his own.

God warns Abimelech in a dream not to take Sarah 
for a wife, so Abimelech restores Sarah to Abraham.

A final preparation is needed before Isaac, or the Divine ration-
al, can be born. Abraham’s and Sarah’s sojourning in Gerar of
Philistia, and Abraham’s calling Sarah his sister represent this
preparation.  Sarah  was  beautiful,  and  Abimelech,  the  king  of
Gerar,  took  her  to  be  his  future  wife. After  being  warned  by
God in a dream, he restored Sarah to Abraham and gave him
many gifts.

Hidden  in  this  story  is  a  Divine  warning. Also  hidden  here  is
how  the  Lord,  as  He  neared  the  end  of  childhood,  prepared  to
receive the Divine “doctrine” or religious principles to live by. In
infancy in Egypt, Jesus had been instructed in knowledges and had

59

THE PATH, CHAPTER 8

received insights. Now, in a far more advanced state, He is taught
doctrinal  things  (AC  2496).  He  is  taught  how  to  convert  these
knowledges and insights into spiritual principles for living.

In His learning, the Lord has a special gift or talent. He is able
to be instructed “by continual revelations, and thus by Divine per-
ceptions and thoughts from. . .the Divine. . . .This way of growing
wise  is  not  possible  with  any  person,  for  it  flowed  in  from  the
Divine itself” (AC 2500:2). This is a method of Divinely perceptive
learning that the child Jesus alone has.

When  Abraham  told  Abimilech  that  Sarah  was  his  sister,  he
opened the way for a terrible adultery. Abimelech represents prin-
ciples of faith that are being searched out by sensual reasoning (AC
2510), and his taking Sarah to his house represents the love of using
sense-based  reasoning  to  find  spiritual  truth.  This  seems  like  an
innocuous thing to do, but it is spiritual adultery and has caused the
downfall  of  every  major  church  on  earth  and  of  many  reasoning
human beings.

We  accept  into  our  lives  only  truth  that  is  gained  from  a  gen-
uinely kind and loving perspective, not from a calculating “prove it
to me” attitude. All truth in our lives can be seen only from spiritu-
al love. Love opens the eyes. Sarah representing such truth is a wife.
She is not a sister to be taken in adultery by Abimelech (AC 2510,
2568:4, 6047).

Jesus  as  a  boy  encounters  the  problem  of  reasoning  from  the
senses  about  matters  of  faith,  because  He  has  this  tendency  from
His heredity through Mary. In His higher thought He sees clearly
that such thinking undermines genuine doctrine, and that in the last
analysis  this  approach  to  the Word  springs  from  conceit.  He  also
sees that this conceit has to be put off, along with the rest of His
finite human heredity (AC 2511).

This story of Abraham, Sarah, and Abimelech seems to be an
historical case of unintentional adultery. Spiritually, though, for the
Lord and for us, it reveals a crucial axiom about external reasoning

60

THE ORIGIN OF DOCTRINE

and its place in the search for faith. This axiom is not in harmony
with  the  attitude  prevailing  in  much  of  higher  education,  which
believes  that  “Of  course  you  use  reason  in  determining  what  is
(spiritually) true! The scientific or inductive method is the key to
final  philosophical  truths.”  It  is  this  ruling  principle,  termed  “the
negative principle” in the Writings of Swedenborg, which underlies
so much of the thinking in today’s world! However, we see a shift
away from this type of thinking in many areas, for example in the
interest  in  Eastern  thought.  The  inadequacy  of  human  reason  is
more and more clearly recognized.

That the Lord confronts this issue in His glorification is a vital
reality, because it paves the way for the future release of civiliza-
tion  from  lower  thinking,  from  a  darkened  perception.  It  enables
heavenly  light  and  heavenly  love  to  penetrate  the  thinking  mind.
The  human begins  in  the  inmost of  the  rational  mind,  and  this
“inmost” is heavenly love.

Concerning the inverted method of thinking that the Lord con-
sidered from His finite maternal human (using reason to establish
faith), we read that “He reproved Himself from zeal. . .and here that
He  felt  horror”  (AC  2548).  What  leads  Him  into  thinking  of  a
wrong approach to truth is His finite maternal heredity, and perhaps
much more potently, the concern He feels for our limitations and
for us. He has to resist reasoning from His limited, outer view of
the  state  of  the  human  race,  and  instead  reason  from  what  He  is
learning from the perspective of His Divine Soul. By considering
the former wrong approach to truth, Jesus learns a great deal, and
the “horror” He comes to feel about this inverted approach, sym-
bolized  by Abimelech’s  horror  at  what  he  had  done,  stands  as  a
warning signal to us.

Heavenly loves and truths are potentially present on the higher
levels of our minds. Truths can be revealed or disclosed to our high-
er  rational.  But  our  lower  rational  or  reasoning  simply  does  not
have the ability to see or believe truths and goods that are on a high-

61

THE PATH, CHAPTER 8

er  or  heavenly  level.  They  are  above  its  range  of  competence. A
camel cannot go through the eye of a needle.

Revealed  truth  may  be  clearly  seen  and  perceived  by  our
“Isaac”  or  spiritual  rational.  That  is  why  the  birth  of  Isaac  is  so
important  both  in  human  development  and  in  the  Lord’s  work  of
becoming  One  with  His  Soul.  To  approach  spiritual  truth  with
humility and with the affection of truth is to invite the Lord to open
our eyes (AC 6047). A quiet miracle happens. “One thing I know:
that whereas I was blind, now I see” (John 9:25).

62

THE BIRTH OF THE DIVINE RATIONAL

Chapter Nine

ISAAC
GENESIS 21

Isaac is born to Abraham and Sarah.

Ishmael mocks Isaac during the feast to celebrate 
Isaac’s weaning, so Sarah banishes Hagar
and Ishmael.

Hagar and Ishmael wander in the wilderness of 
Beersheba and nearly die of thirst until God 
leads them to water.

Hagar and Ishmael survive and settle in Egypt.

“And Jehovah visited Sarah, as He had said; and Jehovah
did  unto  Sarah  as  He  had  spoken. And  Sarah  conceived  and
bare Abraham  a  son  in  his  old  age,  at  the  appointed  time,  as
God had spoken with him. And Abraham called the name of his
son that was born unto him, whom Sarah bare to him, Isaac”
(Gen. 21:3).

In the inmost meaning of this event from Genesis is the culmi-
nation of the Lord’s entire childhood. What Isaac’s birth symbol-
izes  and  what  it  means  to  humankind  is  profoundly  significant.

63

THE PATH, CHAPTER 9

With  Jesus  Christ,  when  His  Divine  rational  is  born,  the  Divine
Human has its beginning.

At this time, the Lord’s Divine rational is born from the mar-
riage of good and truth, of the celestial and spiritual, of Abraham
and Sarah. From this marriage of good and truth within the Lord
comes  the  potential  of  the  marriage  of  good  and  truth  within  us.
From this inner marriage comes “all conjugial love” (AC 2618). A
truly happy marriage, an eternal marriage, comes only with conju-
gial love. The hope of receiving this gift is one of the highest hopes
in  human  life.  For  us  then,  this  birth  of  Isaac  heralds  a  possible
return to innocence, for this can come about only in conjugial love,
or the effort toward this love.

Isaac was born, but he was only a tiny infant. He had to be cir-
cumcised, grow up, marry, and become established as an adult in
his own right. It is the same for the Divine rationality of the Lord.
But this development happens quickly with Jesus. With His Divine
Soul and special endowments, He comes to the birth of the Divine
rational at an early age.

With us, the birth of spiritual rationality is one of the miracles
of life. We may have searched on and on for truth, and sometimes
any real vision of truth may seem utterly impossible. Finally we can
look within ourselves and realize that we have evils that must be
put  aside  before  we  can  ever  truly  see. We  shun  evils,  especially
conceit, and ask the Lord’s help. But still we don’t see. Then quiet-
ly, from we don’t know where, comes the perception, the seeing,
that  revealed  truth  (truth  given  to  humanity  by  God)  is  true (AC
6047)! This opens up a vista stretching to eternity. It opens up even
the hope and promise of future conjugial love.

In the birth of the Divine rational with the Lord, there comes
a  world  of  wonder  and  delight  beyond  our  easy  ken.  With  this
birth,  the  Lord  sees  the  means  (the  truths)  to  fulfill  His  inmost
loves.  This  gives  a  new  character  to  His  human  essence.  He
knows this ability is only in its infancy, but as it grows and is fur-

64

THE BIRTH OF THE DIVINE RATIONAL

ther made Divine, it is part of the means of rescuing us. His heart
is deeply moved.

The name “Isaac” is derived from a word meaning “laughter.”
AC 2072 says that the origin and essence of laughter is nothing but
“the affection of truth. . .from which comes gladness of heart and
merriment. . . . There is also the affection of good, but this is in the
very affection of truth as its soul. The affection of good which is in
the  rational  does  not  display  itself  by  means  of  laughter,  but  by
means of a certain joy and consequent pleasurable delight” (Ibid.)
What is expressed here is sheer joy — joy and happiness that
Isaac is born. Sarah had longed for a son, but she was far too old,
as was Abraham. How could a child be born to them? But it hap-
pened by a Divine miracle. In one sense, nothing could make them
happier in their lives upon earth. Their dreams and hopes were ful-
filled.  Sarah’s  laughter  was  not  the  laughter  of  contempt.  It  had
within it, symbolically, the joy of the affection of good.

What does the boy Jesus feel when this Divine ability is born to
Him? As His love is higher than all other loves, so is His joy at this
birth. He sees the rational truths that can save us.

The infant Isaac grew and was weaned, symbolizing the fur-
ther  perfecting  and  development  of  the  Lord’s  newborn  Divine
rationality and also its separation from the merely human reasoning
abilities  (AC  2645).  Abraham  and  Sarah  —  the  good  and  truth
within the Lord — are married in a new sense with the procreation
and birth of Isaac. The child’s weaning called for a great feast, a
joyous spiritual feast of celebration.

At this feast, Ishmael mocked Isaac. Lower reasoning mocks
Divine truth; therefore it must be separated. Our lower or natural
rational is a blatant doubter. It mocks almost everything worthwhile
and substitutes self-appreciation. The Lord sees clearly at this stage
that the merely human reasoning in His own maternal heredity has
to be banished. This is what Sarah (the Divine Truth) asked. She
asked that Ishmael be banished.

65

THE PATH, CHAPTER 9

Abraham loved Ishmael, and he found it very hard at first
to  banish  him  and  his  mother  Hagar. Jesus  feels  “grief  from
love”  (AC  2660)  at  the  thought  of  banishing  the  merely  human
rational.  This  is  not  because  He  loves  the  false  reasoning  of  this
lower rational, but rather because He sees that this kind of reason-
ing is so much a part of the human race, and has been since the fall
of  the  Most Ancient  Church,  a  people  symbolized  by Adam  and
Eve. The people of the Most Ancient Church were led primarily by
celestial love and perception. But the Ancient Church, symbolized
by those who came after the great flood in Genesis 7, embodied a
new kind of people who needed to be led primarily by truth rather
than love. The false reasoning of the lower rational, symbolized by
Ishmael,  is  inscribed  on  every  person  since  the  fall  of  the  Most
Ancient Church, including each one of us even today. Jesus comes
on earth to save this very kind of person (AC 2661). But this kind
of person, in order to achieve human warmth and light, must also
banish Ishmael-thinking as the primary guide to life. The boy Jesus
then goes through a change of state in His thinking about this sep-
aration. He sees the inner need for this basic change (AC 2664), and
His grief ends.

In the Word or Bible, when one series ends, the same charac-
ter can take on a new meaning or symbolism. This is so now with
Ishmael. Ishmael has so far represented the first or lower reason-
ing  ability,  the  “wild-ass”  reasoning  that  is  to  be  separated.  But
once Hagar and Ishmael are separated from the rest of Abraham’s
family,  Ishmael  represents  the  merely  spiritual  (not  celestial)
church, or the church that is led by truth as opposed to being led
by love (AC 2669).

Jesus  sees  that  the  spiritual  person,  of  the  spiritual  church,
needs  the  support  of  affirmative  human  concepts  and  outer  facts.
These  help  him  to  comprehend  doctrine  and  make  it  valid  in  his
daily thinking and reflecting. We see much in human literature, in
novels like Tolstoy’s War and Peace, in works of history, and psy-

66

THE BIRTH OF THE DIVINE RATIONAL

chological studies like M. Scott Peck’s Further on the Road Less
Traveled, that support and strengthen our faith.

The  saving  of  Ishmael  and  Hagar  from  sure  death  in  the
wilderness  now  follows  in  Genesis  21.  God  was  with  Ishmael,
and he “became a shooter of the bow” (Gen. 21:2), an archer.
The person of the spiritual church defends himself with the arrows
of truth. He receives enlightenment from the Lord’s Divine Human
and this Human saves him (AC 2711). As a boy, Jesus read the story
of Hagar and Ishmael and saw these things within it, and it brought
Him inner consolation.

THE LORD’S MOST GRIEVOUS
AND INMOST TEMPTATIONS

THE NEAR SACRIFICE OF ISAAC
GENESIS 22

God tells Abraham to sacrifice Isaac as a
burnt offering.

Abraham nearly sacrifices Isaac, but an angel of 
Jehovah stops him and a ram is sacrificed instead.

Isaac  was  the  fulfillment  of  Jehovah’s  promise  to
Abraham.  He  had  been  born,  circumcised,  and  in  due  time
weaned from Sarah his mother. Ishmael the mocker has been
separated,  and  the  Divine  rational  is  now  with  Jesus  —  in  its
early stages.

The hells are aware of this event, and with their venom they are
marshalling  to  fight  against  this  young  rational  and,  if  possible,
destroy it (AC 2764, 2819). If they succeed, the Lord’s mission on
earth will be defeated.

Abraham  represents  the  Divine  Love  in  Jesus  in  His  human
essence (AC 2816, 2795). Isaac here is the young Divine rational
with  limited  vision  (AC  2795:2).  The  attack  is  about  to  happen.
God called Abraham to take “your son, your only one, whom
you love, even Isaac, and get to the land of Moriah, and offer

68

THE LORD’S MOST GRIEVOUS AND INMOST TEMPTATIONS

him there for a burnt-offering upon one of the mountains which
I will tell you of” (Gen. 22:2).

God was calling Abraham to sacrifice his son whom he loved.
There  is  great  significance  in  the  fact  that  God  asks Abraham  to
sacrifice “your son, your only one.” Isaac pictures Jesus as to the
Divine Human rational level, and He is the “only one in the uni-
verse by which He was to save humankind” (AC 2773).

The word “sacrifice” comes from two Latin words, facere and
sacra, which  combine  to  mean  “to  make  sacred.”  Interiorly,  this
story  reflects  a  decision  in  the  Lord  not  to  kill His  new  Divine
rational level, but to sanctify or purify it. This purification would
indeed involve death, but only the death of rational thinking within
Jesus that is limited instead of Infinite.

The historical character named Abraham must have felt despair
at  God’s  command  to  sacrifice  his  only  son,  though  it  would  not
have seemed strange to him. Human sacrifice was prevalent in sur-
rounding cultures at that time.

However, there is no description of despair or any similar emo-
tion  on  the  part  of  Abraham  in  Genesis  22.  In  the  literal  story,
Abraham hears the word of God and carries it out with no protest.
This is because Abraham represents the internal love of Jesus, and
Jesus saw and recognized that this sanctification must take place in
His new rational level or there would be no hope for humankind.

This  sanctification  could  be  accomplished  only  by  means  of
severe  temptations.  Why  would  these  temptations  strike  the  new
Divine Rational with such venom? Why do they come now, while
Jesus is still so young?

When  Jesus  was  born  into  the  world,  the  “Truth  Divine”  or
deeper truth within the Word of God was no longer acknowledged
(AC 2813). Instead, religious leaders focused on the literal words
of Scripture, with no interest in deeper Divine meanings. The liter-
al words of Scripture could not remain alive without the presence
of deeper truth, any more than a body can remain alive without the

69

THE PATH, CHAPTER 10

presence of a soul. Only by bringing Divinity to rational thinking
could Jesus establish truly rational thinking into the life of religion.
In this way, He makes it possible for us to see and understand deep-
er  truth  in  the  Word  of  God.  In  this  way,  He  creates  a  new  link
between Himself and human beings, between heaven and earth.

The hells recognize how crucial to the salvation of humankind
this new Divine Rational level in young Jesus is, and react accord-
ingly.  Jesus  must  prepare  for  their  severe  assaults,  and  this  is
described in the arrangements that Abraham makes before his jour-
ney to the land of Moriah. Where the story says, “God did tempt
Abraham,”  the  celestial  or  inmost  meaning  is  that  young  Jesus
allows Himself to be tempted. He knows that these most grievous
temptations, which have no parallel in the life of any other person
that has ever lived, will more closely join His human essence with
His Divine Essence. Through them He will come nearer to achiev-
ing His goal on earth.

There is an amazing tapestry of interconnection in the stories of
the Word and in the internal meaning and its Divine interweaving
(AC 2775). The land of Moriah symbolizes a place of temptation.
It is one of the mountains on which Jerusalem is built — in fact the
eastern height of the city. Isaac is nearly sacrificed on this moun-
tain. Later in history, after King David’s sin of numbering the peo-
ple  without  Divine  command,  a  plague  struck  the  Israelites,  a
plague that from Divine intervention stopped at the threshing-floor
of Araunah  the  Jebusite  on  this  same  Mount  Moriah.  Many  cen-
turies later, Jesus Himself endured here the extremity of His final
temptation. And as late as 1967 another war was fought at this very
site. It is, perhaps, appropriate that the “wailing wall” is right here.
So  the  land  of  Moriah  represents  a  state  of  severe  trials.  Yet
within,  another  state  was  strongly  present.  The  destination  was
“one of the mountains which I will tell you of” (Gen. 22:2). A
mountain signifies Divine Love (AC 2777), and with Jesus, it is His
love for our salvation.

70

THE LORD’S MOST GRIEVOUS AND INMOST TEMPTATIONS

This love for others and for their salvation transcends the dread
of facing temptations. It is a love that is strongly present through-
out this ordeal, although it is not always felt clearly by young Jesus,
who is not yet fully Divine.

Abraham prepares for his journey. That he rises early in the
morning  symbolizes  that  Jesus  prepares  for  His  temptations  in  a
state of peace, knowing that they must happen in order to achieve
His goal of salvation. After three days of preparation and trav-
el, Abraham catches sight of his destination. “Three” symbolizes
completeness. When Jesus’ preparation is complete, He enters into
the land of “Moriah.” The temptation itself is now very near.

Abraham  and  Isaac  went  on  ahead,  without  the  servants,
walking  towards  the  mount.  Isaac  carried  the  wood  for  the
offering, and Abraham carried the fire and a knife. The wood is
the merit, that is, the recognition by Jesus that He will fight from
His own Divine inner power. The fire and knife are the good of love
and the truth of faith that He takes with Him into battle (AC 2798).
The wood is genuine merit with Isaac, but the fire and knife (the
love and the truth) are with Abraham, the Divine Love in the Lord’s
human essence.

Isaac  accompanied  his  father  in  innocent  trust  and  love.
Before  our  own  temptations,  the  Lord  secretly  elevates  us  into
states of warmth and tranquility, even of innocence. This gives us
strength to face the trials that follow. This also stands as a challenge
to  the  hells,  which,  perceiving  these  states,  wish  to  attack  and
destroy. So the Lord as a youth, going in spirit to Mount Moriah, is
elevated into interior peace and compassion (AC 2786). His young
rational is strengthened.

In  the  story  in  Genesis,  Isaac  did  not  know  that  he  himself
was to be sacrificed: “Behold the fire and the wood; and where
is the lamb for a burnt-offering?” (Gen. 22:7) These words touch
our  hearts.  In  the  celestial  sense,  they  go  even  more  deeply.  The
young Divine rational, in a state of limited truth, asks the Divine

71

THE PATH, CHAPTER 10

itself, “Where are those in the human race who are to ‘be sancti-
fied’ or who are to be saved? (see AC 2805). Where are the good
people that I may save? I don’t see any.”

All of the Lord’s temptations focused on humankind — here on
the youthful Jesus’ tender love for us. But His rational mind is still
in very limited truth — a state in which things are not clear to Him.
In His outward confusion, He cannot see how humankind can be
rescued. He despairs.

To  Isaac’s  question  Abraham  replied:  “God  will  see  for
Himself  the  lamb  for  a  burnt-offering.” This  means  that  the
Divine  Human which  was  being  developed  would  provide  those
who are to be sanctified or saved. This is a Divine answer to young
Jesus’  prayer.  Together  Abraham  and  Isaac  walk  on  to  the
mountain, closer in heart to each other than before (AC 2808).

Within Jesus, the celestial love in His rational that is striving to
fulfill His mission now undergoes frightening temptation. This love
in His human essence is not yet glorified; it is still finite and bound
by  appearances  (AC  2813).  A  picture  of  this  is  the  boy  Isaac,
bound upon the altar, with his father raising a knife to kill him.
His rational level is bound (AC 2813, 2814).

Imagine the love and fear in Isaac. He loved his father. Yet his
father was about to sacrifice him! The Divine Itself would never,
never  sacrifice  the  youthful  rational.  But  the  inmost  love  in  this
youthful rational, the love of saving humankind, seems about to be
destroyed. It seems impossible for the new rational to fulfill its mis-
sion.  Jesus’  love  sees  from  limited  truth  —  truth  not  genuine
enough to see Divine reality (AC 6371, 2813).

Looking from the appearances in this still limited rational (AC
2814),  and  with  the  hells  viciously  attacking,  the  youthful  Jesus
feels helpless. He lies upon the wood of the altar, bound and appar-
ently about to be destroyed. Jesus’ agony at this time is beyond our
bearing. The hells are attempting to kill the young rational. It seems
to the boy Jesus at the height of this temptation that He will fail.

72

THE LORD’S MOST GRIEVOUS AND INMOST TEMPTATIONS

The hells maliciously attack with their rejection of the deep, inner
truth that will save humankind. They inject into Him the message
that no one will want to think about deeper truth, no one will want
to accept His salvation, that a “lamb” will never be found for a sac-
rifice,  or  “sanctifying.”  As  is  the  love,  so  is  the  despair.  If  our
inmost loves are tempted to despair, we are in utter pain. So it is
here, with the young Jesus. Something dies in Him then. But what
dies is not what is Divine (AC 2818)!

Jesus  feels  terrible  despair.  But,  instead  of  yielding  in  this
despair,  He  endures,  and  a  miracle  happens.  First,  “whatever  was
from  the  merely  human”  rational  level  dies  (AC  2818).  What
despaired in Him dies. In its place is born a higher rational, a Divine
rational, that can clearly see the possibility of salvation for all peo-
ple. This part of Him becomes “the Son of God,” the Divine Human.
We bow before this miracle; it is part of the heart of the glorifi-
cation  or  the  process  of  Jesus’  becoming  one  with  the  Divine.
Briefly,  Jesus  finds  He  cannot from  His  former  limitations  save
humankind. These limitations involved severe doubts as to whether
human  beings  would  ever  have  interest  in  the  inner  truth  in  the
Scriptures, which can lead them directly to God. These doubts He
yields up; these die. In resisting and conquering the hells that reject
inner truth in the Scriptures, Jesus frees the minds of all people to
seek Divine Rational Truth.

What takes the place of former doubts within Jesus, a new level
in the Divine Rational glorified, this can save us. Out of temptation
comes  victory.  Now  from  His  Divine  Human  in  His  glorified
rational level, He can see the possible reception within humankind
and begin to offer salvation. A true rational replaces one that was
bound. Isaac is freed from the altar.

For us, true humanity begins in the inmost of our rational. For
Jesus the Divine Human begins in the inmost of His now glorified
Divine Rational. No wonder the hells tried to destroy this great step
into Divinity, but they failed.

THE PATH, CHAPTER 10

Out of this temptation — Abraham’s nearly sacrificing Isaac —
comes something wonderful (AC 2776). Before His birth on earth,
the Lord had communication with people here through His highest
or  celestial  kingdom  and  through  an  angel  spokesman  from  this
heaven.  This  was  sufficient  for  the  earliest  or  Most Ancient  and
Ancient Churches and even for the Hebrew and Jewish Churches,
although  in  a  less  effective  way.  Finally,  all  hope  of  reaching
humankind was almost gone. The time had come for the Lord to be
born on earth (see TCR 109).

This communication of the Supreme Divine with human beings
before His Advent — through the highest angels — is “strictly to
be called the Human Divine” (AC 2814), (italics added). The term
the “Human Divine” involves a limitation in the Lord’s power to be
with humankind. He Himself was not yet present in His own Divine
Human. He needed to work through the angels, and this limited His
power to save and redeem (see TCR 109).

There  is  an  ancient  prophecy  that  spoke  of  this.  “The  scepter
shall not be removed from Judah, nor a lawgiver from between his
feet, even until Shiloh comes” (Gen. 49:10), (AC 6371). “Judah”
represents the celestial kingdom and the Human Divine. 

But  this  is  changed  when  Shiloh  comes.  Shiloh  is  the  Lord
Incarnate,  having  been  born  on  earth  and  then  Glorified  in  His
Human,  or  made  one  with  the  Divine.  This  temptation  on  Mt.
Moriah speaks within of the coming of “Shiloh.”

“And the angel of Jehovah called unto him out of heaven,
and  said,  ‘Abraham,  Abraham,’  and  he  said,  ‘Here  I  am’  ”
(Gen.  22:11). This  calling  by  the  angel,  actually  by  the  Divine
itself, would have been most gentle and yet a thing of wonder. It
stops the temptation from continuing any longer (AC 2822).

“And He said, ‘Put not forth your hand upon the boy, and
do not do anything unto him; for now I know that you fear God,
and you have not withheld your son, your only one, from Me’ ”
(Gen. 22:12). This is liberation from the temptation. The tenderest

74

THE LORD’S MOST GRIEVOUS AND INMOST TEMPTATIONS

love  was  under  attack  at  Moriah. This  liberation  brought  greatest
joy.  The  inmost  love  of  the  boy  Jesus  is  moved  with  delight,
because those He feared would be lost can now be saved! It would
be akin to that incredible feeling of joy when a major war is over
and peace finally comes, or to the freedom felt when prisoners of
such a war step out of their cells, liberated.

The  Lord  provided  a  ram  for  the  sacrifice. The  ram  repre-
sents all those of the spiritual church or genius. To sacrifice the ram
here  means  to  sanctify  —  to  save.  By  the  glorification  of  His
Divine rational, the Lord is now able to save all those who are spir-
itual from the time of this glorification onwards. In addition, this
same degree of glorification opens salvation to all the good people
in the world who are represented by the families of Nahor in Haran,
mentioned at the end of Genesis 22. These are all the good Gentiles
on earth.

Jesus liberates the spiritual people and sanctifies them. That is,
as the ram was freed from the thicket, so spiritual people are given
the  means  to  escape  from  mental  and  spiritual  entanglement  in
merely earthly knowledge. The Lord shows them the way to their
rebirth,  to  their  reformation  and  regeneration.  This  way  is  first
shown  in  the  New  Testament,  but  then  is  fully  unfolded  in  the
Writings of Swedenborg. The “glory in the clouds” is revealed (HH
1), and now the era of true science is gradually dawning. The two
foundations of truth (SE 5709), the Word and nature, will meet and
support each other.

“A ram behind, caught in a thicket” (Gen. 22:13). It is very
easy for us to get caught in the thicket of knowledges. The various
disciplines of the sciences and arts can easily not liberate but entan-
gle our thinking, in facts or apparent facts and conflicting theories.
With many students, the sciences and arts of higher education do
not lead to an opening of the mind to the reality of the Lord. Instead
they lead to entanglement and often to the negative view that there
is no God and that we are animals. The ram is often caught, behind,

75

THE PATH, CHAPTER 10

helpless. The Lord is fully aware of this weakness. In the tempta-
tion at Mount Moriah and in the victory, He gives us the means of
liberation  and  true  freedom.  Jesus  has  brought  Divinity  to  the
rational level of human thinking, making it possible for rationality
to be used as a tool in a path to God.

After  the  temptation  and  victory  at  Moriah,  the  Lord  can  see
that now salvation can come not only to the spiritual, but also to all
good people throughout the earth. The vision of the boy Jesus, that
so many can be saved, can bring a warmth and breadth to our own
concepts of who can be saved. We can see the offering of salvation
to the millions of good gentiles throughout the earth.

The account of the near sacrifice of the boy Isaac and his res-
cue by the angel of Jehovah symbolically marks the end of Jesus’
whole childhood. A major step in the glorification is accomplished.
The Divine rational is firmly established.

Now the Divine Rational must be enriched, and this is pictured
through the death of Sarah in the next chapter. How does a death
lead to enrichment? This will be shown through the inner meaning
of the next step of the Divine story we are following.

76

THE ENRICHMENT OF JESUS’ RATIONAL

Chapter Eleven

THE DEATH OF SARAH
GENESIS 23

Sarah dies of old age.

Abraham asks the sons of Heth, in the land of 
Canaan, for a burial plot and they give him one.

Sarah is buried.

As a boy in Egypt, and later in Nazareth, Jesus is taught direct-
ly by His Soul, Jehovah. He learns by outer knowledges from the
Word but also by streams of inner perceptions from His Soul. The
effect on Jesus is expressed in the 119th Psalm, under the Hebrew
letter “Mem”:

“Oh how I love Your law! It is my meditation all the day. You,
through Your commandments, make me wiser than my enemies; for
they are ever with me. I have more understanding than my teach-
ers, for Your testimonies are my meditation. I understand more than
the ancients, because I have kept Your precepts. I have restrained
my feet from every evil way, that I may keep Your word. I have not
departed from Your judgments, for You Yourself have taught me.
How sweet are Your words to my taste, sweeter than honey to my

77

THE PATH, CHAPTER 11

mouth! Through Your precepts I get understanding; therefore I hate
every false way” (Psalm 119: 97-104).

Now in Chapter 23 of the Genesis story comes the death of
Sarah, Abraham’s  beloved  wife. To  us  this  suggests  feelings  of
sorrow, but the death of Sarah is not a tragedy in the celestial sense
of the story. Death here has a different meaning, as it does for the
angels  who  are  eternally  and  delightfully  alive,  and  do  not  know
what physical death is (AC 2916). In this inner story of Jesus’ life
Sarah’s  death  represents  a  further  raising  and  enrichment  of  the
Divine rational (AC 2904). The Divine Truth inflowing into Jesus’
Divine  rational  is  newly  effective,  newly  empowered.  The  Lord,
then only a boy in age but a full adult spiritually, does not feel sad-
ness but a resurrection within Himself, a new source of the power
to save.

The Divine rational is established, surviving devastating temp-
tations. The Divine Human itself is now living and present in inte-
rior thoughts and affections in Jesus. His focus in this state is on the
saving of humankind. He inevitably looks to the future, first to the
sorrow at negative states that would attack the Christian Church, in
which the Trinity would be separated into three gods, and then to
the promise and joy of a New Church to be born and established,
based on the reception of His Divine Human, in which the Trinity
is unified (see TCR 791).

In  order  that  he  might  bury  Sarah’s  body,  Abraham
requests  a  sepulchre  from  the  sons  of  Heth,  in  whose  land  he
then  dwells. Although  in  the  inner  story  Sarah’s  death  is  not  a
tragedy,  Abraham  himself  feels  great  sorrow. The  sons  of  Heth
answer his request with compassion. They wish to help him, to
ease his grief. Ephron offers his sepulcher to Abraham.

There are many levels of meaning to this story. In the internal
historical  sense  Sarah’s  death  may  be  taken  as  a  prophecy  of  the
end of the first Christian Church, which occurred when all charity

78

THE ENRICHMENT OF JESUS’ RATIONAL

and faith had disappeared (AC 2908). Jesus on earth foresees that
this will happen, and Abraham’s grief over Sarah’s death pictures
His  grief  over  the  death  of  this  Christian  Church.  Such  as  is  the
love, such is the grief. The Lord’s love is for the salvation of the
human race, and instead of this He foresees a spiritual death. We
cannot know grief like this, but its analogy is the earthly death of a
conjugial partner. It is devastating.

In this chapter (Genesis 23), the sons of Heth represent “those
with  whom  there  was  to  be  a  new  spiritual  church”  (AC  2913).
These people are open to the Lord and can be regenerated. A “sep-
ulcher”  here  means  not  death,  but  rather  rebirth  and  regeneration
(AC 2916). Many in the world are open to regeneration, to rising
up out of a spiritually dead state. To the angels, the words “I will
bury  my  dead” have  nothing  to  do  with  physical  death.  Rather
they mean that the Lord “would come forth and rise again from the
night in which they were” (AC 2917). “Burying” is to rise again.

Those who will receive the future “New Church” or new under-
standing  about  God  into  their  minds  will  receive  the  Lord  in  His
Divine  Human  with  kindness  and  open  hearts.  Ephron  signifies
these especially. To Jesus in His early adult age, when the Divine
rational has initially been established, His future reception by this
New Church moves Him. This is the ultimate hope of His incarna-
tion and glorification: that He will be more and more fully received
by  a  future  widespread  human  understanding  and  love  that  will
become the crown of all churches.

Regeneration  is  a  process,  a  step-by-step  ascent  toward  the
Lord. The particulars in this story about the sons of Heth show this
gradual process of rebirth in the future groups of people who will
receive and live the new understanding and love that will be called
the New Church. They show how these future people will gradual-
ly discover the Lord, and then go through stages of mediate good,
including merit, until at last they receive the Lord completely, and
from  the  heart  come  to  ascribe  all  good  and  truth  to  Him.  This

79

THE PATH, CHAPTER 11

promise  also  gives  the  Lord  joy.  The  cave  of  Machpelah,  where
Sarah was buried, may have a sad connotation naturally, but in the
internal sense, it speaks of resurrection, of a rediscovery of the Lord
upon this earth. It has within it the wonder of the Lord’s sepulcher
in Jerusalem, from which He rose at Easter fully glorified. It is a
resurrection in joy.

INNER UNION OF LOVE AND WISDOM IN THE DIVINE HUMAN
REBEKAH AND ISAAC
GENESIS 24

Abraham has his servant travel to Mesopotamia, 
to the city of Nahor, to find a wife for Isaac 
among Abraham’s family in his homeland.

The servant is led by Jehovah to find Rebekah, 
who is Abraham’s niece.

Rebekah consents to come back with the servant 
of Abraham, and Isaac and Rebekah are married.

Genesis next tells of Abraham’s wish that his son Isaac find
a wife, one that comes from the land of Abraham’s origin (Gen.
24). He commissions his trusted servant to travel to the home of
his brother Nahor and to find a wife for Isaac there. The ser-
vant wonders what he should do if the woman is unwilling to
come. Should he take Isaac to her for the marriage?

Abraham replies no, he should not take Isaac there. For the
God who had led Abraham to Canaan would “send His angel
before you, and you shall take a woman for my son Isaac from
there” (Gen. 24:6,7).

The  servant  is  the  natural  level  of  Jesus,  or  His  “everyday”
mind that takes in outer knowledge (AC 3019). This is subservient
to His Divine Love, just as the servant carries out the bidding of his
master.  Now  that  the  Divine  Rational  level  (Isaac)  is  fully  estab-

80

THE ENRICHMENT OF JESUS’ RATIONAL

lished, it must join with compatible truth that will come from natu-
ral-level knowledge. Jesus wishes to go through the process that we
humans go through, that is, to learn knowledge from outside of us,
and join it with rational thinking so that it actually becomes truth
within us.

From His inner love (Abraham), Jesus sees the need for Divine
Truth, a “wife,” to come into His rational level, and all truth must
start with an affection for truth – an interest that will lead to truth.
This affection is what Jesus must now search for.

But Jesus knows that He must not choose just any affection to
bring  truth  to  His  Divine  Rational  level.  Abraham  tells  the  ser-
vant  not  to  choose  from  any  of  the  surrounding  Canaanite
women. This symbolizes the Lord’s inner awareness that He is still
surrounded by impure affections in His finite maternal heredity. He
knows that He must travel elsewhere with His search (AC 3024).

The  “angel”  that  would  go  before  the  servant  signifies  “the
Divine Providence” (AC 3039). “Conjugial love” or true and spiri-
tual marriage love is “above every love” (CL 64) with the angels of
heaven and the people of the church. It is a gift that is the highest
reception of the Lord in two hearts, the husband’s and the wife’s.
The Divine Providence works, above all else, for the protection and
establishment of the conjugial in each person. The Lord sends His
angel to lead to this inmost love, and to establish it forever.

Conjugial love has its origin in the union of truth and love in
each  person.  When  truth  and  love  are  lived  by  both,  a  man  and
woman may be led to the initial discovery of each other as poten-
tial eternal partners. With Jesus Himself, there is to be a conjunc-
tion  of  truth  with  good  on  His  rational  plane,  where  His  Divine
Human  begins.  This  is  the  potent  origin  of  our  own  conjugial
hopes  —  our  hopes  for  an  eternally  happy  marriage.  Unless  this
conjunction  between  the  Rebekah  and  Isaac  of  His  mind  takes
place within Jesus, there will be no hope of conjugial love for the
people on earth.

81

THE PATH, CHAPTER 11

Abraham’s servant is led to the city of Nahor and comes to
a well there. This pictures how Jesus travels into the knowledges
related to doctrine or religious principles that He has acquired for
Himself. These kinds of knowledges are symbolized by the city of
Nahor (AC 3052). Jesus stands ready now to learn from doctrinal
principles about real truth that He can make His own on a rational
level  (AC  3013).  He  waits  for  an  appropriate  affection,  a
“woman,” to show itself, and lead Him into deeper learning. This
affection for truth that Jesus looks for must be “a virgin,” innocent
and pure from falsity.

In the literal story, the servant prays that Jehovah will lead
Isaac’s  future  wife  to  the  well  and  that  he,  the  servant,  will
know  her  by  her  offering  him  water  and  then  offering  his
camels water also. Almost incredibly, this takes place. Rebekah,
a beautiful virgin, comes out to get water, and when the servant
asks her for a drink, she gives him water, and then also waters
his camels. He asks her who she is, and she replies; “ ‘I am the
daughter  of  Bethuel  the  son  of  Milcah,  whom  she  bare  unto
Nahor’. . . . And the man [the servant] bent himself, and bowed
himself to Jehovah. And he said, ‘Blessed be Jehovah the God
of my lord Abraham . . . . Jehovah has led me to the house of my
lord’s brothers’ ” (Gen. 24:24-27, selections).

“Rebekah,” beautiful and pure, is the innocent affection for or
interest in doctrinal knowledge that Jesus has been searching for
(AC  3080).  He  allows  this  affection  to  instruct  Him,  and  it
enlightens Him, as Rebekah quenches the thirst of the servant and
his camels.

When we are young, we are taught doctrinal concepts, such as
“God takes care of us, all the time.” To our childhood minds this is
a wonderful thought, and it fills us with affection. Later, when we
develop rational thinking, we can go back to these innocent, beau-
tiful affections for doctrinal concepts. If we can then take them in
and “marry” them to spiritual rational thinking, they will become

82

THE ENRICHMENT OF JESUS’ RATIONAL

real truth for us. “God takes care of us” will no longer be just a nice
thing someone told us. It makes sense to us. We see it in life and
believe it for ourselves. It becomes our own and is transformed, as
the water was changed to wine at the marriage in Cana (Luke 2:9).
And so it is for Jesus. He finds within His natural mind a pure
and  innocent  love  for  doctrinal  concepts.  He  will  take  this  and
marry  it  to  His  rational  level.  There  it  will  no  longer  be  just  an
affection.  It  will  become  Divine  Truth  in  His  Divine  Rational
level. Rebekah will no longer be a beautiful virgin; she will be a
beautiful wife.

In the literal story, when the servant arrives at the house of
Laban  and  Bethuel,  he  is  offered  food  and  hospitality,  but  he
does not eat until he has told his full story to these two. When
he  finishes  his  recounting,  he  asks  them  their  response  to  the
idea of Rebekah becoming Isaac’s wife. They reply: “The word
has gone forth from Jehovah; we cannot speak unto you evil or
good. Behold, Rebekah is before you; take her, and go, and let
her be the woman of your lord’s son, as Jehovah has spoken”
(Gen. 24:50,51).

When asked if she will accompany the servant back to the
land of Canaan to marry Isaac, Rebekah answers: “I will go”
(Gen. 24:58). When they arrive at Abraham’s home, the servant
tells Rebekah that it is Isaac who is coming to meet them. She
willingly comes into Sarah’s tent, and “Isaac loved her, and he
was comforted after his mother” (Gen. 24:67).

This  is  the  fulfillment  of  the  story  about  the  angel’s  leading
Rebekah and Isaac to each other. Consent is given, and love comes
from the Lord. Today there is so much cynicism about marriage and
much doubt about the possibility that marriages can last. Here, very
simply, the Lord says, “Yes, conjugial love is possible, and this is
the story of how it starts. The Lord sends His angel.”

This gift is not possible unless in the supreme sense Rebekah is
found and led to Isaac. This Divine union is essential to the birth of

83

THE PATH, CHAPTER 11

conjugial love with every human being. Isaac is the Divine good in
the Lord’s newly established Divine rational (AC 3210). This good
with Him is key: from good or love comes all else that is truly alive,
filled with buoyancy and potential joy. But good cannot be effec-
tive alone. To be complete it needs union with truth. In the inner
story we have the betrothal of Divine truth with Divine Good and
then the marriage of these two (AC 3210, 3211, and 3212).

Of this Divine conjunction we read: “And Isaac was comfort-
ed  after  his  mother”  (Gen.  24:67),  that  is,  after  the  death  of
Sarah. He loved Rebekah, and with her found inner fulfillment and
happiness. These  words  about  Isaac’s  being  comforted  signify  “a
new state” (AC 3212). In the Lord there is a conjunction within that
changes His life on earth, and that brings the Divine Human fully
into being.

This  marriage  of  Isaac  and  Rebekah  represents  a  whole  new
state in Jesus Christ on earth. Earlier His rational was glorified as
to good, but now with the union with Rebekah, He is glorified also
as to truth (AC 3212). This process of glorification can be under-
stood  better  if  we  realize  that  our  own  regeneration  is  somewhat
like it, but on a lower, limited level. As we struggle through temp-
tations, the Lord will gradually change our inner selfish and domi-
neering nature. He enables us to become more loving, thoughtful,
and  compassionate  towards  others.  Our  faces  and  bodies  don’t
change; our inner natures do. We become new persons in our reac-
tions to people and life situations.

The disciples Peter, James, and John see a deep inner change
with the Lord when, after putting off His finite maternal heredity,
Jesus is “transfigured” before them on the mountain, and His face
shines as the sun. So we too may be reborn, touched by His love.

The full glorification within Jesus Christ is yet to come. But this
union  of  truth  and  good  within  His  rational  mind  is  a  significant
step towards that full transformation. It foreshadows the complete
marriage of the Divine and Human within the Lord.

== Chapter Twelve

BIRTH OF THE DIVINE NATURAL

ESAU AND JACOB
GENESIS 25

Abraham dies of old age.

Isaac and Rebekah have twins, Jacob and Esau.

Esau was the firstborn, but Jacob takes the birthright
from Esau by withholding food from his starving older
brother until he swears to sell his birthright to him.

There is an innocent side to each of us, instilled in our infancy
and childhood. To this side of our nature the Divine Natural is our
Savior.  The  “Divine  Natural”  is  the  Lord  present  with  us  on  the
level in which we live day by day. In Genesis 25 we see the birth
of this Divine Natural in the birth of Jacob and Esau.

Isaac,  the  Divine  rational,  is  the  Lord  coming  to  our  higher
rational, our spiritual thinking. Early in adulthood we have an ide-
alistic passion for spiritual rational thinking, and this is where we
especially need the Lord. When we find our faith, when our ration-
al is open to the wonders of the teachings in the Word of God, our
lives are changed. Through this growing intellectual faith we devel-
op an inner orientation that looks to heaven and to the Lord. Our
purposes in life are established in response to Him.

85

THE PATH, CHAPTER 12

As we grow older and perhaps are married and have children,
our perspectives change. We often focus more on life’s challenges
and problems and less on spiritual thinking. Our selfishness begins
to  intrude  in  our  marriages  or  our  hopes  for  marriage.  We  can
become  colder  and  less  responsive.  We  strive  to  succeed  in  our
work, to find self-fulfillment in our homes, and to acquire money
and status. Good vacations might mean more to us than our regen-
eration. We may not have true concern for others, and our idealism
is left behind. We are not alive to the Lord. The focus has shifted
from rational idealism to the natural plane of life.

We  may  slowly  begin  to  wonder,  “Where  is  the  Lord  of  our
early adult life?” As time passes and we begin to achieve some of
our goals (or fail to achieve them) we become quietly aware that
something is wrong. We are not deeply happy. We aren’t finding the
happiness in life that we anticipated. This loss of meaning in life
may last for some time, until we finally experience an awakening,
a genuine desire to find the Lord again. Now we would like to find
Him where we live, on the daily plane of life.

The  Lord  came  on  earth  and  glorified  His  natural  so  that  He
could  reach  us  and  help  us  change  our  hearts  in  our  day-to-day
lives.  On  His  own  level,  after  the  establishment  of  the  Divine
rational, He turns to a new focus. He begins to focus on His natu-
ral level. In His heredity through Mary He finds the very problems
of which we speak. The Divine is not yet present there, not strong-
ly  operative  in  this  heredity.  He  finds  coldness,  a  rejection  of
inflowing  Divine  life.  How  He  handles  this  strong  challenge,
aggravated by the venom and malice of the hells, is the key to find-
ing the Lord in our daily lives. The Divine Natural is our Rescuer,
Who can change what is dead or humdrum into moments that have
eternal meaning.

Swedenborg’s Writings reveal that the natural level “receives
truths  much  later,  and  with  greater  difficulty,  than  the  rational”
(AC  3321:3).  In  our  natural  minds  is  a  quality  that  opposes  the

86

BIRTH OF THE DIVINE NATURAL

Lord, which fights against Him. It leads us into a darkness of mind
(AC 3322:1,2).

As we mature beyond early adult age, we find in ourselves bar-
riers to heavenly life. What we don’t want to admit is that we have
goals that are not heavenly. They are in our daily lives, and they are
awfully potent. These goals have in them contempt for the Divine.
However, on the higher plane of our hearts and minds, the rational
plane, we still do believe in the Lord and love Him. A war is going
to take place then, right in our hearts. Esau and Jacob, the twin sons
of  Isaac  and  Rebekah,  speak  spiritually  to  this  quandary,  and  the
celestial meaning of their story will show us the path.

Isaac was forty years old when he married Rebekah. At first
she was barren, but Isaac prayed to the Lord for mercy, and in
time Rebekah conceived. Two sons struggled within her womb,
and she enquired of Jehovah: “ ‘Why am I thus?’

“And  Jehovah  said  unto  her,  ‘Two  nations  are  in  your
womb, and two peoples shall be separated from your body, and
the one people shall prevail over the other people, and the elder
shall  serve  the  younger.’ And  her  days  were  fulfilled  to  bring
forth, and behold twins were in her womb. And the first came
forth red all over like a hairy garment, and they called his name
Esau. And after that came forth his brother, and his hand laid
hold on Esau’s heel, and he called his name Jacob; and Isaac
was a son of sixty years when she bare them” (Gen. 25:20-26,
selections).

In the inner story, the conception and birth of Jacob and Esau
are  the  conception  and  birth  of  the  Divine  natural. The  good-ori-
ented side of the Divine natural is Esau. The truth-oriented side is
Jacob (AC 3232). These births with Jesus are to change not only
Him but us too – not our rational visions and ideals, but how heav-
en can actually come to us here in our homes and our work and our
recreation.  Without  these  births  we  would  be  like  animals  in  our
lower minds. Now, from the Lord, we can become human.

87

THE PATH, CHAPTER 12

Right at the birth we glimpse how this change happens. “The
elder  shall  serve  the  younger”  (Gen.  25:23). After  our  rational
faith is established and our focus has shifted to living in this natu-
ral world, we start to desire spontaneity. We look for goodness to
come to us openly, effortlessly, with a natural ease. At first it seems
to. But then we find what the Lord found before us: that the Esau
quality,  good  in  the  natural,  is  at  first  plagued  by  hereditary  ten-
dencies to evil. The Lord found good in the natural “so far as it was
from [His] mother was imbued with hereditary evil” (AC 3599).

Esau represents the Divine natural as to good, and Jacob the
Divine natural as to truth. Within us, Esau is “good” that is unre-
fined in our natural or daily lives and that actually has much self-
ishness within it. Jacob on the other hand is truth in the natural.
This  consists  mainly  of  knowledges  from  the  Word  that  we
believe are true. But we see these knowledges and truths only in
a limited way. So initially both Esau and Jacob have strong limi-
tations. This is what the Lord finds too, in His heredity through
Mary (AC 3599:2).

Jesus  knows  that  the  way  in  which  He  will  handle  these  two
forces  in  His  natural  level  is  a  key  to  the  future  salvation  of
humankind.  Regeneration,  truly  becoming  an  angel,  is  a  process
that  must  happen  on  the  natural  level  with  us.  Here  we  need  the
Lord, and we need Him desperately.

Through  many  states  we  try  to  put  Esau  first,  because  this
seems so right; it seems like the true order of creation, to go with
your  instincts  of  what  feels  good  and  right.  It  would  be,  too,  if
there were no hereditary evil. But since, before we are spiritually
reborn, our instincts are tainted with selfishness, we cannot trust
them to lead. Jacob (truth) must come first for now, because true
ideas must instruct our developing will. This is not the ideal order.
This  is  clear  even  in  the  story,  where  Jacob  steals both  Esau’s
birthright and his blessing. Jacob represents knowledge of truth
from the Word that we compel ourselves to put into our lives. The

88

BIRTH OF THE DIVINE NATURAL

Esau in us caves in to evil, but applied truth brings order and puts
us on the path to the Lord.

In  order  to  regenerate  we  need  to  compel  ourselves  by  free
choice to obey truth for a long time. This is what reforms the natu-
ral level. We change and progress through self-discipline, with the
Lord’s help. We may try to deny this, but we will find that it is true.
We may still try to put Esau first, and then find it doesn’t work. We
have  within  us  too  much  hereditary  inclination  to  contempt,  to  a
sense of superiority, even to adultery. We need the help of Divine
truth, and we need it badly.

Genesis speaks of Esau’s coming in from the field, “and he
was weary” (Gen. 25:29). That he was weary “signifies a state of
combat” (AC 3318). Temptations are the key means of change and
rebirth (Ibid.). Our hereditary loves of self and the world distort and
harden the very vessels in the mind that would otherwise receive
heavenly influx. Temptations order and soften us, turning us toward
the  Lord  and  away  from  stubborn  self-love.  Much  in  our  natural
level of emotions and thoughts is spiritually hard, hard with conceit
and  arrogance.  In  order  to  be  reborn,  we  need  softening  (see AC
3318). This change brings another, gentler nature to our being, one
that includes simplicity and a touch of humility. We then feel love
and compassion for others as never before in our adult life.

So with the Lord, who established the path for us, “Jacob” for
a  time  has  apparent  priority  over  “Esau.”  The  Lord’s  process,  or
“the  glorification,”  needed  to  proceed  through  Divine  truth  to
Divine good even in His Natural. In the story of Jacob’s life and his
final return to the land of Canaan and to Esau, the pathway through
truth to good is revealed, and so also for the Lord, our leader, from
Divine truth to Divine good.

Think  of  Jesus  as  a  youth  in  Nazareth.  He  has  had  the  most
delightful  learning  experiences  as  well  as  severe  temptations  in
childhood.  His  mind  is  filled  with  perceptions  and  love  for
Jehovah.  He  knows  His  future  mission  and  is  preparing  for  it.

89

THE PATH, CHAPTER 12

Outwardly, he is an apprentice carpenter with his earthly stepfather.
He must have been seen as an extra-ordinary child and youth, lov-
ing but not deeply understood.

Yet He is in no way alone. Jehovah and the angels are with Him,
and so are Mary and probably still Joseph. But He is finding now
the unregenerate natural level He has inherited through Mary. He
perceives in this heredity not spontaneous good, but the same need
to compel His natural level to order, and then to glorify this level.
He  must  take  every  feeling  and  impulse  in  His  natural  level  and
compare  it  with  the  truth  He  has  learned  from  His  Divine  Soul,
Jehovah. If the two are not in agreement, He must subdue this feel-
ing to the higher Truth. Jesus is right with us on this path.

By this means the Lord “altogether changed His human state”
(AC 3296:2). He changes it from being human to being Divinely
Human (Ibid.). By the same process the Lord can change us, in our
case from being “dead” to becoming alive, leaving what is old, and
coming into what is young and “new” (Ibid.).

“And Abraham  gave  all  that  he  had  unto  Isaac.  .  .  .And
Abraham expired in a good old age, an old man and sated, and
was  gathered  to  his  peoples”  (Gen.  25:5,8). Because Abraham
represents the Lord’s Divine infancy and then the Divine itself, we
feel a sense of sorrow in his passing. But within, in the Divine gov-
ernment  and  mercy,  Abraham’s  death  indicates  a  major  step  of
progress.  The  focus  in  the  glorification  now  shifts  to  Isaac  and
then before long to Jacob. Each change represents a further stage
in  the  glorification,  the  process  by  which  Jesus  would  become
fully Divine, and an extending of the power of the Divine Human
to save humankind. 

In  the  broadest  sense,  we  see  an  aspect  of  childhood  with  us
until we are thirty. Even contemporary psychology recognizes this.
Although adult age is said to start at twenty (AC 10225), a part of
us  is  still  in  childhood  states  for  another  decade  or  so  (see  AC
5353).  It  is  in  harmony  with  this  that  Abraham  stayed  alive

90

BIRTH OF THE DIVINE NATURAL

throughout much of Isaac’s life. Only a short time after Abraham
died, when his representation of the Lord ceased, Jacob and Esau
were born. States overlap, and one state becomes rich and full of
remains before yielding to the next. “And Abraham gave all that
he had unto Isaac” (Gen. 25:5).

The Jacob-Laban-Esau stories reveal how the Lord makes self-
discipline as easy as possible. It reveals how delights can be main-
tained  despite  the  need  for  self-compulsion  in  regeneration.  The
truth  is  that  the  Lord  walks  with  us  every  step  of  the  way,  even
though this is not always evident.

THE DIVINE RATIONAL IS

FULLY BLESSED

JEHOVAH BLESSES ISAAC
GENESIS 26

Jehovah appears to Isaac and promises descendants 
“as the stars of heaven” and that they would be 
blessed.

Isaac tells the men of Gerar that Rebekah is his 
sister, for the same reason Abraham did earlier.

Abimelech, the king of the Philistines in Gerar, 
discovers Isaac’s deception and warns the men 
of Gerar not to touch Rebekah.

Isaac begins to prosper in the land of the Philistines, 
and the Philistines quarrel with Isaac’s herdsmen 
over access to the well water in the land.

Isaac moves to Beersheba, makes peace with 
Abimelech and is prosperous.

In  Genesis  26  Jehovah  blesses  Isaac. More  deeply,  the  story
tells how the Isaac rational with the Lord is enriched, and how the
Lord rediscovers truths long since lost on this earth. If He is to order

92

THE DIVINE RATIONAL IS FULLY BLESSED

and glorify His natural, the rational within Him also needs further
glorification. It must be blessed. The blessing of His Divine ration-
al comes from an even higher level within Himself, from His Soul.
In  glorifying  His  Human,  Jesus  achieves  the  power  to  work
through the Word on its every level, to touch and move human hearts
and thoughts. It is said that “Isaac returned, and digged again the
wells of water which they had digged in the days of Abraham his
father” (Gen. 26:18). This represents “that the Lord opened those
truths  which  were  with  the  ancients”  (AC  3419)!  Perhaps  the
Ancient Word itself comes into His possession from Egypt, and has
its deepest celestial meaning opened to Him by His Soul.

In this chapter, once again a patriarch calls his wife his “sister.”
“And Isaac said [to the men of Gerar], Rebekah is my sister”
(Gen.  26:7). This  symbolizes  that  Divine  truths,  represented  by
Rebekah,  are  presented  through  appearances  (the  “sister”  here).
The Lord, when He was in the human part of Himself that wasn’t
yet Divine, was also in the “appearance” of truth (AC 3405). This
means that Divine Truth was adapted to the level at which He was
able  to  grasp  it  at  that  time.  Divine  truth  itself,  in  its  essence,  is
above  the  receiving  ability  of  finite  humans,  whether  living  on
earth or as angels in heaven, and it was above the receiving ability
of the not-yet-glorified Jesus.

But later, Isaac was led to admit that Rebekah was his wife.
This has two immediate meanings: first, that Divine truth, which
is accommodated to us by the Lord Himself, is Divine by virtue of
its  origin,  and  thus  is  a  wife,  not  a  sister;  and  secondly,  that  the
highest or celestial level of the mind can perceive rational revela-
tion  to  be  Divine  and  of  Divine  authority.  It  sees  Rebekah  as
Isaac’s wife, whereas the next level down, or the spiritual level of
the mind, cannot easily conceive of a rational revelation as being
Divine (AC 3394:2,3), but rather thinks of it as merely human, and
thus here as a sister.

Jesus Himself was attacked by the illusion that “Rebekah,” or

93

THE PATH, CHAPTER 13

the truth He had gained from the Word of God, was only as a sister
to Him. His finite maternal heredity instilled the false concept that
rational  truths  inflowing  from  His  Soul  are  only  finite  and  not
Divine. But He sees the horror of this suggestion that comes from
His finite heredity, and rejects it. Rebekah as a wife is Divine truth
married to Divine good in His rational mind (Isaac). To call such
Divine truth a sister is to remove it from the Divine marriage.

In its celestial sense, this chapter reveals that the Isaac rational,
the Divine rational with the Lord, is now fully blessed. Isaac dis-
covers  “a  well  of  living  waters”  (Gen.  26:19). This  is  true  for
Jesus as a youth in Nazareth. The Lord would have it be true for us.
Our knowledge of the Word of God, our love for living truths, can
broaden and deepen. This prepares the way for a wonderful gift: the
rebirth  of  the  natural  level  within  ourselves.  If  this  is  reborn,  we
become “heaven-made.”

THE NATURAL LEVEL OF JESUS

TO BE GLORIFIED

THE BLESSING OF JACOB AND ESAU
GENESIS 27

Isaac has become very old and blind. He asks 
Esau to bring him a meal before he dies so that he 
can bless Esau.

Rebekah overhears Isaac’s request and has Jacob, 
disguised as Esau, bring Isaac a meal to deceive 
him into blessing Jacob.

Isaac blesses Jacob. Esau returns, finds out that 
Jacob has stolen his blessing and begs Isaac for 
some type of blessing, which he receives.

After hearing Esau threaten Jacob’s life, Rebekah 
urges Jacob to flee to Laban, Rebekah’s brother, 
in Haran.

Chapter  27  of  Genesis  returns  to  the  story  of  Jacob  and
Esau and the blessing of each by Isaac their father. Isaac was
now “old, and his eyes were dim that he could not see” (Gen.
27:1). Growing “old” in the Word does not mean physical aging;
angels  do  not  know  what  old  age  is  because  they  are  perpetually
young.  Instead,  “old”  means  “the  presence  of  a  new  state,”  (AC

95

THE PATH, CHAPTER 14

3492) and this chapter deals with a new state in the Lord’s natural
level.

Jacob  stole  the  blessing  that  was  intended  for  Esau,  and
Rebekah  helped  him  to  do  this. This  seems  completely  wrong.
Yet it reflects a truth that we are not born good. We are born with
hereditary  evil  tendencies  to  overcome.  We  need  to  be  reborn.
Rebirth is necessary if we are to find true happiness in our natural,
day-to-day plane of life.

The Lord changed on this plane of life, and so showed the path
for how we can change. The final goal that Jesus Christ seeks with
us is to lead us to become wise infants (wise, but with the trust of
an infant), living in the present in our daily natural life and looking
to the Lord as our deeply loved Father (AC 3494:2).

In  His  glorification  process,  the  Lord  does  not  put  Esau  first.
The Esau with Him, the good or love in His natural, is impure from
the heredity He took on through Mary. On His path, truth is first in
time  (AC  3599).  He  endures  the  difficulty  of  self-compulsion  by
obeying Divine truth. But He sees the end, the goal, and in this is
His joy. As a result, He can now establish this same path in the heart
of each one of us, and lead us along it if we wish to follow.

We would love to have the good or love in our natural level be
spontaneously pure — a wonderful and free guide to our lives. But
we discover that this good has hereditary evil tendencies within it.
Esau  within  us  must  wait  to  rule  until  after  it  has  been  purified.
Jacob must take the lead. Yet Jacob, our concept of truth in the nat-
ural, is also limited. It needs education, and purification.

The following song expresses the conundrum about our hearts
and our thinking, about wishing for spontaneous good to rule with-
in us, yet finding that it cannot. Truth must lead instead.

My mind knows You are here
But my heart, 
Oh my heart is left behind.

96

THE NATURAL LEVEL OF JESUS TO BE GLORIFIED

I am leaving the door open for You.
Please come through.

My life is an open book
Let the end be written by You.

My hands are in Your hands; 
Let them do as You want to.

My spirit longs for You to
Come and share bread and wine.

Come and quench the thirst
That earthly water cannot touch.

Only a cup of Your water of life
Can make me whole.

Heather Childs

Swedenborg’s Writings speak about the same subject that this
song does: “The natural does not become new, or receive life cor-
responding  to  the  rational,  that  is,  is  not  regenerated,  except  by
means  of  doctrinal  things,  or  the  knowledges  of  good  and  truth”
(AC  3502:2).  “Only  a  cup  of  Your  water  of  life  can  make  me
whole.”

Before the door can be opened for the Lord to come through,
the  heart  must  be  purified.  The  mind  must  become  new  through
drinking the water of life. We drink by learning the Lord’s truth and
living it. Then the heart becomes new, and the Lord can come in to
us (AC 3504).

Jacob  steals  the  blessing  because  the  initial  blessing  in  the
rebirth  of  the  natural  level  is  by  means  of  truth,  represented  by

97

THE PATH, CHAPTER 14

Jacob.  That  this  is  not the  way  the  Lord  originally  created  the
process  of  spiritual  human  development  is  evident  from  the  fact
that Jacob stole the honor. Yet Rebekah led the way in this. She rep-
resents Divine truth in the rational: a higher truth.

This  higher  truth  knows  that  the  natural  can  be  reborn  only
through  our  compelling  ourselves  to  obey  the  revealed  truth  (AC
1937). Since this is the reality of our rebirth, the Lord with all His
love and tender Providence makes this path as easy and joyful as
possible, just as Jacob’s father gave him a wonderful blessing.

Inmostly,  good  is  always  first.  Without  the  goodness  of
remains  —  innocent  loves  from  childhood  —  in  our  hearts,  we
would never be able to compel ourselves to obey the truth. Later,
good breaks the yoke of self-compulsion to obey truth. From love
we  then  want to  live  a  good  life,  and  do  so  freely.  Good  openly
rules, and self-compulsion no longer dominates our lives. So Isaac
was able to tell Esau, after giving Jacob a full and rich bless-
ing:  “Upon  your  sword  you  shall  live,  and  shall  serve  your
brother [Jacob]; and it shall come to pass, when you shall have
the  dominion,  that  you  shall  break  his  yoke  from  upon  your
neck” (Gen.  27:40).

The Lord goes through the Jacob/Esau states (AC 3508) while
He is in Nazareth. Somehow it is instinctive to think of Jesus Christ
as being without any tendencies to evil. Perhaps because we think
of Him glorified, we tend to forget that He came on earth to assume
a heredity through Mary in order to face and subdue the hells and
glorify His Human. And yet, there in Nazareth, Jesus was facing all
of  the  negative  thoughts  and  feelings  that  we  ourselves  face.  He
was working constantly to reject all thoughts and feelings that were
not in accord with Divine Love, and thus glorify His human heart
into a Divinely Human heart.

In  establishing  this  path,  the  Lord’s  purpose  was  to  set  our

hearts free, so that we will want to do only what is good. 

“Bless  the  Lord,  O  my  soul. And  forget  not  all  His  benefits:

98

THE NATURAL LEVEL OF JESUS TO BE GLORIFIED

Who forgives all your iniquities, Who heals all your diseases, Who
redeems your life from destruction, Who crowns you with loving-
kindness and tender mercies, Who satisfies your mouth with good
things, so that your youth is renewed like the eagle’s” (Psalm 103:
2-5; see also AC 3610:2).

THE MEANS TO GLORIFY
THE NATURAL

JACOB’S LADDER
GENESIS 28

Jacob leaves his father and mother to find a wife 
from Laban’s daughters.

Esau leaves also, to find a wife from Ishmael’s 
daughters.

On his journey Jacob has a dream about angels 
descending and ascending on a ladder to God.

Isaac called Jacob, blessed him, and asked him to travel to
Paddan-aram to find a wife from the daughters of Laban. Isaac
and Rebekah didn’t want Jacob to marry a Canaanite woman.
In  their  hearts  they  wished  he  would  marry  a  woman  from
among  their  relatives  back  in  the  homeland  of  Haran.  Isaac
promised  that  God  Shaddai  would  protect  Jacob  and  that
Shaddai would give him the blessing of Abraham.

It is now time for the natural level of Jesus, His “everyday”
mind represented by Jacob, to join with outer knowledge that will
lead  this  level  to  Divinity.  Outer  knowledge  involves  simple
truths found in the literal stories of the Word, as well as knowl-
edge  of  how  things  function  in  nature,  and  the  outer,  everyday

100

THE MEANS TO GLORIFY THE NATURAL

dealings among human beings.

But  Jesus  must  not  join  with  outer  knowledge  that  denies  the
existence  of  spiritual  and  celestial  truth,  symbolized  by  the
Canaanite women (AC 3665:2). He must search for outer knowl-
edge that admits the existence of such higher truth, symbolized by
the daughters of Laban, because only in this way can He join the
natural,  everyday  mind  with  the  pure  and  heavenly  mind.  If  He
does this, He makes it possible for us to do so as well. Thus, Jacob’s
travels  to  find  an  appropriate  wife  picture  Jesus’  journey  in  the
realm  of  outer  knowledge  that  can  lead  His  natural  mind  to
Divinity.

In the literal story, Jacob prepared for his long journey and
left Beersheba. On the first night he camped near Luz, by the
border  near  the  Jordan.  The  sun  set,  and  he  took  one  of  the
nearby stones and used it for his pillow.

“And he dreamed a dream, and behold a ladder set on the
earth, and its head reaching to heaven; and behold the angels
of  God  ascending  and  descending  on  it. And  behold  Jehovah
standing  upon  it;  and  He  said,  ‘I  am  Jehovah  the  God  of
Abraham your father, and the God of Isaac; the land whereon
you lie, to you will I give it, and to your seed. . . .And behold, I
am with you, and will keep you wherever you go, and will bring
you back to this ground’ ” (Gen. 28:12-15, selections).

The fact that night was falling represents that now Jesus, con-
scious in His natural mind, is in an “obscure” state. In our every-
day, natural-level consciousness there are countless spiritual issues
of which we are only dimly aware. Here in this natural level, Jesus
does not have the ability to discern among all the deeper issues that
are so clear to His higher levels of consciousness.

Jacob’s dream symbolizes something that is revealed to Jesus
by His Divine Soul. Jesus is shown that there will indeed be a full

101

THE PATH, CHAPTER 15

and active connection between the outer knowledge in His natural
mind  and  the  Divine  level  of  celestial  truth  and  goodness.  There
will  be  “infinite  and  eternal”  communication  and  conjunction
between the lowest truths of nature and the Word, and the highest
truths  of  the  Divine  (AC  3701,  3699).  The  outer,  everyday
thoughts, decisions, and actions of Jesus will ascend to seek Divine
enlightenment,  and  Divine  enlightenment  will  flow  down  into
them, shaping and affecting them. This is represented by the angels
ascending and descending on the dream ladder that connects heav-
en and earth.

When  Jacob  woke  up  he  said,  “Surely  Jehovah  is  in  this
place, and I knew it not.” And he was afraid, and said, “How
awesome is this place! This is none other than the house of God,
and this is the gate of heaven” (Gen. 28:12-17).

Jacob got up, took the stone that he had used for a pillow,
and raised it as a pillar. He poured oil on it, marking it as a holy
altar, and named the place Bethel, which means “the house of
God.”

This prophecy that the Divine Soul reveals fills Jesus with awe
and  enlightenment.  Even  here,  in  the  obscurity  and  confusion  of
natural-level issues, the Divine is present. “Surely the Lord is in
this  place,  and  I  knew  it  not.” Jacob’s  fear  and  awe  symbolize
Jesus’ startling realization that the Divine is indeed present in outer,
everyday knowledge and life. This realization alters Jesus’ natural-
level outlook in a sacred way (AC 3718). He sees the presence of
Divinity in the natural-level order of life: “This is none other than
the house of God” (AC 3720). He sees that even the laws of nature
can provide a gateway to knowledge of God, only because God is
the life force that flows into nature: “This is the gate of heaven”
(AC 3721).

In  this  part  of  Genesis  our  own  natural  level  is  being  reborn
(representatively) as to its thinking (truth) and as to its love (good).
This is done step by step, symbolized by ascending a ladder of life.

102

THE MEANS TO GLORIFY THE NATURAL

But first consider the setting that leads up to the dream and its sym-
bolism. Jacob is now the central focus of the story. He represents a
natural-level  way  of  thinking  (AC  3559:2).  Jacob’s  being  sent  to
Aram  or  Syria  by  Isaac  is  prophetic,  for  Syria  represents  the
“knowledges of truth” (AC 3664). The ladder’s beginning, set on
the earth, is the “ultimates of order” (AC 3657). The ultimates of
order are plain truths from the Old and New Testaments, such as the
Ten  Commandments,  the  stories  of  creation,  of  the  patriarchs,  of
the  founding  of  the  Israelite  nation,  of  Elijah  and  Elisha,  of  the
prophets and psalms, of the coming of Jesus Christ and the gospels
of  the  New Testament,  and  finally  the  tapestry  and  beauty  of  the
book of Revelation. Such “ultimates” also include the plain, gener-
al truths of the Writings. From these the Lord disposes the interme-
diates, which are the steps of the ladder ascending upward to him.
The intermediates are the levels of emotions, thoughts, and affec-
tions in our minds that ascend, as in steps, up to the Lord.

When  we  ascend  a  number  of  steps  up  the  ladder  of  truth,  it
enables us to come nearer to the Lord, and enables Him to elevate
our daily lives.  At first our motives are mixed, having both what is
selfish and what is unselfish within. We want to serve and love the
Lord, but much of our orientation from heredity looks to self and
self-glory (AC 3701:4; AC 3993:9-11). But in time, we perceive a
higher rung of truth. We look within and see formerly hidden con-
ceit or pride. This we may shun from our love and obedience to the
Lord. The next rung reveals a higher concept of truth, and exposes
other lower, selfish motives formerly not perceived as such.  Thus
we gradually may ascend toward the Lord, who stands at the height
or top of this ladder of life. Gradually our natural level changes, and
we are actually reborn.

All  this  is  made  possible  because  the  Lord  on  earth  followed
this order. He establishes this ladder of life for us and makes it pos-
sible for us to ascend. Doing this brings Him into severe struggles.
Isaac said to Jacob his son, “God Shaddai will bless you” (Gen.

103

THE PATH, CHAPTER 15

28:3). God Shaddai represents God’s presence during temptations
(AC 3667). It is through temptations that Jesus, our Savior, makes
His natural level Divine (Lord 33, 34).

How  does  Jesus  Christ  begin  this  process?  He  turns  to  the
Word, to the Old Testament and perhaps also to the Ancient Word.
As a boy He studied this Word in depth (represented by Abram’s
time  in  Egypt  and  also  by  Jesus’  time  in  Egypt  as  an  infant).
Streams of perceptions about the inner meaning of the Word flow
into Him from His Soul.

Much later in His life on earth, when it comes time for His nat-
ural level to be reborn, He turns again to this outer truth. He reads
the Word, understanding celestial levels within it that we scarcely
dream of. He applies these transforming truths to His natural. He
applies them to His finite maternal heredity to bring about radical
changes.  He  imposes  Divine  order  upon  this  human  in  order  to
transform His life.

Gradually  His  finite  human  heredity  is  put  aside  as  the Word
becomes more and more His Being (see TCR 85:2). It seems from
the evidence that this is quite a while before His public ministry,
long  before  He  is  thirty  years  of  age.  Who  beholds  these  inner
changes?  The  angels  are  aware  to  some  extent  and  are  deeply
moved. Even Mary — and Joseph too — would be aware of a dif-
ferent sphere about Jesus, a growing gentleness and amazing com-
passion.

Jacob  said  of  his  future:  “I  [will]  return  in  peace  to  my
father’s house” (Gen. 28:21). The Divine natural would become
One with His Soul. He would come home and invite us to our own
spiritual home.

“Come unto Me, all you that labor and are heavy laden, and I
will revive you. Take My yoke upon you, and learn of Me, that I am
meek and humble in heart: and you shall find rest for your souls,
for My yoke is easy, and My burden light” (Matt. 11:28-30).

INITIAL STAGES OF GLORIFICATION

OF THE NATURAL

JACOB IN HARAN: THE EARLY YEARS
GENESIS 29

Jacob journeys to Paddan-aram and meets Laban’s 
daughter Rachel at a well.

Jacob loves Rachel and asks Laban for permission to 
marry her.

Laban tricks Jacob into marrying his older
daughter, Leah.

Laban says Jacob can also marry Rachel if he works 
for seven more years, which Jacob does.

Rachel is unable to have children, but Leah has four: 
Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah.

Here at a well Jacob met Rachel, who was coming to water
her  father’s  sheep.  When  Jacob  found  out  who  she  was,  he
watered her sheep, and then “Jacob kissed Rachel, and lifted
up his voice and wept” (Gen. 29:11). Providence had led him
to  his  kindred.  Soon  Laban,  Rachel’s  father,  came  to  meet

105

THE PATH, CHAPTER 16

Jacob and took him into his home.

After  a  month  there,  Laban  asked  Jacob  how  he  could
reward him for his services on Laban’s farm: “And Jacob loved
Rachel,  and  he  said,  I  will  serve  you  seven  years  for  Rachel,
your  younger  daughter”  (Gen.  29:18).  He  faithfully  did  this,
but  on  the  wedding  night  Laban  substituted  Leah,  the  older
daughter, as Jacob’s bride. When Jacob protested strongly the
next morning, Laban said that the custom in this place was that
the older daughter must marry first. Jacob agreed to serve for
seven more years for Rachel, for his love for her was deep: the
first  seven  years  he  served  for  her  “were  in  his  eyes  as  a  few
days, for the love he had for her” (Gen. 29:20).

Then Rachel became Jacob’s wife. “And Jehovah saw that
Leah  was  hated,  and  He  opened  her  womb,  and  Rachel  was
barren”  (Gen.  29:31).  Leah  then  had  four  sons:  Reuben,
Simeon, Levi and Judah.

In the supreme inner sense of this story this chapter unfolds the
beginning  of  the  glorification  of  the  Lord’s  natural  level.  Jacob
symbolizes  the  truth  applied  in  the  Lord’s  natural  mind  and  His
willingness  to  obey  this  truth.  Finite  human  qualities  within  His
natural level are seen and cast out in a series of Divinely ordained
steps. The preparation for and unfolding of this is in the hands of
Jehovah, the Divine and loving Father. Jacob was led to Haran in
Syria. Syria represents the knowledge needed to lead His natural to
become one with the Father.

In  Providence  Jacob  met  Rachel,  who  was  “beautiful  in
form and appearance” (Gen. 29:17). He fell in love, strongly, ten-
derly.  Rachel  represents  a  love  of  Divine  truth  that  will  lead  the
Lord to glorification. But first came Jacob’s marriage to Leah, who
represents  a  love  for  lower  and  more  external  truths.  Living  by
these  lower  truths prepares  for  the  deeper  marriage  with  Rachel
(AC 3758,9).

Laban is the father of both Leah and Rachel. He symbolizes

106

INITIAL STAGES OF GLORIFICATION OF THE NATURAL

a good that begets loves of truth, loves of the Word. This good is
called “corporeal good” (AC 3778:3). Within us, “corporeal good”
is  the  earliest  remains  or  affections  of  love:  celestial  qualities  of
innocence  and  trust  instilled  in  our  infancy. Around  this  infantile
good  would  be  many  mistaken  childish  notions  and  fallacies
(Ibid.). But still, the good and innocence are within. These remains
are the basis, the foundation, for the desire to be reborn. From these
remains come the hope and strong desire to have our natural mind
change from being dead to becoming alive and filled with percep-
tion and genuine love.

Jesus,  in  the  glorification  of  His  natural,  has  a  similar  basis
within Himself. We know that the youthful Jesus has remains, for
this is taught in the Arcana Coelestia (see 4176, 1906). The remains
with Jesus, however, are Divine and enable Him to be not merely
regenerated  but  glorified,  or  fully  united  with  His  Divine  Soul.
These  remains  are  a  motivating  force  in  His  natural,  and  bring
about  an  utter  transformation  there.  These  are  the  Lord’s  Laban
qualities,  which  are  allied  to  His  Soul  and  His  spiritual-celestial
nature. It takes powerful Divine forces such as these to bring about
a change in His hereditary natural, to bring the transformation that
will change our world. His strong love of truth in His natural was
born of the Laban within Him, His Divine “remains” (AC 1906:4).
The  Lord’s  glorification  of  His  natural  was  accomplished  by
means of the Word. Jacob met Rachel by a well of water. This is
the water of life: the Word itself. When he met Rachel, he “lifted
up his voice and wept” (Gen. 29:11). These were tears of happi-
ness. This represents the Lord’s perception that it truly is the Word,
the water of life, that can bring changes to His natural and glorify it.
Jacob  loved  Rachel,  but  he  was  given  Leah  instead,  Leah
whose “eyes were weak.” Leah represents “the affection of exter-
nal truth” (AC 3758). She too is the daughter of Laban: the elder
daughter. At first Jesus did not see deeply into the Word. His love
for the Word was at first an external affection of truth or “weak-

107

THE PATH, CHAPTER 16

eyed” which did not see the truths that could change the patterns
in  His  not-yet-glorified  natural.  But  this  love  is  followed  by  a
deeper and truer love represented by Rachel, a love of the interior
truths  of  the  Word.  These  truths  lead  to  major  changes  in  the
Lord’s life, in His natural level. In fact, they lead to His glorifica-
tion of that very plane.

From the truths He learns from the Word, He begins to change
in His day-to-day actions, to come into the initiation of glorifica-
tion.  If  what  is  Divine  comes  to  this  natural  level  of  life,  it  also
opens up astonishing changes for us. It provides for us the Source
for  the  inflowing  of  heavenly  life.  It  makes  it  possible  for  us  to
begin to be angels, even here on earth.

Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah, all sons of the affection of
external truth (Leah), depict initial or preparatory stages that lead
the  way  to  the  actual  glorification  of  the  natural.  They  depict  a
“honeymoon” state, preparing for fundamental changes to follow.
Reuben,  the  first-born,  literally  means  “has  seen.” With

Jesus, Reuben represents “foresight” (AC 3859). 

“That in the supreme sense ‘to see’ is foresight must be evident,
for the intelligence which is predicated of the Lord is infinite intel-
ligence, which is nothing else than foresight” (AC 3863:4).

The youthful Jesus comes into Divine foresight even as He goes
about His daily life in Nazareth. His reflections are of the deepest
nature. He knows now not only what is happening around Him, but
also what will happen in the future.

From  His  heredity  through  Mary  the  Lord’s  natural  level  too
had been in darkness. It had lacked faith and real vision. But now a
change is coming. The young Jesus is to experience an insight, a
vision that initiates His natural into becoming Immanuel, God with
us. His Soul, Jehovah, now unfolds before Him the inmost source
of faith in the natural — Divine foresight. Here, in His natural, He

108

INITIAL STAGES OF GLORIFICATION OF THE NATURAL

begins  to  see  with  new  eyes.  He  sees  things  past  and  future;  He
begins  to  foresee salvation  for  us,  and  glorification  for  Himself.
This  foresight  is  a  glimpse  into  infinity,  a  seeing  into  unlimited
promises and spiritual distances.

“And  Leah  conceived  again,  and  bare  a  son,  and  said,
‘Because Jehovah has heard that I was hated, and has given me
this one also’; and she called his name Simeon” (Gen. 29:33).
The Lord now works to obey His acquired faith in His daily life.
This obedience is “Simeon” born within Him, replacing the finite
human  tendencies  to  ignore  what  His  growing  faith  dictates  for
Him to do. These tendencies in His heredity through Mary, with the
hells behind them, hate this obedience in Jesus. This is captured by
the  phrase  of  Leah,  “I  was  hated”  (Gen.  29:33).  Simeon  literally
means,  “to  hear.”  With  Jesus,  Simeon  represents  the  Divine
Providence, because  ultimately  obedience  to  the  dictates  of  faith
expresses  a  full  trust  in  this  Providence.  It  is  through  Providence
that the Lord hears our prayers and answers them. Providence is the
source  that  expresses  Divine  hearing.  With  the  symbolic  birth  of
Simeon, Jesus brings the reality of Divine Providence right down
into His daily life.

As the natural level of Jesus Christ came into initial states of
glorification, first He foresaw the needs of humankind from eterni-
ty  to  eternity.  Then  He  began  to  provide  that  a  new  faith  should
come  into  our  natural  lives.  This  is  at  the  heart  of  His  Divine
Providence. He works His miracles in many ways. States of coin-
cidence, of serendipity, come to us and help us to change our outer
and inner lives. Our new faith in the natural begins to fit into our
home life and our occupational life. We put truths into action.

When Simeon is born to the Lord in His glorification, it leads
Him to see how He can provide for us and lead us to heaven. We
are  as  little  children  in  trying  to  perceive  how  this  is  so.  This
Simeon state comes to Jesus while He still lives in Nazareth, acting
outwardly as a carpenter. This too is representative, for carpenters

109

THE PATH, CHAPTER 16

work with wood, using tools of iron. Wood corresponds to natural
goodness, which is fashioned through natural truths (iron).

“And Leah conceived again, and bare a son, and said, ‘Now
this time will my man cleave to me, because I have borne him
three sons’; therefore she called his name Levi” (Gen. 29:34).
In the supreme sense, “ ‘to cleave’ is love and mercy” (AC 3875).
In the glorification of His natural, as the state of Levi comes into
Jesus’ heart from His Soul, He has a great longing to extend mercy
to others. The Lord sees the states of all on earth and in the spiri-
tual world at this point, and He knows the miseries of all people.
He  also  looks  ahead,  into  the  future  of  humankind  on  earth,  and
knows  that  many  hearts  will  suffer  deep  miseries.  He  sees  the
depression and feelings of being lost that will come to many. This
moves Him with a powerful compassion, a Divine mercy towards
human sufferers.

“And Leah conceived again, and bare a son, and she said,
‘This time I will confess Jehovah’; and therefore she called his
name Judah; and she stood still from bearing” (Gen. 29:35). In
the supreme sense, Judah signifies the Divine of love (AC 3881).
This is the love from which Divine mercy comes. It is this which
the Lord now feels and perceives. That Divine of love is the goal in
glorifying  His  natural.  It  will  bring  Divinity  to  this  level  of  His
mind where before had been the influence of His heredity through
Mary. It is to be a transformation of inestimable spiritual impact. So
far He feels this only in its beginnings.

In  glorifying  His  natural  mind,  the  Lord  takes  the  Word  to
Himself and makes it His nature. He becomes the Word. From this
He ascends toward the Divine good, toward Judah. The Divine of
love (Judah) is at the top of the ladder, but there will be many more
sons and rungs before the natural is fully glorified. The mother of
these first four states is Leah who, as we have seen, represents an
external affection  of  truth. This  indicates  that  more  beautiful  and
powerful states are still to follow. These are represented by Jacob’s

110

INITIAL STAGES OF GLORIFICATION OF THE NATURAL

experiences  in  his  later  years  in  Haran  as  he  gradually  becomes
wealthy and has further sons and a daughter.

For us, each of these first four sons represents a new state that
can change our daily outlooks and lives. There is an initial faith in
everyday  life  (Reuben). Then  comes  the  desire  to  obey  this  truth
(Simeon). The Lord blesses this with a sense of “charity” or love of
the  neighbor  (Levi),  followed  by  a  new  and  applied  love  of  the
Lord  (Judah).  These  are  initial  or  “honeymoon”  type  states,  but
they bring happiness where before there was a feeling of misery.

LATER STAGES OF GLORIFICATION

OF THE NATURAL

JACOB IN HARAN: THE LATER YEARS
GENESIS 30

Rachel envies her sister and gives her maid Bilhah to 
Jacob. Bilhah has two sons named Dan and 
Naphtali.

Leah, who had stopped having children of her own, 
gives her maid Zilpah to Jacob. Zilpah has two sons, 
Gad and Asher.

The first four sons of Jacob were all born from Leah, and
represent an initial stage in the glorification of the natural of Jesus
Christ.  They  are  Divine  foresight,  Divine  Providence,  Divine
mercy, and the Divine of love. These four are a “honeymoon” state,
a beautiful preparatory stage leading up to the actual glorification
that is now to follow.

Jacob and Rachel had a sure love for each other. They were
sad  that  Rachel  was  barren. When  Rachel  saw  that  she  could
not bear a son, she gave Bilhah her handmaid to Jacob. Bilhah
conceived and bore Jacob a son. Rachel then said: “ ‘God has
judged  me,  and  also  has  heard  my  voice,  and  has  given  me  a
son’; therefore she called his name Dan” (Gen. 30:2-6, selected).

112

LATER STAGES OF GLORIFICATION OF THE NATURAL

A new series of sons is now born, and the first of these is Dan. As
the firstborn in this group, he represents the key to all that follows
with this unit. 

In Jesus, Dan represents “justice and mercy” (AC 3920, 3923).
As the young Jesus Christ comes into the actual glorification of His
natural,  He  perceives  justice  and  mercy  as  the  first  goals  in  this
process, a coming into Divine justice and mercy as the foundation
of the glorified Divine natural. This is not the idea of mercy repre-
sented  by  Levi  in  the  first  series;  it  is  rather  a  mercy  and  justice
applied to actual life needs and situations. From His Soul, He is led
into  the  practical  justice  and  mercy  that  will  uplift  individual
human beings. In His Divine natural, the Lord begins to replace His
finite inherited qualities with true justice and true mercy.

“And  Bilhah  conceived  again,  and  Bilhah,  Rachel’s  hand-
maid,  bore  a  second  son  to  Jacob.  And  Rachel  said,  ‘With
wrestlings  of  God  have  I  wrestled  with  my  sister,  and  I  have
prevailed’;  and  she  called  his  name  Naphtali”  (Gen.  30:7,8).
These  words  refer  to  the  Lord’s  victories  in  temptations  through
His own power.

The Lord became incarnate to redeem and save humankind, to
rescue us from the overwhelming power of the hells. To meet the
hells in combat, He assumes through Mary a fallen heredity, thus
giving the hells access to Himself. He meets the hells not from His
Divinity within, but from His human essence. The temptations He
endures are torturous, grievous beyond anything ever known. But
these temptations are necessary, at this stage because they will be a
means of uniting His Divine rational with His new natural. Jesus
fights in these temptations from His own power, and He conquers
from His own power. This is true of no one else; none of us sustains
and  conquers  in  temptations  from  our  own  power.  It  is  the  Lord
Who sustains and conquers during our temptations, with a tender
love for each of us.

In summary, the Lord instilled justice and mercy in His natural

113

THE PATH, CHAPTER 17

(Dan) where before had been the finite heredity through Mary. He
then endured further temptations (Naphtali), the real key to change
and glorification. What follows is His assuming of Gad and Asher
qualities.

“And Leah saw that she had stood still from bearing, and
she  took  Zilpah  her  handmaid,  and  gave  her  to  Jacob  for  a
woman. And Zilpah, Leah’s handmaid, bare Jacob a son. And
Leah said, ‘A troop comes,’ and she called his name Gad” (Gen.
30:9-11). In the Lord’s glorification, Gad represents omnipotence
and omniscience (AC 3929). He represents that in the Lord which
is all-powerful and all-knowing. After justice and mercy become a
part of His natural (Dan), and Jesus then achieves victories in ongo-
ing temptations (Naphtali), Jehovah His Soul instills a degree of the
power and wisdom that will belong to Jesus’ glorified natural in the
end. This power and wisdom are not yet fully Divine, but He per-
ceives  the  reality  of  omnipotence  and  omniscience  and  that  they
will become His with the completion of the glorification process.

With the quality represented by Gad, when it is born to Jesus’
natural  level,  there  comes  a  sense  of  power  from  Divine  love,
and awareness and knowing from Divine intelligence. In His nat-
ural  level  there  is  a  dawning  awareness  of  infinite  power  and
intelligence.

An  increasing  sense  of  Divinity  is  coming  to  Jesus.  Its  very
source is the Divine Love in His Soul. This power, this intelligence,
will serve to save humankind from destruction by the hells. It will
also  save  us  in  moments  of  overwhelming  need. There  are  times
when we are about to be overwhelmed by some evil, and the touch
of  Providence  rescues  us. This  is  the  Lord’s  touch  from  His  now
glorified Divine Human. He redeems us.

The omnipotence and omniscience in God are far beyond our
grasp  or  perception.  But  they  inflow  from  the  Lord,  through  His
Divine  Human,  accommodated  to  our  daily  lives.  They  inflow
through  the  operation  of  His  Holy  Spirit,  which  is  His  Divine

114

LATER STAGES OF GLORIFICATION OF THE NATURAL

Human  touching  and  uplifting  our  hearts  and  minds.  For  Jesus
Christ  on  earth,  His  coming  into  the  representation  of  Gad  is  a
major step in enabling Him to assist us. The all-powerful and all-
knowing Divine, represented by Gad, inflows especially into useful
services that we perform for others.

Another  quality  is  represented  by  the  birth  of  Asher.  “And
Zilpah,  Leah’s  handmaid,  bare  a  second  son  to  Jacob.  And
Leah  said,  ‘In  my  blessedness,  for  the  daughters  will  call  me
blessed’; and she called his name Asher” (Gen. 30:12, 13). In the
Lord’s glorification, Asher represents “eternity, [and] in the inter-
nal  sense  the  happiness  of  eternal  life.  .  .  .”  (AC  3936,  emphasis
added).

Eternal life becomes completely real to Jesus in His natural, and
He  sees  that  the  eternal  or  eternity  is  to  become  His  very  nature
when He and the Father become One. This will be a source of awe
and joy.

If we think of eternity as being in the Lord and in His accom-
modated but pure love, it becomes a source of happiness and of a
sense of reality and hope. With angels, each state the Lord gives to
them  is  sparklingly  alive.  They  always  live  in  the  present  with
openness and delight.

So we read that such angels are not worried or anxious about
the future, and if we are striving to become angels, we must strive
for this state as well:

“Unruffled is their spirit whether they obtain the objects of their
desire or not; and they do not grieve over the loss of them, being
content  with  their  lot.  If  they  become  rich,  they  do  not  set  their
hearts  on  riches;  if  they  are  raised  to  honors,  they  do  not  regard
themselves as more worthy than others; if they become poor, they
are  not  made  sad;  if  their  circumstances  are  mean,  they  are  not
dejected.  They  know  that  for  those  who  trust  in  the  Divine,  all
things advance toward a happy state to eternity, and that whatever

115

THE PATH, CHAPTER 17

befalls them in time is still conducive thereto.

Be it known that the Divine Providence is universal, that is, in
things  the  most  minute;  and  that  they  who  are  in  the  stream  of
Providence are all the time carried along toward everything that is
happy,  whatever  may  be  the  appearance  of  the  means;  and  that
those  are  in  the  stream  of  Providence  who  put  their  trust  in  the
Divine, and attribute all things to Him. . . .Be it known also that so
far as anyone is in the stream of Providence, so far he is in a state
of peace” (AC 8478:3,4).

FURTHER STAGES OF GLORIFICATION

OF THE NATURAL

THE BIRTHS OF ISSACHAR, ZEBULUN, AND DINAH
GENESIS 30 CONTINUED

Leah conceives again and bears sons named 
Issachar and Zebulun and a daughter named Dinah.

“And  Reuben  went  in  the  days  of  the  wheat-harvest,  and
found  dudaim  in  the  field,  and  brought  them  unto  Leah  his
mother” (Gen. 30:14). Rachel asked for these dudaim, and Leah
agreed  to  give  them  to  her  in  exchange  for  Jacob’s  cohabiting
with Leah that night. The “dudaim” represent the “things of con-
jugial love in the truth and good of charity and love” (AC 3942).

“What  the  ‘dudaim’  were,  the  translators  do  not  know.  They
suppose  them  to  have  been  fruits  or  flowers,  to  which  they  give
names according to their several opinions. But of what kind they
were it does not concern us to know. . . .By the ‘dudaim’ there is
signified the conjugial of good and truth. . . .It is derived from the
word  ‘dudim,’  which  means  loves  and  conjunction  by  means  of
them” (Ibid.).

The focus is now on the final key stages of the glorification of

117

THE PATH, CHAPTER 18

the  Lord’s  natural.  The  subject  is  a  progressive  conjunction  of
Divine  good  and  Divine  truth.  From  these  come  the  influx  and
force  enabling  good  and  truth  (love  and  faith)  progressively  to
unite  in  us. And  this  uniting  brings  us  into  heaven  even  on  our
natural level.

In the literal story, the two wives of Jacob have an exchange.
Leah, the wife less loved by Jacob, agrees to give up her dudaim
to  Rachel  only  if  she  may  join  with  their  husband  that  night.
There  is  a  longing  expressed  by  both  women  in  this  incident.
Rachel,  who  already  possesses  the  greater  love  from  Jacob,
longs for the dudaim. Leah longs for closeness with Jacob, and
to conceive more children by him. Each wife agrees to give to
the other what she desires.

Jacob  represents  the  natural-level  delight  that  Jesus  feels  in
response  to  true  ideas.  An  affection  for  deeper,  interior  truth
(Rachel) is more precious and beautiful to Him than an affection for
outer,  external  truth  (Leah). And  yet  a  joining  of  natural  delight
with outer, natural-world truth must come first in order for Jesus to
make His natural mind Divine. Leah’s children must be born before
Rachel’s. In His natural mind, Jesus must embrace the truths in the
knowledge of nature and the literal sense of the Word with delight,
because these too ultimately come from the Divine.

One might wonder why Jesus could not move directly into con-
junction with interior truth. Why did He take this step, first to join
His  natural-level  delight  with  external  truth?  Because  this  is  the
route that we, as finite humans, must take. Without a foundation of
delight in outer truth, we would have no ability to move into deep-
er, spiritual knowledge with equal delight. When we first learn to
delight in the warmth of the sun, we lay a foundation that can lead
to a delight in the knowledge of God’s love, which is represented
by the sun’s warmth. In order to bring Divinity to the path we must
take, Jesus chooses to develop His mind in this order. His maternal
heredity also leads to this pathway.

118

FURTHER STAGES OF GLORIFICATION OF THE NATURAL

Just as both wives gain something in this exchange in Genesis
30,  both  levels  of  affection  in  Jesus  gain  something  through  this
process.  In  the  literal  story,  Leah  gains  conjunction  with  her
husband, and then bears two more sons and a daughter. Rachel
gains the dudaim, which represent the “things of conjugial love.”
These  representations  symbolize  a  joining  of  Jesus’  natural-level
delight with outer truth (Jacob and Leah), which then brings about
a deeper joining that can take place (Jacob and Rachel). He is now
able to move into the “heavenly marriage” of delight in His natural
consciousness  with  deeper,  interior  truth  and  principles.  The  two
last sons and the daughter that are born to Jacob and Leah prepare
the way for the deeper conjunction, the heavenly marriage, which
in the literal story will finally bring a child to Jacob and Rachel.

Regeneration or rebirth comes from the heavenly marriage of
good and truth in the human mind. Truth longs for good, which is
its interior partner, and good needs truths to clothe its love. In other
words, faith needs to feel love for what it knows to be true, and love
needs knowledge to bring it into life. On the highest level, coming
from  the  soul  itself,  a  conjugial  or  marriage  principle  is  now  at
work.  This  is  an  interior  force  or  influx  into  the  mind  working
towards  a  heavenly  marriage.  From  this  marriage,  a  person
becomes an angel. What are truths alone except statements? What
are goods or loves without definition, which truth provides? Good
or love is the heart, but it needs its clothing of truths to have any
effect or use.

Jacob came to Leah that night, and “he lay with her” (Gen.
30:16).  From  this  came  the  conception  and  birth  of  Issachar,
the ninth of Jacob’s twelve sons. In speaking of the heavenly mar-
riage  now  taking  place,  the  Writings  reveal  a  new  principle:  that
this marriage is between the good of a lower plane and the truth of
a higher one (AC 3952). Lower goods need the discipline of truths
from a higher level of revelation. For example, the good of a sexu-
al relationship needs the higher truths regarding conjugial love, or

119

THE PATH, CHAPTER 18

the outer sexual act will be profaned. With the Lord, the marriage
is between His Divine Human and the Divine itself, His Soul. This
is a holy marriage between the Son of God (His Divine Human) and
the Father. In the Lord these two became One by glorification (see
AC 3952:2). “I and My Father are One” (John 10:30).

The first birth in this new series is that of Issachar, son of
Leah  and  Jacob.  When  this  fifth  son  of  Jacob  and  Leah  was
born,  Leah  said:  “  ‘God  has  given  me  my  reward,  because  I
gave  my  handmaid  to  my  man.’  And  she  called  his  name
Issachar” (Gen. 30:18).

On the human plane, in the rebirth of the natural level, Issachar
represents mutual love. This is a “reward” in human life that is dis-
cretely above any natural definition of reward. In fact, the very con-
cept  of  reward  is  left  behind  and  replaced  by  mutual  love,  a  real
love of others and their happiness, which is returned. Such a love is
heavenly  in  us  and  can  come  from  the  Lord  alone. This  explains
why,  in  the  supreme  sense,  Issachar  represents  Divine  good  and
Divine  truth  in  Jesus  Christ  Himself.  Divine  good  expresses  a
Divine love for others, and this has its own inmost Divine truths.
These now come as new qualities in His natural.

On His plane of glorification, the Lord comes into a new, fuller
love of humankind. From this He inflows into believers, endowing
them with mutual love. This is a crucial step in His glorification.

“And Leah conceived again, and bare a sixth son to Jacob.
And Leah said, ‘God has endowed me with a good dowry; now
will my man dwell with me, because I have borne him six sons’;
and  she  called  his  name  Zebulun”  (Gen.  30:19,20).  In  the
supreme  sense,  these  words  signify  “the  Divine  itself  of  the  Lord
and His  Divine  Human;  in  the  internal  sense,  the  heavenly  mar-
riage, and in the external sense, conjugial love” (AC 3958, empha-
sis added).

In the supreme sense, dealing with the Lord’s glorification, the
coming  of  Zebulun  is  of  profound  significance.  It  signifies  the

120

“One-ness”  Who  is  Jesus  Christ  (AC  3960:3),  Jesus  being  the
Divine Love, and Christ the Divine Wisdom. These are not two but
One  (AC  3960:1). With  the  birth  of  Zebulun  in  the  glorification,
Jesus Christ on earth comes into a new and very special state. He
enters into the beginning of the Divine Marriage. From this Divine
Marriage within Himself comes the heavenly marriage in our inner
minds and the conjugial promise in our everyday lives. Since the
conjugial is the first source of all our happiness (CL 64), this birth
is a coming of the Prince of Peace. With the Lord in His glorifica-
tion, it is a new sense of Oneness with the Father, and a joy exceed-
ing all joys (AC 2034). It is an early stage of Divine union, and it
prophesies all the stages to follow.

“And afterwards she bare a daughter, and called her name
Dinah”  (Gen.  30:21).  Dinah  represents  a  new  affection  born  to
Jesus for all the general truths symbolized by the ten sons of Jacob
by  Leah  and  the  handmaids  (AC  3963).  Now,  finally,  the  way  is
prepared for a birth from the “heavenly marriage” between Jacob
and Rachel. A love for deep, interior truth can conjoin with good in
the natural consciousness of Jesus.

ADVANCED GLORIFICATION

OF THE NATURAL

JOSEPH BORN, JACOB ENRICHED
GENESIS 30 CONTINUED

Rachel finally conceives and has a son
named Joseph.

Jacob decides it is time to leave Laban, but Laban 
doesn’t want him to go because he has prospered 
with Jacob working for him. Jacob agrees to stay 
on longer if he is allowed to keep the speckled and 
spotted goats and black lambs from Laban’s herds.

Jacob shrewdly builds up large flocks of the 
healthiest goats and lambs.

“And God remembered Rachel, and God hearkened to her,
and opened her womb. And she conceived, and bare a son, and
said, ‘God has gathered my reproach.’ And she called his name
Joseph,  saying,  ‘Let  Jehovah  add  to  me  another  son’  ”  (Gen.
30:22-24). With Joseph’s birth a new era begins, a new stage in the
glorification and the coming of a new love in Jesus. Joseph’s birth
is like the morning star.

Joseph’s  life  story  in  Genesis  –  his  dreams,  his  betrayal,  his
exile in Egypt, and then his coming to great power – indicates his

122

ADVANCED GLORIFICATION OF THE NATURAL

high  representation.  Swedenborg’s  Writings  say  that  here  in
Genesis Joseph represents “the celestial-spiritual man” (AC 3969:
3). The  celestial  level  is  love,  and  its  inmost  is  love  of  the  Lord.
With the Lord Jesus Christ on earth, the birth of Joseph heralds the
coming completion of the glorification. For “Joseph” with Him is a
celestial  quality  in  His  inner  level.  That  is,  Jesus  Christ  on  earth
comes  into  a  love  of  His  Soul,  Jehovah,  that  He  has  not  before
experienced.

This new love leads Him to hunger for union with the Divine
Love that is behind all creation. It looks to the Easter resurrection,
to the complete Divine marriage, which brings into reality the glo-
rified  Lord  Jesus  Christ,  the  one  God  of  heaven  and  earth.  The
Father and Son will then truly be One.

So  far  Joseph  is  only  a  newborn  babe.  He  is  fragile  and
dependent  on  his  parents,  Jacob  and  Rachel. But  he  is  present
and heralds changes that are to come. The Genesis story still focus-
es on Jacob, his relationship to Laban, and finally on his return
to Canaan. This indicates that the glorification of the natural is still
the major theme. But in the process a new love has been born.

Now the love that the Lord always wanted, an unimpeded love
for Jehovah, has come to Him. He feels alive on both the spiritual
and natural levels, whereas the finite maternal heredity had blocked
the way before. This enables Him to be present with us as He never
has been before. Yet this is only the beginning of this miracle.

In  our  own  rebirth  process  Joseph’s  birth  is  also  a  miracle.
Joseph is the birth of a celestial love that leads to wise innocence
— a wisdom that is willing to be led by the Lord.

Joseph’s birth means much to Jesus. The Word speaks of this in

Jacob’s later blessing of this son:

“Joseph is the son of a fruitful one, the son of a fruitful one
by a fountain. . . .He shall abide in the strength of his bow; and
the arms of his hands shall be made strong by the hands of the

123

THE PATH, CHAPTER 19

Mighty One of Jacob; from there is the Shepherd, the Stone of
Israel,  by  the  God  of  your  father,  and  He  shall  help  you,  and
with Shaddai, and He shall bless you with blessings of heaven
above, with blessings of the deep that lies beneath, blessings of
the breasts and of the womb; the blessings of your father shall
prevail over the blessings of my progenitors even to the desire of
the everlasting hills; they shall be upon the head of Joseph. . .”
(Gen. 49:22-26).

Much of this Divine, poetic blessing is mysterious, but its affec-
tional  and  poetic  ring  is  clear:  Joseph  brings  wondrous  blessings
which reach to “the everlasting hills.” He is the Shepherd and the
Stone of Israel. 

“And it came to pass, when Rachel had borne Joseph, that
Jacob  said  unto  Laban,  ‘Send  me  away,  and  I  will  go  to  my
place, and to my land. Give me my females, and my children,
for  whom  I  have  served  you,  and  I  will  go;  for  you  know  my
service wherewith I have served you’ ” (Gen. 30: 25, 26).

As soon as Joseph is born, there is a very significant change of
state  in  the  Lord’s  glorification. A  celestial-spiritual  love  is  born
and inflows into the corresponding order in the natural level of the
mind.  This  love  is  a  powerful  combination  of  a  celestial  love  of
Jehovah with a spiritual love of all humankind. With this there is an
uplifting, a sense of exhilaration. This is just the beginning of this
influx, but it makes an immediate difference.

Therefore,  immediately  after  Joseph  was  born,  Jacob  said  to
Laban, “Send me away, and I will go to my place, and to my
land” (Gen. 30:25). Jacob, goodness of truth in the natural level,
now  wants  to  dissociate  from  the  mediate  good  represented  by
Laban. He begins to be uncomfortable in Laban’s presence. Higher
goods and truths have now come into the Lord’s natural level, and
the Jacob within desires to get away from the self-serving qualities
Laban now represents. Representations in the stories of the Word

124

ADVANCED GLORIFICATION OF THE NATURAL

change  within  general  parameters,  according  to  the  spiritual  con-
text, and Laban at this point represents the lower of evil qualities in
mediate good. In the context of a prior chapter Laban represented
remains, but remains with flaws attached to them.

Jacob longed to get back home to his parents, to Isaac and
Rebekah. “There was a longing of the natural represented by Jacob
for  a  state  of  conjunction  with  the  Divine  of  the  rational”  (AC
3973), represented by Isaac and Rebekah (Ibid.).

But  Laban  realized  how  much  he  had  been  blessed  by
Jacob’s  service,  how  much  he  had  been  enriched.  So  he  now
earnestly  requested  Jacob  to  stay,  and  asked  what  reward  he
could offer if he would stay. Jacob replied that he would stay if
he  were  permitted  to  pass  through  all  Laban’s  “flocks  today,
removing  from  them  every  small  cattle,  and  goats  that  are
speckled  and  spotted,  and  every  black  one  among  the  lambs,
and these shall be my reward” (Gen. 30:32). Laban agreed, and
Jacob proceeded to procure this reward. He also increased the
offspring of these selected types by a technique that stimulated
their procreation.

What is all this about in the internal sense? Certainly it would
not be a part of the Lord’s Word if it were only about Jacob’s flocks
being increased! But within, it speaks about a miracle of the Lord’s
government.  It  speaks  of  mediate  good,  and  of  the  way  that  by
means of goods that are lower and not genuine, the Lord can lead
us into goods and truths that are genuine. For example, merit is a
mediate  good.  With  little  children  and  young  adults,  a  sense  of
merit is needed and can lead in time to higher goods that are free
from merit. For a long time merit has innocence within it, and it is
permitted, in Providence, to be a stepping-stone leading to higher
goods.  Therefore,  this  merit  is  a  mixture  of  something  good  and
something wrong, just as the flocks that Jacob selected had on them
a mixture of darkness and light.

But  what  were  the  mediate  goods  with  the  Lord  Himself?

125

THE PATH, CHAPTER 19

Because  of  His  spiritual-celestial  endowment  at  birth  and  His
Divine  Soul,  His  mediate  goods  would  have  been  of  a  higher
nature. For instance, He fought against merit in temptations in very
early childhood and overcame merit in that state (see the AC treat-
ment of Gen. 14). Because of His Mary heredity there would have
been mediate good states in the Lord. He was not born regenerate.
The nature of the specific mediate goods with Jesus Christ on earth
is not revealed. We are told that these had “what is human” within
them (AC 4026). And it is revealed that in Him and by Him there
was an absolute separation of the goods signified by “Laban” from
the higher or pure goods (AC 4026).

FURTHER GLORIFICATION

JACOB SEPARATES FROM LABAN
GENESIS 31

Laban and his sons become openly jealous and angry 
with Jacob.

Jehovah appears to Jacob and tells him to return 
to Canaan. Jacob and his family flee from Laban 
with the possessions Jacob had earned.

Laban and his sons pursue Jacob and catch up with 
Jacob and his family.

Laban and Jacob argue over whether Jacob should be 
allowed to leave with Laban’s daughters and the
possessions Jacob has earned.

Jacob and Laban settle their dispute and make a 
covenant to stay out of each other’s territory.

Jacob  had  served  Laban  for  twenty  years,  fourteen  years
for  his  two  daughters  and  six  years  for  his  flocks.  He  found
Laban a harsh father-in-law. Although the farmstead had been
blessed  under  Jacob’s  leadership,  it  was  also  true  that  Jacob
had been greatly enriched himself. Laban’s sons saw this, and

127

THE PATH, CHAPTER 20

unfairly  criticized  Jacob:  “Jacob  has  taken  all  that  was  our
father’s, and from that which was our father’s has he made all
this abundance” (Gen. 31:1).

“And Jacob saw the faces of Laban, and behold, he was not
at all with him, as yesterday and the day before. And Jehovah
said unto Jacob, ‘Return unto the land of your fathers, and to
your nativity, and I will be with you’ ” (Gen. 31:2,3). “Faces”
represent interior qualities (AC 4066); the plural is used because
of  the  many  different  qualities  that  compose  mediate  good  or
Laban. Laban and Jacob had both changed in the years that Jacob
spent  in  Paddan-aram  Representatively,  Jacob  had  become  more
caring,  mellower,  and  less  personally  ambitious,  whereas  Laban
had gradually hardened and become more and more distant from
his son-in-law.

The  time  had  come  for  them  to  separate.  Mediate  good  is  a
means  to  an  end. The  end  is  the  establishment  of  genuine  goods
and truths in the natural mind. These are Jacob’s flocks and also
his wives and children. Since mediate good has selfishness at its
core, it must eventually be left behind; we can no longer operate
from  mixed  motives.  This  change  is  what  is  now  happening.
Jehovah Himself is calling Jacob to leave Laban and return to
the land of Canaan. This is reminiscent of Abram’s being called
in far earlier days to leave Haran and travel to the land of Canaan.
But Abram  was  to  establish  a  home  in  the  Holy  Land,  whereas
Jacob was returning home to the place of his “fathers, and to
(his). . .nativity” (Gen. 32:3).

Jacob  conferred  with  Leah  and  Rachel  about  his  call  to
return home and his desire to leave Laban, who had been such
a  cruel  taskmaster.  His  wives  agreed  with  him,  and  so  they
gathered  up  their  families  and  possessions  and  left  without
Laban’s  knowledge.  Also,  Rachel  stole  her  father’s  idols  or
teraphim (Gen. 31:9).

When news reached Laban that Jacob and his family had

128

FURTHER GLORIFICATION

departed,  Laban  gathered  his  men  and  pursued  in  anger.  He
felt that all of Jacob’s goods and family were his own, although
they were not. Laban might well have attacked Jacob and per-
haps even killed him, but “God came to Laban the Aramean in
a dream by night, and said unto him, ‘Take heed to yourself lest
you speak with Jacob from good even to evil’ ” (Gen. 31:24). It
was a warning from God to leave Jacob untouched.

Jacob and Laban met in the mountains of Gilead, and each
made harsh accusations against the other. After much arguing,
Laban finally came into a wholly different state, one of recon-
ciliation. Laban and Jacob made a covenant and separated in
peace (Gen. 31:48-55).

The Laban-Jacob story tells how the Lord “made His natural
Divine” (AC 4065). He used mediate goods as a means to procure
those things needed for the glorification of His natural. He did this
by “His own power” (Ibid.), unlike ourselves. We might think that
the  Lord  would  not  employ  mediate  goods.  But  the  Word
responds:  “The  Divine  Itself  has  need  of  none,  not  even  of  that
mediate good, except that He willed that all things should be done
according  to  order”  (Ibid.).  He  took  this  path  so  that  we  would
have a path to follow.

Jacob  was  told  by  Jehovah  to  “return  to  the  land  of  your
fathers”  (Gen.  31:3). This  verse  means  that  Jesus  (as  Jacob)
should  now  “betake  Himself  nearer  to  good  Divine”  (AC  4069).
Jacob  should  return  and  go  to  Isaac. The  glorification  of  the
Lord’s  natural  is  nearing  completion,  and  He  is  ready  to  become
one with Isaac, the Divine rational (AC 4069).

The Writings of Swedenborg teach much about our connection
with  people  in  the  spiritual  world. They  describe  how  our  spirits
actually travel from place to place in the spiritual world as we grow
and  change. With  each  new  development,  we  associate  ourselves
with a new “society” or group of spirits or angels.

Jesus  “summoned  to  Himself  such  [heavenly  societies]  as

129

THE PATH, CHAPTER 20

might be of service, and changed them at His good pleasure” (AC
4075). He did this in order that by means of them He might glorify
His natural and thus be able to redeem and save us. He in no way
harmed these societies but rather by means of them acquired Divine
goods and truths that would help everyone. At the same time, by
having this process involve so many societies, He put both heaven
and  hell  into  order  (Ibid.). We  may  forget  this  vital  aspect  of  the
Lord’s work on earth: part of His redeeming or rescuing us lay in
His  bringing  order  back  to  the  spiritual  world.  He  did  this  partly
through this process, but also more powerfully through temptations
and victories. He ordered the heavens, and subjugated and ordered
the hells. Thereby He redeemed us.

Jesus  Christ  on  earth,  living  in  Nazareth  as  a  young  man,  is
doing  work  of  eternal  importance  in  His  spirit.  Within  Himself,
having an overview of all things in creation, He successively draws
to  Himself  certain  spiritual  societies  in  an  intricate  and  beautiful
pattern, and by means of this He learns ever more interior things.
At the same time, He orders these societies in new ways, removing
evils  that  obstruct,  ordering  goods  where  needed.  He  is  the
Redeemer. This Man, while in His body in Nazareth, is the Divine
rescuer.  He  is  ordering  and  healing  spiritual  societies,  and  at  the
same time glorifying His own natural. This is possible because of
His Soul and His endowments.

He sees what merit is like from societies who take merit, and
then  leads  Himself  to  see  the  goodness  of  taking  no  merit  at  all,
which is a state from the Divine (AC 4065).

He sees societies of spirits who love to reason about goods and
truths,  and  who  think  themselves  very  wise.  Studying  these  soci-
eties, He perceives that they are in mental shade, and that without
Divine mercy regarding their states they will spiritually perish (AC
4075: 2). He observes societies that say they are in love to God, but
look only to the vast Infinite and worship an invisible God. He sees
that unless they have some finite concept of God they will be “look-

130

FURTHER GLORIFICATION

ing  into  thick  darkness”  only  (AC  4075:3)  and  will  have  only
strange and false fancies. He sees the terribly limited nature of their
ideas and realizes their need to have a visible Divine Human to see
and worship.

All these things He learns as He processes these spiritual soci-
eties. He gains knowledge by means of them, but not directly from
them. He learns by means of His own Laban states, but receives no
qualities  from them.  Rather,  the  states  that  become  His  own  are
Divine.

The Lord in His glorification now turns to a new goal. This is
pictured  in  Jacob’s  leaving  Paddan-aram,  “to  go  to  Isaac  his
father in the land of Canaan” (Gen. 31:18). As His natural is glo-
rified, the Lord looks to uniting His natural level with His Divine
rational, which is Isaac. He looks to becoming integrated, Divine
on both planes, and alive in a way that He has not been before: alive
as the only true Human, One with His Soul. But still He needs to
take steps before His natural is ready for such advanced glorifica-
tion. Jacob has to cross into the borderlands of Canaan, meet an
angel there, and then be reconciled with Esau, whom he fears.
A major step in this direction of reuniting with Isaac comes
when  Jacob  and  his  family  and  flocks  crosses  over  the
Euphrates,  which  is  the  extreme  boundary  of  the  land  of
Canaan  in  its  widest  sense. Crossing  this  boundary  is  a  coming
into  a  “conjunction.  .  .  with  the  Divine”  (AC  4116).  It  is  not  the
complete conjunction and integration, but a vital step in this direc-
tion, and a step away from Laban’s homeland.

THE LORD’S TEMPTATIONS IN
GLORIFYING HIS NATURAL

COMING HOME
GENESIS 32

On his way back to Cannan Jacob sends out 
messengers to Esau, his brother. The messengers 
return, saying Esau is coming toward him with 
four hundred men.

Jacob is afraid and separates his family into groups to 
allow for an escape if Esau attacks.

During the night Jacob wrestles with an angel 
and prevails. Jacob is then renamed Israel by God.

After twenty years away from his parents and his homeland
of Canaan, Jacob now journeyed toward a reunion. For him the
most  feared  aspect  of  this  return  was  his  meeting  with  Esau.
Before  leaving  Canaan  many  years  earlier,  Jacob  had  twice
betrayed  his  older  brother.  Esau  had  sworn  revenge  at  that
time;  in  fact  he  had  intended  to  kill  Jacob.  Jacob’s  fear  on
returning seemed justified. But twenty years had gone by, and
in such a long time many changes occur.

After Jacob and his family separated from Laban and went
on  their  way,  the  Word  says,  “the  angels  of  God  ran  to  meet

132

THE LORD’S TEMPTATIONS IN GLORIFYING HIS NATURAL

him” (Gen. 32:1). Again, the angels! First in his dream of the lad-
der at Bethel and now, two decades later, as Jacob came near home.
The “angels” are enlightenment coming in from goodness, prepar-
ing us for the meeting with Esau, preparing Jacob within us to meet
the older brother. It is a readying for truth to come to inner good and
to discover that goodness is the ruler of the heart. If we have been
living the truth in many, many states, this upcoming change fright-
ens us. It will alter our patterns. We will lose our former moorings.
We are afraid we will lose everything, emotionally and spiritually.
So the Lord sends His angels to give us inner warmth and light and
to guide us home.

The  Lord  brings  about  this  change  in  us  with  Divine  wisdom
and gentleness. He has established on His own plane on earth the
same process (AC 4234). The Isaac level of the Lord has been glo-
rified. But the natural level, represented by Jacob and Esau, is only
in the process of glorification. On this plane there had been strong
tendencies to evil through the finite human nature inherited through
Mary. Jesus Christ started out with Jacob leading the way: He com-
pelled His hereditary natural to obey Divine truth. He is now ready
to go on His way to Esau: to experience a reunion with Esau that
brings Divinity to His very natural (AC 4234). When Jesus comes
to  love  the  principles  of  Divine  Truth  in  His  natural-level  con-
sciousness, self-compulsion is no longer necessary. True principles
meet with love and delight, and then living them is pure joy.

These changes within the Lord will have direct impact on our
natural emotions and ideals, on our ordinary thoughts and day-to-
day life.

When Jacob and Esau are united in Jesus Christ and His natural
is glorified, He comes to us in a new way. It is like the returning of
someone  we  love  deeply  who  has  been  far  away  but  now  comes
home, enters our door, and takes us into his arms. By coming home
he gives us a warmth and light we would never know without him
(TCR 109). One of Jesus’ greatest gifts is that He glorifies His nat-

133

THE PATH, CHAPTER 21

ural level, and that He puts Esau or Divine good first, with Jacob
becoming  as  one  who  serves.  Good  comes  first  with  Him  —  the
strong and wonderful good of the love of others, and this in His very
Natural (TCR 43). We pray that someday it may be so with us.

The process by which truth acknowledges good to be superior,
to be the heart of life, is seen in harmonious detail in the coming
together of Jacob and Esau. Jacob sent messengers ahead to Esau
and said to them, “Thus shall you say to my lord Esau” (Gen.
32:4), and through them Jacob relays to Esau his experience in
Haran. The words “My lord Esau” signify “the first acknowledg-
ment of good as being in the higher place” (AC 4242). Jacob did
not call Esau his brother, but his “lord,” and also later he calls him-
self Esau’s “servant” (Ibid.). This is drawing near the “inversion”
(AC 4243) in which good will come to lead the way. This is what
was hoped for in the beginning, and now, after successive steps of
rebirth, it is actually happening.

When they had talked with Esau and returned, the messen-
gers  of  Jacob  said,  “We  came  to  your  brother,  to  Esau,  and
moreover  he  comes  to  meet  you,  and  four  hundred  men  with
him” (Gen. 32:6). Good is now coming to the truth within Jesus.
This good brings “four hundred men” with it! This struck fear into
Jacob.  His  brother  was  coming,  and  Jacob  feared  it  was  to  take
vengeance for his misdeeds twenty years earlier. Jacob’s outward
fear speaks spiritually of an inward anxiety that comes with temp-
tation. “Four hundred” represents temptation.

Jesus  on  earth,  while  in  Nazareth,  goes  through  these  inner
clouds and storms. “And Jacob remained alone, and there wres-
tled a man with him until the dawn arose.” Here it is the Lord’s
temptation in glorifying His natural that is the subject. He under-
goes a most grievous temptation, so grievous that He wrestles not
only  with  the  hells,  but  also  with  the  angels:  “That  the  Lord  in
temptation at last fought with the angels themselves, no, with the
whole angelic heaven, is a secret that has not yet been disclosed”

134

THE LORD’S TEMPTATIONS IN GLORIFYING HIS NATURAL

(AC 4295:2).

When the hells attack Jesus through the maternal human, the
issue is saving humankind. They focus on how evil humankind is,
and instill despair over His purpose of saving us. This is a power-
ful  trial,  for  the  hells  have  much  of  lower  realities  on  their  side.
They  try  to  deflect  the  Lord  from  the  higher  reality  that  many
human beings choose heaven in freedom!

But how do the angels tempt Him? Angels are the most loving
and  caring  people  in  all  creation.  Why  would  the  Lord  combat
them? It is vital to see that He would never have had to fight against
the  genuine  wisdom  and  love  within  them.  These  only  want  to
serve the Lord and others. Ordinarily, the angels are in elevated or
morning and noon states of mind, when their love for the Lord and
others is full of joy and life.

But in twilight states of mind, their hereditary evils are nearer.
At the time of the Lord’s life on earth and His temptations, the spir-
itual world had great disorders, such as imaginary heavens, ruled
by evil genii. Devils had infiltrated the borders of heaven itself, and
disorder  and  confusion  existed  there  from  such  an  evil  presence.
When the Lord endures temptations from the angels and conquers
their illusions, He brings the heavens back into order. He restores
the heavens to the full beauty of the human form, or Grand Man.
Before  this,  the  heavens  are  strongly  disturbed. Terrible  fears  for
the salvation of human beings on earth overwhelm them.

The angels love the Lord deeply, with all their “hearts, souls,
minds and strength” (Mark 12:30). Do they not want to relieve the
Lord of His almost unbearable torment? Wouldn’t they perceive the
part-truth that the hells were insinuating into Him: that humankind
is  too  evil  to  be  saved?  Given  these  things,  perhaps  the  angels
focused on the Lord’s chief end: to save us. They perceived how in
myriad cases this seems almost impossible.

The angels then, in a state of obscurity, try to instill in Jesus an
immediate apparent need: to force humankind into goodness. The

135

THE PATH, CHAPTER 21

most powerful evil, the love of dominion, would work through the
angels’ low states and urge the Lord to “command that these stones
become bread” (Matt. 4:3). The angels would urge this innocently,
out of misguided love, and in agonized obscurity.

If  this  is  the  case,  angels  have  temporarily  lost  faith  in
humankind. They are wrong. Nothing is more precious than leav-
ing human beings in final freedom to choose heaven or hell with no
over-ruling compulsion. That it is the angels who tempt Him is ter-
ribly hard for Jesus, Who is love itself.

Jesus Christ must at times feel quite alone except for the beau-
ty of His Divine Soul, which in temptation seems remote. Yet He
does  not  yield  to  the  angels.  He  endures  a  terrible  torment  and
struggles even to near despair. But then love triumphs; He wrestles
and wins. He does this in order to preserve that very essential of our
humanity: our spiritual freedom.

The Lord leads the angels back to basic truths and goods, and
then restores the heavens to true order. The temptations from them
cease.  The  “sun  arose  to  Jacob”  (Gen.  32:31).  Jacob  and  the
angel ceased wrestling. Peace came, and a blessing.

The  angel  changed  Jacob’s  name  to  “Israel” —  the  angel
who now represents the Divine inflowing. This new name marks
a major change in Jacob’s life. Names signify qualities, and after
the victory in this temptation, Jesus in His natural comes into a new
quality (AC 4286). Now celestial good inflows through truth into
the natural level of the Lord as it had not done before. He therefore
has a new name: “Israel.” This is celestial love come into His nat-
ural life.

Each  major  temptation  of  Jesus  Christ,  as  revealed  in  the
Arcana,  focuses  on  His  love  for  the  salvation  of  humankind.  In
childhood  He  fights  and  conquers  those  hells  that  stand  between

al is the vital tool in saving us. Now, in wrestling and overcoming
the angel, Israel is established. The Divine natural is firmly in place
and  needs  only  a  few  further  steps  for  its  complete  glorification.
This Divine natural makes our regeneration possible.

This  change  in  the  Lord  opens  the  way  for  His  reunion  with
Esau, the Divine good in His natural, which is eternally optimistic
about humankind, and in this is Divinely realistic.

As Esau and Jacob meet, and Esau becomes the leader, so the
Lord leads us to a realization that the whole purpose in the rebirth
of the natural in Himself — and in us — is that Divine good may
come  into  the  human  heart.  He  is  our  Father, Who  took  the  path
first,  and  now  tenderly  and  lovingly  invites  us  to  follow  Him,  to
take the journey to heaven, even while He holds our hand.

GLORIFICATION OF THE NATURAL

NEARS COMPLETION

THE RECONCILIATION OF JACOB AND ESAU
GENESIS 33

Jacob fearfully approaches Esau, but Esau runs to 
embrace him and they are happily reunited.

Jacob convinces Esau to return to where he came 
from, and Jacob and his family travel slowly to 
Succoth and buy land there.

“And Jacob lifted up his eyes, and saw, and behold, Esau
came, and with him four hundred men. And Jacob divided the
children over unto Leah, and over unto Rachel, and over unto
the two handmaids. And he put the handmaids and their chil-
dren  first,  and  Leah  and  her  children  after,  and  Rachel  and
Joseph  after.  And  he  himself  passed  over  before  them,  and
bowed  himself  to  the  earth  seven  times,  until  he  drew  near
unto  his  brother. And  Esau  ran  to  meet  him,  and  embraced
him,  and  fell  upon  his  neck,  and  kissed  him,  and  they  wept”
(Gen. 33:1-4).

At  last  the  twin  brothers  were  reunited.  Jacob  had
approached  Esau  with  fear.  Esau  had  come  to  him  with  four
hundred  warriors.  But  there  was  no  anger,  no  confrontation.

138

GLORIFICATION OF THE NATURAL NEARS COMPLETION

Instead, Esau ran to Jacob and embraced him with great love.
The two wept together, not in sorrow but in relief and joy.

This  marks  another  new  state  in  the  Lord’s  glorification  on
earth. Divine good can now at last rule in the natural with the full-
ness  of  love.  Where  before  there  had  been  self-compulsion  and
temptation, Divine love has now come to bring glorification. Jesus
is still in Nazareth, a young adult in appearance, doing the work of
a carpenter. But within He is the Divine carpenter of glorification
and rebirth.

This stage of the glorification of the natural level of the Lord is
the  key  to  our  own  rebirth. Temptations  and  victories  effect  such
rebirth  with  us.  The  reunion  of  Esau  and  Jacob  came  only  by
Jacob’s  undergoing  fear  and  anxiety  and  at  last  coming  into  sub-
mission  and  genuine  humility  (see AC  4341:2). The  limited  truth
with  us  becomes  anxious  when  good  itself  approaches,  and  it
undergoes temptations and profound revisions. These in turn lead
to reconciliation, reunion, and release. The goal of Esau as leader is
achieved,  not  with  bitterness  or  outward  friction,  but  with  love
from the very heart. On this natural plane we are free.

With Jesus, this reunion is the reunion of Divine good and truth,
and His joy relates not only to Himself, but also and especially to
the  meaning  of  this  union  in  Himself  for  humankind.  He  knows
what it will mean to us. At last we are able to be in a harmony with
Him, and by our free choice. This reunion brings the Lord surpass-
ing joy, for it is a fulfillment of His love.

When Jacob was reconciled with Esau, he said, “I have seen
your faces like seeing the faces of God, and you have accepted
me”  (Gen.  33:10). This  is  the  truth  in  our  natural  level  seeing
goodness at last, goodness like “the faces of God.” When this real-
ly  happens  to  us,  when  we  see  it  in  our  natural  lives,  it  stirs  the
affections and brings an inner love of others, a love made real by
performing useful services, especially spiritual services, for others.
This  state  of  experiencing  love  of  others  in  our  natural  level

139

THE PATH, CHAPTER 22

deepens  step  by  step.  The  full  uniting  of  Jacob  and  Esau,  on  the
spiritual plane, is successive, stage by stage (see AC 4375 et al). In
each  increasing  stage  of  closeness  we  experience  greater  delight,
usefulness, and creativity.

Jacob  now  traveled  on  with  his  family  and  possessions  to
Shalem,  a  city  of  Shechem.  Shalem  “means  tranquility  and  per-
fection”  (AC  4393).  This  is  so  with  the  Lord  on  earth.  With  the
union of Good and Truth in Him, as it progresses step by step, there
comes increasing tranquility. After a few more stages, the natural
with Him is glorified. In this, with Him, is “perfection.”

Here in Shalem Jacob raised an altar to worship Jehovah,
to  thank  Him  for  his  safe  return  home  and  his  reunion  with
Esau. He called the altar “El Elohe Israel,” which means “God
of gods” (AC 4402:4). Jesus Christ has now come to a stage in His
glorification  where  Divine  truths  joined  with  Divine  goods  have
become a part of Himself in His natural. In the Isaiah prophecy, this
indicates an attainment of the next successive stage of the glorifi-
cation: “And His name will be called Wonderful, Counselor, God,
Hero” (Isaiah 9:6, emphasis added). He has not become “God ” on
this  plane  without  also  being  a  “Hero,”  that  is,  a  victor  in  most
grievous temptations.

Ahead are increasing heights of glorification and even greater
struggles  against  the  hells.  Beyond  those  He  will  become  “the
Father  of  Eternity,  and  the  Prince  of  Peace”  (Isaiah  9:6).  He  will
achieve this as He turns to the glorification of His sensuous level
and finally of His very body.

THE FALLEN SENSUOUS

THE LOST DREAM
GENESIS 34

Shechem, a prince of the country, rapes Jacob’s 
daughter Dinah.

Yet Shechem loves Dinah, and his father asks 
Jacob and her brothers if Shechem may marry her.

Dinah’s brothers say they will allow the marriage 
if the males of the land will be circumcised. In 
reality, they have no intention of allowing it at all.

Shechem and his father consent, and when they are 
recovering from the circumcisions, Simeon and Levi,
Dinah’s brothers, kill them, and all the sons plunder 
the city.

Jacob rebukes Simeon and Levi.

Chapter  34  in  the  Genesis  narrative  tells  of  the  rape  of
Dinah by Shechem and the dreadful revenge of her brothers.
This is the sad story of a forced sexual union followed by an
extreme  and  evil  revenge. What  has  this  to  do  with  the  Lord’s
glorification?  Why  is  it  placed  spiritually  or  representatively  in

141

THE PATH, CHAPTER 23

the context of late stages of the glorification of the Lord’s natu-
ral?

This  story  appears  where  it  does  because  this  is  where  it
belongs. It tells of evils that may possibly overwhelm the sensuous,
that  is,  the  level  of  the  senses  in  human  beings.  Coming  soon  is
Jesus’  confrontation  of  these  sensuous  evils  and  His  battle  with
them in His glorification process.

People  who  had  descended  from  the  members  of  the  Most
Ancient Church, the first church on earth with the earliest peoples
on earth, still existed in the land of Canaan at the time of Jacob and
his  children,  “especially  among  those  called  the  Hittites  and
Hivites” (AC 4447:2,3). What kind of a people were they? It may
be  said  that  Hamor  and  Shechem  were  of  the  last  peoples  of  a
Golden Age, and that in a sense this chapter re-enacts the fall of that
Golden Age and repeats it perhaps for the final time.

But  it  was  Shechem  who  forced  Dinah.  From  his  point  of
view this union turned out to be more than only sexual, for he
genuinely wanted her in marriage. This desire of Shechem to join
with Dinah represents the Hivites’ desire to join with Jacob’s clan.
The outer rites that Jacob and his family practiced were familiar to
the Hivites. These rites represented deeper principles that ancient
religions, ancestors of the Hivites, had lived by. Thus Shechem and
his tribe were drawn to Dinah and her family (AC 4449). Hamor,
Shechem’s  father,  endeavored  to  arrange  a  marriage.  To
achieve  this  goal,  Hamor  and  Shechem  agreed  to  be  circum-
cised in order to be acceptable to the Jews. In speaking of their
agreeing  to  circumcision,  the  Lord  reveals  in  Swedenborg’s
Writings  that  “Hamor  and  Shechem  his  son  committed  an  enor-
mous sin in receiving circumcision” (AC 4489:4e).

This  was  because,  as  people  of  the  Most  Ancient  Church,
Hamor and Shechem were internal in nature (AC 4489:3). But cir-
cumcision is an external rite, symbolic for the representative of a
church,  the  Israelitish  Church,  which  rejected  internal  things.  In

142

THE FALLEN SENSUOUS

accepting  circumcision,  Hamor  and  Shechem  and  their  followers
turned away from celestial things to empty externals, from a celes-
tial innocence to a sensuous act.

The sons of Jacob had no desire to join with deeper principles
of religion. They were content with mere external rites. Therefore,
the only way that the Hivites could join their ancient religion with
this new one would be by forcing the union (AC 4433), and this is
represented by the fact that Shechem forced himself on Dinah.

A  marriage  between  Shechem  and  Dinah  would  have  been  a
good union, representing a union between external rites and deeper
religious principles of the heart and mind. This could have re-estab-
lished  the  wisdom  of  the Ancient  Church  with  the  sons  of  Jacob
(AC  4439). Yet  no  union  can  become  real  if  it  is  forced. Though
Shechem’s  desire  was  a  good  one,  his  method  was  very  wrong.
There could be no union here, because the children of Jacob did not
want one.

Here the fall of the Most Ancient Church is re-enacted in a near-
ly final incident in the history of this Hivite clan, for it led to their
complete  extermination  by  the  murderous  swords  of  Simeon  and
Levi. Externally we find much that is brutal and coarse in this story.
Internally  it  speaks  of  gentle  and  innocent  love  being  lost. When
innocence is truly lost, its loss is sad beyond anything else that can
happen.

Because  of  their  fall  from  innocence,  the  Lord  permitted  the
Hivites in this Hamor/Shechem clan to be entirely destroyed, killed
by the sons of Jacob. For once they had fallen so drastically, their
children  would  not  have  been  salvable  (AC  4493:5,6).  The  Lord
always provides for our salvation or our freedom to be saved.

This remnant of the Most Ancient Church turned to the sensu-
ous plane and sensuous evil. Here they were met and slain by an
entirely  sensuous  people. With  the  Israelitish/Jewish  Church,  and
indeed with the Christian and New Churches, there is from heredi-
ty a strong tendency toward evil in our sensuous level. In fact, ten-

143

THE PATH, CHAPTER 23

dencies to evil are present in the hereditary will on every plane, but
especially in the sensuous. The Lord came on earth to confront this
fallen condition and to show us the path to freedom and a return to
true ideals.

In  Genesis  3:15,  the  Lord  God  said:  “And  I  will  put  enmity
between you [the serpent] and the woman, and between your seed
and her seed; He shall bruise your head, and you shall bruise His
heel.”

“He” is the Lord, come on earth. It is His heel, His sensuous,
that  is  bruised  by  the  serpent.  But  He  conquers  that  serpent,  and
rises glorified on Easter.

The supreme sense of this story teaches of the Lord’s clear sight
of  the  sensuous  evils  active  in  His  finite  heredity  through  Mary.
What might this sad story be describing about Jesus’ inner process?
Jesus  has  just  now  completed  the  process  of  making  His  natural-
level consciousness Divine. The final level to face is the sensuous
level, the most corrupted level of humankind.

And yet, ideally, the level of the senses should provide a beau-
tiful link to the deepest, holiest parts of the soul. We see this pic-
tured  in  infancy  when  a  baby  experiences  all  love  and  discovery
directly through the senses.

When Jesus focuses His consciousness onto the level of human
sensuality, He knows from within Him the beautiful links that are
possible to join the senses with Divinity. Might He, in His finite and
not  yet  glorified  state  of  mind,  be  tempted  to  force  the  union
between Divinity and human sensual experience, just as Shechem
forced Dinah? We are shown in Luke 4:3 that Jesus was vulnerable
to  this  kind  of  temptation,  when  the  devil  tempted  Him  in  the
wilderness  to  “Command  this  stone  to  become  bread”;  in  other
words, to “force people to be what you want them to be.” And yet,
though Jesus can be tempted in this way because of His great desire
for our happiness, He does not give in. His Divine Soul knows well
that to force anything upon human beings would be to remove their

144

THE FALLEN SENSUOUS

freedom and thus their very humanity. His human essence (the spir-
itual-celestial within Him) knows compulsion cannot lead to a true
union. It is an appearance flowing in through His maternal human
that tempts Him here.

Sadly,  there  is  a  shocking  realization  in  store  for  Jesus  in  the
human  sensuous  level,  which  He  experiences  through  the  finite
maternal  heredity  He  has  received.  In  the  human  sensuous  level,
there  is  violent  opposition  and  hatred  toward  any  deeper  kind  of
love and truth. Here there exists a hellish desire to reject, corrupt,
and destroy celestial and spiritual matters, just as the sons of Jacob
wickedly  tricked,  plundered,  and  destroyed  this  nation  of  the
Hivites.

Seeing this causes Him deepest sadness, as when on earth He
weeps when He regards Jerusalem and its fallen state. This sadness
is reflected in Genesis by Jacob’s grief after his sons had com-
mitted this horrible slaughter: “Ye have troubled me, to make
me to stink to the inhabitants of the land. . .” (Gen.  34:30). His
heredity through Mary embodies the hereditary fall of humankind.
Seeing the evils within the sensuous, Jesus determines to face the
glorification of this level within Himself out of love for us.

FULL GLORIFICATION OF THE NATURAL

BETHEL, BENJAMIN, AND ESAU’S GENEALOGY
GENESIS 35 AND 36

God appears to Jacob and tells him to go to Bethel. 
Jacob does so, and builds there an altar to God.

God blesses Jacob and again names him Israel.

Jacob and his family leave Bethel for Ephrath.

During the journey Rachel has hard labor, giving 
birth to Benjamin before she dies.

They arrive at Hebron where Jacob’s father Isaac, 
lives. Isaac is very old, and he dies.

Esau’s genealogy is given in Genesis 36.

Bethel was a sacred place to Jacob: here he had the dream
of  the  ladder  with  angels  ascending  and  descending  and  the
Lord  standing  above  it.  Now,  decades  later,  “God  said  unto
Jacob, ‘Arise, go up to Bethel, and abide there; and make there
an altar unto God who appeared unto you when you fled from
before Esau your brother’ ” (Gen. 35:1). Reflected here is the cir-
cle of life in which one starts from a spiritual base, travels through
a thousand states and changes, and in the end returns to that start-

146

FULL GLORIFICATION OF THE NATURAL

ing place, now as an entirely different person.

Jacob  asked  his  household  and  all  that  were  with  him  to
“put  away  the  gods  of  the  stranger  which  are  in  the  midst  of
you, and purify yourselves” (Gen. 35:2). This they did, and then
journeyed onward.

“. . .and a terror of God was upon the cities that were round
about  them,  and  they  did  not  pursue  the  sons  of  Jacob.  And
Jacob came to Luz, which is in the land of Canaan, this is Bethel.
. . .And he built there an altar. . . .And God was seen by Jacob
again when he came from Paddan-aram, and God blessed him.
And God said unto him, ‘Your name is Jacob; your name shall
no more be called Jacob, but Israel shall be your name’; and He
called his name Israel” (Gen. 35:2-10 selections).

Once before, after wrestling with the angel, Jacob was named
Israel.  This  second  naming,  now  by  God,  is  an  affirmation,  and
spiritually it is confirmation of a new state. With Jesus, this is an
entry into the Divine Love itself in the natural plane of life.

Jacob’s  family  journeyed  from  Bethel  towards  Ephrath,
which  is  Bethlehem.  Rachel  then  began  labor  with  her  final
child,  and  she  “suffered  hard  things  in  her  bringing  forth”
(Gen. 35:16). “The midwife said unto her, ‘Fear not, for this is
also  to  you  a  son.’ And  it  came  to  pass  as  her  soul  was  going
forth  that  she  was  about  to  die;  and  she  called  his  name
‘Benoni’;  and  his  father  called  him  ‘Benjamin.’  And  Rachel
died, and was buried in the way to Ephrath; this is Bethlehem”
(Gen. 35:16-18, selections).

In  the  story  Rachel’s  death  is  a  tragedy.  She  was  the  most
important person in Jacob’s life, the one he loved deeply. However,
Benjamin’s birth is representatively a warm and beautiful thing. In
the spiritual sense, Rachel’s death and Benjamin’s birth represent
new and beautiful states. The birth of Benjamin signifies a break-

147

THE PATH, CHAPTER 24

through  in  the  Lord’s  glorification  in  which  He  gains  insights  of
truth which enable Him to enter a new and higher state. So with us:
if only Benjamin can be born in our hearts, we find interior life and
heavenly creativity. Benjamin is the medium, the step upward, to a
higher heaven!

Benjamin  was  born  near  Ephrath,  the  earliest  name  for
Bethlehem itself. That he was born here is no accident. Here also
King David and the Lord Himself were born. For Bethlehem, like
Benjamin, represents a miraculous stage of rebirth. For us it is the
place where the Lord comes to us, where He is born as an infant in
our hearts.

The qualities represented by Bethlehem and Benjamin have to
do with the inner heavens, with angels who are sensitive and gen-
tle  and  innocent.  The  Lord  Himself  achieves  these  qualities  in  a
Divine way. The residue in His natural that has not been glorified
is now becoming Divine. Benjamin’s birth represents a progression
with  Jesus  that  is  more  interior  and  reaches  up  into  His  rational
level where a new glory is born (AC 4536; 4585:2).

In  the  Lord’s  glorification,  “Jacob”  becomes  “Israel.”  The
Divine truth that He took to Himself (Jacob) becomes, after many
states,  the  Divine  Good  (Israel).  To  Him,  in  His  glorification,
Rachel dies, and Benjamin is born. We can comprehend what these
things mean only in a limited way. In us, Jacob’s becoming Israel,
and Rachel’s death and Benjamin’s birth near Bethlehem, speak of
a gradual entering into gentleness and innocence and new warmth
of love. These states come to us only from the angels and finally
only from the Lord, and they promise closeness in our marriage and
nearness to the Lord that we do not yet know. The residue on our
natural  level  is  reborn,  and  a  miraculous  new  insight  of  truth
(Benjamin) is born.

Bethlehem and Benjamin symbolize a step beyond the regener-
ation  of  the  natural  level.    Benjamin  brings  sparkling  truth  to  us.
This  truth  is  “new”  in  the  sense  that  we  see  it  with  a  clarity  and

148

FULL GLORIFICATION OF THE NATURAL

insight we have never experienced before. It is seen in this new way
because this truth comes from a higher, inmost good. Here then is
a breakthrough — it leads to being an angel of the middle heaven,
close to the Lord.

The states represented by Joseph and Benjamin come through
the process of rebirth, and they come by the Lord’s gift to us of vic-
tory in temptations. Rachel’s giving birth to Benjamin, and suffer-
ing hard things in this birth, represent such temptations (AC 4586).
The Lord is within this hard state, protecting and moderating.

Israel  journeys  now  towards  Hebron,  where  Isaac,  his
father,  dwells. Prior  to  meeting  Isaac,  Israel’s  twelve  sons  are
named again. But they are listed in an order different from that of
their births, signifying a different subordination and ordering in the
human  mind,  and,  more  importantly,  in  Jesus’  mind. The  natural
level  has now  been  glorified and  is  preparing  for  unification  and
integration  with  the  Divine  rational  level,  with  Isaac.  In  the
progress of glorification and rebirth, Jacob’s ladder is continually
activated: with Jesus Christ and in human rebirth, there is ascend-
ing and descending.

“Jacob came unto Isaac his father in Mamre Kiriatharba;
this is Hebron, where Abraham and Isaac sojourned. And the
days  of  Isaac  were  a  hundred  years  and  eighty  years.  And
Isaac expired and died, and was gathered unto his people, old
and sated of days; and Esau and Jacob his sons buried him”
(Gen. 35:27).

The  natural  level  of  the  Lord’s  mind  is  a  receptacle  for  His
rational.    Now  both  are  Divine,  and  with  this  comes  a  profound
integration,  a  coming  into  One.  Both  are  One,  Jehovah,  the  Lord
Jesus Christ. In this integration, Isaac — the rational as a separate
entity — dies, old and sated of days. His two sons bury his body
lovingly.

Spiritually, as with Rachel, this death is not a tragedy. Rather, it
represents  new  life  (AC  4618).  Here  then  is  an  integration  of

149

THE PATH, CHAPTER 24

tremendous impact. With Jesus Christ now comes an ascent from
the  glorified  natural  to  the  glorified  rational,  and  an  integration.
Then  He  comes  to  these  levels  in  us  anew,  with  a  power  never
before present (AC 4603). For this the angels sang. Yet there is still
a  level  of  glorification  to  be  accomplished,  that  of  His  sensuous
level, and His body.

The Arcana treatment of Genesis 36 is one of the shortest chap-
ters  in  the  whole  work. This  brevity  is  not  due  to  lack  of  Divine
content. Rather, it is because the subject, the glorification, is almost
too profound for human comprehension. Literally the subject is a
full  genealogy  of  the  descendants  of  Esau  who  moved  to  the
country of Edom.

Esau  in  Edom  represents  the  Divine  good  inflowing  from  the
infinite Jehovah to be conjoined with the good in the natural repre-
sented by Jacob/Israel. It is a coming together of Divinity and glo-
rified Humanity in Jesus Christ on earth, in His natural.  Think of
the incredible power of Infinite good coming down to become One
with glorified good in Jesus Christ!

Esau stands now for that unique inner plane of Divine good in
Jesus Christ that came from God. Jacob/Israel is the Divine good
that by glorification replaces the hereditary evil in the Lord’s finite
human through Mary. These two become One (AC 4641). Divinity
meets Humanity. This completes the glorification of the natural. It
paves  the  way  for  a  whole  new  subject:  Joseph  and  his  life  from
seventeen years old and onward.

The  whole  order  of  the  Lord’s  Divinely  good  natural  level  is
described  by  the  descendants  of  Esau  listed  in  Genesis  36.  Even
though our finite minds understand little within this genealogy, it is
useful to read it, for if we read in a state of worship, an inflowing
sphere of love from the Lord benefits both the angels and us.

It is the same with the genealogies of the Lord Jesus Christ in
the New Testament: when people on earth read these in a state of
worship and humility, angels are deeply moved. Something of the

150

FULL GLORIFICATION OF THE NATURAL

highest internal senses affects them with a flame of love. We may
perceive the spiritual meanings only “as faint outlines” (AC 4644),
but these can affect us. We can know from the treatment of Genesis
36  in  the  Arcana that  now  Divinity  and  Humanity  in  the  Lord’s
natural are one. Because of this, our own limited natural levels can
be reborn.

OVERVIEW OF THE GLORIFICATION

OF THE SENSUOUS

JOSEPH: HIS DREAMS AND BETRAYAL
GENESIS 37

Jacob gives a coat of many colors to his son 
Joseph. 

Joseph dreams symbolic dreams that his family will 
bow down to him.

Later, Joseph’s brothers betray him and sell him into 
slavery. They cause their father to believe that 
Joseph is dead.

Joseph’s  life  story  contains  both  an  innocence  and  a  promise
that no other patriarch’s story conveys. Joseph’s dreams, his betray-
al  by  his  brothers,  his  exile  to  Egypt,  and  his  miraculous  rise  to
authority there, have a quality of wonder. One senses a symbolism
in his life story. The book of Daniel also has this same enchanted
sphere. Daniel’s rise to power, his interpretations of dreams, and his
miraculous  escape  from  death  also  seem  to  suggest  hidden  mes-
sages. Spiritually, Joseph represents the Lord and our coming into
love of Him.

Joseph’s life completes the series of the four patriarchs. It also
brings  to  an  end  the  book  of  Genesis. Abraham’s  life,  spiritually

152

OVERVIEW OF THE GLORIFICATION OF THE SENSUOUS

viewed, depicts the Lord’s childhood. Isaac’s life depicts the com-
ing of the Divine rational to the Lord. Jacob, later renamed Israel,
is the Divine natural. Joseph completes the series. His life depicts
the  coming  of  glorification  to  the  sensuous  level,  and  even  the
body, of the Lord Jesus Christ on earth (AC 4675, 5078, 4670).

After  Joseph’s  brothers  betrayed  him  and  sold  him  into
Egypt, they took his coat and dipped it in the blood of a goat
they had killed. They brought this blood-stained coat of many
colors to Jacob their father, and said: “ ‘This we have found;
know  now  whether  it  be  your  son’s  tunic  or  not?’ And  Jacob
knew it, and said, ‘It is my son’s tunic; an evil wild beast has
devoured him; Joseph is torn in pieces’ ” (Gen. 37:32,33). Jacob
was  devastated;  his  beloved  son  was  dead.  Joseph’s  brothers
also began in time to believe that Joseph was dead. Ten of them
knew they had sold him away, and after many years they came
to feel that he had died as a slave in Egypt.

We feel a haunting quality in his family’s belief that Joseph was
dead. For Joseph represents not only love of the Lord but also the
innocence  from  infancy  in  each  of  us.  In  earliest  childhood,  we
learn  to  love  the  Lord  completely.  We  trust  Him  with  our  whole
hearts and feel a tender and magical love for Him. But as we grow
up and become adults, this earliest innocence and trust are forgot-
ten.  Tender  remains  are  withdrawn  into  our  interiors,  above  our
conscious mind. As we discover evils in the world and in ourselves,
we lose our earlier dreams and hopes. We feel Joseph is dead. We
can come into our own rational faith (Isaac) and we can even find
love of the neighbor in our natural lives (Jacob becoming Israel).
But  we  simply  know  that  Joseph  is  dead.  Our  inmost  dreams  of
innocence and trust in the Lord fade. But the secret of the Joseph
story is that he does not die. He can be restored to the central posi-
tion in our hearts, even as this occurred with the Lord Jesus Christ
at the end of His glorification.

If Joseph’s life story portrays the rebirth of the sensuous level

153

THE PATH, CHAPTER 25

in us, isn’t that the very lowest step in regeneration or rebirth? How
is it that what is most ultimate or exterior marks the completion of
the process of becoming an angel? The reason is that there is a sur-
prising  linkage  between  the  senses  and  the  celestial,  or  inmost,
level in the human mind. We see this linking of the celestial and the
sensuous  with  little  infants.  Tiny  children  live  in  a  world  of  the
senses,  yet  the  highest  angels  surround  them. The  senses  and  the
celestial are linked. Rebirth takes place on dual levels: as we ascend
nearer to the Lord through regeneration, the Lord also brings order
and  rebirth  to  lower  and  lower  levels  of  our  minds  (AC  5122:2;
5202:4; 5145; CL 302). In human rebirth, as in the Lord’s glorifi-
cation, we see a simultaneous ascent and descent, like the angels on
Jacob’s ladder.

Conjugial love is also an example of the linking of the celestial
and  the  sensuous.  If  there  is  true  order  in  a  marriage,  there  is  an
ascent  to  ever-higher  levels  of  the  mind,  with  an  effort  even  to  a
union of the souls (see CL 302). At the same time, there is a descent
toward the senses. That is, tender states of love are expressed with
affectionate touch and union in marriage. While conjugial love in
its inmosts is a celestial love (CL 64), it is also a love that express-
es itself gently through the senses.

In Joseph’s first dream, the eleven sheaves that bowed down
to  him  are  his  eleven  brothers.  In  his  second  dream  (as  his
father Jacob clearly saw) the sun and moon and eleven stars are
Joseph’s  father,  mother,  and  eleven  brothers  bowing  before
him. These  dreams  reveal  that  Joseph  (that  is,  the  quality  repre-
sented by Joseph) is supreme, and that all other qualities bow down
before  this. With  the  Lord  Himself,  in  His  glorification,  all  other
qualities  in  His  mind  bowed  down  before  Joseph.  Joseph  now
becomes the central figure — the love of Jehovah operative within
Jesus. Joseph represents the wonderful, caring love within Jesus in
this  state,  when  the  glorification  of  His  sensuous  and  body  are
about to take place. In Swedenborg’s Writings this love is called the

154

OVERVIEW OF THE GLORIFICATION OF THE SENSUOUS

“celestial  of  the  spiritual,”  and  it  involves  both  the  love  of  His
Father or Divine Soul and His love for the salvation of humankind;
this is also called His “human essence.”

The evil heredity through Mary is still present and powerful in
the sensuous level of Jesus’ life on earth. It is active now, in this
series,  opposing  further  glorification. This  heredity  is  the  serpent
that bruised Jesus’ heel (Gen. 3:15), the “heel” being His sensuous.
Joseph’s dreams prophesy the future state when spiritually the
eleven sheaves of the field would bow before him as would the sun,
moon, and stars. This foretells the glorification state when all qual-
ities in the Lord’s Human would become subordinate to the Divine
love. This would happen when Divine love was fully received, and
it would order all things in Jesus Christ. Then all the knowledges of
good and truth within the Lord bow down before Divine love.

But at first this is not happening. Joseph’s brothers, key quali-
ties in the lower level of the Lord’s mind, do not bow down. They
resist, reject, and hate the celestial, even as nine of Joseph’s broth-
ers were jealous of him and despised him. (Benjamin and Reuben
did not share in this hatred.)

This speaks clearly of a strong need in the process of the Lord’s
glorification,  the  need  for  the  evils  in  His  maternal  heredity  that
reject the Divine love to be removed, extirpated. Until this is done,
the  glorification  is  incomplete.  Now  Joseph,  instead  of  ruling,  is
sent into slavery and exile. Joseph himself must experience trials
and  temptations,  for  the  celestial  of  the  spiritual,  although  it  is  a
wondrous  quality,  is  not  yet  Divine  or  glorified  in  Jesus  (see AC
5256, 5257).

The nine sons of Jacob who despised Joseph now represent those
qualities  that  are  dominated  spiritually  by  sensuous  pleasure  apart
from any higher loves (AC 4769:1). Perhaps here the nine brothers
of Joseph represent in the supreme sense the hereditary evils and fal-
sities in the sensuous level of the Lord: these are tendencies to evils
and falsities that exist through His finite maternal heredity.

155

THE PATH, CHAPTER 25

Here we come to the last major stage of the Lord’s glorification,
with the goal of its completion. Does the “Joseph” stage of Jesus’
development happen at the same time as His public ministry? Might
the physical healing He gave during His travels, often by means of
the sense of touch, have happened at the same time as His inner bat-
tles  to  bring  healing  to  the  human  sensuous  level?  Perhaps  future
studies of this subject will shed more light on this possibility.

Now is when the Lord’s worst temptations take place. The evils
of  humankind  that  have  access  to  Jesus  through  His  maternal
heredity  flow  most  powerfully  through  the  sensuous  heredity.
Certainly  in  the  temptations  in  the  garden  of  Gethsemane  and  on
the cross, the serpent bruises Jesus’ heel.

THE BETRAYAL BY THE HEREDITARY

SENSUOUS

JOSEPH’S BROTHERS BETRAY HIM
GENESIS 37 CONTINUED

Joseph is sent to help his brothers with the flock of 
sheep.

When his brothers see him coming, they decide to 
kill him because they are jealous of his dreams.

Instead of killing him they sell him to some passing 
Midianite traders as a slave.

The brothers take Joseph’s tunic, dipped in goat’s 
blood, back to their father Jacob. Jacob believes 
that Joseph is dead, and he mourns.

The Midianites sell Joseph in Egypt to Potiphar, an 
official of Pharaoh.

Joseph  was  seventeen  when  he  had  the  two  dreams  fore-
telling his future role. When he was sent to his brothers, who
were tending the sheep at Dothan, his brothers did not warmly
greet  him,  but  laid  a  plan  to  kill  him  instead.  Reuben  inter-
vened and discouraged this plan. Yet still, when Joseph came to
them, the nine brothers grabbed him roughly, stripped him of

157

THE PATH, CHAPTER 26

his coat of many colors, and threw him into a barren pit. Later,
Judah noticed Ishmaelites passing by in a caravan and suggest-
ed that Joseph be sold to them for profit.

Joseph’s brothers sold him into Egypt for twenty pieces of
silver. Celestial  angels,  when  they  hear  stories  from  the  Word,
search out the inmost affections involved, for these are the keys to
the  internal  meaning.  This  story  causes  horror  to  the  angels.  To
them Joseph is the Lord, Who came innocently to humankind. The
evil  within  humankind  first  intends  to  kill  the  Lord,  but  then
instead,  out  of  greed,  representatively  sells  Him.  Joseph’s  tunic
was  misused  to  prove  his  death  to  Jacob. Here  is  raw  hatred,
intended murder, and greed, together with the lie about the tunic,
and the terrible devastation of Jacob because of this lie.

Towards Jesus Himself, in His goal of the glorification of the
sensuous, the hells show violent opposition, especially the lowest
hell, the genii. As we have seen, Jesus, working through the “celes-
tial of the spiritual” (Joseph), looks to glorifying His sensuous level
and  His  body.  The  “celestial  of  the  spiritual”  is  a  deep  love  of
Jehovah, along with a deep love of humankind. He knows what this
process  will  do  for  humankind,  for  each  of  us.  He  knows  it  will
open up the choice of heaven for us in a way never before possible,
enabling us to see and love the Lord even with our sensuous mind.
But  the  hells  resist  violently.  They  infiltrate  the  Lord’s  states
through His maternal human heredity. In this lower human are all
the evils of humankind in potentiality. The hells rise to attack. They
take Jesus, coming in innocence, throw Him into a barren pit, and
finally sell Him into Egypt. His coat they abuse to prove His death.
Looking  at  Joseph’s  story,  and  at  Jesus’  later  life  on  earth  as
recounted in the New Testament, we see similarities. Jesus also is
betrayed, but in His case it is the Pharisees and Judas who betray
Him.  Judas  sells  Him  for  thirty  pieces  of  silver,  as  Judah  sold
Joseph for twenty pieces of silver. The Lord’s outer coat is taken,
gambled for by lots, and won by a Roman soldier. His enemies put

158

THE BETRAYAL BY THE HEREDITARY SENSUOUS

Jesus  to  death,  and  Joseph’s  brothers  nearly  put  him  to  death.
Joseph  in  the  pit,  without  water,  is  like  Jesus  in  his  final  tempta-
tions, when He is in a spiritual pit and says, “I thirst” (John 19:28).
What happened to Joseph here is then a prophecy of future tempta-
tions in the Lord’s own life.

In brief, the maternal heredity in the Lord rejected the celestial
of the spiritual (Joseph). Love of the Lord wears a beautiful coat of
many  colors.  These  colors  are  the  wonderful  varieties  of  natural
sciences and arts that clothe the reality of the one Lord (AC 4667).
But evil takes this clothing of affirming facts, dips it in the blood of
misinterpretation, and conveys it with arrogance: “Look, here are
your so-called facts that clothe the Lord’s reality.” Evil cunningly
misuses  nature,  science,  and  the  arts  to  disprove  the  Lord’s  exis-
tence. And evil then sells the Lord into Egypt as just another knowl-
edge, in this case as evil and empty knowledge.

Because of a different emphasis in the two series, the amounts
for  which  Joseph  in  the  Old  Testament  and  the  Lord  in  the  New
Testament are betrayed are not the same. The twenty pieces of sil-
ver for which Joseph was sold represent low estimation of Joseph’s
spiritual value, a rejection of remains or innocence, and a turning to
what is unholy (AC 4759). The thirty pieces of silver for which the
Lord was betrayed by Judas represent those who “value so little the
Lord’s  merit,  and  redemption  and  salvation  by  Him”  (AC  2276).
The  two  amounts  are  spiritually  related  and  fill  out  each  other’s
meaning. In either case, the highest love is sold for greed.

It  seems  that  the  Divine  natural  (Jacob),  in  temptation,  is
attacked by the appearance that humankind will never tame its sen-
suous. It appears here that the hells win and the highest human love
(Joseph) perishes before these lowest evils. Seeing the bloodstained
tunic, Jacob believes Joseph to be dead.

LOVE OF DOMINION IN THE
HEREDITARY SENSUOUS

JUDAH AND TAMAR
GENESIS 38

Jacob’s son Judah marries a Canaanite woman 
and has three sons: Er, Onan, and Shelah.

Judah arranges for Er, his oldest, to marry Tamar, 
but Er dies before producing any children. 

According to Israelitish law, Onan must marry his 
brother’s widow and raise up children for him.

Onan marries Tamar, but he also dies with 
no offspring. Tamar is told to wait for Shelah to 
grow up for her next husband.

Judah’s wife dies. Tamar, who desires her right 
for children, disguises herself and waits by the 
road for Judah. Judah thinks she is a harlot, and 
goes in to her.

Judah learns that Tamar has become pregnant. He 
orders that she be killed for harlotry, not knowing 
that he is the father.

When Judah learns the truth, he spares Tamar and 
she delivers twins: Perez and Zerah.

160

LOVE OF DOMINION IN THE HEREDITARY SENSUOUS

Genesis now tells the strange story of Judah and his daugh-
ter-in-law Tamar. In this story Judah takes on an evil representa-
tion:  the  lowest  evil  in  the  Lord’s  maternal  heredity,  the  love  of
dominion. The Lord sees the quality of this love in all its terrible
forms. It is the extreme of the evil love of self. Delight in ruling and
dominating  over  others  on  the  sensual  level  is  the  most  powerful
natural  delight  the  hells  offer.  Its  appeal  has  undermined  many
human souls. It comes in subtle disguises. It puts concern for self
above all else: above one’s spouse, family, country, and church. The
Lord’s first concern is for what this evil may do to humankind, how
it might spiritually destroy the human race on this earth. His fear
from His love (see AC 2034) is that His mission on earth will fail
because  humankind  will  be  overcome  by  the  evil  represented  by
Judah. How valid this concern is may be confirmed by studying the
contemporary world where all kinds of minor wars, power strug-
gles, and brutal crimes dominate our newscasts.

The Judah quality that attacks the Lord comes to Him through
the sensuous degree. This is where Judah particularly nestles. The
desire to dominate and the sensuous are joined together. So with
us  also.  This  evil  is  manifested  in  rape,  incest,  and  the  sexual
abuse of children. Jesus felt horror at seeing this potential quality
in  His  maternal  heredity  and  therefore  in  humankind. This  with
most of us is likely only a tendency, deeply hidden in the uncon-
scious.  But  to  know  its  potential  is  to  lessen  its  possibility  of
openly attacking us.

“Judah saw. . .a daughter of a man, a Canaanite, and her
name was Shua; and he took her, and came to her” (Gen.  38:2).
In  time,  and  in  following  order,  three  sons  were  born  of  this
marriage: Er, Onan, and Shelah. “Judah took a woman for Er
his firstborn, and her name was Tamar” (Gen. 38:6). There is
about Tamar, probably from her good correspondence here, a sense
of beauty and loveliness. Tamar represents a church that is genuine,
one  whose  spirit  has  innocence  and  humility  (AC  4831).  “The

161

THE PATH, CHAPTER 27

internal of the church here is Tamar, and its external is Judah with
his three sons by the Canaanite woman” (Ibid.). Judah and his sons
are not only the external elements of the church but also an exter-
nal that has no soul, no true internal.

Tamar was first given to Er as a “woman” or wife, but he
was evil, and died without offspring. It was an Israelitish cus-
tom that a brother was obligated to provide offspring if his broth-
er  died  with  none.  Tamar  was  then  given  to  Onan  who  died
after refusing to beget offspring for his brother. Judah did not
want  his  third  son,  Shelah,  to  die  also.  He  asked  Tamar  to
return  to  her  father’s  house  and  wait  until  Shelah  grew  up,
but  he  really  had  no  intention  of  fulfilling  this  obligation.
When Shelah was grown, Judah withheld him from marriage
to Tamar. When it became clear that Judah would never keep
his promise to give Shelah in marriage to her, Tamar disguised
herself as a harlot, and after Judah’s wife died, enticed him to
ask her, as a harlot, for intercourse. He did not know her iden-
tity.  When  Tamar  became  pregnant  from  this  union,  Judah
would have killed her for unfaithfulness until he learned that
he himself was the father.

The love of dominion is hell’s lowest and strongest love. This
rejects what is genuine even as Judah rejected Tamar as a wife for
Shelah  and  took  her  for  himself  as  a  harlot.  That  he  did  this
unknowingly tells even more about his state representatively: love
of ruling does not care that it treats genuine loves (Tamar) as a har-
lot (AC 4868:2). Such, too, is the coldness in sensuous dominion
that allows rape and incest, or sexual domination in marriage.

Perhaps in the supreme sense Judah is the tendency to sensuous
evil in the Lord’s maternal heredity (AC 4825, 4868:2). This hered-
itary  evil  could  not  be  conjoined  with  anything  genuine.  To  the
Lord this is a great sadness. He sees the evil in humankind inroot-
ed in its sensuous level, as it is in His maternal heredity. If only this
plane were pure, as it had been in Most Ancient times! Then Tamar,

162

LOVE OF DOMINION IN THE HEREDITARY SENSUOUS

all that is lovely, could have been conjoined with Judah’s son in a
conjugial marriage. Instead, the sensual level of humanity refused
to join with something genuine and internal, as Judah and his sons
refused to provide Tamar with a husband and offspring.

The birth of the twins to Tamar represents the beginning of
the  glorification  of  the  Lord’s  sensuous  level,  which  is  done  by
introducing  genuine  qualities  of  truth  and  goodness  to  this  level.
This representation takes Judah’s union with Tamar in its best light.
The sensuous level (Judah), which refused to join legitimately with
something  deeper  (Tamar),  is  coaxed  into  a  first  union  that  does
indeed produce some results. The twin boys born to Tamar, Zerah
and  Perez,  symbolize  states  of  goodness  and  truth  that  begin  the
Lord’s process of bringing rebirth to the sensuous level.

Jesus knows that the real power to bring the sensuous level back
in line with heaven lies in the power of goodness. This acknowl-
edgment of the power of goodness is symbolized by the fact that
the  infant  Zerah  (goodness  in  the  sensuous)  first  thrust  his
hand out of his mother’s womb, and a midwife tied around it a
cord of double-dyed scarlet.

And yet Zerah pulls his hand back into the womb, and his
brother Perez is born first. Perez symbolizes truth in the sensuous
level.  Jesus  sees  that  the  human  sensuous  level  is  so  devoid  of
goodness that He must first use truth to set it back into order. In the
process of regeneration we too must first use the power of truth to
teach our sensual level how to live in goodness.

The message of Genesis 38 is that Jesus Christ puts Divine truth
firmly  into  practice  on  the  sensuous  level  where  His  maternal
human heredity wishes to rule. Jesus finds the means that will grad-
ually lead to goodness on the sensuous plane. He does this by call-
ing  upon  His  own  Divine  remains  of  goodness,  from  His  earliest
states of innocence when He was an infant, living completely and
innocently in the sensuous plane.

EARLY TEMPTATIONS IN THE SENSUOUS

JOSEPH AND POTIPHAR’S WIFE
GENESIS 39

Joseph proves to be a skilled and loyal servant for 
Potiphar. Potiphar puts Joseph in charge of his 
household and possessions.

Potiphar’s wife yearns for Joseph, and tries to 
entice him into an adulterous relationship.

Joseph refuses, and this makes Potiphar’s wife
furious. She openly accuses Joseph of trying
to rape her.

Potiphar is enraged, and throws Joseph into prison.

But even in prison, Jehovah gives Joseph “favor in 
the sight of the keeper of the prison.” The keeper 
places Joseph in charge of all the other prisoners.

When  Joseph  was  sold  into  Egypt,  Potiphar,  captain  of
Pharaoh’s guard, purchased him as a servant. Here “Jehovah
was  with  Joseph”  (Gen.  39:2).  In  time  he  was  set  over
Potiphar’s  house  and  all  that  he  had.  But  once  again  he  was

164

EARLY TEMPTATIONS IN THE SENSUOUS

betrayed,  this  time  by  Potiphar’s  wife,  and  then  unjustly  put
into prison. Here also “Jehovah was with Joseph” (Gen. 39:21).
Soon  he  supervised  all  things  in  the  prison,  having  won  the
complete trust of its head keeper.

Joseph  represents  the  Lord’s  highest  human  essence  on  earth
before this is glorified and made Divine. This human essence has
two combining qualities: truth and good on a very high level, or the
spiritual  and  the  celestial.  In  doctrinal  terminology,  Joseph  is  the
“celestial of the spiritual” (AC 4962), a love both for Jehovah and
for saving humankind.

Thus Joseph is that “pure love” (AC 1812) towards the human
race  which  motivates  the  Lord  on  earth.  Joseph  and  his  younger
brother Benjamin are closely linked together in the Word because
spiritually they combine as a one (AC 4592:2). These two as one
are the human essence of the Lord before He is completely glori-
fied — with Benjamin representing new truth seen as sparkling and
alive, which flows from the celestial love, which is Joseph.

Jehovah  was  with  Joseph,  and  all  that  Joseph  did  pros-
pered. So too does that celestial of the spiritual within Jesus. As the
glorification  progresses,  this  pure  love  prospers  and  advances,
going  through  initial  states  preparatory  to  the  glorification  of  the
Lord’s  sensuous  level.  Jesus  (Joseph)  is  spiritually  in  the  land  of
Egypt  (natural  level  knowledges)  in  order  to  face  sensuous  ele-
ments in His nature and to glorify these.

But  this  does  not  happen  without  severe  temptations.  The
Word  says,  “Joseph  was  beautiful  in  form  and  beautiful  in
appearance” (Gen. 39:6). So is the celestial of the spiritual, that
high love within the Lord: it is beauty itself. It is then with a sense
of shock that we read: “And it happened. . .after these events,
that  his  lord’s  [Potiphar’s]  wife  lifted  up  her  eyes  towards
Joseph, and said, ‘Lie with me’ ” (Gen. 39:7). Joseph refused,
saying, “How. . .shall I do this great evil and sin against God?”
(Gen. 39:9). But Potiphar’s wife insistently demanded this day

165

THE PATH, CHAPTER 28

after  day,  until  one  day  when  Joseph  came  into  the  house,
which was then deserted of others, “she took hold of him by the
garment, saying, ‘Lie with me.’ And Joseph left his garment in
her hand, and fled, and went out of doors” (Gen. 39:11,12).

Adultery  is  one  of  the  worst  of  evils.  Representatively  with
Potiphar’s  wife,  this  is  not  a  natural  or  physical  adultery  that  is
being spoken about. It is an attack by the hells on the inner level of
the sensuous with the Lord Himself. Perhaps when Joseph flees and
leaves his garment in her hand, this is an early prophecy about the
Lord Himself when He was being led away to be crucified. 

“Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took His gar-
ments and made four parts, to each soldier a part, and also the tunic.
Now the tunic was without seam, woven from the top in one piece.
They said therefore among themselves, ‘Let us not tear it, but cast
lots  for  it’.  .  .  .Therefore  the  soldiers  did  these  things”  (John
19:23,24).

Potiphar’s wife was furious at Joseph’s rejection: the anger
of a lusting woman scorned. She shouted in feigned horror and
then displayed Joseph’s garment and claimed that he had tried
to rape her. She later told Potiphar this, and he in hot anger had
Joseph  “committed.  .  .to  the  prison  house”  (Gen.  39:20).
Potiphar’s wife represents the evil passion of the hells now attacking
the Lord, here the evil spirits of the milder hells (AC 5035e). But the
genii, the lowest devils, are behind these evil spirits. The attack was
directly against Jesus, against His love for our salvation (AC 5042).
The method of this attack is the temptation to engage in adul-
tery: here, in the internal representation, spiritual adultery, which is
to have a true love undermined by a lower lust. This has its foun-
dation in natural or physical adultery.

In the celestial sense this chapter is speaking of the Lord Jesus
Christ in the later states of His life on earth. I believe this is when

166

EARLY TEMPTATIONS IN THE SENSUOUS

He walked and taught and healed in the land of Canaan. The love
that is to be glorified is the celestial of the spiritual which is His
pure love for the salvation of human beings (AC 1812, 2034). This
love is now under attack at the sensuous level.

The attempted adultery of Potiphar’s wife depicts milder hells
focusing Jesus’ attention on the horrifying depravity of the sensuous
level with humankind. Putting this in my own words, the hells ask:
“How can this depraved sensuous level survive temptations of spir-
itual and natural adultery? Your sensuous as inherited through Mary
is incapable of glorification; it is completely fallen and depraved.”
The Lord answered this by continuing His glorification of this very
level by saying in effect, “Get behind Me, Satan” (Matt. 16:23).

Throughout  this  process,  the  Lord’s  human  essence  is  being
glorified. It is not the internal level alone (the celestial of the spiri-
tual) that is now being glorified. It is this internal as it is present in
the  lowest  of  the  natural:  in  the  sensuous  itself  (AC  5086).  This
ongoing glorification of the Lord’s sensuous is vital for us, for so
often  it  is  abuse  of  the  senses  that  betrays  us.  If  He  glorifies  His
sensuous, He makes it possible for Him to regenerate our own sen-
suous  level.  This  knowledge  is  vital  in  overcoming  attacks  that
come through our senses: alcoholism, drug abuse, child abuse, and
even  adultery.  We  can  and  must,  as  the  Alcoholics  Anonymous
organization teaches, turn “to a Higher Power.”

Here then is the Lord’s love coming down to the sensuous to
bring glorification there. Isn’t this where we especially need Him?
Isn’t it too often true of us that the “spirit indeed is willing, but the
flesh is weak” (Matt. 26:41)?

One clear indication that the sensuous is the focus here is that
the story happens in Egypt, which represents ultimate knowledges
that come in through the senses (AC 5078:4). The Lord’s goal here
is to make the whole of His body Divine, including His organs of
sensation (AC 5078:2). “He rose from the grave with His body, and
after the resurrection told the disciples, ‘See My hands and My feet,

167

THE PATH, CHAPTER 28

that  it  is  I  Myself;  handle  Me  and  see;  for  a  spirit  does  not  have
flesh and bones as you see Me have’ ” (Ibid.).

Potiphar  had  Joseph  cast  into  prison. There,  once  again,
Jehovah came to his aid. He was given leadership responsibili-
ty over the whole prison. “And whatever he did, Jehovah made
it to prosper” (Gen. 39:23).

That Joseph was with those who were imprisoned means repre-
sentatively that the Lord is in temptations. Yet the celestial of the
spiritual in Him rules and holds steady even in these terrible temp-
tations. He fights alone from His own power, unlike any other per-
son  on  earth  (AC  5045).  These  trials  are  leading  up  to  His  final
temptation  on  the  cross  and  to  the  greatest  victory,  when  His
Human becomes Divine. Then the Joseph within Him, the celestial
of the spiritual, will be glorified. All of the Divine Providence leads
toward this.

THE SETTING FOR JESUS’ SENSUOUS

TEMPTATION

THE BUTLER AND THE BAKER
GENESIS 40

Pharaoh’s chief butler and baker offend their king, 
and thus are put into the same prison where Joseph 
is being held.

The prince of the guards places Joseph in charge of 
these other two prisoners.

We come next to the story of Joseph in prison with Pharaoh’s
butler and baker, and of their dreams (Genesis 40). The inner mean-
ing of this historical account deals with the glorification of the sens-
es:  the  process  of  Divinity  coming  to  the  lowest  level  of  Jesus
Christ.

In this story Pharaoh, king of Egypt, symbolizes the Lord’s nat-
ural-level mind that has now been glorified. But there are tenden-
cies in the Lord’s sensuous mind, represented by the butler and the
baker, that are in great disorder from His finite maternal heredity.
When  God  originally  created  human  beings,  He  created  our
senses to serve and reflect our love of God and love of other peo-
ple. Thus heaven itself could be felt right down in our bodies. But
over time, human beings used the senses more and more to pursue

169

THE PATH, CHAPTER 29

selfish,  empty,  and  harmful  pleasures  that  shut  out  heaven  alto-
gether. Sensuous thinking and delights were no longer used to serve
higher  thinking  and  loves,  but  instead  to  shut  out  and  dominate
them. The Writings  describe  the  ideal  position  of  sensual  experi-
ence in our lives:

“When sensory impressions occupy [a subordinated] position,
happiness and bliss radiate from the interior man into the delights
of the senses and make these delights a thousand times better than
they were before” (AC 5125:2, italics added).

When God came on earth as Jesus, He made this possible again,

if we choose to follow His path.

Since the corrupted elements in the human sensuous mind, rep-
resented by the butler and the baker, are so opposed to the purity of
the  Divine  Natural  level  in  Jesus  (Pharaoh),  they  cannot  remain
near this level. This is represented in the literal story by the fact that
the  butler  and  the  baker  had  sinned  against  their  king,  and
were thus cast into prison (AC 5079, 5083). This prison symbol-
izes a state of falsity from evil (AC 5085).

It was not human sensations themselves that were rejected by
the  Divine  Natural.  Rather  it  was  the  views,  thoughts,  affections,
and desires that people were drawing from the senses, which were
opposed to the things of spiritual love and truth (AC 5094).

But there is a part of Jesus that is present right there in the midst
of the corrupted human sensuous mind. This is Joseph, the celestial
love that has come to rescue and restore this level, and lead it back
toward heaven. Joseph is there in prison with the butler and the
baker. Jesus’ love is there, enduring the imprisonment of the temp-
tations of sensuous evil in order that He may set us free.

Immediately, Pharaoh’s prince of the guards places Joseph
in  charge  of  the  other two  prisoners. The  prince  of  the  guards
represents  true  ideas  from  the  deeper  sense  of  the  Word  of  God.

170

THE SETTING FOR JESUS’ SENSUOUS TEMPTATION

From  these  deep  truths  (the  prince  of  the  guards)  Jesus  uses  His
celestial love now present in this lower level (Joseph) to teach the
human sensuous mind (AC 5087, 5088), working to guide it back
toward serving goodness and truth.  

Jesus confronts the hells on the level of the senses. He does this
from the Joseph within Him, from the celestial of the spiritual. His
human  essence  experiences  spiritually  the  states  that  come  to
Joseph  in  the  prison  house.  Jesus’  love  for  the  salvation  of  the
human race is now focused on the human sensuous mind and how
this should be Divinely ordered.

The senses are meant to be a tool for the inner or spiritual level
to use while living in the natural world. But the external senses tend
to take over and dominate the inner plane instead of the other way
around. If this actually happens, and is confirmed, “a person is done
for” (AC 5077). However, while we remain on earth, repentance is
always possible. The Lord faces the hells on the plane of the sens-
es  as  they  inflow  through  His  finite  maternal  heredity,  and  He
shows the path in His ordering of these senses.

In the Arcana we read:

“The present chapter deals with how the Lord glorified or made
Divine the exterior aspects of. . .[the] natural. The exterior aspects
of  the  natural  are  rightly  called  bodily  ones,  being  both  kinds  of
sensory powers of perception together with their recipient members
and organs; for these recipients together with those powers make up
that which is referred to as the body. . .The Lord made Divine all
that constituted His body, both its sensory powers and their recipi-
ent members and organs, which also explains why He rose from the
grave with His body, and after the resurrection told His disciples,
‘See My hands and My feet, that it is I Myself; handle Me, and see;
for  a  spirit  does  not  have  flesh  and  bones  as  you  see  Me  have’  ”
(Luke 24:39; AC 5078:2).

171

THE PATH, CHAPTER 29

The Lord alone glorified His body, or made it Divine (Ibid.). He
made His body Divine for purposes we are just beginning to under-
stand. It gives Him a retained power on the most ultimate plane. We
are reassured that He has a Divine presence even on the plane of
our bodies. Of course we can never regenerate our body; that is, the
Lord does not look to this as His goal for us. For the natural body
serves a temporary role here in this world while we make our free
choices of good or evil, heaven or hell. After our physical bodies
die, we are given spiritual bodies that are far more perfect and sen-
sitive than the ones they replace.

However, Jesus glorified His senses and the complete sensuous
level.  “As  Moses  lifted  up  the  serpent  in  the  wilderness,  even  so
must  the  Son  of  Man  be  lifted  up,  that  whoever  believes  in  Him
should not perish but have eternal life” (John 3:14,15). The serpent
is the sensuous, and this was “lifted up” or glorified with the Lord.
“And  I,  if  I  am  lifted  up  from  the  earth,  will  draw  all  peoples  to
Myself” (John 12:32).

Representatively,  when  the  butler  and  baker  sinned,  it  was
against the true order within the natural level (here depicted by the
king). This natural plane of the mind consists of “known facts and
the  affections  for  them”  (AC  5079:2).  Such  things  are  being
brought  into  order  and  glorified  with  Jesus  (AC  5079).  But  the
impressions flowing in through the senses are not yet ordered. They
are open to the disarray of evil.

The  challenge  is  to  bring  heavenly  order  to  our  senses.  From
infancy  and  early  childhood  we  have  affections  and  perceptions
that are innocent and good. These heavenly remains are associated
with our senses. So despite our evil heredity, which lodges in and
works  through  the  senses,  we  also  have  goods  from  infancy  and
childhood on this same level, making a potential equilibrium possi-
ble (see AC 1555).

The  prison-house  where  the  butler  and  baker  and  Joseph
were  all  bound represents  temptations  regarding  the  senses  and

172

THE SETTING FOR JESUS’ SENSUOUS TEMPTATION

body. This is an apt representation, for prisons suggest a sphere of
being bound, limited, and also a darkness of atmosphere. Sensuous
temptations  come  to  us  throughout  our  adult  lives.  Inmost  love
(Joseph) is about to work with these senses, to instruct them, and to
work with Providence to bring them into order. Illusions of the sen-
ses need to be deprived of power. “And the prince of the guards set
Joseph  over  them”  (Gen.  40:4).  Under  the  guidance  of  principles
from  the  Word  (the  prince  of  the  guards),  the  celestial  (Joseph)
taught these sensories (see AC 5087). During these severe tempta-
tions  it  is  inmost  love,  using  the Word,  that  instructs  and  teaches
our lowest level regarding the true uses of sensations.

In old age, the failing body brings difficulties and infirmities.
These cause hard trials and temptations centered on the senses. This
is true in serious illness as well. Other temptations may arise when
health is good, and yet our minds and hearts are focused on outer
sensations  apart  from  love  of  others  and  the  Lord.  However,  the
greatest liberation also comes in old age. It is likened ideally in the
Writings to a time of innocence and the wisdom of innocence, when
from the Lord a person again becomes like a child, but now a wise
child (see AC 10225). What is more touching than loving, innocent
old people? The Lord is with them. In spirit they are like Simeon
who held the baby Jesus in his arms.

STEPS IN GLORIFYING THE
SENSUOUS

THE DREAMS OF THE BUTLER AND THE BAKER
GENESIS 40 CONTINUED

The butler and the baker each describes a dream
to Joseph.

Joseph interprets the dreams, gaining this knowledge 
from God. The interpretations describe the future 
fate of the butler and the baker.

The fates that Joseph describes come to pass. The
butler is restored to his former position, while the 
baker is executed.

The butler forgets to ask Pharaoh to grant Joseph’s 
freedom, as Joseph had asked him to.

The  days  that  the  butler  and  the  baker  spent  in  custody
symbolize  the  long  period  in  which  the  corrupted  finite  sensuous
mind inherited by Jesus through Mary could not be in the presence
of His glorified Divine Natural mind. Jesus’ celestial love (Joseph)
was working down in the prison of sensuous evil and temptations
to  teach  and  reform  the  human  sensuous  mind.  But  would  these
efforts be successful?

A  revelation  about  the  future  comes  to  Jesus,  represented  by

174

STEPS IN GLORIFYING THE SENSUOUS

the dreams of the butler and the baker. The dreams come to these
two  prisoners  during  the  night,  and  in  the  morning  they  are
sad because they do not know the meaning of the dreams. In
the  part  of  His  mind  that  is  entangled  in  the  impurities  of  finite
human  sensuous  thinking  (the  butler  and  the  baker,  AC  5083,
5084, 5095) Jesus cannot foresee the outcome of His efforts. Can
His work save this final level of humanity and restore it to accord
with Divine order?

And  then,  in  the  morning,  Joseph  comes. The  clarity  of
morning  represents  the  ability  of  Jesus’  celestial  love  (Joseph)  to
perceive the future fate of these two elements in the human sensu-
ous mind. As Jesus perceives this knowledge through a revelation
from His Divine Soul, so Joseph perceives the meanings of the
dreams through a revelation from God.

The  butler  and  the  baker  each  represent  different  parts  of  the
human sensuous mind (see AC 5157). The “butler” pictures knowl-
edge that has been gained through the senses – thoughts, concepts,
ideas. This part of the sensuous mind has connection with intellec-
tual thought, and therefore it can be taught. For instance, one’s eyes
take in the sight of the sun rising and setting, and the sensuous mind
can  conclude  that  the  sun  moves  around  the  earth.  However,  this
sensuous thought can be altered or re-taught by the intellectual con-
cept that the earth is rotating and orbiting, creating the illusion of a
moving sun. Then the sensuous mind can understand why the eyes
are seeing what they see. This part of the mind can grasp, “What
you are seeing is not what it first appears to be.” This type of sen-
suous thinking, governed by human understanding and represented
by the butler, enters especially through the senses of sight and hear-
ing, but also to some extent through smell and taste (AC 5077).

The baker, on the other hand, represents the part of the sensu-
ous mind that experiences delights through the senses. This part of
the mind functions apart from the intellect. If a person has estab-
lished a feeling of delight in something disorderly, such as drinking

175

THE PATH, CHAPTER 30

alcohol  excessively,  that  part  of  his  or  her  mind  cannot  be  told,
“You do not find pleasure in drinking excessively.” The “baker” in
our minds cannot comprehend anything beyond what it feels. A per-
son must abandon and reject the behavior that feeds that harmful
pleasure  and  replace  it  with  new  and  higher  sources  of  pleasure.
Any recovering alcoholic knows that a return to previous harmful
behaviors will bring that same destructive pleasure right back. This
kind of purely sensuous perception, governed by the human hered-
itary will and represented by the baker, can enter through hearing,
smell, or taste, but most especially through touch (AC 5077).

In a revelation from His Divine Soul, Jesus foresees what will
become of these two parts of the fallen human sensuous mind. This
revelation is described representatively by the dreams of the butler
and the baker.

Special dreams in the Word involve Divine foresight, and this
is the case with the dreams of the butler and baker (AC 5091). The
Lord alone can foretell the future; not even angels have this facul-
ty. Jehovah gave Jesus Christ on earth the ability of foresight; Jesus
knew the future destiny of the senses within Himself. Joseph, who
represents the human essence of the Lord, could foretell the mean-
ing of the butler’s and baker’s dreams. When Joseph said, “Do not
interpretations belong to God?” (Gen. 40:8), he was saying that
God gave him the ability to interpret.

The butler told his dream to Joseph, and said to him:
“ ‘In my dream. . .behold, a vine before me. And on the vine
three shoots, and it was as though budding; its blossoms came
up, and its clusters ripened into grapes. And Pharaoh’s cup was
in  my  hand,  and  I  took  the  grapes  and  pressed  them  into
Pharaoh’s  cup,  and  put  the  cup  onto  Pharaoh’s  palm.’  And
Joseph said to him, ‘This is the interpretation of it: The three
shoots  are  three  days.  In  yet  three  days  Pharaoh  will  lift  up
your  head  and  will  restore  you  to  your  position,  and  you  will
put Pharaoh’s cup into his hand, according to the former man-

176

STEPS IN GLORIFYING THE SENSUOUS

ner when you were his cupbearer’ ” (Gen. 40:9-13).

In its inner meaning the butler’s dream tells of the re-ordering
of sensuous thinking that is subject to the understanding or intel-
lect. Jesus foresees that this part of human sensuous thinking can be
brought back into accord with higher thinking, at least for a time.
The details of the dream describe how this comes about.

The  “shoots” are  derivatives  from  the  understanding  that
extend  down  even  to  the  senses,  especially  in  the  rebirth  of  the
sense of sight (see AC 5114:1). The rebirth begins first with leaves
that represent heavenly intelligence applied to these senses (subject
to the understanding) which properly orders them. Then come blos-
soms,  which  are  qualities  not  just  of  intelligence  but  of  wisdom
coming to the use of the senses.

Clusters are the truths coming to these senses when they look
outward toward good to the neighbor. This happens when we use
our  senses  not  simply  to  provide  enjoyment  for  ourselves,  but  to
serve others with love. Finally come the ripe grapes or fruit, which
are goods done from celestial truths (see AC 5117), that is, using
the senses to promote love to the Lord, conjugial love, and love of
little children (AC 2039)(AC 5116:5).

The  butler  was  restored  to  serving  Pharaoh  after  three
days, but sadly he forgot Joseph and what Joseph had done for
him.  The  senses  subject  to  understanding  were  restored  to  order
and  received  heavenly  influx.  But  the  glorification  of  the  senses
with the Lord and the rebirth of the senses of human beings (those
subject to the understanding) are not completed; the butler forgot
Joseph.  A  major  step  had  been  taken,  but  there  are  still  further
stages  to  come.  The  celestial  still  feels  bound,  forgotten  in  an
inward prison.

“And  when  the  chief  of  the  bakers  saw  that  Joseph  had
interpreted what was good, and he said to Joseph, ‘I also was in
my dream, and behold, three baskets with holes in them were
on my head. And in the highest basket there were some of every

177

THE PATH, CHAPTER 30

kind of food for Pharaoh, the work of the baker, and the birds
were eating them out of the basket, from upon my head.’ And
Joseph answered and said, ‘This is the interpretation of it: The
three baskets are three days. In yet three days Pharaoh will lift
up your head from upon you, and will hang you on wood; and
the birds will eat your flesh from upon you’ ” (Gen. 40:16-19).
The subject now is the sensory degree subject to the will, rep-
resented  by  the  baker  (AC  5144).  This  is  primarily  the  sense  of
touch, but also the senses of smell and taste, and to a degree, the
sense  of  hearing  (AC  5077:3). These  senses  have  strong  connec-
tions with the fallen hereditary will.

The three baskets that had “holes in them” depict the hered-
itary will. In this will are no receptive levels of conscience, nothing
that would receive and retain the inflowing of good (or food) from
the highest level. Our hereditary will loathes the idea of conscience
on any level and it ridicules such things. There are holes in the bas-
kets allowing food (goodness) to fall through and be corrupted in
the lower levels. In this hereditary will, remains of childhood are
not retained by either the civil or the spiritual level of conscience
(AC 5145:3).

The primary area of operation of this fallen will is on the sen-
suous  plane  where  it  loves  to  work  through  touch,  or  smell  and
taste,  and  would  also  like  to  capture  hearing  and  sight.  It  would
lower  these  to  lusts.  It  would  dominate  our  senses.  If  this  is
achieved, then the birds come and eat the food from the upper-
most basket: that is, lies or excuses originating in our evils pluck
out and eat any inner goods.

The senses, obsessed by the fallen will, take a ruling position
when  food  and  drink  take  precedence  over  any  higher  values  —
when drugs mean more than revealed truth, when the body means
more than the spirit. Many, many human beings have been caught
in  this  bodily  trap.  We  are  all  vulnerable.  It  is  a  primary  way  in
which the hells can take us over. The bodily senses seem external

178

STEPS IN GLORIFYING THE SENSUOUS

and relatively unimportant, yet they are entry points for evil spirits
who delight in destroying us.

The Divine will of Jesus is from His Soul. This will does not
receive sensuous delights flowing in through the maternal heredity.
Such  delights  are  “evil,  and  therefore  had  to  be  cast  aside”  (AC
5157:3). This is the baker who was hanged. In His glorification,
the  Lord  successively  rejects  and  casts  aside  His  finite  maternal
human.  In  place  of  the  hereditary  will  through  Mary,  the  Lord
acquires a new will: this new will flows down to the level of His
senses. In time, this very ultimate level will be glorified. His sens-
es and even His body will be glorified (AC 5078:2).

Hereditary evil, allied with touch, would lead us to reject life
after death. Touch could tell us that only our body is real. It would
suggest strongly that when our body dies, we are wiped out forev-
er. The hells, through the misuse of touch impressions, would lead
us to utter despair. What the Lord is teaching here directly is that
the “baker” is lying, distorting sense impressions. We can reject the
lies he tells. The butler can be re-ordered in us, receiving new infor-
mation about the heavenly use of the senses. We can understand the
beauty of our earthly environment a “thousand times” more clearly
than before. In place of the baker, a new will that is allied to all of
our senses can be given us. The Lord glorified His senses; He can
help us in the rebirth of ours.

For now, however, Joseph is still in prison. The butler has
forgotten  the  interpreter  of  his  dream,  which  means  that  the
celestial  is  still  imprisoned  by  false  attitudes,  false  principles.
When Joseph says to the butler, “Remember me,” he represents
the  celestial  love  of  Jesus,  urging  His  not-yet-glorified  sensuous
thinking  to  remember that  the  Divine  exists  in  all  physical  and
worldly issues. But this does not happen yet. The butler does not
speak  to  Pharaoh  about  Joseph  in  order  to  set  him  free. The
sensuous is not yet fully subordinate and in compliance with heav-
enly loves. Despite the elevation of the butler and the hanging of

179

THE PATH, CHAPTER 30

the  baker,  rebirths  still  must  take  place  before  the  sensuous  is  in
true order.

Toward the end of His life on earth, the Lord clearly foretold the
coming crucifixion and His resurrection. The story of the baker is
in one sense a prophecy of the final temptation on the cross when
the maternal human would be cast aside, rejected. The elevation of
the butler is a foretelling of the Divine resurrection to come. 

The leading factor in the completion of the glorification, and of
our  regeneration,  is  innocence  (AC  5168:2).  This  is  prophesied
with  Jesus  Christ  on  earth,  when  John  the  Baptist  sees  Him:
“Behold the Lamb of God, Who takes away the sin of the world”
(John 1:29).

DIVINE CHANGES IN THE SENSUOUS

JOSEPH: TWICE REDEEMED
GENESIS 41

Pharaoh has two dreams that he does not
understand.

The chief butler finally remembers Joseph in 
prison. He tells Pharaoh that this is a man
who can interpret his dreams.

Joseph is brought up out of prison. From the 
power of God he interprets Pharaoh’s dreams.

Pharaoh is so pleased that he sets Joseph in a great 
position of power, and gives him the daughter of
the priest of On as wife.

Joseph  was  betrayed  first  by  his  brothers  and  then  by
Potiphar’s wife, and as a final blow he was simply forgotten in
prison by the butler. The betrayals and the forgetting portray the
coldness  of  evil,  which  rejects  the  Savior  of  humankind.  These
rejections of Joseph, who represents the Lord, have their counter-
parts in the New Testament.

After Jesus is baptized by John, He is led up by the Spirit into
the wilderness, and there endures three temptations. After He fasts

181

THE PATH, CHAPTER 31

forty days, the tempter asks Him to turn stones into bread: to force
the  stony  hearts  of  people  into  being  good.  Then  the  devil  takes
Him  up  onto  the  pinnacle  of  the  temple  in  Jerusalem,  and  says,
“Throw yourself down. For it is written: ‘He shall give His angels
charge concerning you. . .In their hands they shall bear you up, lest
you  dash  your  foot  against  a  stone”  (Matt.  4:6). After  Jesus  con-
quers in this temptation, the devil takes Him up into an exceeding-
ly high mountain, and offers Him all the kingdoms of the world if
He will worship him. Jesus answers, “Away with you, Satan! For it
is  written,  ‘You  shall  worship  the  Lord  your  God,  and  Him  only
shall you serve’ ” (Matt. 4:10).

Although  no  outward  relationship  exists  between  Joseph’s
betrayals and the Lord’s three temptations in the wilderness, in the
deeper supreme sense both treat of the Lord’s terrible temptations
while on earth. Each in a sense is a summary of these trials. If we
think about the emotions Joseph would have felt during his betray-
als,  we  sense  his  inward  agony.  He  begged  his  brothers  not  to
betray him. He felt despair over the lies of Potiphar’s wife, and then
over  his  utterly  unfair  imprisonment.  These  betrayals  picture  the
Lord’s  despair  and  agony  in  His  temptations.  This  despair  is  not
over His own fate. It is despair about His efforts to save the human
race from evil. When the love is for others, and the despair is over
the state of others, the resulting pain is incredible. Love and despair
touch inner levels of the heart, beyond all outward trials.

Joseph in the pit and in prison is Jesus’ love for our salvation
trapped  by  the  illusions  instilled  by  the  hells.  They  have  Him
imprisoned by the believable illusion that humankind is too evil to
be saved. The Lord can clearly perceive the appalling nature of the
evil in His own maternal heredity. He knows the states of evil in
humankind. No wonder He despairs. It is such evils that led to the
killing  of  six  million  Jews  in  Nazi  concentration  camps  during
World War II. It is such evils that lead to the betrayal of a husband
or a wife by adultery. It is such evil that abuses children. The Lord

182

DIVINE CHANGES IN THE SENSUOUS

sees the desire of the hells to destroy innocence on earth, to remove
compassion from human hearts. They drive into the Lord’s lower
mind the illusion that they, the hells, will easily succeed.

This, in the supreme sense, is what Joseph’s torments represent.
While  in  the  prison  (in  temptations)  he  interprets  the  butler’s
dream: the human senses (subject to the understanding) would be
redeemed.  But  when  so  redeemed,  they  forget  Joseph. There  still
remains a lack of connection between the senses in the Lord and
His celestial human essence. Joseph remains in prison, forgotten.

The  Word  now  tells  (in  Genesis  41)  of  Pharaoh’s  two
dreams: first of seven fine-looking and fat cows that come up
out of the river, and of seven other cows, ugly and gaunt, that
eat  up  the  fat  cows. Then  of  seven  good  heads  of  grain  being
devoured  by  seven  thin  and  blighted  heads.  These  dreams
deeply  troubled  Pharaoh,  and  he  called  all  his  magicians  and
wise men to interpret them. But “There was no one who could
interpret them for Pharaoh” (Gen. 41:8). It was then at last that
the chief butler remembered Joseph and his accurate interpre-
tation of his dream and of the baker’s. The butler told Pharaoh
about the “Hebrew boy” (Gen. 41:12) who could truly interpret
dreams.

“And Pharaoh sent for Joseph, and they hurried him out of
the pit” (Gen. 41:14). What a change and rescue! Joseph had been
in  prison,  seemingly  to  be  forgotten  until  he  died.  Now,  out  of
nowhere, he was raised up, his hair and beard were clipped, he was
given fresh clothes and presented to the ruler of all Egypt.

What  a  liberating  state  this  must  have  been  in  Jesus’  life  on
earth! It is an uplifting and refreshing of the human essence after
temptations  and  despair.  This  is  an  early  prophecy  of  the  Easter
dawn, here a raising up from a state like death. This depicts a major
and wonderful step in the glorification of His sensuous.

The  human  essence  is  elevated,  released.  Representatively,
Pharaoh,  who  wished  to  have  his  dreams  interpreted,  does  this.

183

THE PATH, CHAPTER 31

Pharaoh  represents  the  natural,  here  the  natural  in  the  broadest
sense, which includes the ultimate or the sensuous level. Pharaoh
in  this  context  is  said  to  represent  “the  new  natural,”  which  is
ready now “to accept the celestial of the spiritual” (AC 5244), or
Joseph. For us this means that the Lord comes directly to our sen-
suous  level,  bringing  His  love  and  light.  Our  sensuous  level  is
beginning  to  respond  to  Him  in  open  and  free  reception  of  His
influx. With Jesus Himself this is a beginning of rebirth in the will
of the sensuous, a beginning of the glorification on this ultimate
and powerful level.

“And they hurried Joseph out of the pit” (Gen. 41:14).
Jesus’  being  in  the  pit  is  an  entrapment  by  His  finite  human
heredity.  In  the  sphere  of  hereditary  evil  through  this  human,  it
seems that all hope for humankind is gone. Seeing the power and
putrid  nature  of  sensuous  evils  with  humankind,  Jesus  must  feel
that we cannot be saved. The hells urge this illusion upon Him. But
now, the devastating temptations are over. He is lifted up, into the
clean and fresh air of Divine reality.

Imagine how the Lord feels here. He is lifted up from an ago-
nizing temptation and restored to a state of Divine vision. He sees
again that humankind can be saved, that it is open to salvation. He
is filled with inmost joy (AC 2034).

Changes are coming then to the sensuous: the imagery is direct.
Joseph clipped his hair and beard. The Lord is clipping away and
casting aside that which was disheveled and in disorder in His sen-
suous.  He  becomes  refreshed  and  appears  in  spiritual  beauty.
Joseph discarded his worn and unclean prison apparel and put
on  fine  garments (AC  5248).  Joseph  then  came  to  Pharaoh,
which means that the love in Jesus opens up “communication with
the new natural” (AC 5249).

Great changes are happening. Jesus is advancing in the glorifi-
cation of His sensuous level to the point where the celestial of the
spiritual now arises out of prison and becomes a leader, a profound

184

DIVINE CHANGES IN THE SENSUOUS

interpreter of dreams. Joseph stood before Pharaoh not as a for-
mer prisoner but as one who could tell the meaning of dreams
and foretell the future. Here is a hint of the full glorification that
is to come, a hint of the Divine omniscience to come (AC 5249).

Pharaoh then unfolded to Joseph his two dreams about the
fat and thin cows and the fat and thin heads of grain. Jehovah
allowed  Joseph  to  interpret  them.  Joseph’s  prophecy  told  of
seven  years  of  plenty  followed  by  seven  years  of  famine.  He
advised Pharaoh to store up grain during the good years to pro-
vide food for the bad ones that would follow.

In  Pharaoh’s  eyes  this  prophecy  and  suggested  plan  were
good. He asked, “ ‘Shall we find a man like this, in whom is the
spirit  of  God?’  And  Pharaoh  said  to  Joseph,  ‘After  God  has
caused you to know all this, no one has wisdom and intelligence
like you. You shall be over my house, and all my people shall
kiss  on  your  mouth;  only  in  the  throne  will  I  be  great,  more
than you. . . .See, I have set you over all the land of Egypt’ ”
(Gen. 41:38-41).

Only hours before, Joseph had been in prison! Such is the power
of  celestial  love  in  the  human  heart. After  temptations,  it  rises  to
leadership, governing all the land of Egypt, all factual knowledges.
For celestial love and the truth perceived from it are supreme in the
human heart. They are the Lord with us. So also in the Lord’s glori-
fication: the Joseph in Him is raised up to leadership in His Egypt;
the celestial rules in all the knowledges of creation.

“These events happened by Divine Providence so that Joseph
might come to represent the celestial of the spiritual, which was the
Lord’s when He was in the world — the celestial of the spiritual
being that by means of which the Lord exercised control over His
natural  and  also  His  sensory  awareness,  so  that  step  by  step  He
could make both of these Divine” (AC 5316).

THE PATH, CHAPTER 31

Pharaoh  gave  Joseph  a  new  name,  “Zaphenath  Paneah”
(Gen. 41:45), and gave him for a wife Asenath, the daughter of
the  priest  of  On. This  name  “Zaphenath  Paneah”  means  “the
essential nature of the celestial of the spiritual” (AC 5330), which
is celestial love set in a foundation of spiritual truth.

The marriage of Joseph to Asenath indicates a higher and fuller
union of good and truth within Jesus Christ, a marriage that enables
the glorification to continue with power and fullness. But the essen-
tial nature of this marriage within the Lord is too deep and won-
derful for human comprehension (AC 5332). It is a love of the ten-
derest kind, united now to a gentle, profound wisdom. It is the Lord
coming nearer to us.

THE NEW WILL AND UNDERSTANDING

IN THE SENSUOUS

JOSEPH’S EARLY RULE
GENESIS 41 CONTINUED

As second ruler in Egypt, Joseph works for seven 
years to store up grain, preparing for the famine.

During this time, his wife bears two sons: Manasseh 
and Ephraim.

After seven years of plenty, the famine begins. The 
people of Egypt and of other lands come to Joseph to 
buy grain.

“And Joseph was a son of thirty years when he stood before
Pharaoh, king of Egypt” (Gen. 41:46). This age of thirty repre-
sents  a  state  when  “the  quantity  of  remains  was  complete”  (AC
5335). Jesus Christ on earth has endured many and severe tempta-
tions  by  the  time  He  reaches  the  age  of  thirty.  I  believe  that  the
Isaac rational is firmly established in Him by then, and also the glo-
rified  natural  represented  by  Israel.  Jesus  must  have  been  far
advanced in His glorification to do the astonishing miracles of the
next few years.

Pharaoh now appointed Joseph ruler. And Joseph went out
“through all the land of Egypt. And in the seven years of abun-

187

THE PATH, CHAPTER 32

dance of corn the land yielded bunches. And Joseph gathered
all the food of the seven years which were in the land of Egypt,
and laid up the food in the cities. . . .And Joseph stored up grain
like the sand of the sea, very much until he left off numbering,
because it was beyond number” (Gen. 41:46-49, selections).

Within  Jesus,  the  truths  linked  to  good  in  His  sensations  are
stored up in His “interior parts of the interior natural” (AC 5344).
When He undergoes the seven years of famine, He has these stored-
up  Divine  remains  to  draw  upon.  They  carry  Him  with  courage
through the rest of His life on earth.

In us, these tremendous harvests of grain picture an advanced
stage of rebirth when we become sensitive to the marvels, beauty,
and interior miracles of nature. We sense new ways of helping oth-
ers  and  new  states  of  closeness  in  marriage.  The  Lord  stores  up
these precious remains in the interior area of our mind. This is rich
and full, just like the corn stored up in the cities of Egypt.

The Lord gives us these gifts for the difficult times we experi-
ence  during  the  further  rebirth  of  the  sensuous  that  follows.  He
draws goods or loves out of these gifts to sustain us and to carry us
through inner famine. By this process we are reborn. We see evils
in order to shun them, and the Lord removes them. The Lord estab-
lishes this process in His own glorification of His sensuous mind
(AC 5342:3). With Him, in His glorification in this state, the stor-
ing up of grain was “like the sand of the sea, very much, until he
left  off  numbering,  because  it  was  beyond  number”  (Gen.
41:49; see  also AC 5346). Imagine the tremendous amount of good
sensuous delights that move Jesus deeply – perhaps the beauty of
nature and how good food serves human beings, the power of touch
between  a  mother  and  child  or  a  loving  husband  and  wife,  and
many,  many  other  delights. These  things  Jesus  would  store  up  to
call upon later, during times when all would seem hopeless on the
natural level of humanity.

“.  .  .To  Joseph  were  born  two  sons.  .  .whom  Asenath  the

188

THE NEW WILL AND UNDERSTANDING IN THE SENSUOUS

daughter  of  Potipherah,  the  priest  of  On,  bore  to  him.  And
Joseph  called  the  name  of  the  firstborn  ‘Manasseh  –  for  God
has  made  me  forget  all  my  labor  and  all  my  father’s  house.’
And the name of the second he called ‘Ephraim – for God has
made me fruitful in the land of my affliction’ ” (Gen. 41: 50-52).
The birth of Manasseh and then Ephraim marks vital stages in
the Lord’s glorification. Manasseh symbolizes a new will within the
Lord’s sensuous (AC 5351). This brings a Divine spring and warmth
that replace the coldness of evil through the finite maternal heredi-
ty.  For  the  angels  this  is  a  time  of  joy,  certainly  a  time  when  the
songs  of  “Hallelujah”  would  ring  in  the  heavens.  For  the  Lord  is
coming to humankind in the most ultimate level of life (see CL 81).
In  naming  Manasseh,  Joseph  said,  “For  God  has  made  me
forget all my toil, and all my father’s house” (Gen. 41:51). “The
words ‘For God has made me forget all my toil’ mean ‘the removal
of the evils which have caused pain’ ” (AC 5352). Manasseh’s inner
promise for us is forgetfulness of evils that have plagued us all our
lives. Now these evils leave central positions and go to the periph-
ery  of  our  consciousness  where  we  forget  them.  It  follows  that
when there is a new will in the sensuous, a new understanding will
be born there also. This is the birth of Ephraim, who was named
with the words: “God has made me fruitful in the land of my afflic-
tion”  (Gen.  41:52).  To  be  fruitful  represents  a  multiplication  of
truths (AC 5356) in a new sensuous understanding.

But  now  the  famine  comes. What  does  this  famine  mean?
Where  the  sensuous  had  felt  the  beginning  of  regeneration  and
lovely states of spring and summer opening up the heart, there now
comes a change. A late autumn and winter come to the heart, deso-
lation in the spirit, a void or emptying out. Delight seems to disap-
pear  for  us,  including  delights  of  the  senses. Things  seem  empty,
purposeless (AC 5360). Fortunately, in this inner famine we do not
die in our spirits; there is grain stored up in the cities of Egypt.
If we go to Joseph, to our inmost love, we can draw out memories

189

THE PATH, CHAPTER 32

of remains that sustain us, but just barely. We are poignantly aware
of a famine, an emptiness, all around us within our minds.

The Lord helps to explain what is going on spiritually in rebirth.

“With those who are being regenerated. . .truths are multiplied
exceedingly; for these people have an affection for knowing truths.
But as they draw nearer to the point when their regeneration is actu-
ally  carried  out,  they  are  seemingly  deprived  of  those  truths.  For
those  truths  are  withdrawn  to  a  more  interior  position,  and  when
this  happens,  the  person  seems  to  experience  desolation.
Nevertheless those truths are returned in consecutive stages to the
natural  (sensuous  here),  where  they  are  joined  to  good  while  the
person is being regenerated. . . .The desolation. . .is meant by the
famine lasting for seven years” (AC 5376:2).

The Lord permits this desolation because only in this state do
the evils and falsities that lie concealed in the sensuous emerge to
be seen for what they are. Then, drawing on the remains stored up
in the interiors of our minds, the Lord can help us fight against and
shun those now evident evils. We see what is blocking us off from
heavenly states.

To  encourage  us  in  this  process,  the  Lord  tells  us  in  the
Writings: “Desolation occurs to the end that a person may be regen-
erated, that is, to the end that evils and falsities may first be sepa-
rated from him, and then truths may be joined to forms of good, and
forms of good to truths” (AC 5376:7).

“Jehovah  will  comfort  Zion,  He  will  comfort  all  her  waste
places, so much so that He will make her wilderness like Eden, and
her  desert  like  the  garden  of  Jehovah.  Gladness  and  joy  will  be
found in her, confession and the voice of song” (Isaiah 51:3).

THE SENSUOUS RESPONDS TO

A NEW ORDER

THE TEN SONS OF JACOB GO TO EGYPT
GENESIS 42

Back in Canaan, Jacob sends his ten older sons to 
Egypt to buy grain.

Joseph recognizes his brothers, but they do not 
recognize him. Joseph conceals his identity and 
speaks roughly to them.

The ten brothers believe they are suffering 
because of their cruel treatment of Joseph.
In private, Joseph weeps over their remorse.

Joseph holds Simeon hostage while the nine other 
brothers return to Canaan with grain. Joseph
commands them to return with their youngest
brother, Benjamin. In secret, he returns their money 
into the sacks of grain that they have bought.

Learning that there was food in Egypt during the terrible
famine,  Jacob  sent  Joseph’s  ten  brothers  down  to  buy  grain.
Benjamin, his beloved youngest son, he kept behind. He did not
want to lose Benjamin, as he had lost Joseph.

The ten brothers arrived in Egypt, and “Joseph’s brothers

191

THE PATH, CHAPTER 33

came and bowed down to him, faces to the earth. . . .And Joseph
recognized  his  brothers,  and  they  did  not  recognize  him. And
Joseph remembered the dreams which he had dreamed involv-
ing them” (Gen. 42:6-9, selections).

Joseph spoke hard words to them, calling them spies. This
they  denied,  saying  they  had  come  to  buy  food  and  that  they
were all sons of one man in the land of Canaan. “And behold
the  youngest  is  with  our  father  today,  and  one  is  not”  (Gen.
42:13).

But  Joseph  tested  them,  telling  them  that  they  should
choose one to go and  fetch their brother in Canaan, and that he
would  keep  the  rest  in  bonds  in  Egypt.  “Bring  your  youngest
brother to me, and your words will be verified and you will not
die” (Gen. 42:20).

And  they  said.  .  .“Assuredly  we  are  guilty  concerning  our
brother, whose anguish of soul we saw when he pleaded with us,
and  we  did  not  hear;  therefore  this  anguish  has  come  to  us”
(Gen. 42:21).

“Joseph  turned  away  from  them,  and  wept;  and  he  came
back  to  them  and  spoke  to  them;  and  he  took  Simeon  from
them, and bound him before their eyes. And Joseph gave com-
mand to fill their vessels with grain, and to restore their silver,
each man’s in his sack. . .” (Gen. 42:24,25).

Joseph is the Lord’s human essence on earth, not yet glorified.
He now sees in His sensuous nature, which had been flawed with
hereditary  evil  through  a  finite  human  mother,  the  beginning  of  a
change.  Joseph’s  two  sons  symbolize  this  beginning.  Now  Joseph
saw his brothers experiencing guilt over their earlier betrayal of him;
he could see their genuine anguish. He could not help weeping.

The same is true of the Lord on earth when He sees the begin-
ning of true glorification in His sensuous level. It may be said that
Jesus  weeps,  as  indeed  it  is  twice  recorded  of  Him  in  the  New
Testament. This change in Himself, this glorification of His sensu-

192

THE SENSUOUS RESPONDS TO A NEW ORDER

ous,  would  make  possible  almost  incredible  future  changes  for
humankind on earth. Joseph wept; that is, the Lord weeps. This is
celestial love crying — here out of joy.

But there is still much to be accomplished in the full glorifica-
tion  of  this  lowest  level.  Benjamin  was  not  yet  reunited  with
Joseph,  nor  was  Jacob.  Spiritually,  these  are  the  missing  keys.
Joseph did not imprison all the brothers. Rather, he bound only
Simeon, sending the others back to Jacob. So the nine brothers
began their journey back home.

Early  in  this  return  journey,  one  of  them  opened  his  sack
and found that the silver they had paid for grain had been mys-
teriously restored to them. “And they trembled, saying a man
to  his  brother,  ‘What  is  this  that  God  has  done  to  us?”  (Gen.
42:28). They came to Jacob and told him all that had happened:
that Simeon remained bound in Egypt and that this unknown
ruler demanded that Benjamin be brought down to him.

“And Jacob their father said to them, ‘You have bereaved
me; Joseph is not, and Simeon is not, and you take Benjamin’.
. . .And Jacob said, ‘My son shall not go down with you, for his
brother is dead, and he, he alone, is left. And should harm hap-
pen to him on the road in which you go, you will cause my grey
hair to go down in sorrow to the grave’ ” (Gen. 42:36,38).

The  attempts  by  Joseph’s  brothers  to  procure  any  more
grain without bringing their youngest brother Benjamin down
to  Egypt  would  be  futile. In  the  celestial  and  spiritual  sen-ses,
Benjamin must be in Egypt, and finally Joseph must be seen and
acknowledged  by  his  brothers  as  the  true  ruler.  Celestial  love
(Joseph) and living truth (Benjamin) must be present before any-
thing genuine (grain) can be taken from knowledges (Egypt) (AC
5396, 5397).

Without such love and truth present, there is the attempt to rea-
son one’s way from the senses up to Divine truth. Ishmael, the wild-
ass rational, is the first to represent this attempt in adult life. Now,

193

THE PATH, CHAPTER 33

many years later, human beings in advanced rebirth attempt to find
truth on the sensuous level by reasoning their way upward from sci-
ence and from the senses. But this cannot be done (AC 5397). Truth
on  any  level  always  comes  from  above,  from  heavenly  love,
through  perception  (AC  6047). Truth  does  not  come  from  below,
from the senses alone. Missing here is not only a known and rec-
ognized Joseph, but also and especially Benjamin.

Benjamin is the “spiritual of the celestial,” or truth coming from
celestial good. He is a go-between, between higher and lower qual-
ities, between the celestial represented by Joseph, and the natural
and sensuous represented by the other ten sons of Jacob. As a medi-
um, he is said to draw qualities from each: from the celestial and
from the natural.

As  we  have  seen,  the  nine  sons  told  their  father  what  had
happened to them in Egypt, how the ruler had demanded that
Benjamin be brought down to him and had kept Simeon bound
in ransom. They told Jacob Joseph’s words to them: “. . .Bring
your youngest brother to me, and I shall know that you are not
spies,  that  you  are  upright  men;  I  will  give  you  your  brother
(Simeon),  and  you  will  wander  through  the  land,  trading”
(Gen. 42:33,34). Joseph said, in effect: Bring Benjamin down to
me in Egypt and you will become successful traders.

If Benjamin is present and all twelve sons of Jacob are then
in  Egypt  together  with  Joseph  as  ruler,  wonderful  things  will
happen. The sons will flourish and grow in bounty as successful
“traders.” What is pictured here spiritually is the goal of rebirth in
the sensuous for us, and the goal for the Lord, the path establisher, in
the glorification of His sensuous. This goal is that Joseph, or inmost
love, should rule in the human heart, even at the lowest levels.

This rule is one of tender, unselfish love. Joined to it are living
and  sparkling  truths,  represented  by  Benjamin’s  presence.  When
these  two  are  both  present  in  the  interior  levels  of  our  mind,  the
external truths of the sensuous, represented by the other ten sons of

194

THE SENSUOUS RESPONDS TO A NEW ORDER

Jacob, assume true and heavenly order. Willingly and lovingly sub-
ordinate to Joseph, as he had dreamed long before at the age of sev-
enteen, they do not become slaves, but rather alive and free. They
successfully  trade  in  wonderful  goods  and  truths  in  the  sensuous
level  of  life.  The  lowest  level  of  our  being  becomes  heavenly,
responsive, and receptive of inmost love (see AC 5227).

With the glorified Lord, this is the Divine order from which all
human order flows. The Divine celestial, love itself, governs in cre-
ation  and  human  hearts,  and  Divine  truths  from  this  provide  the
means for this to happen. Then all lower truths serve willingly and
also become alive and Divine. This is the goal in His glorification.
However, Jacob, representing a higher good within the natural,
feels he cannot survive without Benjamin. When there is disorder
on a lower plane, the plane right above it is in obscurity and confu-
sion. This good within the natural (Jacob), cannot see the full pic-
ture; it does not know that Joseph is alive and ruling in Egypt and
that if Benjamin joins him, then wonderful things will happen. This
would  include,  eventually,  a  reunion  of  Jacob  himself  with  his
whole family in Egypt. But especially this would focus on Jacob’s
reunion with Joseph, his beloved son, who he thinks is dead.

We cannot foresee the miracles the Lord has in store for us. The
despair in us blinds our eyes. Shakespeare wrote, “We know what
we are, but we know not what we may be” (Hamlet, Act 4, Scene 5).
Jacob, viewing things from his present perspective, despairs. In
the spiritual sense this expresses the despair of goodness in the nat-
ural (Jacob or Israel) if deprived of the only internal level it now
possesses  (Benjamin,  or  inner  truth  from  love).  The  inmost  love
from  infancy  (Joseph)  is  gone,  apparently  dead.  Benjamin  had
taken Joseph’s place in Jacob’s heart. And now he feared losing
Benjamin:  “And  should  harm  happen  to  him  on  the  road  on
which you go, you will cause my grey hair to go down in sorrow
to the grave” (Gen. 42:38).

Spiritually, Jacob or good in the natural is saying, “If inner truth

195

THE PATH, CHAPTER 33

from  good  is  lost  to  me,  then  this  will  be  the  ‘final  phase  of  the
church’  (AC  5550)  in  me.”  “Grey  hair,”  means  this  final  phase
(Ibid.). “ ‘In sorrow to the grave’ means without hope of a restora-
tion to life” (AC 5551). As is so often true of us, Jacob sees only
his immediate circumstances. Without such inner truths (Benjamin)
in  this  state,  we  feel  we  are  only  animals,  which  will  die  and  be
buried. There will be no life after death.

To be without hope is devastating. That is how Jacob felt about
losing Benjamin, and so we feel if we are without truth that is alive.
Yet an astonishing surprise is coming for Jacob. The Lord promis-
es this for us as well if we patiently follow the path of life.

BENJAMIN COMES TO JOSEPH
GENESIS 43

When their purchased grain runs out, Israel (Jacob) 
tells his sons to travel to Egypt to buy more. Judah 
reminds him that they have been commanded to 
bring Benjamin with them.

With great sadness, Israel agrees, and all the 
brothers leave for Egypt.

Joseph greets them warmly, and prepares a feast 
for them.

Genesis 43 begins, “And the famine grew more serious in the
land” (Gen. 43:1). The first thing said in a series is often the key
to  all  that  follows.  “Famine”  represents  an  absence  of  good  —  a
state of desolation.

During the Lord’s process of glorifying His sensuous level, His
finite  or  maternal  human  heredity  is  resistant  and  very  active.  It
blocks  the  influx  of  Divine  good  into  the  Lord’s  lowest  mind.  In
this sensuous level He feels desolation, a lack of hope for the sal-
vation of humankind.

But  this  chapter  brings  a  refreshing  change.  One  of  the  key

197

THE PATH, CHAPTER 34

elements  missing  in  the  Lord’s  human  essence  is  now  brought
directly  to  Him  where  it  can  help  restore  joy  and  begin  to  push
away  this  desolation.  Benjamin  was  brought  down  to  Egypt
and  into  the  presence  of  his  long-lost  brother  Joseph.  The
famine had become so desperate in Canaan that Israel had to
yield  up  his  youngest  son  to  accompany  his  nine  brothers
down to Egypt. As Judah urged so strongly, only in this way
would  the  ruler  in  Egypt  receive  them,  for  that  ruler  had
demanded that Benjamin be brought down. Heartsick at this,
Israel nevertheless had to give in. It was good that he did, for
it changed his life.

In  a  first  brief  meeting  with  his  ten  brothers  in  Egypt,
Joseph saw that, at last, Benjamin was with them. He ordered
a special feast and released Simeon from being held hostage. At
last they all came fully into Joseph’s presence at a feast of first
reunion.  But  it  was  only  a  first  or  preliminary  reunion:  the
eleven  brothers  still  had  no  idea  that  the  ruler  was  actually
Joseph. In their minds, Joseph was dead.

Although Benjamin saw Joseph with his own eyes, he, too,

had no idea this was his closest brother.

“And Joseph came to the house, and they [the eleven broth-
ers] brought him the gift that was in their hand, to the house,
and bowed down to Joseph to the earth” (Gen. 43:26).

This again harks back to Joseph’s dream at age seventeen.
Only his father and mother were still missing. Joseph asked his
brothers  if  their  father  “had  peace?  Is  he  still  alive?”  (Gen.
43:27). They replied that he was.

“And Joseph lifted up his eyes, and saw Benjamin his broth-
er,  his  mother’s  son,  and  said,  ‘Is  this  your  youngest  brother,
whom you said [something about] to me?’ And he said, ‘God be
gracious to you, my son.’ And Joseph hastened, because feelings
of  compassion  were  being  roused  in  him  toward  his  brother,
and he sought [somewhere] to weep, and he went into his bed

198

“NEW” TRUTHS COME TO CELESTIAL LOVE

chamber and wept there” (Gen. 43:30). Benjamin was his clos-
est brother; he and Benjamin alone shared Rachel as mother.

Divinely  this  is  a  first  reunion  within  Jesus  in  His  human
essence,  one  that  He  sought  for  a  very  long  time.  His  heart  has
yearned for the truth that is symbolized by Benjamin. At this time
the  inmost  in  the  Lord’s  finite  human  essence  is  celestial  —  the
celestial  that  is  a  pure  love  of  the  human  race.  But  this  celestial
love  has  lacked  its  partner,  its  brother,  which  is  the  living,
sparkling truth that comes from the celestial. Now it is brought to
Him in a reunion that advances His glorification wonderfully. The
emotion  expressed  by  Joseph  when  he  sees  Benjamin  discloses
Jesus’ feelings at this time.

The  Lord  felt  a  “mercy  springing  out  of  love”  (AC  5691).
“When such mercy bursts forth it does so from what is inmost, and
it  does  so  as  fast  as  the  blink  of  an  eye  or  flash  of  an  idea”  (AC
5690).  It  is  said,  “feelings  of  compassion  were  being  roused  in
Joseph” (Gen. 43:30). “In the original language, ‘feelings of com-
passion’  is  expressed  by  a  word  which  describes  inmost  or  most
tender love” (AC 5691).

That love is what the celestial level feels when it is united with
the spiritual truth that clearly expresses its nature. It feels whole-
ness, a oneness. With Jesus Christ this is deeply moving. Prior to
this, the human essence has been conjoined with the wonderful but
limited truth of the angels in the heavens. But now the Divine Truth
itself is near – the clear, complete, and Divinely true way of seeing
and  understanding  all  things  of  life. This  truth  is  superior  to  that
seen  by  any  of  the  celestial  angels  of  the  Most Ancient  heavens.
Step by step the “Human Divine”, or the angels who had mediated
for Jehovah, are being replaced by the Divine Human of Jesus, and
this even on the sensuous level (AC 5663:3). This process is only
in  an  early  stage;  it  was  like  a  “general  influx  before  the  joining
together” (AC 5574). But it evokes tenderest love in Jesus, because
it heralds what is to come when His work on earth is complete.

199

THE PATH, CHAPTER 34

The process by which Joseph revealed himself to his brothers
also  tells  of  the  gradual  unifying  of  our  spiritual  being  —  of  our
becoming  “one”  before  the  Lord,  our  becoming  little  children  in
His eyes. It speaks of a coming into wisdom that is filled with inno-
cence and trust. This is possible for us because the Lord Incarnate
undergoes these advanced stages in His glorification. The Joseph in
Him is gradually revealed to His lower mind as it is purified of His
finite maternal heredity.

“.  .  .The  Word  became  flesh  and  dwelt  among  us,  and  we
beheld His glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,
full  of  grace  and  truth”  (John  1:14).  Benjamin  is  Divine  truth,
“full of grace.” The Lord in His human essence, before He is glo-
rified,  receives  this  Divine  truth  finitely  but  deeply.  More  and
more, this truth in Him becomes Divine; it is glorified (AC 10053;
see AC 9315, 9198).

These  inmost  truths  speak  directly  of  why  the  Lord  made  us,
why  we  were  born,  what  our  inmost  destiny  is  in  His  eyes.  The
story of the reunion of Joseph, Benjamin, and Israel speaks direct-
ly to the human heart.

At some point in our lives we learn from the Word that all good
and truth is really the Lord’s, and that of ourselves we do not have
a good heavenly self. Part of us rebels against this. If all of our good
is from the Lord, what is ours? People who are good have a state in
which  they  “make  the  existence  of  a  separate  selfhood  vital  to
delight” (AC 5660:2). The Lord doesn’t break this state. He allows
us to go on with our own thinking even to the point of almost decid-
ing we don’t want good and truth if they come only from the Lord.
At first we don’t feel enough selfhood in this, and therefore we are
allowed to try to find good and truth from some other source.

The Lord allows us the freedom to search and search until we
realize that there is no other source, and come freely to accept His
leadership in our hearts (AC 5660:2).

The  Lord  is  now  giving  or  offering  us  a  “new  will”  (AC

200

“NEW” TRUTHS COME TO CELESTIAL LOVE

5660:3). This is a heavenly selfhood, and those who receive it “no
longer see only themselves in every single thing they do or in every
single thing they learn about and convey to others. Instead they see
their neighbor, the general public, the Church, the Lord’s kingdom,
and so the Lord Himself. The ends (or purposes) they have in life
are  what  undergo  change;  for  ends  which  have  lower  things  —
namely self and the world — in view are removed and higher ones
are introduced to replace them” (AC 5660:3).

We are the ends or purposes we have in view. Our ends speak
of the things we love the most, of what we want to accomplish or
be. In the process of rebirth, a person becomes unselfish goals or
loves!  The  Lord  alone  can  do  this.  He  alone  can  make  an  angel.
What is it like to experience this change?

“The person who is given a heavenly selfhood enjoys. . .a state
of serenity and peace, for he trusts in the Lord and believes that no
evil at all can come to touch him, knowing too that no strong evil
desire can molest him. More than that, those who have received a
heavenly  selfhood  enjoy  true  freedom,  for  being  led  by  the  Lord
constitutes freedom, since one is then led within the sphere of good,
from good, and to good. From this it becomes clear that they enjoy
bliss and happiness, for nothing exists to disturb them — no self-
love at all, consequently no enmity, hatred or vengeance at all; nor
any love of the world at all, consequently no deceitfulness, fear or
unease at all” (AC 5660:3).

We  find  a  hint  of  this  oncoming  state  in  the  last  verses  of
Genesis 43, which speak of the happy feast Joseph gave for his
eleven brothers. What a fulfillment this was to Joseph. He knew
who  these  eleven  men  were,  and  his  heart  sang. He  felt  some-
thing  of  the  release  spoken  of  that  comes  with  a  “heavenly  self-
hood”! But this would have been like only a prophecy, for the
eleven  brothers  did  not  know  who  Joseph  was. There  was  no

201

THE PATH, CHAPTER 34

reciprocal  joy  yet  in  their  hearts,  only  a  wonder  and  trepida-
tion. Representatively, evils were still present in the external natu-
ral  level  (represented  by  the  ten  brothers)  that  prohibited  Joseph
from revealing who he truly was.

TEMPTATIONS TO SPIRITUAL THEFT

THE SILVER CUP
GENESIS 44

Joseph fills his brother’s sacks with grain.  Secretly, 
he places their money back into the sacks, and his 
own silver cup into Benjamin’s sack.

When the brothers have left, Joseph sends his servant 
to pursue them, and accuses them of stealing his cup.

Joseph says he will keep Benjamin as a slave, and the 
rest may go free.

In desperation, Judah offers himself as a slave 
instead, explaining that their father may die if they 
do not bring Benjamin back.

The story now centers on Joseph’s silver cup, and is spiritually
about  temptations  that  are  frighteningly  intense.  Joseph  com-
manded that the pouches of the eleven brothers be filled with
food, “as much as they can carry; and put each one’s silver in
the  mouth  of  his  pouch. And  you  are  to  put  my  cup,  the  cup
made of silver, in the mouth of the pouch of the youngest, and
his silver for grain” (Gen. 44:1,2). Joseph was speaking to his
chief servant, giving these instructions. The servant complied,

203

THE PATH, CHAPTER 35

and when morning dawned, the eleven were sent away.

They  were  only  a  little  beyond  the  city  when  Joseph  com-
manded his chief servant to pursue the eleven and accuse them
of  stealing  his  silver  cup.  The  servant  overtook  them  and
accused  them  of  theft.  They  strongly  denied  this  and  said,
“With whomever of your servants the cup is found, let him die;
and we also will be slaves of my lord. . . .And he [the chief ser-
vant] searched; he began with the oldest and finished with the
youngest.  And  the  cup  was  found  in  Benjamin’s  pouch.  And
they rent their clothes; and each one loaded his ass, and they
returned  to  the  city”  (Gen.  44:9,12,13).  They  came  back  in
despair.

The brothers then came before Joseph, “and fell before him
to the earth” (Gen. 44:14). They made no excuses even though
literally  they  had  not  stolen.  They  simply  said,  “We  are  my
lord’s slaves, even ourselves, even he in whose hand the cup was
found” (Gen. 44:16). Joseph said no, only Benjamin would be
his  slave.  Then  Judah  made  his  plea.  He  told  what  he  had
promised his father Israel before taking Benjamin away from
Canaan to Egypt. Judah said that if Benjamin did not return
now, it would kill their father. “And now I beg you, let your ser-
vant stay instead of the boy, a slave to my lord, and let the boy
go up with his brothers” (Gen. 44: 33).

This  was  Judah  speaking,  who  had  originally  sold  Joseph
into  Egypt  for  money.  What  a  change  had  come  upon  him!
Seeing  this  willingness  to  sacrifice  himself  in  Judah,  Joseph
could not contain his love and compassion. Genesis 45 describes
the touching reunion that then openly took place.

These  temptations  focused  on  theft,  on  the  proclivity  of  the
Lord’s finite maternal human to steal what was rightfully Divine.
Theft is so inscribed on hereditary evil that it seems impossible to
eradicate it. It is deep and fundamental to the states of mediate good
within us, in which we take much credit for things. However, it is

204

TEMPTATIONS TO SPIRITUAL THEFT

an evil, and in time it must be seen as such and shunned if we are
ever to become free.

The apparent theft of Joseph’s cup does not represent the Lord’s
last  temptations  directly.  These  come  later,  at  the  very  end  of
Genesis.  Nevertheless,  on  the  cross  the  Lord’s  finite  maternal
human  would  have  cried  out  for  its  own  self-life,  the  cry  of  that
innate urge for self-preservation that is written on our very bodies.
“My  God,  My  God,  why  have You  forsaken  Me?”  (Matt.  27:46)
But the Lord, at the very end, gave up the illusion of self-life held
by His finite sensuous level, inherited through Mary. He broke that
illusion:  “Father,  into  Your  hands  I  commend  My  spirit”  (Luke
23:46).

This final state has not yet come upon Jesus. The apparent theft
of Joseph’s cup is a powerful temptation that comes before His final
ones. It may have involved the Lord’s seeing in His finite human
how merit is inscribed on human hearts. The despair He feels is for
us: how can human beings ever be freed of this evil that they hug
to themselves so tightly for warmth? His despair is crushing. Yet He
does not yield. He sees the possibility of rebirth even on the lowest
level of the love of self. For in the end, did not Judah offer himself
as a slave to Joseph, even as the lowest or sensuous love of self can
be reborn and submit to the celestial in our hearts?

Joseph’s silver cup evokes images in our memories. One thinks
of the Holy Grail, which legend has it was used by Jesus at the Last
Supper  and  was  brought  to  Britain,  where  it  was  often  sought.
Every time we take the Holy Supper, we drink from a cup, often a
silver cup. The correspondence of Joseph’s silver cup is vital in our
spiritual lives, for it represents truth seen powerfully and as living
reality itself. The silver cup is truth seen beyond any doubt, even as
angels perceive truths in heaven. We seek this cup!

Joseph,  the  celestial  within  us,  fills  the  spiritual  level
(Benjamin) with perceptions of truths — truths that are alive, that
are the only truths of the true church! They are called this because

205

THE PATH, CHAPTER 35

they  alone  are  truly  living  for  us.  Here  is  one  of  life’s  beautiful
states:  when  truths  in  us  receive  loves  that  inflow  from  our  very
inmost,  from  our  earliest  childhood  innocence  and  remains,  and
these truths become alive. They are like wine in the silver cup (AC
5728) and like the new wine at the wedding feast at Cana.

But such a wonderful state is abhorrent to the hells, and espe-
cially to the hells who tempt Jesus Christ when the internal celes-
tial is flowing powerfully into the intermediary with Him, causing
that intermediary (Benjamin) to bring the very Divine present with
it (AC 5689:2). This is the new state coming upon Jesus Christ: He
is becoming the Divine truth — the “Word made flesh” (John 1:14).
This level in the Lord is not yet Divine, but its quality is “next to
the Divine” (AC 5689).

This major progress in the glorification is greeted with venom
and hatred by the hells. They know what is happening, sensing it
through their presence in the Lord’s finite maternal heredity. Seeing
this new progress in Jesus, they attack with all the malice they pos-
sess. So it is with us, after we have experienced the silver cup, and
have fully known its marvel. The hells will attack, and this is our
opportunity  to  make  this  new  state  permanent,  from  the  Lord’s
power.

These temptations are of our sensuous plane. They persist until
there is willing submission of this lowest level to the internal celes-
tial (see AC 5729).

Despair  is  life’s  hardest  state  to  endure.  Despair  is  a  loss  of
hope. All joy in life has hope within it. In this temptation with us,
the  evil  within  our  sensuous  feels  that  it  has  been  discovered,
exposed. It is giving up its hope, and that wracks the human heart.
With the Lord, as we have said, it is despair about human beings
ever  overcoming  spiritual  theft  —  despair  instilled  through  the
Lord’s maternal human.

The despair is expressed in the literal story by the reaction
of the brothers when Joseph’s chief servant finds the silver cup

206

TEMPTATIONS TO SPIRITUAL THEFT

in Benjamin’s pouch. They must have felt, “What’s the use?”
They tore their clothes in misery, and as we have already seen,
went back to Joseph and fell down to the earth in front of him.
They said, “God has found out the iniquity of your servants”
(Gen. 44:16), and we and Benjamin are your slaves. They knew
that they had been dishonest to Jacob in the past even though
in  this  instance  they  had  not  themselves  stolen. When  Joseph
said no, he would keep Benjamin only, then Judah offered him-
self instead, and he meant it with all his heart. These brothers
felt utter despair.

This is not only a spiritual story of temptation but also an illus-
tration of the uses that can come out of such difficult permissions.
What evil is surfacing for open acknowledgment and the opportu-
nity for shunning? The Writings respond:

“The  whole  of  this  chapter  has  as  its  subject  spiritual  theft,
which consists in laying claim to good and truth that come from the
Lord. This is a matter of consequence so great that after death a per-
son  cannot  be  admitted  into  heaven  until  he  acknowledges  in  his
heart  that  nothing  good  or  true  originates  in  himself,  only  in  the
Lord, and that whatever originates in himself is nothing but evil.

“The truth of this is proved to a person after death by means of
many  experiences.  .  .  .Laying  claim  therefore  to  truth  or  good  as
one’s  own  is  the  opposite  of  the  attitude  of  mind  that  reigns  uni-
versally in heaven. It is the opposite of the acknowledgment that all
salvation is due to mercy” (AC 5758:1,2).

These words are easy to accept in theory. It is not hard to say
that  all  good  and  truth  are  the  Lord’s.  But  to  really  acknowledge
this is a lifelong struggle, a struggle that intensifies in the advanced
regeneration of human beings and the advanced glorification of the
Lord. How many of our daily motivations are based on wanting to
appear  intelligent  or  sharp  or  wise?  How  often  are  we  concerned

207

THE PATH, CHAPTER 35

about our position, our superiority? How often do we think we are
good because we have done this or that? This common human trait
is termed “self-righteousness” in the Word, and it is said that from
this quality “many evils well up. Thinking in this way, a person sees
himself  in  every  specific  deed  he  performs  for  his  neighbor;  and
when he does this he loves himself more than anyone else” (Ibid.).
The feeling of merit is terribly hard to get rid of; it has its own
secret warmth, warmth that can hold us in bondage and limit our lives.
The  silver  cup  in  Benjamin’s  pouch  speaks  of  this  merit,  this
theft. Here the merit is especially over truth — thinking of truth as
our own, not the Lord’s. Prior to advanced regeneration, the lower
level in us insists on taking credit for the truth it sees. It is interest-
ing that in the literal story the ten brothers admitted guilt for the
theft, when in this case they had not actually stolen (Gen. 44:
16)!  Here  the  spiritual  reality  overrides  the  literal  situation  (AC
5747:2). Yet the ten had been dishonest in the past, and therefore a
literal truth exists as well.

Spiritually,  the  theft  is  actual.  Their  guilt  about  this  is  com-
pletely valid. Spiritually, our lower level has been stealing from the
Lord for years without our feeling any shame or guilt. We are happy
to claim credit for the wonderful truths we know and speak about.
Suddenly  we  awaken  spiritually.  The  highest  and  most  innocent
level in us (Joseph) accuses us of stealing from the Lord, and now
we know this is true. When and if we actually feel this in our hearts,
we  despair  about  ourselves.  How  despicable  we  are  at  this  level!
How can we ever change? Our despair is complete, even as it was
with the ten brothers who offered themselves to Joseph as slaves.

Judah offered himself in place of Benjamin. Earlier, Judah rep-
resented love of self in the lower level of our hearts and minds, but
now this evil self-love is being shunned, to be replaced by an order-
ly self-love that looks to the Lord. This new love of self (the new
Judah) at last sees the real guilt of the former love and submits itself
completely  to  what  is  inmost,  which  in  reality  contains  the  Lord

208

TEMPTATIONS TO SPIRITUAL THEFT

Himself.  A  real  regeneration  is  taking  place  here,  and  it  comes
about only through first experiencing despair. The sensuous in us is
truly becoming subordinate.

One  of  the  vital  factors  that  enables  this  change  to  happen  is
that  spiritually  Benjamin  is  now  present  with  Joseph.  Benjamin
represents a new perception of truths that was not there before. This
perception, when joined with the celestial love (Joseph), enables us
to shun what before we could not shun. Because we now see truth
as living from the Lord, and see it from highest love, we can there-
fore shun any taking of merit by our outer self. The Lord can purge
this level of its conceit. Truth of a higher level cleanses goods on a
lower level, and this is the heavenly marriage while we are regen-
erating. This higher truth is Benjamin, and he has vision because of
our spiritual Joseph.

The silver cup was in Benjamin’s sack. But in the end, instead
of this being a theft, Benjamin’s possession of the cup was a true
and wonderful representation. The silver cup, the grail, is his! The
last  thing  he  would  do  is  to  take  merit  for  it!  For  he  is  the  Lord
active in the truth we now see and love.

Benjamin  has  been  called  “a  child  of  Israel’s  old  age,  the
youngest one” (Gen. 44:20). The meaning of “old age” is “newness
of life” (AC 5804), and “a child of his old age, the youngest one”
means “truth that is new” (Ibid.). Now there are perceptions of truth
that a person “did not and could not know previously” (Ibid.). This
applies  both  to  Jesus  at  this  stage,  and  to  each  one  of  us  at  this
stage. Now truths possess “life,” whereas before they had “little life
in them” (Ibid.).

Benjamin, when he is with his father Israel, depicts truth seen
from spiritual good, and this is called “new truth” (AC 5806). This
is because truth seen from a state of goodness is the only truth that
is living. We see it as reality itself.

But Benjamin represents a deeper insight into truth when he is
with Joseph. Then he is said to represent “truth even more interior”

209

THE PATH, CHAPTER 35

(Ibid.). Truth springing from celestial love (Joseph) is from an even
higher level. Celestial good is higher than spiritual good. Love of
the  neighbor  (Israel)  or  spiritual  love  is  a  wonderful  love,  and  it
brings warm and beautiful insights. But love of the Lord or celes-
tial love brings warmth and light and visions of use that are higher
even than insights from love of the neighbor.

With  the  Lord  in  His  glorification,  this  “new  truth”  is  Divine
truth drawing near; it represents the Lord’s becoming Divine Truth
by  degrees. The  Joseph  quality  within  Jesus  Christ  brings  Him  a
nearness  to  His  Soul,  and  explains  Jesus’  teachings  and  ministry
during the last three years of His life on earth. It would explain the
miracles He did that restored not only broken bodies, but also bro-
ken spiritual hearts, and even life itself. The inmost origin of such
miracles is His Divine Soul.

Speaking  of  human  beings,  we  would  note  that  the  Joseph  or
celestial “good is like a little flame, which sheds light and provides
illumination, and so enables a person to see, perceive and believe
truths”  (AC  5816:2).  Then  these  inner  truths,  now  alive
(Benjamin),  can  order  and  subordinate  truths  in  our  lower  mind.
Thus Benjamin is the link, the intermediate, that allows our whole
mind to become alive to mercy and to love. With Benjamin present,
the Lord’s mercy can inflow from the inmost, through truths seen
from that inmost, and then down to our outer mind and senses. This
mercy of the Lord makes us alive spiritually (see AC 5816, 5822).
The key to having this happen is shunning evils in the sensuous
level of our lives. Good cannot flow in and reveal itself while evils
still occupy this level. This chapter, with the brothers’ despair and
their full submission in freedom, speaks more deeply of shunning
evils in our outermost life. We are asked by the Lord to cleanse our
sensuous  thinking  from  lusts  and  sense  addictions. What  is  more
difficult? But the result will be the coming of the Lord.

CELESTIAL LOVE REVEALED

JOSEPH REVEALS HIS IDENTITY
GENESIS 45

With great tenderness, Joseph now reveals his 
identity to his astonished brothers. He urges them to 
go and fetch their father and their wives and
children, and to come and live in Egypt with him.

“And  Joseph  could  not  contain  himself  before  all  those
standing with him; and he cried out, ‘Make every man go out
from me.’ And no one stood with him while Joseph made him-
self known to his brothers. And he gave forth his voice in weep-
ing, and the Egyptians heard, and the house of Pharaoh heard.
And Joseph said, ‘I am Joseph. Is my father still alive?’ And his
brothers could not answer him, for they were filled with dismay
at his presence” (Gen. 45:3).

After all, this was the brother they had betrayed, the broth-
er they had wished to kill. Now Joseph asked them to draw near
him, and he talked with them from his heart:

“Do not be grieved, and do not have anger in your eyes that

211

THE PATH, CHAPTER 36

you sold me here; for God sent me before you for the bestowal
of life. . . .God sent me before you to establish for you a remnant
on  the  earth,  and  for  the  bestowal  of  life  on  you  for  a  great
escape. And now you did not send me here, but God. . . .Make
haste and go up to my father, and say to him, ‘Thus said your
son Joseph: God has established me as the lord for all Egypt;
come down to me, do not delay. And you shall dwell in the land
of Goshen. . . .And I will sustain you there, for there are still five
years of famine’. . . .And behold, your eyes see, and the eyes of
my  brother  Benjamin,  that  with  my  mouth  I  am  speaking  to
you. . . .

“ ‘And you must tell my father about all my glory in Egypt,
and all that you see; and you must make haste, and cause my
father  to  come  down  here.’  And  Joseph  fell  on  the  neck  of
Benjamin  his  brother,  and  wept,  and  Benjamin  wept  on  his
neck. And  he  kissed  all  his  brothers,  and  wept  on  them;  and
after that his brothers talked with him” (Gen. 45: selections).

This family that had been torn in two was reunited. Joseph,
who had been considered dead, was found alive. Celestial love,
which comes from remains and innocence from infancy, has long
been hidden. Now rebirth is advanced far enough for this love to
reveal itself again in the consciousness of our hearts. We thought
the  innocent  joys  of  infancy  were  dead,  but  now  we  see  and  feel
that they are alive.

Joseph said, “God sent me. . . .for the bestowal of life on you
for  a  great  escape”  (Gen.  45:7). Escape  from  what?  From  hell,
from being eternally in hell. Many of us may have a deep fear of
going  to  hell,  for  something  in  us  feels  we  deserve  it,  and  at  the
same time we are afraid of this damnation. But Joseph now reveals
that he is sent before us for a great escape. The remains of earliest
infancy are the counterbalance to all our hereditary evil. And if as
adults we try to shun evils as best we can with the Lord’s help, then
the Joseph in us will deliver us from bondage and lead us to a “great

212

CELESTIAL LOVE REVEALED

escape.” Joseph is the Lord’s gift to each human heart, a gift wait-
ing to be received.

The affections expressed in this part of Genesis are a revelation
of Divine love. Few stories in the Word have the tenderness of this
chapter.  Inmostly,  Joseph  symbolizes  the  Lord.  Here  the  Lord
reveals  Who  He  is:  celestial  love  that  embraces  living  truth
(Benjamin) and integrates the entire human mind.

With the Lord Himself, in His glorification, Joseph’s revelation
of his identity is a high point of His being glorified. It speaks of the
long-sought uniting of celestial good and spiritual truth within Him.
Joseph and Benjamin embraced each other, and wept for joy.
This love and truth in the human essence, next to the Divine, pave
the way for the full glorification that is soon to come. Divine truth
is now integrated within the Lord’s Human. He has become Divine
truth: “the Word became flesh” (John 1:14; see also AC 4538, 9670,
9199,  9315).  He  will  become,  stage  by  stage,  the  Divine  good:
Jesus Christ glorified.

All that is needed now is for Israel, the father, to join them.
Israel will be sent for, and when he comes down he can see with
his own eyes and feel with his heart the reality that Joseph is
alive. Joseph said to his brothers: “Tell my father [Israel] about
all my glory in Egypt” (Gen. 45: 13). This is not Joseph being
prideful; it is rather Joseph speaking out of love, reassuring his
father that all is well. The words, “Tell my father about all my
glory” give a key to what this revelation of Joseph may be in the
New Testament, in the Lord’s own life on earth.

When, in the New Testament prior to the Easter story, does the
Lord  Jesus  Christ  first  clearly  show  Who  He  is?  When  does  He
show His glory and deeply move the disciples who were with Him?

“Now  after  six  days  Jesus  took  Peter,  James,  and  John  his
brother, and brought them up on a high mountain by themselves,
and was transfigured before them. His face shone like the sun, and

213

THE PATH, CHAPTER 36

His clothes were as white as light. And behold, Moses and Elijah
appeared to them, talking with Him. Then Peter answered and said
to Jesus, ‘Lord, it is good for us to be here’ ” (Matt. 17:1-4).

If  Joseph’s  manifestation  of  who  he  was  parallels  the  Lord’s
transfiguration, then each of these stories casts light on the other.
This is especially so in the celestial and spiritual senses of the Word
(AC 5922).

On the mount of transfiguration the Lord shows Peter, James,
and John His glory. He shows them “what His Divine Human was
like, and what it looked like in Divine light” (AC 5922:5). They are
seeing the Lord in His Divinity for the first time. It prepares them
for the Lord’s very last temptations and for the beautiful victory of
Easter  morning.  Easter  night,  they  see  the  Lord  in  His  Divine
Human, when He appears in their midst.

Joseph showed his glory to his brothers and he did so out of
love. At the mount of transfiguration, the Lord shows His glory to
the three disciples; He shows that He is the ruler not only of Egypt
(the  sciences),  but  also  of  the  universe. At  the  transfiguration  the
Lord  reveals  that  He  is  the  Divine  truth,  and  reveals  the  glory  of
this. Joseph with Benjamin represents the Divine truth that comes
from Divine love. This is a pre-vision, a prophecy, of the complete
glorification.

The  open  uniting  of  Joseph  with  his  brothers  symbolizes  the
actual joining together of the internal and external loves within us
(see AC 5867). Loves make up our life, and now there are heaven-
ly loves with both our inner and our sensuous levels.

This union, though beautiful, lacks a key presence. To make
the  picture  complete,  Israel  the  father  must  come  down  to
Goshen to join his family. Even Pharaoh was aware of this key
absence. He said to Joseph:

“Say to your brothers, ‘Do this: Load your animals and go,
get you to the land of Canaan. And take your father and your

214

CELESTIAL LOVE REVEALED

households, and come to me’. . . .And Joseph sent his brothers
away, and they went; and Joseph said to them, ‘Do not quarrel
on the way.’ And they went up out of Egypt, and came to the
land of Canaan, to Jacob their father. And they told him saying,
‘Joseph is alive, and he has dominion in all the land of Egypt.’
And Jacob’s heart failed, for he did not believe them. And they
spoke  to  him  all  of  Joseph’s  words  which  he  had  spoken  to
them, and he saw the carts which Joseph had sent to carry him,
and  the  spirit  of  Jacob  revived.  And  Israel  said,  ‘Enough;
Joseph my son is still alive. I will go and see him before I die’ “
(Gen. 45:17,18,24-28).

“[It  is]  enough!”  This  understates  the  surging  joy  in  Israel.
Israel has taken on a newer representation than earlier in this spiri-
tual history, when Jacob’s change to Israel represented the regener-
ation or rebirth of the natural level of our mind. Now Israel is good-
ness in general in our natural lives. This goodness must come and
be united with Joseph, Benjamin, and the ten brothers. For then the
human mind is regenerate on all its levels, and the mind and heart
stand complete: an angel before the Lord.

Our inmost celestial remains or loves need the sparkling truths
represented by Benjamin in order to purify our outer sensations and
reactions  (the  ten  brothers). And  a  part  of  this  picture  is  spiritual
love, or charity, which Israel represents. Charity, spiritual goodness
active in our natural lives, is a key to genuine religion. “All religion
is of the life, and the life of religion is to do that which is good”
(Life 1).

Genuine charity brings all levels of our mind and heart togeth-
er. Only what we do for others out of genuine and sincere motives
really brings heaven to us. This unites our inmost remains and the
truths we love with all our outer life. It brings fulfillment. As Israel
said: “[It is] enough!”

It  is  vital  that  Israel  come  down  and  join  all  his  family  in
Egypt. This represents Divine good in the natural level coming to

215

THE PATH, CHAPTER 36

the Divine truth in the sensuous level, and successively becoming
integrated into the Divine Human. The Lord on earth is becoming,
successively,  “Divine  love  in  human  form”  (AC  4735).  You  feel
this in reading the latter parts of the gospels, especially the gospel
of John. You feel His love in the resurrection of Lazarus, in His giv-
ing the first Holy Supper, in His incredible steadfastness in His last
temptations (see AC 9670:4).

nation in Egypt.

Israel and Joseph are reunited. They embrace and 
weep together.

Israel’s belief that Joseph had been torn to pieces by a wild
beast had haunted his life. To him, Joseph was dead. Within this
conviction is one of the saddest realities of human life, the belief by
adults that the Joseph within them, their earliest innocence, is lost,
gone, and even more brutally, dead. Israel believed this, and he
had the evidence of the torn and bloody tunic. The undamaged
tunic  or  coat  of  many  colors  represents  the  wonderful  variety  of
truths  that  infants  believe  with  trust  and  innocence.  These  truths
may be summarized in the infants’ deep belief that the Lord made
everything: that He is our Father Who tenderly cares for us every
moment. In adult life, it seems that a wild beast destroys both this
earliest innocence and its “childish” beliefs.

217

THE PATH, CHAPTER 37

As time goes on in rebirth, Jacob takes on progressively higher
representations. First he is truth in the natural level, then the good-
ness of truth there, and finally, as Israel, regenerate good there, or
natural goodness that has been remade by truth. Now he has come
to  represent  spiritual  goodness  from  the  natural  level:  the  clear
“charity” or active, everyday love of the neighbor that can come in
old age to the faithful.

The  ten  brothers,  who  had  also  gradually  reformed  and  been
reborn,  came  back  to  Israel  in  Canaan  and  told  him  astonishing
news:

“ ‘Joseph is still alive, and he has dominion in all the land of
Egypt.’ And  Israel’s  heart  failed,  for  he  did  not  believe  them.
And they spoke to him all of Joseph’s words which he had spo-
ken  to  them;  and  he  saw  the  carts  which  Joseph  had  sent  to
carry  him,  and  the  spirit  of  Jacob  their  father  revived.  And
Israel said, ‘Enough; Joseph my son is still alive. I will go and
see him before I die’ ” (Gen. 45:26-28).

On rare occasions we find magical moments in life. Falling in
love  is  one  of  them.  Seeing  truth  as  the  Lord’s  truth  is  another.
Discovering  a  love  of  others  that  is  not  selfish  is  another  (this  is
Israel). But to find that Joseph has not died, that the innocence of
infancy is still within us and alive — this is probably the highest
spiritual experience in life. Very few people find this here on earth,
but many, many people will find this after death. The Lord is with-
in this realization, for He is the originator of our earliest remains.
This  rediscovered  innocence  blesses  our  love  for  our  conjugial
partner  in  ways  inexpressible.  The  Lord  says  this  state  is  one  of
“innocence,  peace,  tranquility,  inmost  friendship,  full  confidence,
and a mutual desire of mind and heart to do the other every good”
(CL 180).

Israel’s journey to Egypt and being reunited with Joseph is
charity, or active love of the neighbor, coming to celestial love and
being conjoined with it. This changes the nature of the charity, for

218

CELESTIAL LOVE AND CHARITY REUNITE

now it is being conjoined with the highest innocence and love in the
human  mind.  It  is  conjoined  with  that  gentle  and  trusting  quality
from the earliest times in our lives, a quality we had thought dead.
In Beersheba, as Israel started his journey down to reunite

with Joseph,

“God  spoke  to  Israel  in  visions  of  the  night,  and  said,
‘Jacob, Jacob.’ And he said, ‘Behold, here I am.’ And He said,
‘I  am  God,  the  God  of  your  father;  do  not  be  afraid  of  going
down to Egypt, for I will make you into a great nation there. I
will also go down with you to Egypt, and I will certainly cause
you to come up also, and Joseph will put his hand on your eyes’ ”
(Gen. 46:2-4).

This  was  the  God  who  had  spoken  to  Jacob  earlier  in  his
life, at Bethel, when he was starting on his journey to Haran.
Now  again,  God  appeared  to  him.  He  reassured  Jacob,  now
called Israel, and said concerning Joseph: “Joseph will put his
hand on your eyes” (Gen. 46:4).

This  statement,  “Joseph  will  put  his  hand  on  your  eyes,”
means  that  charity  would  have  its  inner  eyes  opened,  opened  by
celestial love (AC 6008).

“And Israel traveled on and all that he had” (Gen. 46: 1).
This  traveling  of  Israel  refers  to  the  “beginning  of  the  joining
together” (AC 5996) of Israel and Joseph. This is a spiritual jour-
ney toward reunion, and is “a continuation of and further stage in
the  glorification  of  the  Lord, Who  in  the  highest  sense  is  ‘Israel’
and ‘Joseph,’ whereas a continuation and further stage of a person’s
regeneration is meant in the internal sense” (Ibid.).

To bring the inmost of the human essence in the Lord (Joseph)
to  union  with  the  spiritual  goodness  from  His  natural  or  outer
level (Israel) is “a further stage in the glorification” (AC 5996).
With Him, as with us in potential, spiritual progress is descending
from  inmosts  to  outmosts.  Divine  love  is  coming,  bringing
warmth and life to each successive level of the heart and thought.

219

THE PATH, CHAPTER 37

When  and  if  our  “Israel”  joins  our  “Joseph,”  it  is  like  an  angel
putting his hand on our eyes. When his hand is removed, we see
in a whole new way.

“And  Joseph  harnessed  his  chariot,  and  went  up  to  meet
Israel his father, to Goshen, and he was seen toward him [that
is,  Joseph  presented  himself  to  his  father],  and  Joseph  fell  on
his neck, and wept on his neck a long while. And Israel said to
Joseph, ‘Now let me die, after I have seen your face, that you
are still alive’ ” (Gen. 46:29, 30).

Joseph’s  and  Israel’s  embracing  and  weeping  from  love
express  this  reunion  of  the  inmost  love  with  outer  charity.  They
were weeping and rejoicing because they had found each other.
Joseph was not dead! And Israel had become a changed person.
These two, in their reunion, prophesy much for the spiritual future
of this world. Some time in the future rebirth of humankind, inmost
love  from  infancy  and  outer  charity,  or  kindness  to  the  neighbor,
will reunite in many human hearts. Human charity from the Lord
will  have  its  eyes  opened  from  inmost  love.  Peace  and  kindness
will  come  to  humankind  in  place  of  today’s  wars  and  cruelties.
Joseph  will  put  his  hand  on  Israel’s  eyes,  and  there  will  be  a
blessing.

This is possible now, and will be in the future, because with
the Lord Himself, in His glorification, Joseph and Israel are reunit-
ed. Jesus Christ is successively becoming the Divine good, even as
with  Benjamin,  and  earlier  with  Isaac,  He  had  become  Divine
truth.  “His  Human  was  made  Divine  truth  when  He  was  in  the
world, thus such as is in heaven. But afterwards it was successive-
ly made Divine Good of Divine Love by union with the Father”
(Ath. Cr. 156).

This reunion of Joseph and Israel is another of the key stages in
the Lord’s process of becoming Divine goodness on this earth. This
process was not completed until the end of His temptation on the
cross, when “He made His human Divine Good” (AC 9670:4). The

220

CELESTIAL LOVE AND CHARITY REUNITE

specific words here are: “When He departed out of the world, He
made His Human Divine good” (Ibid.). Still, Israel’s and Joseph’s
reunion is a great step in this process.

Two  primary  truths  are  revealed  here.  One,  as  we  have  seen,
concerns the reunion of inmost innocence and charity or love of the
neighbor.  The  other  focuses  on  “the  joining  together  of  the
Church’s  truths  and  its  factual  knowledges”  (AC  6047:2).
Examples of these “factual knowledges” are the beauty of creation,
the facts of science, the history of civilization, and the origin of the
human  species. This  introduction  of  spiritual  truths  into  the  facts
that  we  know  is  represented  by  Jacob’s  taking  his  whole  family
down to the land of Egypt (which represents worldly knowledge) to
meet Joseph. The name “Jacob” is used in this case, not Israel. “The
reason why the name ‘Jacob’ and not Israel is used is that natural
truth and all that accompanied it must be introduced into the facts
known  to  the  Church,  meant  by  Jacob’s  going  down  into  Egypt
together with his sons” (AC 6001).

Jacob represents natural-level truth here, but behind this is the
powerful inflowing of Divine rational truth within the Lord. This
is what is meant by the verse: “And God said, ‘I am the God of
your  father’  ”  (Gen.  46:3). This  “father”  is  Isaac,  the  Divine
rational. The following phrase: “Do not be afraid of going down
to  Egypt”  (Gen.  46:3) “means  that  natural  truth  and  all  that
accompanies  it  must be  introduced  into  the  facts  known  to  the
Church”  (AC  6004,  emphasis  added).  This  word  “must”  is  used
firmly,  and  means  that  such  introduction  of  spiritual  truths  into
worldly facts is necessary if we would find the Lord and be reborn.
When  truths  are  so  introduced,  then  “when  some  fact  comes  to
mind, the truths that have been gathered into it may be recollected
at the same time” (AC 6004:3).

“It is an essential of Divine order that interior things should be
gathered into exterior ones, so that finally everything prior should

221

THE PATH, CHAPTER 37

be gathered into what is last and lowest and coexist with it. This is
what  happens  in  the  entire  creation.  If  this  were  not  so,  no  one
could be fully regenerated” (AC 6004:4).

Truths  gathered  into  facts,  and  ordering  them,  enable  what  is
interior within our hearts to become one with what is outmost —
the things of our senses. This brings heaven to earth.

“. . .Knowledge dwells in virtually the same inferior light as a
person’s physical sight. This inferior light is such that unless it is
brightened from within by the light received from truths, it leads to
falsities, especially those that are produced by the illusions of the
senses” (Ibid.).

This is a call to become aware that behind all the beauty of cre-
ation, the facts of science, the history of civilization, the origin of
the human species, is the hand of the Divine Creator. When inner
loves, truths, and data are ordered from above, we are open to the
song of David: 

“O Lord, our Lord, how excellent is Your name in all the earth,
You Who  set Your  glory  above  the  heavens.  .  .  .When  I  consider
Your heavens, the work of Your fingers, the moon and stars which
You have ordained, what is man that You are mindful of him, and
the Son of Man that You visit Him?” (Psalm 8:1,3-4)

All  this  is  based  on  a  fundamental  premise  that  innocence  (a
willingness to be led by the Lord) can see what conceit refuses to
see. Innocence sees that there is a Lord, in His Divine Human, Who
created each of us, Who loves us, and Who made all of creation in
order to lead us in freedom to heaven.

It is the Joseph in us that sees. This Joseph welcomes Jacob
and  all  his  children  and  belongings  into  Egypt. He  welcomes

222

CELESTIAL LOVE AND CHARITY REUNITE

truths and goods and innocence into the Egypt of sensual and sci-
entific  knowledge.  For  the  senses  and  sciences  will  gradually
become  truly  alive  for  us,  brightened  by  the  Lord’s  charity  and
light. But it will still take some time. There is still a famine in the
land of Egypt that must be faced and overcome. But the Lord is
coming to us, even to our senses.

== Chapter Thirty-Eight

REBIRTH OF THE SENSUOUS

DEALING WITH THE FAMINE
GENESIS 47

Joseph tells Pharaoh of his family’s arrival.

They settle in the land of Goshen, in Egypt.

The famine remains very severe. When people run 
out of money to buy grain from Joseph, he offers to 
trade them the grain for livestock.

When the livestock runs out, Joseph accepts land 
from the people in exchange for food. The land 
would now belong to Pharaoh. The people would still 
work the land, but give one fifth of their future 
crops to Pharaoh.

Joseph  told  Pharaoh  his  good  news:  Joseph’s  father  and
brothers had come with all their possessions to settle in the land
of  Egypt.  Pharaoh  welcomed  this  from  his  heart,  for  Joseph
had been the savior of Egypt during the famine. Now Pharaoh
could show kindness in return.

“ ‘The land of Egypt is before you; in the best of the land
cause your father and your brothers to dwell; let them dwell in
the land of Goshen. . . .’ And Joseph caused Jacob his father to

224

REBIRTH OF THE SENSUOUS

come,  and  placed  him  before  Pharaoh;  and  Jacob  blessed
Pharaoh. . . .And Joseph sustained his father and his brothers,
and all his father’s household with bread” (Gen. 47:6,7,12).

Pharaoh represents knowledge in the lower level of our mind.
As  this  lower  level  is  ordered  by  inmost  innocence,  it  welcomes
charity (Israel) with deepest respect, and looks to the truths in the
natural (the sons of Jacob) to be shepherds in the land. Such shep-
herds represent true ideas that lead to a good life and which use the
land of Pharaoh (knowledges) wisely (see AC 6059, 6060).

This welcoming of Joseph, Jacob, and Jacob’s sons by Pharaoh
indicates (representatively) a mind receptive of the Lord, a looking
in trust to the Lord in His Divine Human. When Joseph rules and
sustains his father and brothers, things are favorable in human states.
Things  are  favorable  for  the  over-all  rebirth  of  the  human  mind.
With our cooperation and consent, the rational level, together with
the natural, has already been reborn from the Lord’s operations. The
very sensuous, the lowest level, has begun to be truly ordered.

But one tends to forget, when seeing the affirmative progress,
that  “There  was  no  bread  in  all  the  land,  for  the  famine  was
extremely  serious;  and  the  land  of  Egypt  and  the  land  of
Canaan  languished  from  the  presence  of  the  famine”  (Gen.
47:13). Famine  is  a  lack  of  goodness:  here,  in  Egypt,  a  lack  of
goodness in the sensuous level. When there is famine on this low-
est level, there is also a famine in the higher level of the mind, in
Canaan.  This  has  its  counterpart  in  the  New  Testament  in  the
absence of good with many of the Pharisees.

Despite all the good things that have happened to us, we still
feel desolation within. Something vital is missing. Our lowest level
of thinking and feeling is out of kilter, desperately hungry for good.
We  are  uneasy,  searching  for  the  Lord  in  things  of  the  sensuous
level. Why are our senses not alive to inner beauty and love? Why
are our knowledges, though ordered from above, still not sparkling,
seemingly devoid of real life?

225

THE PATH, CHAPTER 38

Something powerful and subtle is standing in the way. This is
hereditary  evil,  still  hidden  within  our  sensuous  level.  It  is  the
strong sense that outer truths and the good we feel outwardly are
ours, and certainly our bodies are ours and not the Lord’s. Where
there is an insistence of self-life, that all things are from self, the
Lord cannot enter. No matter how regenerate our rational or higher
natural  level  may  be,  if  the  lower  level  is  still  a  rebel,  it  affects
states  within.  There  is  a  famine.  Once  again,  it  is  another,  and
stronger, nighttime of the senses.

When  we  read:  “The  famine  was  extremely  serious”  (Gen.
47:13), it  “means  desolation”  (AC  6110). This  is  the  despair  that
comes when good seems to be gone in our outer life.

“And  Joseph  gathered  all  the  silver  found  in  the  land  of
Egypt and in the land of Canaan, for the corn which they were
buying;  and  Joseph  caused  the  silver  to  come  to  Pharaoh’s
house”  (Gen.  47:14). When  we  feel  desolation  and  despair,  the
Lord comes with aid and healing. He gives an inner food that sus-
tains and gives life to our hungry states. He gives us corn, or wheat.
But in return for this good, this “daily bread,” we give Him our sil-
ver. We do this willingly.

Silver here corresponds to “knowledge that held truth in it” (AC
6112). In our sensuous level, and our understanding there, we give
up possession of such knowledge that holds truth. That is, we stop
insisting inwardly that these are ours. Rather, we see these facts as
part of a general whole, part of the Lord’s genuine pattern of cre-
ation. We now realize that all the ideas we take pride in knowing
come  from  associate  good  spirits,  and  ultimately  from  the  Lord.
Our  every  thought  comes  from  Him.  We  must  come  to  want to
ascribe these facts, and the truths within them, to the Lord Himself.
“The most general and all-embracing whole, the source from which
everything  is  held  in  place  is  the  Lord  Himself;  and  what  holds
everything  in  place  is  Divine  Truth  going  forth  from  Him”  (AC
6115:3).

226

REBIRTH OF THE SENSUOUS

With Jesus Christ on earth, this is a far-advanced stage of glo-
rification. He now is being further glorified even as to His sensu-
ous  level. This  is  a  step-by-step  glorification,  and  continues  now
with direct focus on the sensuous level inherited through Mary that
ascribes facts and their truths to itself. This is being changed. Jesus
is rejecting this falsity, cleansing it out of His sensuous. He experi-
ences and lives this state of glorification.

“And when the silver was used up in the land of Egypt and
in the land of Canaan, all Egypt came to Joseph, saying, ‘Give
us bread; and why should we die nearby you because the silver
is  lacking?’ And  Joseph  said,  ‘Give  your  livestock,  and  I  will
give you [bread] in exchange for your livestock, if the silver is
lacking.’ And they caused their livestock to come to Joseph, and
Joseph  gave  them  bread  in  exchange  for  horses,  and  for  live-
stock of the flock, and for livestock of the herd, and for asses;
and he provided them with bread in exchange for all their live-
stock that year” (Gen. 47:15-17).

Bread  for  livestock! The  famine  was  eased;  food  was  pur-
chased. The  desolation  (within)  eased  off  when  the  Egyptians
gave up their farm animals. What do the livestock mean in our
rebirth and the Lord’s glorification? The plea for bread is “a plea
for the sustainment of spiritual life” (AC 6118). When the silver is
gone,  when  knowledges  with  their  truths  are  yielded  up,  there
comes in time “a state of desolation” — “truth seems to have fled”
(AC 6122). It hasn’t really fled, for “all truth and good that the Lord
ever  grants  a  person,  spirit,  or  angel  remains.  None  is  ever  taken
away  from  them,  but  in  a  state  of  desolation  they  become  so
obscured by the person’s selfhood that they cannot be seen” (Ibid.).
Here  is  the  cause  of  obscurity,  of  famine:  “the  person’s  self-
hood”  cuts off heavenly influx. Knowledges with their truths (sil-
ver)  have  been  totally  ascribed  to  the  Lord.  But  now  something
even more meaningful, loves with their truth in the sensuous level
seem gone (AC 6123). Loves in the natural or sensuous level that

227

THE PATH, CHAPTER 38

spring from truths there — these have sustained us and fed us. But
as the famine continues, even these loves with their truths must be
transferred  to  the  Lord.  The  livestock,  which  represent  our  outer
sensual  loves,  must  be  given  to  Joseph  in  return  for  bread.  In
extreme desolation, we realize that even the loves we have felt in
our  outer  life  have  not been  ours  actually.  We  find  at  the  end  of
temptation a new realization. These outer loves are actually also the
Lord’s!  When  we  can  make  this  ascription  with  honesty  and
insight,  the  Lord  does  a  wonderful  thing.  He  inflows  with  bread
from heaven. He sustains us.

Again, this is a new step forward in the rebirth of the sensuous.
Seeing this ends the famine we have known through many states.
Truth  and  knowledges  we  have  honestly  given  to  the  Lord.  Now
love,  too,  we  ascribe  to  Him,  love  in  all  its  various  forms  in  our
outer mind. These loves are defined by the delights they give: they
include all good sensuous delights. These would be delights in the
beauty of nature with its seasons, delights in human artistic expres-
sions, delights in nourishing food and drink, delights of conjugial
love in ultimates. These various forms of delight and their loves are
represented by the variety of livestock handed over to Joseph. This
new insight, this new ascription from the heart, feeds us with heav-
enly food.

“And that year ended, and they came to Joseph in the sec-
ond  year,  and  said  to  him,  ‘We  will  not  hide  from  [my]  lord,
that since the silver has been used up and the livestock of the
beasts has passed to [my] lord, nothing is left before [my] lord
apart  from  our  bodies  and  our  ground.  Why  should  we  die
before  your  eyes,  both  we  and  our  ground?  Buy  us  and  our
ground  for  bread,  and  we  will  live,  and  our  ground,  as
Pharaoh’s slaves; and give us seed so that we may live and not
die, and the ground may not become a waste’ ” (Gen. 47:18,19).
“Nothing is left before [my] lord apart from our bodies and
our ground.” This is the giving up of the belief of our proprium

228

REBIRTH OF THE SENSUOUS

(our feeling of selfhood) that our outmost life, our bodies and their
sensations  are  ours.  Outermost  life  and  sensations  come  through
receptacles  on  the  sensuous  level:  the  five  senses  and  the  strong
appearance of self-life there. Once before there was a challenge and
temptations on this level in a general way. We find this in the story
of  the  butler  and  baker  and  their  dreams.  But  now  these  lowest
receptacles of life meet severe temptations. This is the final refusal
from our proprium to ascribe physical life and its sensations to the
Lord. The contemporary demand by some to retain complete con-
trol of their bodies, with the right to commit suicide, or the right to
abort fetuses in all cases, expresses this lowest physical thinking.
This is the last outpost of evil’s self-love. This is also the case if we
abuse our bodies with harmful substances, believing that our bod-
ies are ours to do with as we feel. If we wish to confirm this appear-
ance,  then  we  limit  ourselves  in  a  stark  way,  for  there  is  a  stage
beyond this that finally invites the Lord to enter our hearts fully.

We cannot pass through this blockade, this temptation, without
feeling terrible desolation. Old people sometimes show this, espe-
cially when the spiritual temptation involved is also combined with
physical  suffering  or  handicaps. Again,  the  Lord  does  not  permit
this in order to punish us. Rather, it enables us to find Him as we
never  have  before.  The  people  of  Egypt  gave  up  their  bodies,
their  labor,  to  Joseph. And  they  gave  up  their  ground  to  him
and Pharaoh. In return, Joseph and Pharaoh gave back four-
fifths of all the harvests with one-fifth coming to Pharaoh. This
was true of all except the priests.

What is happening here? At first we sense terrible depression and
desolation. Then the realization gradually dawns: our bodies are only
receptacles, receptacles of delights and sensations. But their life real-
ly is the Lord’s life in us. We then can actually rise above our bodies
and not let them be the origin of anxiety. We perceive too that the
spiritual body is within our natural one and that we will enter into this
spiritual body with its health and youth upon leaving this world.

229

THE PATH, CHAPTER 38

The body in true order is a receptacle of life and of good from

the Lord (AC 6135).

“I  [Swedenborg]  have  been  able  to  see  quite  clearly  from  the
angels that ‘body’ in the genuine sense is the good of love. When
they [the angels] are present, love floods out of their entire bodies.
Also their bodies have a dazzling appearance full of light shining
from them; for the good of love is like a flame sending out from
itself light, which is the truth of faith derived from that good.

“If this therefore is what the angels of heaven are like, what of
the Lord Himself? He is the source of every spark of love among
the angels, and His Divine Love is seen as the Sun. . . .The Lord’s
Divine Human is what appears in that way and is the Source of all
those  things.  From  this  one  may  now  see  what  is  meant  by  the
Lord’s body – Divine Love, the same as is meant by His flesh. . .
.Also, the Lord’s very body – having been glorified, that is made
Divine – is nothing else than such Love. . . .Nothing else is meant
by ‘body’ in the Holy Supper than the Lord’s Divine Love toward
the entire human race” (AC 6135:3,4).

The desolation of the Egyptians (and of the Egyptians in us)
leads them not to annihilation, but instead to a reception of Divine
Love that is transforming. This is pictured in the Holy Supper, inau-
gurated  by  the  Lord  on  the  Thursday  of  Easter  week.  The  bread
received by His disciples is His Divine love, and the wine is His
wisdom. This indicates what happens to the Lord Jesus Christ at the
culmination  of  His  glorification.  He  becomes  the  “bread  of  life.”
His Body becomes Divine: Divine Love itself.

The  temptations  and  desolation  represented  by  giving  up  the
silver, cattle, bodies and ground are nearly the final temptations of
human regeneration. And with the Lord too, these are almost the
last temptations. They are certainly near if not identical with the
temptations  in  the  garden  of  Gethsemane,  when  “His  sweat

230

REBIRTH OF THE SENSUOUS

became  like  great  drops  of  blood  falling  down  to  the  ground”
(Luke 22:44).

In  return  for  offering  up  their  bodies  and  ground,  the
Egyptians  would  be  given  “seed”  for  crops, which  represents
“an  influx.  .  .of  the  good  of  charity  and  the  truth  of  faith”  (AC
6139). They asked for this seed “so that we may live and not die,”
which means “spiritual life received. . .and the fear of damnation
no  longer”  (AC  6140).  This  seed  they  would  plant  in  the  earth
(goodness in the sensuous level), awaiting rain from heaven or irri-
gation from the Nile. “The fear of damnation no longer” – these
are the sweetest words, and they speak to a fear of old people and
of many others. 

Of  Joseph’s  final  steps  to  feed  the  Egyptians  through  the
years of famine, it is said that “only the ground of the priests he
did not buy, for the priests had a fixed portion from Pharaoh
and  ate  their  fixed  portion  which  Pharaoh  had  given  them;
therefore  they  did  not  sell  their  ground”  (Gen.  47:22).  The
“ground of the priests” here refers to the capacities or talents to
receive good and truth from the Lord.

“A person’s capacities to receive truth and good come directly
from the Lord; he obtains them without any help at all from him-
self.  A  person’s  capacity  to  receive  goodness  and  truth  is  main-
tained in him unceasingly. . . .But a person does not receive them if
he turns to evil. The capacity to receive does, it is true, remain, but
its access to thought and sensitivity is blocked, on account of which
his capacity to see what is true and have a sensitive awareness of
what is good perishes” (AC 6148:2).

Our  abilities,  our  talents,  and  our  receptions  of  loves  and
insights — these come from the Lord. He gives them to us as tal-

visions and new insights when we get conceited. The painting will
not come, or the writing encounters a mental block. Things seem to
go wrong with our creative endeavors. I think this happens in order
to lead us to a truth: our talents are gifts from the Lord. Gifts are
given and are not bartered for. The greatest artists seem to be aware
of this, as when a composer like Handel says that a work like “The
Messiah” comes from the Lord.

A NEW UNDERSTANDING AND

WILL IN THE SENSUOUS

BLESSINGS OF EPHRAIM AND MANASSEH
GENESIS 48

Israel (Jacob) becomes sick, and is near death.

Joseph brings his two sons to his father so that they 
may receive his blessing.

Joseph puts his older son, Manasseh, at Israel’s right 
hand to receive the greater blessing.

Israel, however, crosses his arms and puts his right 
hand on the head of Ephraim, the younger son, and 
his left hand on the head of Manasseh.

This displeases Joseph, but Israel says it must be so.

Israel was now an old man, and his eyes were dim so that he
could not see clearly. Realizing that his father was about to die,
Joseph  brought  his  two  sons  to  Israel  hoping  for  his  blessing.
Israel was told: “Behold, your son Joseph has come to you. And
Israel strengthened himself, and sat on the bed” (Gen. 48:2). He
reminisced then about outstanding events in his lifetime, things
that had touched his heart. He spoke of God’s appearing to him
in Luz (or Bethel), with that vision of the ladder ascending to

233

THE PATH, CHAPTER 39

heaven, and of God’s blessing him then.

Israel spoke warmly to Joseph of his sons: “And now your
two sons. . .they are mine, Ephraim and Manasseh. As Reuben
and Simeon they shall be mine” (Gen. 48:5). Jacob represents the
truth in Jesus’ natural-level mind. Into this level have come truth
and  goodness  (Ephraim  and  Manasseh)  from  a  deeper  source
(Joseph)(see  AC  6234-6238).  This  brings  great  joy  to  Jesus,  as
Joseph’s sons bring great joy to Jacob.

He  also  spoke  of  another  memory  which  still  moved  him
deeply:  “And  as  for  me,  when  I  was  coming  from  Paddan,
Rachel  died  on  me  in  the  land  of  Canaan  on  the  road  when
there was still a stretch of land to go to Ephrath; and I buried
her  there  on  the  road  to  Ephrath  (that  is,  Bethlehem)”  (Gen.
48:7). Bethlehem, where the Lord was later to be born! A sphere of
the Lord touches this verse; for Israel represents the Divine good in
the Lord, and Rachel, Israel’s beloved wife, is the interior love of
truth. Bethlehem, where Jesus was later to be born, is the spiritual
of the celestial: truth seen clearly from love, even the Lord’s Divine
truth seen clearly from Divine Good.

Israel  rejoiced  at  the  chance  to  bless  Ephraim  and
Manasseh, Joseph’s two sons born in Egypt. He said to Joseph:
“I did not think to see your face, and behold, God has caused me
to see your seed also” (Gen. 48:11). The blessings that follow have
an  interesting  correspondence.  Joseph  presented  Manasseh  to
Israel’s right hand and Ephraim to Israel’s left hand. In ancient
biblical times, the right hand gave the priority and higher blessing.
But Israel did a strange thing. He did this even though he
could not see well, being led to an enactment that came direct-
ly  from  God.  “Israel  put  out  his  right  hand  and  placed  it  on
Ephraim’s  head,  who  was  the  younger,  and  his  left  hand  on
Manasseh’s  head;  crosswise  he  put  out  his  hands.  .  .  .”  (Gen.
48:14). In so blessing them, he said: “May God bless the boys,
and in them will my name be called, and the name of my fathers

234

A NEW UNDERSTANDING AND WILL IN THE SENSUOUS

Abraham and Isaac; and may they increase into a multitude in
the midst of the earth” (Gen. 48:16).

Joseph tried to correct Israel’s error in his placing his right
hand on Ephraim’s head and his left on Manasseh’s, the first-
born.  “Joseph  saw  that  his  father  placed  his  right  hand  on
Ephraim’s  head,  and  it  was  wrong  in  his  eyes”  (Gen.  48:17).
But Israel refused to make a change. He said: “I know, my son,
I know; he [Manasseh] too will be a people, and he too will be
great; but truly, his younger brother will become greater than
he, and his seed will be the fullness of nations” (Gen. 48:19).

The chapter concludes: “And Israel said to Joseph, ‘Behold,
I am dying; and God will be with you, and will bring you back
to the land of your fathers. And I give you one portion above
your brothers, which I took out of the hand of the Amorite with
my sword and my bow’ ” (Gen. 48:21,22).

The  deeper  meaning  within  this  chapter  treats  of  the  role  of
Ephraim and Manasseh in the glorification of the Lord’s sensuous
level, and of the rebirth of our sensuous level. Within us, Manasseh
represents the new will in the natural, and Ephraim the new under-
standing in the natural (AC 6222; cf. AC 6234, 6236). The natural
includes a number of levels ranging from the rational to the sensu-
ous, and even to the body in the widest definition. The rational has
already been reborn, as has the higher level of the natural. We see
this in the stories of Isaac and Jacob, renamed Israel. That Joseph
and his life are tied to the rebirth of the sensuous is quite evident in
the Arcana treatment of the dreams of the butler and the baker.

This  rebirth  comes  in  the  final  stages  of  regeneration,  and  in
these stages nature opens up as the Lord’s heaven on earth. It sings
and speaks from within of heavenly life. Nature becomes again, as
it was with the Most Ancient peoples, a medium of contact with the
angels (AC 1802-6).

This is possible because the Lord reaches this stage of the glo-
rification: His Sensuous is made Divine. He establishes the path of

235

THE PATH, CHAPTER 39

Ephraim (a new understanding) as being first in His sensuous, and
then Manasseh (a new will).

It  is  interesting  that  as  Israel  blessed  his  grandsons,
Ephraim, the younger came first and Manasseh second. Truth
or understanding (Ephraim) leads the way to the rebirth of good-
ness on the sensuous level, just as truth takes first leadership on the
higher levels of the mind. Earlier in Biblical and spiritual history,
Jacob came before Esau. Truth coming into our understanding must
happen  first  in  rebirth.  Later  in  Genesis  (Genesis  38),  there  are
Perez and Zerah, born of Tamar and Judah. Perez symbolizes the
first truth to regenerate the sensuous, and Zerah the first good that
follows (see Chapter 27, The Path). If we try to put our will first,
prior to applying the discipline of truth, we inevitably go astray, for
our will at each level is flawed until truth seemingly leads the way
and establishes genuine order. The word “seemingly” (AC 6217) is
used  because  behind  any  self-discipline  obtained  by  means  of
revealed  truth  is  the  motivating  factor  in  our  will  of  earliest
remains:  remains  of  goodness!  Though  we  seem  to  compel  our-
selves sometimes to live according to true principles “against our
will,” it is really the hidden remains of goodness in our will which
motivate us to do so!

Our  sensuous  level  is  the  nest  or  home  of  hereditary  evil  ten-
dencies. We need only look at the disorders on the sensuous level in
the world, and look into our own hearts and motivations, to see that
the senses are easily prone to evil. “The flesh is weak” (Matt. 26:41).
The  Lord,  however,  leads  us  past  the  Ephraim  stage  of  self-
compulsion, even to the Manasseh state: to the birth of a new will
in  the  sensuous  itself,  which  allows  the  Lord  to  flow  with  His
warmth into our outer earth, to our senses. This means that the body
stops  ruling  us.  Sensual  delights  become  subordinate;  heavenly
loves are uppermost. Charity and love lead instead of bodily lusts
and anxieties. It was Joseph who saw a truth when it came to the
genuine relationship of Manasseh and Ephraim. It was “wrong in

236

A NEW UNDERSTANDING AND WILL IN THE SENSUOUS

his eyes” (Gen. 48: 17) that Israel gave priority of blessing to
Ephraim.

The Arcana explains that the phrase “it was wrong in his eyes”

means “displeasure.”

“The reason why Joseph was displeased was that he represents
the internal celestial, which is above the spiritual good that ‘Israel’
represents. What is higher can discern the nature of anything done
in what is lower, and so can also discern whether or not any thought
there is the truth. . . .What is higher can see whatever exists in lower
parts,  because  it  does  so  in  the  light  of  heaven.  .  .  .The  internal
celestial, which is ‘Joseph,’ could see that spiritual good from the
natural, which is ‘Israel,’ was making a mistake” (AC 6288).

In the long run, good always has priority over truth. The inter-
nal celestial (Joseph) sees this clearly. But in the shorter run, in the
process of rebirth, truth seemingly takes priority over goodness for
a time. Israel was right in the short run; Joseph was right eternally
(AC 6240)!

“And  Israel  said  to  Joseph,  ‘Behold  I  am  dying;  and  God
will  be  with  you,  and  will  bring  you  back  to  the  land  of  your
fathers’  ”  (Gen.  48:21). “Dying”  means  “awaking  to  life”  (AC
6302),  and  with  Israel  this  means  “new  life”  (Ibid.).  The  Divine
good in the Lord’s natural level represented by Israel is now being
glorified. This is a truly tremendous step in those successive stages
by which the Lord became Divine good (Ath. Cr. 156, AC 2649).
Gone would be a major blockage from the Lord’s finite maternal
heredity,  which  had  connected  impurity  with  sensuous  delight.
Through  His  process,  Jesus  rediscovers  and  re-establishes  the
Divine  in  the  human  sensuous  level.  He  can  feel  more  fully  than
ever the Divine goodness and truth that exist there. There are only
the final steps to be taken: the complete glorification of the sensu-
ous level and the body.

A REVIEW OF THE GLORIFICATION

ISRAEL’S FINAL BLESSINGS
GENESIS 49

Israel gives final blessings or curses to his sons.

He instructs them to bury him with his ancestors, 
and then he dies.

The final two chapters of Genesis bring the history of Israel
and then of Joseph to fulfilling ends. Israel, an old man, called
his twelve sons to him, and by Divine leadership gave blessings
or  curses  to  each  son.  In  these  blessings  we  find  some  of  the
most touching poetry of the Word. The last verse of Genesis 49
reads: “And Jacob finished commanding his sons, and he gath-
ered up his feet toward the bed, and expired, and was gathered
to his peoples” (v. 33).

“And  was  gathered  to  his  peoples.” In  this  is  a  truth  that
speaks of death as the angels see it. It is not the end. It is rather the
true beginning, the fulfillment of the purpose of life on earth. Death
then, in the spiritual sense, means new life. In this there is the heart-
beat of hope rather than any lasting tragedy. Israel was “gathered to
his peoples” in the spiritual world. By this great step in Israel’s life
is  meant  the  Lord’s  coming  into  Divine  good  in  His  natural  as  a

238

A REVIEW OF THE GLORIFICATION

whole.  This  Divine  good  is  His  intense,  compassionate  love  for
each human being ever born.

When  did  He  become  Divine  good  or  love  on  this  natural
plane? In the Old Testament, it was when Israel finished his bless-
ings and then died. In the New Testament, it was at the conclusion
of the temptation in the Garden of Gethsemane. He then “rose up
from prayer, and came to His disciples” (Luke 22:45). To “rise up”
is to be elevated into a new state, and with Jesus here, into Divine
good or love itself on the natural plane. This coming into Divine
good helps Him to face the betrayal, trials, persecution, and cruci-
fixion that are to come. He faces these with Divine love, not with
defeating despair. But the finite human level was still present in His
senses  and  body.  The  sensuous  level  is  not  yet  the  Divine  Good
(Ath. Cr. 156).

Both Israel and Joseph came into peace and fulfillment before
their  deaths.  Each  came  into  a  golden  state.  The  New  Testament
gives much of the shock and temptations of the Lord’s last days on
earth, but words of hope are there as well. However, it is in the Old
Testament, in the story of the final days of Israel and Joseph, that
the  Lord’s  love  and  hopes  in  these  last  few  days  are  more  fully
revealed.

“And Jacob called his sons, and said, ‘Gather together, and
I  will  tell  you  what  will  happen  to  you  at  the  end  of  days.
Assemble  and  hear,  O  sons  of  Jacob,  and  hear  Israel  your
father’ ” (Genesis 49:1,2).

What  follows  are  both  curses  and  blessings  of  the  sons.
Certain  ones  are  cursed,  and  certain  ones  are  blessed. The
twelve  sons  with  us  represent  major  qualities  that  comprise  the
human mind: those goods and truths, or their opposites, that make
up a human being. Why, at the end of His life on this earth, did the
Lord  make  this  summation  of  qualities  composing  the  human
mind? It reminds me of the discovery that, when near death and res-
urrection, a person experiences a quick review of his entire history,

239

THE PATH, CHAPTER 40

his entire lifetime on earth. Did the Lord experience such a review
now of His entire glorification?

Israel’s blessings and curses seem to be a summation of the glo-
rification itself: a brief, clear overview of the Divine process. First,
in the curses of Reuben, Simeon, and Levi, it exposes qualities in
the finite human heredity through Mary. Then comes a presentation
of the human Divine, those qualities of the celestial kingdom that
the Lord assumed when “He bowed the heavens. . .and came down”
(Psalm 18:9). Judah represents this human Divine.

Then follow Zebulun, Issachar, Dan, Gad, Asher, and Naphtali.
The “blessings” contain, in some cases, an unveiling of the nega-
tive or finite human hereditary qualities, and then the Divine qual-
ities,  which  become  present  after  temptation  and  glorification.
They seem to be an outline of the glorifying of the Human, Jesus,
that Jehovah assumed on earth. Following this is a soaring, uplift-
ing song which is in the blessing upon Joseph. This seems in the
celestial sense to be a portrayal of the Divine Human glorified. It
shows Joseph in his glory, even as the transfiguration showed the
Lord in His glory. Benjamin follows last, as the Divine brother of
Joseph.

Three of these sons of Israel now especially deserve study and
reflection. They signify highest qualities of the Lord Jesus Christ
and their effects with us, the Lord’s children.

Of Judah, Israel said:
“Judah  are  you,  your  brothers  will  praise  you;  your  hand
will be on the neck of your enemies. Your father’s sons will bow
down to you. A lion’s cub is Judah; from the plunder you have
gone up, my son. He crouched, he lay down like a lion, and like
an  old  lion;  who  will  rouse  him?  The  scepter  will  not  be
removed from Judah, nor the lawgiver from between his feet,
until Shiloh comes; and to him will be the obedience of the peo-
ples. He binds his young ass to the vine, and the foal of his she-
ass to the outstanding vine; he washes his clothing in wine, and

240

A REVIEW OF THE GLORIFICATION

his garment in the blood of grapes. His eyes are red from wine,
and his teeth white from milk” (Gen. 49:11).

Judah is the celestial church (AC 6363), that is, all those who
live from an innocent love of the Lord. This church is “superior to
all the rest” (AC 6364). The hells flee from the celestial; its inno-
cence puts terror into evil. In this innocence is an “innate strength”
(AC 6367), which is depicted as a “lion’s cub.” After being called
a lion’s cub, Judah is likened to a young lion and an old lion. This
is the power of the celestial, which “is safe when among all those
in the hells” (AC 6370).

The Most Ancient Church on this earth, and the celestial heav-
en  that  is  made  up  of  people  from  this  church,  manifested
humankind as the Lord intended. Its innocence, trust, and wisdom
were  those  of  wise  children:  “The  scepter  will  not  be  removed
from Judah, nor a lawgiver from between his feet, until Shiloh
comes”  (Gen.  49:10). Before  the  Lord  became  incarnate,  He
inflowed  into  the  good  people  on  this  earth  through  the  celestial
kingdom, the celestial angels. When He appeared to Old Testament
leaders  and  prophets,  He  appeared  through  a  celestial  angel. The
Lord’s power on earth then rested with these angels: through them
He  touched  the  hearts  of  people  upon  earth.  This  presence  of
Jehovah was called the human Divine (AC 2814). Judah represent-
ed  these  celestial  angels,  and  this  prophecy  said  that  the  scepter
would not depart from Judah until Shiloh comes.

What the Lord lacked before His incarnation was a body visi-
ble  to  our  minds  and  hearts.  He  did  not  have  what  is  called  the
Divine  natural  (see  TCR  109).  He  could  not  inflow directly into
human minds on earth; He needed to go through Judah, the celes-
tial kingdom. This was effective until humankind experienced the
fall into evil. As soon as the fall took place, the Lord prophesied in
Genesis 3:15 that He would be born on earth: “And I will put enmi-
ty  between  you  [the  serpent]  and  the  woman,  and  between  your
seed and her Seed. He shall bruise your head, and you shall bruise

241

THE PATH, CHAPTER 40

His heel.” This “He” is the Lord Jesus Christ, to be born of the vir-
gin Mary.

After the fall of humankind, human beings fell more and more
deeply into evil, and the celestial kingdom (Judah) proved weaker
and  weaker  in  reaching  down  to  affect  and  reform  human  hearts.
Judah  did  reign,  the  “scepter”  did  not  depart  from  Judah,  nor  a
“lawgiver from between his feet,” until Shiloh came. The “lawgiv-
er from between his feet” means truths through the celestial angels
in lower things (AC 6372). But this truth, too, was becoming less
and less effective (see AC 6373). It could not reach down into the
lower, fallen natural and sensual levels in which people were living.
Then “Shiloh” came! The Lord Jesus Christ was born on earth,
an infant babe in Bethlehem of Judea. The coming of Shiloh means
“the Lord’s coming, and the peaceful tranquility at that time. This
is  clear  from  the  meaning  of  ‘Shiloh’  as  the  Lord, Who  is  called
Shiloh because He brought peace to all things and gave them tran-
quility; for in the original language Shiloh is derived from a word
meaning tranquil” (AC 6373).

After  Israel’s  prophecy  concerning  Judah,  six  other  sons
received their “blessings.” Then follows the blessing upon Joseph.
Joseph represents the “Shiloh” who was to come, the “Shiloh” Who
would restore Divine truth and the power of the Lord to free and
touch human hearts.

Of Joseph, Israel said:
“The son of a fertile one is Joseph, the son of a fertile one
beside a spring. . . .He will sit in the strength of his bow, and the
arms of his hands are made strong by the hands of the power-
ful Jacob — from there is the shepherd, the stone of Israel. By
the God of your father, Who will help you, and together with
Shaddai, Who will bless you with the blessings of heaven from
above, the blessings of the deep lying beneath, the blessings of
the breasts and of the womb. The blessings of your father will
prevail  over  the  blessings  of  my  ancestors,  even  as  far  as  the

242

A REVIEW OF THE GLORIFICATION

desire  of  the  everlasting  hills.  They  will  be  on  the  head  of
Joseph, and on the crown of the head of the Nazarite among his
brothers” (Gen. 49:22-26, selections).

Each phrase in Israel’s blessing of Joseph speaks of potentials
for each one of us. “Since ‘Joseph’ is the fruitfulness of good and
the multiplication of truth, he is called (in Israel’s blessing) ‘the son
of a fertile one’ “ (AC 6417). That Joseph “will sit in the strength
of his bow” (Gen. 49:24) and that his arms “are made strong by the
hands of the powerful Jacob” (Ibid.) describe the power that can be
gained  from  revealed  truth  that  is  truly  present  in  “doctrine,”  or
religious principles (AC 6423). Also the fact that power will inflow
through this truth “from the almighty power of the Lord’s Divine
Human” (AC 6425, see 6424).

Joseph’s  blessing  speaks  of  the  “shepherd,  the  stone  of
Israel” (Gen. 49:24). Inmostly, this Shepherd surely is the Lord,
for a shepherd spiritually is “one who leads to the good of charity
by means of the truth of faith” (AC 6426). The 23rd Psalm tells of
reality: “The Lord is my Shepherd.” And the “stone of Israel” here
“is used in the highest sense to mean the Lord” (AC 6426:3). This
“stone which the builders rejected has become the head of the cor-
ner” (Psalm 118:22).

In further speaking of Joseph in his blessing, Israel proph-
esied:  “By  the  God  of  your  father,  Who  will  help  you,  and
together with Shaddai, Who will bless you with the blessings of
heaven from above, the blessings of the deep lying beneath, the
blessings  of  the  breasts  and  of  the  womb”  (Gen.  49:25). The
“God  of  your  father”  is  “the  God  of  the  Ancient  Church”  (AC
6428).  “God  Shaddai”  means  “the  Lord,  the  bringer  of  benefits
after temptations” (AC 6429).

From the Lord a regenerating person will receive “blessings of
heaven  from  above”  (Gen.  49:25).  These  “mean  blessings  with
goodness and truth from a source within” (AC 6430). This tells of
love  and  faith  touching  us  tenderly  from  within,  changing  our

243

THE PATH, CHAPTER 40

nature.  Also  given  are  “blessings  of  the  deep  lying  beneath”
(Gen.  49:25),  which  tell  of  factual  knowledges  marvelously
ordered  by  Divine  truth.  When  revealed  truth  orders  our  percep-
tions of science and nature, it transforms them into real blessings.
Outer creation becomes  a theater representative of the Lord and of
His heaven, as it was in earliest times (AC 1802-6).

The  “blessings  of  the  breasts” mean  special  affections  of
“goodness and truth” (AC 6432), which is the gentleness of conju-
gial love, received from the Lord. The breasts “mean those affec-
tions, because the breasts communicate with the generative organs,
and for that reason belong to the province of conjugial love. . . .In
addition they derive that meaning from the fact that the breasts are
what feed infants, and so mean, through the affection that goes with
breast-feeding, conjugial love when joined to the love of offspring”
(Ibid.). The final words of this verse speak of the Lord giving bless-
ings  “of  the  womb.” This  means  inmost  love  and  faith  “joined
together”  (AC  6433).  “This  is  clear  from  the  meaning  of  ‘the
womb’ as the inmost center of conjugial love” (Ibid.). The Lord’s
pearl  of  great  price  is  the  restoration  of  conjugial  love,  the  love
between one man and one woman, which comes in innocence from
the Lord.

Israel then promises: “The blessings of your father will pre-
vail over the blessings of my ancestors, even as far as the desire
of the everlasting hills” (Gen. 49:26). To people on earth now this
offers special promise. For blessings that go as far “as the desire of
the  everlasting  hills”  mean  “as  far  as  celestial  mutual  love”  (AC
6435), that is, a more deep and genuine love of the neighbor that
flows  out  from  an  innocent  love  of  the  Lord.  The  hope  for  the
Church on earth is for it to progress, under the Lord’s leadership, to
a return to a golden age, but now a new golden age of celestial love
(see AC 6435:1,3).

Following the blessing of Joseph, we read of Benjamin:
“Benjamin  is  a  wolf;  he  will  seize  in  the  morning,  he  will

244

A REVIEW OF THE GLORIFICATION

devour  the  spoil,  and  at  evening  he  will  divide  the  plunder”
(Gen. 49:27). How strange! Why, after the beautiful blessing upon
Joseph, is Benjamin cursed? Why do the blessings end by seeming
to curse the youngest son?

But this is a case where affirmative, not negative, representa-
tives rule. This is not a curse; it is a blessing! Benjamin is truth of
celestial good (AC 6440). He is, as we have seen before, new truth,
and the only truth of the church (see AC 6440). He is also defined
as “the spiritual of the celestial” (AC 9592), living truth from the
highest level open to us. That here he is called a wolf, “means an
eagerness to rescue and deliver the good. . . .It is evident [from lit-
eral passages in the Word] that ‘a wolf’ means those who seize, but
here one who rescues from hell those who have been seized” (AC
6441). This passage points out that a lion is also a rapacious animal,
“but  in  the  good  sense  ‘lion’  means  truth  when  empowered  by
good. (The Lord Himself is likened to a lion.) Something similar
applies also to other ravenous creatures, such as leopards or eagles”
(Ibid.).

That Benjamin “ ‘will seize in the morning, he will devour the
spoil’ means that the deliverance takes place when the Lord is pres-
ent” (AC 6442). “ ‘And in the evening he will divide the plunder’
means  their  possession  in  the  Lord’s  kingdom”  (AC  6443).
Benjamin here represents a powerful and liberating quality in the
Lord’s Divine Human glorified: this is His “eagerness to rescue and
deliver the good” (AC 6441). He will rescue them from evil states
as  they  respond  in  freedom  to  His  new  truth  [Benjamin],  and  He
will lift them into the Lord’s kingdom. When this happens, those
rescued  will  be  “at  first  in  obscurity”  (AC  6443),  but  eventually
they will come into clear light (Ibid.). In an affirmative passage, it
is said: “There is little Benjamin, their leader…” (Psalm 68:27).

“All  these  are  the  twelve  tribes  of  Israel,  and  this  is  what
their father spoke to them, and he blessed them, each according
to  his  blessing  he  blessed  them. And  Israel  commanded  them

245

THE PATH, CHAPTER 40

and said to them, ‘I am being gathered to my people; bury me
with my fathers, at the cave, which is in the field of Ephron the
Hittite,  in  the  cave  which  is  in  the  field  of  Machpelah,  which
faces Mamre in the land of Canaan, which Abraham bought. .
.  .There  they  buried Abraham  and  Sarah  his  wife;  there  they
buried Isaac and Rebekah his wife; and there I buried Leah. . . .’
And Jacob finished commanding his sons, and he gathered up
his feet toward the bed, and expired, and was gathered to his
people” (Gen. 49:28-33, selections).

Abraham is the Lord’s celestial from childhood, which is glori-
fied; Isaac is His rational, which is glorified; Jacob is His natural,
which also is glorified.

The cave of Machpelah then, to the angels and the Lord, is a
place of life, of wondrous entrance into glory. That Jacob now died,
and was “gathered to his people” is the next-to-last stage of the glo-
rification.

Joseph still lives in the nearly glorified Jesus Christ. Joseph is
still the celestial of the spiritual in His human essence not yet glo-
rified.  This  alone,  along  with  His  outer  senses  and  body,  is  still
finite. The last chapter of Genesis tells of this final glorification. It
gives a different aspect to the Easter story itself.

GLORIFICATION

THE FINAL YEARS OF JOSEPH
GENESIS 50

There is a great ceremony honoring the embalming 
and burial of Israel, with mourning by Joseph and 
his family, and also by the Egyptians.

Joseph tenderly assures his brothers that he has 
forgiven their past sins against him.

Joseph lives to see his great grandchildren. Then, 
after assuring his family that God will eventually 
bring them back to Canaan, he dies.

Joseph’s body is embalmed. Much later, it will be 
carried to Canaan.

We come now to the end of the Lord’s glorification as shown
through Genesis. In this final chapter in Genesis, we will learn of a
great farewell for Israel, a final reconciliation between Joseph and
his  brothers,  and  the  golden  old  age  and  death  of  Joseph.  In  the
New Testament, the parallel story includes the Lord’s last tempta-
tion on the cross, His states of love and compassion as His tempta-
tion ends, and His death and glorification. The Lord’s states of love
and compassion on the cross are depicted in the internal sense of

247

THE PATH, CHAPTER 41

the final experiences of Joseph’s old age.

“And Joseph fell upon his father’s face, and wept on him,
and kissed him” (Gen. 50:1). Joseph mourned and felt anguish
at his father’s death. He had Israel embalmed. Then followed a
long  period  of  mourning,  both  for  Israel’s  family  and  for  the
Egyptians.  “And  the  Egyptians  wept  for  Israel  for  seventy
days” (Gen.  50:3).

After this period of mourning, Joseph asked Pharaoh’s per-
mission to take Israel’s body to Canaan to be buried in the cave
of Machpelah, as Israel had requested.

“And  Pharaoh  said,  ‘Go  up  and  bury  your  father,  as  he
made you swear on oath.’ And Joseph went to bury his father;
and there went up with him all Pharaoh’s servants, the elders
of  his  house,  and  all  the  elders  of  the  land  of  Egypt. And  the
whole house of Joseph, and his brothers, and his father’s house;
only their young children, and their flocks, and their herds they
left in the land of Goshen.

“And there went up with him both chariots and horsemen;
it was an extremely large army. And they came to the thresh-
ing-floor  of Atad,  which  is  at  the  crossing  of  the  Jordan,  and
wailed  there  with  a  great  and  extremely  loud  wailing;  and
Joseph  made  a  mourning  for  his  father  seven  days.  And  the
inhabitants  of  the  land,  the  Canaanites,  saw  the  mourning  at
the  threshing-floor  of Atad,  and  they  said,  ‘This  is  an  intense
mourning for the Egyptians’; therefore they called the name of
it Abel  Mizraim,  which  is  at  the  crossing  of  the  Jordan. And
Israel’s  sons  did  for  him  thus,  as  he  had  commanded  them”
(Gen.  50:6-12).

Israel symbolizes a general goodness in the natural, and now,
with his death, this goodness is glorified, made Divine. The Lord
has almost completed the successive states of becoming the Divine
Good  (see  Ath.  Cr.  156,  AC  4538).  Jesus  said  in  the  New
Testament: “ ‘Father, glorify your name.’ Then a voice came from

248

ANGUISH, RECONCILIATION, GLORIFICATION

heaven, saying, ‘I have both glorified it and will glorify it again’ ”
(John  12:28).  At  this  point  in  the  Genesis  series,  the  Lord  has
become the Divine good or love as to the whole natural, except its
outmost parts.

What is left to be glorified in Jesus is the celestial of the spiri-
tual (Joseph) which is the Lord’s burning love for the salvation of
humankind. Also, His outer sensation and His body have yet to be
fully purified.

The hells still have access to the Lord despite the fact that He
has  now  become  Divine  Good  or  Love  on  His  natural  level.  His
senses and body are still finite, and in those levels His finite mater-
nal human heredity still has its awful foothold. This is seen in the
Lord’s lament on the cross: “My God, My God, why have You for-
saken Me?” (Matt. 27:46) His cry comes not from His Divinity but
from His finite human essence, which is still feeling separated from
His Soul. In the extreme of this final temptation, He feels He can-
not save humankind. Through seeing the evil heredity operating in
His own senses, He is aware of the evil in our senses. Then all the
hells flow in together when He is in agony on the cross and infuse
the belief that humankind, in its perverted sensuous, is too evil to
be saved.

We  cannot  comprehend  how  awful  this  temptation  is  for  the
Lord. It attacks Him where He is still vulnerable and devastates His
love. He realizes, I believe, that in this battle the Divine Good now
present  in  His  natural  level  (Israel)  is  insufficient  to  save
humankind in these sensory-level temptations.

The great mourning procession that escorts Israel’s body out of
Egypt and up to Canaan represents an intense mourning that there
is not yet a goodness in Jesus powerful enough to save humankind,
not in His last temptations that include the celestial (Joseph) and the
senses (the Egyptians here). Something is still needed, desperately.
The procession came “to the threshing-floor of Atad, which is at
the crossing of the Jordan, and wailed there with a great and

249

THE PATH, CHAPTER 41

extremely loud wailing” (Gen. 50:10). “And the inhabitants of
the land said, ‘This is an intense mourning for the Egyptians’ ”
(Gen. 50:11).

The  Lord  on  the  cross,  in  the  depth  of  His  last  temptation,
knows  that  He  still  lacks  that  final  quality  which  can  save
humankind. He lacks Divinity on the plane of the senses and His
body. If He is to save us in our worst trials, when inmost love and
the body are both in despair, He has to take another and final great
step. He has to give up what is finite: He has to be transformed, glo-
rified, even as to His senses and His body.

But before this happens, He experiences the utter devastation of
His final temptation. He sees that in our senses and bodies rest the
hereditary  evils  that  would  defeat  us.  Here,  in  the  last  stages  of
regeneration, is where we would fail. He not only sees this: He feels
it to the very core of the Joseph within Him, the very core of His
celestial  but  finite  love  of  us.  This  agony  is  given  a  voice  at  the
threshing floor of Atad at the Jordan. For there there was a “great
and extremely loud wailing” (Gen. 50:10), an “intense mourn-
ing” (v. 11).

The threshing-floor is the good of love (AC 7377: 4) in the Lord
(Joseph)  which  is  in  agony  regarding  the  ultimate  evils  in
humankind.  This  wailing  happens  at  the  Jordan,  the  ultimate
boundary  of  Canaan. The  Egyptians  too  witnessed  a  terrible  sad-
ness, an “intense mourning” (Gen. 50:11).

The temptation focuses on the outmost level of the Lord’s mind,
and  in  our  regeneration  on  the  outermost  of  our  minds.  The
Egyptians here represent the sensory level, home of both sensory
knowledges and sensory delights. Here is where we would fail. The
hells force this reality into the Lord’s suffering heart and mind. He
knows  there  is  still  one  great  and  terrible  step  to  take.  His  finite
human essence needs to be yielded up and glorified. To have this
happen, He must endure the agony of this temptation to its end. The
Lord foresees this in the Garden of Gethsemane: “O My Father, if

250

ANGUISH, RECONCILIATION, GLORIFICATION

this cup cannot pass away from Me unless I drink it, Your will be
done”  (Matt.  26:42).  During  the  agony  of  the  temptation  on  the
cross, He longs for the inmost truth that would lead to our salva-
tion. He cries, “I thirst” (John 19:28), for water represents the liv-
ing truth that can save us.

But the Lord’s states on the cross are not all ones of agony and
despair. He also feels a new hope, one flowing powerfully into Him
from His very Soul. He foresees not final defeat, but something far
different. Even on the cross, He thinks from celestial love, love that
looks  to  our  salvation.  For  those  who  put  Him  on  the  cross,  He
says,  “Father,  forgive  them,  for  they  do  not  know  what  they  do”
(Luke  23:34).  To  Mary  He  says,  looking  at  John  the  disciple:
“Woman, behold your son!” (John 19:26). Then He says to the dis-
ciple, “Behold your mother!” (John 19:27). And to the good thief
Jesus says words of comfort: “Assuredly, I say to you, today you
will be with Me in Paradise” (Luke 23:43).

These  words  of  compassion,  spoken  even  while  on  the  cross,
show how much He loves us and how near to us He is. This has its
counterpart in the story of Joseph. After Israel was buried in the cave
of Machpelah, there seems to be, representatively, a change of state.
“Joseph returned to Egypt, he and his brothers, and all who
went up with him to bury his father. . . .And Joseph’s brothers
saw that their father had died, and they said, ‘Perhaps Joseph
will hate us and will fully return to us all the evil with which we
repaid him.’ And they gave a command to Joseph, saying, ‘Your
father commanded before he died, saying, “Thus you are to say
to Joseph, I beg you, forgive — I beg you — the transgressions
of  your  brothers,  and  their  sin,  for  the  evil  with  which  they
repaid you, and now forgive, I beg you, the transgressions of the
servants of your father’s God” ’ ” (Gen. 50:15-17, selections).
“And Joseph wept as they spoke to him” (Gen. 50:17).
“And his brothers also went and fell down before him, and
said, ‘Behold, we are your slaves.’ And Joseph said to them, ‘Do

251

THE PATH, CHAPTER 41

not be afraid, for am I in the place of God? And you thought
evil against me; God thought (to turn) it into good, in order to
do what is in accord with this day, to bestow life on a great peo-
ple.  And  now,  do  not  be  afraid.  I  will  sustain  you  and  your
young children.’ And Joseph consoled them, and spoke to their
heart” (Gen. 50:18-21).

“And Joseph spoke to their heart.” The Lord does the same
on the cross to those who are there, both those who love Him and
those who crucified Him. He becomes reconciled with those near
Him who will listen. So Joseph becomes reconciled with His broth-
ers after returning to Egypt. Joseph forgave them, as Jesus forgives
even those who crucified Him.

In the Joseph story, and in the New Testament pre-Easter and
Easter stories, the Lord “speaks to [our] heart.” He testifies of His
love and His willingness to forgive.

That  this  happened  in  Joseph’s  life  after  his  return  to  Egypt
indicates that the states of conclusion after Israel’s burial focus on
the sensuous, for this outmost level is now being glorified. On the
cross, the Lord’s temptations have their ultimates in His physical
pain and eventually in His physical death.

However, toward the end of His time on the cross, Jesus Christ
experiences integrations and elevations of state. The Joseph story
represented this in his final time in Egypt, before he died. He lived
to “a hundred and ten years” (Gen. 50:22). This signifies a full
state of remains or states of innocence, and a unifying of the Divine
remains in the Lord.

“The Divine remains which pertained to the Lord were all the
Divine  states  which  He  procured  for  Himself,  and  by  means  of
which He united the Human Essence to the Divine Essence. These
cannot be compared to the remains that pertain to a person, for the
latter are human, not Divine” (AC 1906:4).

252

ANGUISH, RECONCILIATION, GLORIFICATION

“And  Joseph  saw  Ephraim’s  sons  of  the  third  generation;
also the sons of Machir, Manasseh’s son, were born on Joseph’s
knees” (Gen. 50:23). With us, Ephraim and Manasseh are the new
understanding and new will in the sensuous. With the Lord, they are
the glorifying of His sensuous level, of His understanding and will
on this ultimate level.

“And Joseph said to his brothers, ‘I am dying, and God will
certainly visit you and cause you to go up out of this land to the
land which He swore to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.’ And Joseph
made  the  children  of  Israel  swear,  saying,  ‘God  will  certainly
visit you, and you shall cause my bones to go up from here.’ And
Joseph died, a hundred and ten years old; and they embalmed
him, and he was put in an ark in Egypt” (Gen. 50:24-26).

When Joseph dies, it is the symbolic picture of the end and ful-
fillment of the glorification. The Lord’s former sensuous then is put
aside,  and  He  assumes  a  new  Sensuous  level  and  Body  that  are
Divine!  In  this  transformation  is  the  greatest  miracle  in  history.
This is symbolized by the embalming of Joseph and then later
the taking up of his body and its being carried back to the land
of Canaan. Symbolically, Joseph returned home at last. The land of
Canaan represents heaven, and in the highest sense it represents the
Lord in His glorified Divine Human. Joseph’s dying means spiritu-
ally  a  whole  new  beginning  for  humankind.  The  celestial  of  the
spiritual,  Jesus’  finite  but  wonderful  love  for  our  salvation,
becomes glorified: it becomes Divine. He returns Home, One with
His Father.

This happens with His victory and death on the cross. He says,
speaking  His  last  words  in  His  earthly  body:  “Father,  into  Your
hands  I  commend  My  spirit”  (Luke  23:46).  Then  in  those  words
that mark the completion of the glorification: “It is finished” (John
19: 30). The finite human essence has achieved its inmost goal, and
now is replaced by the Divine Human in its fullness.

What is not shown in the Joseph story in representative terms is

253

THE PATH, CHAPTER 41

the glorification of the Lord’s body in the tomb, although Joseph
did  ask  his  sons  to  bring  back  “my  bones”  to  the  land  of
Canaan (Gen. 50:25), and Canaan with Jesus signifies the Divine.
We read that Joseph was “embalmed, and he was put in an ark
in Egypt” (Gen. 50:26). This means preservation of his body from
any corruption by evil (see AC 6595). But in the celestial sense, this
is to be understood in a “supereminent sense” (AC 10252:7). In this
sense, it stands for the dissipation of the finite human body that was
born of Mary, followed by the rising of the glorified Divine Body
itself (Ibid.). This is the Divine resurrection of Jesus Christ. He is
indeed brought to the Divine, to the Divine Canaan.

It is interesting that when Jesus dies, His body is buried in the
tomb  of  Joseph  of  Arimathea  (Matt.  27:  57-60).  The  name
“Joseph”  catches  the  eye.  It  is  perhaps  one  of  the  final  correla-
tions  of  Joseph’s  Genesis  story  with  that  of  Jesus  in  the  New
Testament.

Seen from the reality of eternal life, Joseph’s story has a gold-
en  ending.  He  lived  out  his  final  years  in  Goshen,  a  portion  of
Egypt, surrounded by family who loved him. He saw his children
and their children even to the third generation. He was loved by his
own family and highly respected by the Egyptians. His dreams as a
seventeen-year-old came true: his family did bow down before him,
but out of love, not because of any domination by him. Even the
coat of many colors was representatively restored to him. For the
celestial love clothes itself with all the arts and sciences of creation,
and these bring bright colors to its innocence.

Once Joseph dies, then, in representatives, Jesus’ finite human
essence  is  gone  –  replaced  by  His  glorified  Divine  Human!  Yet
Joseph’s meaning is not lost; it is replaced by the Divine Human,
Who  now  Divinely  loves  humankind  and  its  salvation.  And  His
name is called “Wonderful.” Jesus has become the Divine Good on
every  plane,  from  inmosts  to  outmosts.  From  this  good  proceeds
healing Divine Truth (AC 9670, Ath. Cr. 156).

254

ANGUISH, RECONCILIATION, GLORIFICATION

It is to the New Testament that we must turn to see clearly the
Lord  in  His  Easter  rising  and  in  His  post-Easter  times  with  His
disciples.

“Now after the Sabbath, as the first day of the week began to
dawn, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary came to see the tomb.
And behold there was a great earthquake; for an angel of the Lord
descended from heaven, and came and rolled back the stone from
the door, and sat on it. His countenance was like lightning, and his
clothing as white as snow. . . .The angel answered and said to the
women, ‘Do not be afraid, for I know that you seek Jesus Who was
crucified. He is not here; for He is risen, as He said. Come, see the
place where the Lord lay’ ” (Matt. 28:1-6, selections).

Mary Magdalene runs to Peter and John and tells them what has
happened. They run to the tomb and find the clothes in which Jesus’
body had been wrapped, but Him they do not find.

“But Mary stood outside by the tomb, weeping, and as she wept
she  stooped  down,  and  looked  into  the  tomb.  And  she  saw  two
angels  in  white  sitting,  one  at  the  head  and  the  other  at  the  feet
where the body of Jesus had lain. Then they said to her, ‘Woman,
why are you weeping?’ She said to them, ‘Because they have taken
away my Lord, and I do not know where they have laid Him.’ Now
when she had said this, she turned around and saw Jesus standing
there, and did not know that it was Jesus.

“Jesus said to her, ‘Woman, why are you weeping? Whom are
you seeking?’ She, supposing Him to be the gardener, said to Him,
‘Sir,  if  you  have  carried  Him  away,  tell  me  where You  have  laid
Him,  and  I  will  take  Him  away.’  Jesus  said  to  her,  ‘Mary.’  She
turned and said to Him, ‘Rabboni!’ ” (John 20:11-17).

In a sense, each of us is Mary Magdalene. We have sinned in

255

THE PATH, CHAPTER 41

our lives, yet we search for the Lord. The message of Easter is that
He is not in the tomb, “He is risen.” To each of us He would come
and say our spiritual name. He waits for us to discover Him.  

It is in the Arcana story of Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and Joseph
that the Lord makes Himself visible to our hearts and thoughts, to
our emotions and natural ideas. In the glorification story disclosed
there He reveals His inner nature as He never has before. He speaks
to our hearts and minds. He shows, step by step, how He made a
path for us: a path to heaven.

“The  Lord’s  life  in  the  world  was  an  example  according  to
which  the  people  of  the  church  are  to  live,  as  the  Lord  Himself
teaches  in  John:  ‘I  have  given  to  you  an  example,  that  you  also
should do as I have done to you. If you know these things, blessed
are you if you do them’ ” (John 13:15,17; AE 254:2).

He shows us The Path. He founded it and then re-established it
on earth. He invites us to take this spiritual highway and gradually,
step by step, to come to Him. He reveals to us what He thought and
felt in His own glorification: His joys and insights, His awful temp-
tations,  His  liberating  victories.  We  do  not  lose  Him  when  He  is
glorified. We find Him.

The Lord says to us, “Peace be with you” (John 20:19).

“Our  Father, Who  art  in  the  heavens,  hallowed  be Thy  name.
Thy  kingdom  come. Thy  will  be  done,  as  in  heaven  so  upon  the
earth. Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our debts as
we forgive our debtors. And lead us not into temptation, but deliv-
er us from evil. For Thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the
glory forever.” Amen.
