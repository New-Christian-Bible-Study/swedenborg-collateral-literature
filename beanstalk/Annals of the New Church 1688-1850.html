<p>WITH A CHRONOLOGICAL ACCOUNT OF THE LIFE OF EMANUEL SWEDENBORG.<p>VOL. I.<p>1688-1850.<p>BY<p>CARL THEOPHILUS ODHNER<p>ACADEMY OF THE NEW CHURCH,<br>BRYN ATHYN, PA.<br>1904.<p>DEDICATED<p>TO<p>JOHN PITCAIRN, ESQ.<p>PREFACE.<p>The History of the LORDS New Church, the Church of the New Jerusalem, has not yet been written, nor can until the facts of her past experience have been collected. These facts lie hidden, at present, in several thousand different volumes, published in many different tongues, distributed in widely distant libraries, and thus inaccessible to the general student. Before a philosophical and yet exact History of the New Church can be written, these scattered and imprisoned facts must he brought together, in order that the historian or historians of the Church may have the necessary materials at hand. The stones must be procured before the building can be erected<p>An attempt to supply this want of proper materials for New Church History has been made by the compilation of the present Annals of the New Church. Let it be well understood, that the Annals do not pretend to be a History of this Church. It is simply a work of reference, rudis indigestaque moles; a mass of materials, roughly arranged in chronological order, and drawn only from the public and printed records of the Church. They present merely the corporeal part of New Church History. The spirit within the bare facts will be found in the private, unpublished letters, which are or will be preserved in the archives of the Church.<p>The Annals, though the fruit of long-continued and extensive researches, favored by exceptional advantages and opportunities, do not claim any absolute exhaustiveness or perfection. Much, we fear, has been omitted, and many errors will undoubtedly be found. <p>The plan of the compiler has been to collect authentic, referable and impartial information as to the following general subjects:<p>1. The facts connected with the life and work of Emanuel Swedenborg.<p>2. Historically,--notices of all important events in the general history of the New Church, throughout the world, such as general meetings (with summaries of proceedings), new movements and changes, accounts of the successive states of the Church in various countries and localities, etc.<p>3. Biographically,notices of the leading events in the lives of noted members of the Church, the time of their departure into the spiritual world, references to obituaries and biographies, etc.<p>4. Theologically,--records of important articles, (controversial or didactic), in the periodical literature of the Church, presenting an historical view of the progress of doctrinal thought.<p>5. Bibliographically,--a full, but simple, bibliography of the whole Literature of the New Church, arranged chronologically and alphabetically, including all editions of Swedenborgs Writings and of collateral works in all languages, with references to notices or reviews, and to the libraries where copies of these works may be found, the library of the Academy of the New Church being taken as a basis.<p>6.

<p>PREFACE<p>The Science of History, like Clio among the Muses, is chief among the handmaids that serve the knowledge and worship of God. It is chief among those instrumentals which may render man rational, for it affords the ratio or comparative relation of present things with all things of the past, which is most essential to the rational faculty. History, in a supreme sense, is the record of the Divine Providence among men; it is the summary of the collective experience of mankind under the overruling government of the LORD, and through this science men may see confirmed, by objective illustration, the lessons of wisdom which are taught, subjectively, in the written Word of God.<p>But in order to serve this purpose, History, like every exact science, must be founded, ultimately, upon the solid rocks of actual facts. Without these facts there may be theory, indeed, but not Science. Hence we find that chronicles lie at the basis of all History.<p>The History of the LORDS New Church, the Church of the New Jerusalem, has not yet been written, nor call it be written until the facts of her past experiences have been collected. These facts lie hidden, at present, in several thousand different volumes, published in many different tongues, distributed in widely distant libraries, and thus inaccessible to the general student. Before a philosophical and yet exact History of the New Church can be written, these scattered and imprisoned facts must be brought together, in order that the historian or historians of the Church may have the necessary materials at hand. The stones must be procured before the building can be erected.<p>An attempt to supply this want of proper materials for New Church History has been made by the compilation of the present Annals or chronicles of the New Church. Let it be well understood, that the Annals do not pretend to be a History of this Church.  <p><Div Align = 'Right'>4</Div><HR><p>

<p>INTRODUCTION<p>SWEDENBORGS PREPARATION FOR HIS MISSION<p>1688-1742.<p>1688. January 29th,* Emanuel Swedberg is born in Stockholm, where his father, the Rev. Jesper Swedberg, is regimental chaplain and preacher to the court.<p>* This date is according to Swedenborgs own statement to the House of Nobles, and according to the Registry of the Swedish Nobility. But in his autobiographical letter to the Rev. Thomas Hartley, Swedenborg gives the year 1689 as the year of his birth, and this, according to a statement reported by his friend. General Tuxen, on account of a spiritual, correspondential reason. (D. II:436) Tuxens report, however, comes to us through a questionable medium. It seems more probable that the year 1689 is a slip of the pen. Another chronological discrepancy occurs ill the same letter to Hartley, where Swedenborg states that he returned to Sweden in the year 1714, whereas, in fact, he did not return until after April, 1715. The question of the correct date of Swedenborgs birth has been discussed, and various explanations offered, in I.1833:497, and M. n. s. XII. 303, 365; XIII:48.<p>Emanuel Swedberg, on the side of his father, descended from an ancient family of opulent miners, near the city of Fahlun, in the province of Dalecarlia. The hero Engelbrecht, who liberated Sweden from Danish rule, in 1434, is said to have been one of his ancestors. On the side of his mother, Sarah Behm, he descended from king Gustavus Wasa, who reigned in Sweden from 1523 to 1560. The name Swedberg and subsequently Swedenborg, was derived, not from the name of the kingdom of Sweden, or Sverige, but from the old homestead of the family, Sveden, which means a place cleared in the forest by means of fire.<p>The spiritual character of the Swedish nation is described in S. D., 5034-5721, and the well known, upright character of the Dalecarlians, in the same work, n., 5042. A biography of Jesper Swedberg is given in English, in D. I:96, and the genealogy of the Swedenborg family in D. I:82.  <p><Div Align = 'Right'>6</Div><HR><p>

<p>Of this period of his childhood Swedenborg states: From my fourth to my tenth year I was constantly engaged in thoughts about God, salvation and the spiritual ills of men; and several times I revealed things at which my father and mother wondered, saying that angels must be speaking through me. - D. II:279.<p>CONTEMPORARY EVENTS.<br>Victory of the Dutch and English fleets over the French, off La Hague.<p>Marshal Luxembourg defeats William III. at Steenkirk.<p>The dominions of the Duke of Brunswick-Lneburg are formed into the Electorate of Hanover.<p>The Massachusetts and Plymouth colonies are united.

I knew no other faith at that time.--D. II:279<p>About this time he begins to experience peculiar states of respiration, being gifted with a species of internal breathing, especially while attending the family worship, mornings and evenings.--S. D. 3320, 3464.<p>A tradition relates that angels appeared to him, while a child, in the shape of little boys,--invisible to others,--who played with him in the garden of his father.Mess. 1853:287.  <p><Div Align = 'Right'>8</Div><HR><p>

<p>ANNALS OF THE NEW CHURCH.<p>PREFATORY NOTE.<p>In the following chronological account of the history of the New Church we have refrained from dividing this history into any distinct or specifically characterized periods, as such a division can be made with justice only in a somewhat distant future, when a greater perspective shall have been gained.<p>The year 1743 has been chosen, among a variety of dates, to mark the beginning of the Annals of the New Church, in order to insure the greatest possible inclusiveness, as this year is the earliest date given by Swedenborg in describing his first call to his spiritual mission.<p>He states of the period now beginning: As the LORD had prepared me from my childhood, He manifested Himself in person before me, His servant, and sent me to do this work [the publication of the Doctrines of the New Church]. This took place in the year 1743, and afterwards He opened the eyes of my spirit, and thus introduced me into the spiritual world.--D. II:387. Compare D. I:9; C. L., I. 419; T. C. R. 157, 779, 851.<p>There exists no further account of the LORDS personal manifestation to Swedenborg, as occurring during this year, but a second manifestation took place in April, 1744, and a third in April, 1745.<p>The date of the opening of Swedenborgs spiritual sight has been discussed in D. II:1118 and I. 1874: 24, 178, 268. See also Mr. Richard McCullys articles on Swedenborg in the New Dawn, in I. 1871:23, 68, 110. A full comparative account of Swedenborgs spiritual experiences and mental states during the years 1743-1746 is given in D. II:1082-1118.  <p><Div Align = 'Right'>54</Div><HR><p>

 This missing manuscript, of which an index is preserved, is known as Memorabilium, pars prima.--D.

C. R. 508; I. 1871:229.<p>June 2, Stockholm.-Swedenborgs letter to the king, declining the suggested promotion to a councilorship, and requesting permission to retire from his office, retaining half of his salary.--D. I:464.<p>June 12.--Royal decree, accepting Swedenborgs resignation from the assessorship, and granting the favor suggested by him. The king in his letter expresses his assurance that the work upon which Swedenborg is now engaged--for the completion of which he feels it necessary to go abroad--will in time contribute to the general use and benefit, no less than the other valuable works written and published by him have contributed to the use and honor of his country. This work, to which Swedenborg had referred in his letter, was the Arcana Coelestia, on which he now had begun to work.--D. I:465.<p>July 17.--Swedenborg is present, for the last time, at the College of Mines, taking leave of his colleagues.D. I:466.<p>July 26.--This is the first date occurring in the preserved portion of the Spiritual Diary. This first part is known as Memorabilium, pars secunda, MS. 516 pp.; (the Spiritual Diary, nos. 149-3427).D. II:970. Some time during this month Swedenborg leaves Stockholm, entering upon his sixth foreign journey.Ibid.<p>August (beginning).--Arrives in Holland.<p>August 7.On this day he makes the following note in the manuscript of his Index to Isaiah and Jeremiah: There was a change of state in me, into the celestial kingdom, in an image. This would seem to indicate that the celestial degree of his mind had now been opened, and that henceforth he would be able to receive the revelation of the celestial sense of the Word. From this date, therefore, may be counted the end of the period of Swedenborgs preparatory illumination, and the beginning of his full state of inspiration.  <p><Div Align = 'Right'>62</Div><HR><p>

 A printing office is about to be established in conjunction with that of the Free Masons; favored by the king, the crown-prince and the archbishop, the members of the society dream of speedily converting the whole nation to the Doctrines of the New Church.Sundelin, p. 216.<p>About this time the members of the society begin to be much interested in the phenomena and practices of animal magnetism, then fashionable at most of the European courts. A rational and favorable explanation of these phenomena is thought to have been found in the Writings of Swedenborg. Sick persons are introduced at the meetings and treated by mesmeric methods. Intercourse with the spiritual world is sought by magical means. C. F.

 James Hindmarsh and Samuel Smith,--both of them former Methodist preachers,--are set apart as candidates for ordination; twelve men are chosen by lot to lay their hands upon the candidates; Robert Hindmarsh, by unanimous consent, which is confirmed to his own satisfaction by a private lot, reads the ordination service. From this source, i. e., through James Hindmarsh and his successors, are derived all subsequent ordinations of ministers in the New Church in Great Britain.--R.

 A series of thirty resolutions is adopted, setting forth the faith of the Conference in the doctrines of the New Church, as revealed in the writings of Emanuel Swedenborg. Numerous letters are read; a committee is appointed to draw up a catechism for the instruction of children; a circular letter is drawn up, addressed to the members of the New Church at large; the members dine together each day of the Conference. A sphere of great harmony, peace and gladness prevails.<p>An account of the proceedings is published in R. P., 84-109. Additional details are given in E. pp. XX-XXIV. A report of the meetings was also published separately.<p>The following places, containing individual or societies of receivers, were represented at this Conference: Chester, Derby, Keighley, Liverpool, London, Nantwich, Norwich, Quidhampton, Rotherham, Salisbury and Warrington.<p>May 4, 1789.-April 11, 1790.--The records of the meetings held by the society in Great East Cheap during this whole period have been torn out of the original minute book. Rev. Manoah Sibly has reported that these lost minutes contained the record of many solemn meetings, resulting finally in the exclusion of Robert Hindmarsh and five other prominent members from the society, on account of the emphasis which these members laid upon the teachings concerning concubinage, as set forth by Swedenborg in the latter part of Conjugial Love. No imputation of evil was made against the excluded members, and Robert Hindmarsh continued to act as the secretary and actual leader of the society. All the documents relating to this occurrence have been brought together and discussed in our Life of Robert Hindmarsh, pp. 25-31.<p>The Rev. Francis Leicester, a talented and learned clergyman of the Established Church, comes openly into the New Church. This is the only case of the kind in the history of the New Church in England.M. K.

Ralph Mather and Joseph Salmon, continuing their open-air evangelistic journeys, come to Norwich and receive permission to preach in the Baptist chapel, Mr. Hunt, the owner, being much impressed with the New Doctrines.  <p><Div Align = 'Right'>148</Div><HR><p>

Doughty, of Kamapo, N. Y.)<p>July.--The New Church Temple in Birmingham narrowly escapes destruction during a series of politico-religious riots (the Tory riots) directed especially against the Unitarians, whose two churches are demolished by a mob, infuriated by the sympathy which Dr. Priestley and the Unitarians had shown toward the French revolutionary movements. The house and library of Dr. Priestley are destroyed, and with these the first manuscript of his work against the New Church. The Temple of the New Church is also attacked, but is saved by Mr. Proud, who lived in the adjoining house and who, with great presence of mind, scatters among the crowd the last Sundays collection of money, at the same time exclaiming that the New Church was neither Unitarian nor inimical to the government; the mob hereupon disperses, shouting New Jerusalem for ever.--R.

 the unanimous opinion is expressed that no minister should be permitted to baptize an adult person without the consent of the society of which such person intends to become a member; a number of other peculiar resolutions are adopted.--E. p. 131.<p>Liverpool, October 16.A New Church place of worship is opened in Key street. Great interest is excited in the city by the novelty of the Doctrines, as well as by the superb representative robes of the minister, Mr. Ralph Mather, who, on the same day, is ordained into the priesthood by members of his congregation. (He had previously received a preachers license from the government and from the Great East Cheap Society.)--R. P. 138; G. H. 60; L. 1896:154.<p>London, April 25-29.--The Third General Conference of members of the New Church in Great Britain is held at Great East Cheap. Mr. Benjamin Banks, of Salisbury, is chosen president, and Robert Hindmarsh secretary. Admission to voting membership in the Conference is restricted to friends of the separate establishment of the New Church. An Executive Committee of twelve persons is appointed. Letters are read from various places in England, Sweden and America. A resolution is adopted placing the Clergy and the Laity on an Equal footing in the deliberations of the Conference. The propriety of consecrating temples is agreed upon, and a form of consecration is adopted. The propriety of Ministers wearing representative garments, while officiating, is also agreed upon and a form of such vestments recommended. Societies in various parts of the Kingdom are recommended to hold provincial conferences. The members of the Church in Great East Cheap form themselves into a particular Society and transfer to the Conference all such powers as they have exercised as the first Society of the New Church. The form of ordination and the list of the ordained ministers are revised. It is resolved that no ordinations are to take place in the future, except by the recommendation of a Society, and by the approbation of the Conference. Consent is given to the ordination of Joseph Proud and Robert Brant.--See Minutes of the meeting, and R. P. 117-126.  <p><Div Align = 'Right'>161</Div><HR><p>

Mr. Anthony Hunt, of Bristol, is elected president, and Robert Hindmarsh, secretary. A committee of Directors is appointed to manage and direct the affairs of the Church at large. Resolutions are adopted recommending various measures for the organization and representation of the individual societies. Mr. Samuel Hands, of Birmingham, recommends that each society form itself into a trading company. The Conference is distinctly divided into a majority and a minority, the latter objecting to the democratic spirit which prevails in the assembly. Robert Hindmarsh reads a paper, signed by the members of the minority, warning against democratic rule, and favoring an episcopal form of government for the New Church. The minority virtually withdraws from the Conference. The minutes, of which two differing editions are published, are signed only by the members of the majority--R.

 Hindmarsh, with his friends, keep the chapel in Great East Cheap open for worship for a little over a year.--R. P. 143.<p>[Photo of Rev.

<p>The apparent means of propagating the Doctrines have been straightened by the difficulties of the times, yet the cause of Truth has made some progress during the year.--Conv. R. 1820, p. 8.<p>The New Church in America, at this time, begins to be much disturbed by the introduction and rapid dissemination of what afterwards becomes known as the conjugial heresy or the Boston principle. According to this theory, which is first developed by Mr. Thomas Worcester, of Boston, and his brother, Samuel, there is a peculiar conjugial relation between a pastor and his society, corresponding to the relation between the LORD and the Church in general, or as between the truth of good and the good of truth. The minister, according to the theorists, receives truth only in the degree of his own progress in regeneration, and must preach only such truth as he himself has lived. This truth, then, is the truth of his good, and the society, when receiving and living according to this truth, becomes the good of his truth. The husband being, essentially, the truth of good, and the wife the good of this truth, there must necessarily result a similar conjugial relation between a pastor and his society. From this argument close communion followed as an inevitable corollary, together with a certain indissoluble relation between a pastor and each member of his flock..<p>This theory now beings to attract much attention; a number of ministers and societies, especially in New England, warmly receive it, while others vigorously oppose it, and the subject continues to be the burning question in the Church for some twenty years, causing much distrust and dissention. A long correspondence on the subject, between Messrs. Thomas and Samuel Worcester, on the one side, and Messrs. Condy, W. Grant, R. Hindmarsh, Daniel Lammot, R. Arbouin, C. Raguet, and John Clowes, on the other side, is published in N. IV:20-124. See also M. 19:177.<p>Abington, Mass.--The Rev. Holland Weeks, a popular Presbyterian minister, receives the Doctrines of the New Church, and begins to proclaim them openly.  <p><Div Align = 'Right'>279</Div><HR><p>

<p>South America. Georgetown (Demerara), March 16.--Mrs. Elizabeth Scott, in a letter to the Swedenborg Society, describes the few receivers in Demerara, and the peculiar circumstances of the death of a Mr. Meredith.--R. S. S. 12:13.<p>Sweden. Upsala.--The whole country is greatly excited over the religious trial of Professor Eric G. Geijer (afterwards the famous national historian of Sweden). Having published a work in defense of the principles of the poet Thorild, he is called to account by the Chancellor of Justice for having denied the doctrine of the Trinity and the Atonement, but especially for having published the following syllogism: The Church maintains that there are three persons in the God-head. Each one of these persons is God. God is the tri-personal. It thus follows that each person is tri-personal. Geijer, in his eloquent defense, expounds the doctrines at issue according to the Writings, but without mentioning Swedenborg, and argues so skillfully that the accuser is forced to defend his orthodoxy by admitting the justice of Geijers (and Swedenborgs) doctrine. The trial closes by the complete acquittal of Professor Geijer.--Kahl IV:44-59; I. 1822:60; R. S. S. 12:14.<p>PUBLICATIONS<br>Swedenborg: De la Nouvelle Jrusalem et sa Doctrine Cleste. Paris.

His temporal employment consists in preceding the settlements, and sowing nurseries of fruit trees, which he avows to be pursued for the chief purpose of giving him an opportunity of spreading the Doctrines throughout the western country. In his progress, which neither heat nor cold, swamps nor mountains, are permitted to arrest, he carries on his back all the New Church publications he can procure, and distributes them wherever opportunity is afforded. So great is his zeal, that he does not hesitate to divide his volumes into parts, and, by repeated calls, enable the readers to peruse the whole in succession. Having no family, and inured to hardships of every kind, his operations are unceasing. He is now employed in traversing the district between Detroit and the closer settlements of Ohio.

 This forms the beginning of the Abington Society.--M. 28:339.<p>Bridgewater.--A number of new receivers establish a New Church library, and form themselves into a society. They report a membership of 15 to 20 persons.--Conv. R. 1826:13.<p>Yarmouth.--A society of seven members is formed here.Ibid.<p>Pennsylvania, Lancaster.--Though receivers of the Doctrines have existed here since 1796, a New Church society is not formed until the present year.Ibid. p. 16.<p>Philadelphia.--The society of Rev. M. B. Roche in Southwark is reported as in a most flourishing condition, with more than 150 members. Seventy new members have been added within a year, many of these being former members of the original society in Philadelphia. The latter society is in a state of decline, owing to the financial embarrassments of the most prominent members. The pastor, Rev. M. M. Carll, after a long absence on account of ill health, on his return finds himself unable to serve gratuitously as before, and the regular services in the Temple are discontinued. The society, in consequence, loses its charter.--Conv. R. 1826:15 ; Ex. 169.<p>June 3-5.Seventh General Convention. Mr. Hargrove, president, and Mr. Roche, secretary. The committee on Rules of Order, appointed at the last Convention, reports that until it be deemed advisable to change the nature and character of this assembly, it will be unnecessary to form a special code of laws. It is resolved to transmit a respectful and affectionate address to the General Conference of the New Church in England. A communication from the Cincinnati society, signed by Daniel Roe, denying in toto the use of ordination, or of any distinctive priesthood, and requesting the Convention to express itself upon the subject, is received, and a committee of three ministers and four laymen is appointed to make a report to the next meeting. This marks the beginning of the controversy on the subject of the Priesthood, which so long has agitated the New Church in America. It is resolved that the next Convention be held in New York, 1826.  <p><Div Align = 'Right'>313</Div><HR><p>

 The reason for thus deferring the meeting seems to have been the languishing conditions of the societies in Philadelphia and New York, and the generally disturbed state of the Church, as resulting from the heated controversy about the conjugial relation between pastors and their societies. The Journal of this Convention did not appear until 1826, when it was printed as an Appendix to the Journal of the Eighth General Convention. The extraordinary communication from Cincinnati is published in Ex. Appendix, p. xli. See also Conv. R. 1826, p. 22, and Ex. 166-177.<p>Portland, Me.--Beginning of the New Church in this city. A lawyer, John L. Megquier, settles in Portland. Possessing a copy of Heaven and Hell, he lends the same to his physician, Dr. Timothy Little, who speedily receives the Doctrines, and before long succeeds in interesting Mr. Megquier himself, Mr. Oliver Gerrish, and a few others.M. 30:207; M. n. s. V:475; Mess. 38:255.<p>Steigers Rest, Athens Co., Ohio.--Baron J. R. de Steiger Granson, one of Napoleons old generals, settles in this district, where he has purchased some thousand acres along the Little Federal Creek, in Ames township. He brings with him several hundred emigrants from Switzerland and builds a baronial mansion for himself, and cabins for his tenants. While on his way to the wilderness, he stops in Philadelphia, where he becomes acquainted with members of the New Church, and receives the Doctrines with much enthusiasm. In a letter to the Convention of 1824 he states his intention to introduce all his tenants into the faith of the New Jerusalem, that he is building a temple for this purpose, and desires the services of a minister. He subsequently secures the services of Mr. Daniel Thuun, an old and well-known member of the Church in Philadelphia, who spends the rest of his days as chaplain to the Baron. According to the Rev. J. R. Hibbard, who visited Steigers Rest in his youth, the Baron died at an advanced age, and the colony dispersed, but the temple and a few of the colonists remained, among these a Mr. Junod, who, among others, was instrumental in presenting the Doctrines to Mr. Hibbard.--See Conv. R. 1826:17, and Mess. vols. 30:177; 33:304; 44:208.  <p><Div Align = 'Right'>314</Div><HR><p>

Five ministers and seventeen delegates are present. A committee is appointed to take into consideration the subject of organizing this Convention, and also the several Churches and Societies of the New Jerusalem. in this country, into some form of Ecclesiastical Government. The Convention, on the following day, June 2 at the recommendation of this committee, adopts the following resolution: Resolved, That a candidate for ordination present himself before the Convention of Ministers and Delegates, with the requisite recommendations already prescribed, and there receive ordination:--unless it should be the particular desire of his own Society to have him ordained in their presence; in which latter case, the candidate shall present a certificate of approbation from the Convention, to any two ministers possessing ordaining powers, and then receive ordination at their hands.<p>The Convention, by this important resolution, takes into its own hands the original ordaining power and authority, which up to this time had been exercised by the local churches in Baltimore, Philadelphia and New York, the ordaining ministers remaining simply the instruments through which the Convention, as the source of authority, confers the ordination. This is, essentially, the order which has continued with the Convention until the present time (1899). The meeting grants ordination to Dr. Lemuel C. Belding and Mr. Eleazar Smith. Rev. Holland Weeks, on behalf of the committee appointed in 1824 to consider the communication from the Cincinnati Society, presents an able report, setting forth the Scriptural, Doctrinal, and rational reasons for the existence of a distinctive priesthood in the New Church, and for a trine of degrees within that priesthood.

 (See annals, p. 148.) He now became minister to the new society at Norwich, but encountered much opposition and ill usage, was ordained into the ministry of the New Church, May 3, 1791, and in the same year became the first pastor of the Birmingham Society, where he preached with great success until 1797, when he removed to London, to take charge of the congregation in Cross St., Hatton Garden. Here he became one of the most popular preachers in the city, his eloquence and the striking, representative robes, etc., attracting enormous crowds. The congregations still increasing, the society removed to York St. in 1799, where, in a large and elegant chapel, he continued to preach for fourteen years, to an average attendance of one thousand hearers. Owing to financial and other complications, the society removed to a more obscure chapel in Lisle St., Leicester Square. Internal dissensions now arose in the congregation, and Mr. Proud returned to Birmingham, in 1814. Being now seventy years of age, and broken in strength, his ministrations proved less successful than formerly, and the society became almost extinct, but revived under the preaching of Rev. Edward Madeley, Jr., Mr. Prouds assistant Mr. Proud now devoted most of his strength to the missionary field, and preached with much success in various places, but retired from active work in 1822. An indefatigable writer, he published hundreds of tracts and sermons, composed the first hymnbook of the New Church, in 1790 (within a period of three months), became one of the editors of the Aurora, 1798-1800, contributed frequently to the (Intellectual Repository, and published his last and most valuable work, the Aged Ministers Last Legacy to the New Church, in 1818. As one of the most outspoken advocates of the distinctiveness of the New Church, he has been much attacked by the non-separatists, but is generally acknowledged as one of the great apostles of the New Church in Great Britain, zealous, ardent, poetical, industrious and sincere.I. 1826:347, 351; L.

He became a member of the Theosophical Society in 1784, was a member of Mr. Prouds society in Cross street, and, until his death, a zealous member and contributor to the Swedenborg Society. The mind of John Flaxman was earnest, enthusiastic, and highly poetic; his temper serene; his affections warm and benevolent; and his whole character shone with the angelic light of pure disinterestedness and cheerful piety. Religion was not with him a thing set apart for occasional use, regarded only for the sake of the worlds opinions, or because the world has lost its attractions;  <p><Div Align = 'Right'>331</Div><HR><p>

 <p>[Photo of John Flaxman.]<p>it was the vivifying principle of his existence; it guided every feeling, was blended with every thought, and passed into every action. In this dishonest, hypocritical world, a simple-minded, sincere man must necessarily be considered very peculiar; and John Flaxman was so regarded. He was a receiver of the Doctrines of the New Jerusalem,--a humble believer that the revelations of Emanuel Swedenborg were graciously provided by the Lord, for the restoration of a true faith and church in the world. (From the writings of Allan Cunningham and Lydia M. Child, in W. N. 1855, pp. 4, 5; see also D. II:1200; R. S. S. 1827:13, 14; I. 1827:434; L. M. 1827:31.<p>December 17.--Rev.

Francis Marcellus Hodson, an enthusiastic and eloquent laborer in the New Church. He was one of the earliest separatists in Manchester, and preached to the Peter street society, alternately with Rev. Richard Jones, until the year 1800. He subsequently preached to the various little centres in Lancashire, established an independent society at Ancoats Road in Manchester, 1820, and finally became the pastor of the society in Hull, where he became very popular with the seafaring population.  <p><Div Align = 'Right'>332</Div><HR><p>

Jonathan Bayley.--Mess.

Joseph Fletcher, the celebrated vicar of Madeley, in 1785. Filled with apostolic zeal and accompanied by the Rev. Ralph Mather, he immediately began to proclaim the Doctrines as a street preacher in numerous towns in England, but after a few years becoming convinced of the disorderly character of his proceedings, he became a non-separatist and co-worker with John Clowes, and henceforth confined his activity to the literary field of the Church.--I. 1827:430.<p>Newcastle, July 9.--Rev. James Bradley resigns from the pastorate, owing to his troubles with the Conference and a part of the society. He is succeeded by Mr. E. R. Rendell.--I. 1826:260; G.

<p>1827. America. Maine, Bath.--The receivers of the Doctrines continue in nominal connection with the Old Church, but have to hold separate reading meetings, and are looking forward to complete separation from their former connections.--Conv. R. 1827:27.<p>Maryland, Baltimore, June 7-9.--Ninth General Convention, Mr. Hargrove, president, Richard DeCharms, secretary. A committee is appointed to consider the propriety of establishing a more orderly form of ecclesiastical government, and particularly as relates to the ministry. This committee, at the same convention, presents a report (written by Jon. Condy, Esq.), clearly recognizing that a trine ought to exist in the ministry, and that, should an episcopal mode of government be established, the office of ordination could with propriety be performed only by a bishop. External circumstances, however, forbidding the appointment of a bishop, the committee is of the opinion that the time has not arrived for the establishment of such a form of government, and each society is recommended to regulate itself by what may appear to be expedient, leaving for the future the adoption of such measures as may become requisite for the general benefit and good order of the Church.<p>The Convention expresses its concurrence in the views of the above reports, being contented, for the present, with the order now subsisting in the Church, inasmuch, for all necessary purposes, a threefold principle has been recognized, and does in fact exist in the ministry, * * * in the establishment of the several ecclesiastical offices of licentiates, priests, and ordaining ministers. The members of the church are, however, invited to continue the free discussion of the subject, for the serious consideration of their brethren at large, and the more deliberate investigation of the next Convention. A complete list of the six ordaining ministers, the seven priests and teaching ministers, and the eleven licentiates, connected with the Convention, is published in the journal of this meeting, together with an appendix, containing Standing Recommendations, and a list of places containing societies or receivers.--Conv.

<p>Massachusetts, Boston, September.--Publication of the first number of the New Jerusalem Magazine.--Conv. R. 1826:6.<p>The centre of New Church activity in America is at this time changing from Philadelphia to Boston.--M. n. s. viii:215.<p>Bridgewater.--The society here is rapidly growing, under the care of Rev. Eleazar Smith, who is also preaching in the neighboring towns of Taunton, Abington, and North Bridgewater. A society is organized in the latter place during the year.--Conv. R. 1827:25, 26.<p>New York, Riverhead and Baiting Hollow, Long Island.--Rev. M. M. Carll ministers with much success to the societies in these villages; eleven members are baptized during the year.--Conv. R. 1827:23.<p>Ohio, Bethlehem, August.--Death of Jonathan W. Condy, Esq., the real founder, and, for many years, the leading mind of the Church in Philadelphia and of the General Convention Horn in Philadelphia, of a Huguenot family related to the princely house of Cond, he graduated at the University of Pennsylvania, became one of the most eminent lawyers in Philadelphia, and served with distinction as Clerk to the House of Representatives in Congress during and after the era of the Revolution. He received the Doctrines of the New Church in 1797, and became a most profound student of these Doctrines. A man of great genius and upright fearless character, original, acute, bold, active and eloquent, it is said of him, that a more powerful, brilliant, or commanding intellect never served the visible body of our Church in this country, or perhaps in any other. He was offered the office of first pastor to the Philadelphia Society, but declined on account of diffidence. The New Jerusalem Church Repository, and his brilliant defense of the New Church against the attacks of Rev. Jackson Kemper are eloquent memorials of his genius and devotion. He was also one of the most learned Hebraists in this country. As the theological instructor of Rev. Richard DeCharms, he is the forerunner of the Academy movement. He died in Ohio, soon after the meeting of the Convention, while on a visit to a settlement which he had formed at Bethlehem in that State.Ex. 110-118; B. Mag.

He was a cordial receiver of the Heavenly Doctrines, to which he was introduced in 1787, and was one of the founders or the society in Bolton. It is interesting to note that the present, enormous manufacture of cotton material owes its stupendous growth during the century largely to the inventions of three humble New Churchmen, Hargreaves, of Blackburn, who invented the spinning jenny, Highs, of Leigh, who constructed the water-frame, and Crompton, who in his invention combined the excellencies of the other two.I. 1827:685; 1872:294; Mess. vol. 47:81; Bayleys New Church Worthies, p. 11.<p>Bristol.--The society becomes extinct during the year. No reports are henceforth sent to the Conference, and no records are kept of any meetings until 1845.--M. L. 1895:167.  <p><Div Align = 'Right'>340</Div><HR><p>

<p>Derby, November 27.--Death of Rev. Edward Madeley, Sr., aged 50 years. Born at Yoxall in Staffordshire, he received the Heavenly Doctrines in 1804 through Mr. Thomas, Dawes, removed to Derby in 1809, and immediately opened a Sunday-school, first at his own house and afterwards in his tape factory. Gradually the parents began to attend the services, and thus in time, a flourishing society was built up. Mr. Madeley was ordained into the New Church ministry, 1818. He was a simple, gentle, and intensely affectionate man, with an extra-ordinary love of preaching. He literally preached himself to death. His son, Edward Madeley, Jr., was the successor of Mr. Proud in Birmingham.--R. P. 472; L. M. 1828:26.<p>Leeds, May 4.--The society removes from its quarters in Noahs Ark to the new chapel on Byron street, which is consecrated by Rev. Thomas Goyder.--M. L. 1885:56; I. 1827:609.<p>London, June 19.--Eighteenth annual meeting of the Swedenborg Society, Dr. Spurgin, chairman.

S. S. 18.<p>July 22.--A small chapel of the New Church is opened in Curtain Road, near Shoreditch. The society worshiping here was organized on January 23, 1825, by Mr. John Cayford and a few other persons, former members of the society in Friars street.--R. P. 458.<p>August 14-18.--The Twentieth General Conference is held in the chapel in Cross street, R. Hindmarsh, president, J. S. Hodson, secretary. The Conference resolves to remove the name of Rev. James Bradley from the list of ministers, in view of his having broken his engagements with the Conference in regard to the Newcastle Trust, and on account of certain articles published by him in the London Magazine, which are interpreted as insulting to the Conference. (The whole affair was extremely complicated, and based entirely on personal misunderstandings. Mr. Bradleys name was restored in 1833.)  <p><Div Align = 'Right'>341</Div><HR><p>

<p>Rev. Samuel Noble is declared an ordaining minister. The ordination of Mr. W. Bruce, of Edinburgh, is authorized. The rules for regulating the ministry, adopted by the conference of 1822, are rescinded, and new regulations are adopted. Henceforth no person can be eligible to the ministry, unless invited to become a candidate by not fewer than three-fourths of the adult members of some New Church Society. The candidate must produce a certificate of exemplary life and character, must be at least twenty-four years of age, must have been baptized into the New Church, have been a known receiver of the Doctrines for no lee than three years, and have exercised his talents as a preacher for the space of one year, at least. It is resolved that on future revisals of the list or ordaining and ordained ministers, the president shall ask the members of Conference, immediately after reading the name, whether there be any complaint against such minister? But no name shall be omitted, without giving the party opportunity for explanation, unless where the cause of the complaint is matter of public notoriety.--Conf. R. 1827; R. P. 458.<p>August 16.--A great social meeting is held during the conference. Mr. W. Malins, a zealous member of the church in London, on this occasion reads a lengthy paper in which he unexpectedly proposes the establishment of an institution for general New Church education.

A second meeting is held on September 19, and steps are taken to secure for the proposed school a beautiful and convenient property, eight miles from London.I. 1827:684; R.

 It was afterwards purchased for the use of the Scottish Presbyterians, and was for many years occupied by the celebrated and eccentric Rev. Edward Irving, the founder of the Catholic Apostolic Church. Mr. Irving having been excommunicated from the Kirk, the building is sold for 4,000 to Mr. Nobles society, which now removes from Hanover street to Cross street, and thus once more comes into possession of its original and elegant quarters.I. 1873:239; R.

<p>France. Paris, February 23.--Death of Captain Jean Jacques Bernard, the first eminent apostle of the New Church in France, a man of sublime character, great learning, and indefatigable zeal for the Truth. Born near Nantes, 1791, he entered the imperial army, as lieutenant, 1809, took part in the ill-fated expedition to Russia, 1812, was wounded at Leipzig, 1813, and was made a member of the Legion of Honor. While stationed at Bordeaux, in 1820, he accidentally came across the Writings of Swedenborg, received the Doctrines with the utmost enthusiasm, and at once began his successful evangelistic activity, chiefly among his brother officers, of whom quite a number became steadfast receivers. At first somewhat affected by Animal Magnetism and Spiritualism, he soon recognized the dangerous and disorderly character of all forms of magic, and became a loyal and profound student of the Heavenly Doctrines. Accompanying his regiment, he worked for the New Church wherever he was stationed, introducing the Doctrines to many prominent persons, such as Edouard Richer and Madame de St. Amour, of Nantes, Oegger and Saint Martin, of Paris, General Count de Bissy and Professor Genisset, of Besanon, and many others. Though hated, alike by the Jesuits and Calvinists, he was protected from persecution by the respect and affection of his comrades in the army. For a long time suffering from consumption, he died at the age of thirty-seven years.--M. 31:463; Mrs. Ehrenborgs Letters from France, Vol. I, p. 106.<p>Germany. Rostock.--Death of Charles Frederick Nordenskjld, charge d affairs for Sweden at Mecklenburg-Schwerin, brother of Augustus Nordenskjld, and president of the Exegetic-Philanthropic Society in Stockholm (see 1787-1791). A profound student of the Doctrines and one of the most important of the earlier champions of the New Church.--D. I:622.<p>Great Britain.

 Twenty-first General Conference, Rev. David Howarth, president, J. S. Hodson, secretary. Seven ministers and thirteen representatives are present. The new Liturgy, as finally completed, is received and approved. The Conference resolves that it is inexpedient to proceed further with the business of ordering the ministry. A code of laws for the New Church, having been agreed upon, the same is recommended for adoption by all societies in the Church, subject to the necessary alterations demanded by the peculiar circumstances of each society. Blanks, for the registry of baptisms, are furnished to all societies. It is resolved that no person, whose name is omitted from the list of ministers recognized by the Conference, can with propriety be permitted to exercise the functions of the ministry in any society of the New Church in connection with the Conference. (This resolution is directed especially against the Rev. J. Bradley.) The application of the Newcastle Society, for the ordination Mr. E. D. Rendell, is declined, but the ordination of Mr. William Bruce, of Edinburgh, is authorized.--Conf. R. 1828; R. P. 479; L. M; 1828:299; D. G. Goyders Autobiography, p. 207.<p>August 14.The Rev.

Tübingen, March 1.--Dr. Immanuel Tafel, unable to endure any longer the royal prohibition against his activity for the New Church, addresses a petition to the king of WÃ¼rtemberg, praying for permission to continue his publication of Swedenborgs works, and, in the case of refusal, offering his resignation from his professorship. The king, on March 25, releases Dr. Tafel from the conditions laid upon him in 1825, and unexpectedly confers upon him the office of Librarian to the University. About the same time Dr. Tafel receives an offer of financial assistance for his publications from Herr J. F. Frank, a royal apothecary of Potsdam, in Prussia, and makes arrangement with Ludwig Hofaker, a publisher and bookseller in Tübingen, for the distribution of the Writings.  <p><Div Align = 'Right'>358</Div><HR><p>

Six ministers and fourteen representatives are present. A committee is appointed to consider the propriety and practicability of forming a third order or degree of the ministry, particularly with a view of granting ordination to local leaders, so as to enable them to administer one or both of the sacraments. The application of the Newcastle society for the ordination of Mr. E. D. Rendell is again refused, (perhaps on account of Mr. Rendells suspected leanings towards Tulkism). The Intellectual Repository is adopted as the organ of the General Conference. It is henceforth to be published under the title The Intellectual Repository and New Jerusalem Magazine, under the editorial management of Messrs. Hindmarsh, Noble and Th. Jones. Mr. J. H. Smithson is appointed secretary for foreign correspondence, in place of Mr. E. W. Brayley, resigned. New rules are adopted in relation to the administration of the Chester legacy, and additional rules are adopted in reference to the status of ministers suspended from the Conference, and as to the method of removing suspension. A long resolution is adopted, solemnly condemning as most awfully erroneous the following teachings of Chas. Aug. Tulk, viz.,  <p><Div Align = 'Right'>359</Div><HR><p>

 1. That the finite apprehension of the Infinite is the Divine Human of the Lord, and, 2. that the Lords glorification only consists in the reception of Him by man.

 This marks the beginning of the New Church in the Dominion, and of the Chingachowchy (or Chinguacousy) society.

 The fruits of his activity, since that date, are evident on nearly every page of these Annals of the New Church. A man of sublime virtue, spirituality, tenderness, wisdom, genius, learning, activity, and usefulness, he will be revered in all future ages as one of the first wise men of the East, who in the dawn of the New Dispensation came to worship and serve the Lord in His Second Advent.<p>His death, like his life, made a profound impression upon the New Church throughout the world. No event has ever yet occurred in the annals of the New Church which produced so general a sensation. It pervades every circle, and moves alike all classes of the receivers. Nothing else has been talked of, or thought of, since this dispensation of Providence has been known. And all seem actuated by one desire,--to express in the fullest manner their grateful veneration for his memory.I. 1831:453; 1841:353.<p>London, June 15.--A great meeting, in memory of the Rev. John Clowes, is held at the temple in Cross street. It is more numerously attended than any other meeting of the New Church previously held in London. Commemorative addresses are delivered by the three ministers and a number of the most prominent members of the Church in London. The meeting is fully reported in I. 1831:462. Similar meetings are held in most of the larger centres of the New Church in Great Britain.<p>June 20.-Twenty-second annual meeting of the Swedenborg Society. The committee reports the gift of 20 from an unknown friend for the purpose of placing copies of the Writings with certain literary clubs; these donations have been well received by the clubs mentioned, excepting the Oxford and Cambridge University club, which has returned the books. A long resolution, in commemoration of the Rev. John Clowes, and of his services in behalf of the New Church, has been inserted in the leading public newspapers. Much information is presented respecting the activity of Dr. Tafel, in Germany.--R. S. S. 1831.<p>August 9-13.--The Twenty-fourth General Conference is held at the temple of the Cross St. Society.  <p><Div Align = 'Right'>375</Div><HR><p>

 Five ministers and sixteen representatives are present. Rev. Robert Hindmarsh is elected president. A resolution is adopted, disavowing any intention of interfering with the freedom of particular societies by the recommendation of the Conference Liturgy, or by the regulations of the Conference Deed. (This, in reply to complaints from Scotland, where many viewed the Liturgy with suspicion, as smacking of Romanism, etc.) The Conference strongly expresses its conviction that the most perfect arrangement of the ministry is that of a trine, but that spiritual benefits can only result to the Church from forms founded in rational use. A complaint of a serious nature [Tulkism?] being preferred against the Rev. E. D. Rendell, it is resolved that the name of the latter be omitted from the list of the ordained ministers. Rev.

<p>1832. America. Massachusetts, Boston, August 16Fourteenth General Convention. Three ministers and twenty-three delegates are present, all from New England. Rev. Th. Worcester is elected president, and Mr. Zina Hyde, secretary. No business of general interest is transacted. The lack of representation front outside New England was caused by the prevalence of cholera in various parts of the United States.--Conv. R. 1832; Ex. 245.<p>Ohio, Cincinnati.--A New Church Sunday School, the first one in the city, is opened by Mr. Milo G. Williams.

R. 1832:10.<p>May 7.--Edwin A. Atlee, the minister of the Cincinnati society, resigns from his office and returns to his former associates, the Quakers, for the sake of peace of mind. He does not, however, renounce his faith in the Doctrines, and after a few years comes back to the New Church.--Conv. R. 1832:15. Mr. Richard De Charms succeeds Mr. Atlee as pastor of the Cincinnati society, at that time, an unenviable position.N. iv:135.<p>October 12-13.--First General Convention of the Receivers of the Doctrines of the New Jerusalem West of the Allegheny Mountains (the Western Convention). Daniel Mayo, Esq., is chosen president, and M. G. Williams, secretary. The members adopt a report by the Rev. Adam Hurdus, setting forth the aims and circumstances which have necessitated the formation of a Western Convention, viz., the needs of more local uses, the great distances between the brethren in the east and in the west, local peculiarities of character and particular affinities, etc. This District Convention still considers itself subject to General Convention of the whole Church in the United States, but leaves undecided its relation to the General Convention as already existing. A committee is appointed to prepare a friendly address to the next General Convention.  <p><Div Align = 'Right'>380</Div><HR><p>

 Other committees are appointed to prepare rules and regulations for the government of the Western Convention, to take into consideration the general subject of church government and order, etc. The publication of a New Church periodical in the west is recommended.--W. Conv. R. 1832.<p>France. Leves, near Chartres.Abb Franois Ledru, the parish priest of Leves, is ejected from his cure by the bishop of Chartres, on account of his faith in the New Church. (He had received the Doctrines in 1830). This proceeding creates great indignation among the parishioners, who march in a body to the bishop, to plead for the reinstatement of their beloved pastor, but in vain. The Abb now opens an independent place of worship, naming it, at first, the French Catholic Church. The bishop denounces him to the civil authorities as a disturber of the public peace, and a body of military is sent to arrest him, but is prevented by the inhabitants of Leves and adjoining villages, who rise in arms in defense of their preacher. The soldiers refuse to act against the people, whereupon a larger force is sent, and a solemn investigation is instituted, resulting in the acquittal of Ledru from the charges preferred.I. 1838:325.<p>Germany.

A legacy of 845 is received from the late Mrs. Ann Marshall, of London. The Conference being unable to come to any unanimous conclusion on the subject of the proposed third order of the ministry, two committees are appointed to take into further consideration the question whether it is in accordance with the laws of Divine Order to admit persons, by some solemn service, to administer the sacrament of Baptism only, and not that of the Holy Supper. The resignation of Mr. J. H. Smithson from the office of secretary of foreign correspondence is accepted, and the office is abolished as being unnecessary at present.--Conf.

 Receiving the Doctrines in his youth, through Mr. Clowes, he came early to the conviction that the Church could prosper, permanently, only when separate from the institutions of the Old Church, was chosen the leader of those, in Manchester, who held the same conviction, and was chiefly instrumental in organizing the separate society, and in erecting the temple in Peter St., in 1792. Beginning to preach for this society in the year 1800, he was ordained into the ministry in 1808, and continued, from that time until the day of his death, to serve gratuitously as the beloved pastor of the Peter St. society, and as one of the most respected and trusted ministers of the New Church. Steadfastness, thoroughness, earnestness and humility were the most conspicuous characteristics of his mind.

<p>Germany. Tübingen.--Dr. Tafel begins to preach openly, every Sunday, to an assembly of receivers from Tübingen and neighboring villages. The Doctrines are spreading in Suabia and Southern Germany.--Conv. R. 1833:2.<p>Great Britain. Bath, August 13-17.Twenty-sixth General Conference, Rev. Robert Hindmarsh, president. Six ministers and fourteen representatives are present. The Conference concludes that it is inexpedient to attempt to legislate, at present, on the question of authorizing lay-preachers, by some formal service, to administer the sacrament of Baptism only. A new set of Rules for the General Conference is adopted. The ordinations of J. H. Smithson and J. W. Barnes are authorized, and the name of Rev. James Bradley is restored to the list of ministers recognized by the Conference.--Conf.

Thomas Furlong Churchill, M. D., at the age of sixty-five years. While practicing medicine in London he received the doctrines of the New Church through Mr. Proud, about the year 1798, was ordained into the ministry on August 16, 1812, and succeeded Dr. Hodson as pastor of the society in Dudley Court, London. This society, in 1814, united with the society in Lisle st., and Mr. Churchill remained here until, owing to ill-health, he resigned, in 1819, when he was succeeded by Rev. S. Noble. Mr. Churchill now retired to Bristol, where, in 1825, he published a well-known volume entitled, Jesus Christ the True God and Life Eternal. Eloquent and amiable, he was very popular as a preacher, but seems to have been somewhat lacking in firmness of conviction and purpose.I. 1833:531;1834:108; N. J.

Of the three societies, that of Mr. Noble is the largest, most intellectual and influential. Mr. Siblys congregation consists of a great proportion of young people; the sphere here is very affectionate. Mr. Goyders society is more non-descript, and the pastor is affected by the doctrines of C. A. Tulk. The New Church college, established by Mr. W. Malins, has failed, owing chiefly to lack of experience on the part of the founder. Rev. Augustus Clissold is described as a popular lecturer in one of the most fashionable churches; he is a man of wealth, an open receiver of the Doctrines, and a liberal supporter of the New Church. Mr. Wilkins mentions that he has visited Swedenborgs lodgings at Coldbath Fields, has inspected the MS. of the Spiritual Diary, and has procured copies, for America, of the extremely scarce original editions of the Writings.--Conf.

<p>See also respecting the resolution in regard to the Western Convention, M. 18:39.<p>France. Nantes, January 21.--Death of Edouard Richer, one of the most talented writers in the history of the New Church. Born at Nantes in 1792, he became one of the foremost literary men in France, writing a great number of celebrated works on archaeology, history, poetry, and philosophy, but devoting himself entirely to the interests of the New Church after becoming acquainted with the Heavenly Doctrines, in 1812, through his friend, Captain Bernard. Of his many writings in exposition of these Doctrines the best known are his Religion of Good Sense and the series of eight volumes published under the collective title The New Jerusalem. He was a brilliant, learned and industrious man, and at the same time simple, gentle, and unaffected.M. 31:622; C. H. 39; Bayleys N. C. W 180.<p>Saint Amand (Cher.), November.--Monsieur J. F. S. Le Hoys des Guays, a judge at Saint Amand, and a well-known writer on Roman Law, becomes acquainted with the Doctrines of the New Church. He had previously been a student of magnetism and mesmerism, but after his reception of the New Jerusalem became a firm opponent of all forms of spiritism. He now begins a life-long propaganda for the New Church, and opens his house for worship on Sundays.--I. 1865:125.<p>Great Britain. Blackburn.--The Doctrines are introduced here by the Rev. Mr. Price, vicar of St. Pauls. After his removal to another charge, a number of his sympathizers form themselves into a distinct society of the New Church.--M. L. 1894:138.<p>Embsay, April 13.--A New Church chapel is opened in this village. The society here, which was raised up chiefly through the open-air preaching of Rev. Thomas Pilkington, now becomes connected with the General Conference.I. 1871:205; Conf. R. 1834:46; W. Conv. R. 1834:22.<p>London, June 19.Twenty-fifth annual meeting of the Swedenborg Society.

 He was the first to call together a meeting of New Churchmen, the first to receive the Baptism of the New Church, was the first ordainer in the Church, the first New Church publisher, the first, and throughout his life the foremost, of the evangelizers and defenders of the Doctrines of the New Jerusalem. Born at Alnwick, in Northumberland, Nov. 8, 1759, and the son of the Rev. James Hindmarsh (who, in 1788, became the first ordained minister of the New Church), he established himself as a printer in London, in 1780, and received the Doctrines of the New Church in 1782 Early in the following year he gathered around him a little circle of other receivers, and in 1784 organized the Theosophical Society, through which body important activities were soon developed. Hindmarsh now became the leader of those who desired to separate themselves from the Old Church, and was virtually the founder of the society in Great East Cheap, in 1788. Chosen by lot to read the services at the first ordination of New Church ministers, on June 1st, 1788, he was subsequently recognized by the General Conference as ordained by Divine Auspices. At the early Conferences, from 1789 to 1793, he was the leading spirit, and stood forth, in 79", as a most able champion of the Doctrines, in his Letters to Dr. Priestley. His life between the years 1795 to 1810 was clouded by conflicts within the Church and reverses in his business, but after this period he devoted himself entirely and most successfully to the work of the priesthood. He now removed to Manchester, and became the founder and pastor of a prosperous society at Salford, where he remained, constantly occupied in preaching, evangelizing, and writing, until the year 1824, when he retired to private life in Canterbury. His literary activity did not cease, however, until within a few days before his death; he was nine times elected president of the General Conference, and continued to the end the recognized leader of the organized Church in Great Britain.

 in short, a complete constitution, proposing the establishment of an absolutely Episcopal form of government for the whole church. The three degrees in the Priesthood are to be entitled, respectively, Bishops, Pastors and Ministers; the formation of district conventions or associations is recommended, each to be under its own Bishop, with a chief Bishop for the General Convention itself. The whole proposed Constitution meets with the earnest opposition of Rev. R. De Charms, on the ground that it would exclude the whole church in the West, which would not submit to such Episcopacy. The report is consequently recommitted to the Committee of the Ordaining Ministers.Conv. R. 1837; Ex. 226<p>France.

<p>Sweden. Fogdon, near Hesselbyholm, in lake Malar, January 28--Death of Rev. Johan Tybeck, at the age of eighty-seven years,--for thirty years the foremost standard-bearer of the New Church in Sweden. Born in 1751, he was ordained into the priesthood of the Lutheran Church in 1779, and received the Heavenly Doctrines in 1780. He now became, and continued through life, the domestic chaplain to Baron J. Liljencrantz, the governor of Sodermanland, who was a thorough and active New Churchman. Tybeck began his literary activity for the New Church in 1788; he published more than sixty different treatises and works in explanation and defense of the new revelation. Thoroughly honest and outspoken, he soon attracted the disapprobation of the crypto-New Churchmen among the Swedish clergy, as well as the determined hostility and unrelenting persecution of the Old Church. In the year 1818, when sixty-one years of age, he was placed on trial for heresy, was acquitted by the civil authorities but again tried before the Consistory of Strengnas, by whom he was deposed from the priesthood and treated with such unnecessary cruelty as to gain the sympathy of the secular press. His attitude, while on trial, has been compared with that of Socrates before the Areopagus or of Luther at Worms. His life was henceforth devoted still more distinctly to the New Church, and he was supported in his open activity by Baron Gyllenhaal, Councillor Schonherr, and the New Church in England. His writings gained numerous converts, but he could not form any distinct organizations, as the law would not permit it. In his services to the New Church in Sweden he combined the features of Clowes and of Hindmarsh as the translator of the Arcana Coelestia, as the lucid expounder of the Word and the Heavenly Doctrines, as the skillful defender of the Truth against the attacks of the Old Church, as the champion of doctrinal integrity against heresy within the Church, and as the uncompromising advocate of New Church distinctiveness. During his latter pears he was recognized as the patriarch of the New Church in Sweden, and known throughout the country as the Bishop of the Swedenborgians.Kahl, 3:108-144; D. II:1279.  <p><Div Align = 'Right'>424</Div><HR><p>

 It is resolved that it is the sense of this Convention, that no one of the societies, now its members, which shall neglect to become organized according to the Rules of Order adopted by the Convention until after the meeting of the Convention in the year 1839, ought thereafter to regard itself, or to be regarded, as a member of Convention.<p>This is the celebrated squeezing rule, by which an attempt was made to force the episcopal form of government upon the Church at large. It created a great disturbance in the Church, caused the secession of a number of societies and led to the organization of the Central Convention. The rule was modified at the Convention in New York, 1841.--Conv. R. 1838; Ex. 270.<p>September 9.--Owing to the continued disorder in the New York Society the pastoral relation of the Rev. C. I. Doughty to that society is dissolved by a tribunal of three ordaining ministers, according to the Rules of Order of the General Convention. Mr. Doughty immediately opens independent services at his own house, and is gradually joined by a number of the members of his old society.--Conv. R. 1839:405; N.

Birmingham, August 14-17.Thirty-first General Conference. Seven ministers and twenty representatives are present. Rev. Edward Madeley is elected president. Rev. Thomas Goyder is appointed an ordaining minister. The ordination of Rev. Richard Storry, of Heywood, is approved, but the application of the Friar street society of London, for the ordination of Mr. T. C. Shaw, is refused, as Mr. Shaw is not connected with that society. (Mr. Shaw was the intended pastor of the new society at Burton street, which had been formed by members seceding from Mr. Nobles society at Cross street. The whole Church in Great Britain was affected by the dispute between the two parties, and the Conference was evenly divided as to the propriety of admitting the Barton street society into connection with the general body. The president, Mr. Madeley, refused to cast the deciding vote, and the matter was dropped for the time being.) The Rules of the Conference relating to the reception of societies into connection with it are rescinded, and a new set of rules adopted. Mr. T. F. Salter is appointed treasurer of the Conference, in place of the late Thomas Jones, Esq.--Conf. R. 1838.<p>The animus of this meeting, as viewed by Rev.

We have not been able to discover the real cause of the trouble which at this period agitated the whole New Church in England, but surmise that the differences were of a practical or personal, rather than doctrinal, character.I. 1838:333.<p>Poole.--The small society in this town is disrupted, and the services abandoned, owing to differences among the members as to teetotalism.I. 1838:274.<p>St. Heliers, Jersey, November 22.--Death of Captain James Gomm, R.

 For this society Captain Gomm acted as leader and preacher, until, in 1830, it was broken up, owing to mob-violence, police persecution, and internal dissensions. The work revived in 1837, but Captain Gomm was now too aged and feeble to assume the leadership. He was through life a consistent, devoted and talented member of the Church.I. 1839:497.<p>NOTABLE ARTICLES.<br>Intellectual Repository, 1838.<p>The total-abstinence controversy is continued by a reply from J.

 The Association adopts a name and brief Rules of Order. Measures are taken to secure the services of a New Church clergyman. The custom of family worship is earnestly recommended. Receivers of the Doctrines are reported from a dozen places in the State, the greatest number residing at Canton, in Fulton County.

John Hargrove, the founder and patriarch of the New Church in America. Born in Ireland, 1750, he emigrated to America in 1769, joined the Methodist church in 1777, and was ordained a preacher in 1795 by Bishop Ashbury. When first hearing of the Doctrines of the New Church, in 1793, he much opposed them, and began to study the Writings for the purpose of controverting them, but within a few years he became convinced of their truth. Resigning from the Methodists in June 1798, he now began to preach for the small society of the New Church in Baltimore, and was ordained by that society, through Ralph Mather, on July 8, 1798. He became the sole pastor of the Baltimore society in 1800, and was, until 1824, the only New Church minister in America. He was the first president of the General Convention, and was re-elected ten times to this office. From him, as the first source,&nbsp;have been derived all subsequent ordinations of ministers in the New Church in America. From the year 1808 to 1824 he held the office of City Registrar of Baltimore. Sturdiness, honesty, courage, and benevolence were his leading characteristics. For his biography see M. 14:485, M. n. s. xvii.:I. P.

The course includes all the ordinary branches of education, and also a thorough training in the Doctrines of the New Church. Heaven and Hell and The Earths in the Universe are used as text books. Preparation for Heaven is recognized as the first and great end of education, and the study of the Word is made paramount in this school.--M. 12:398; Conv.

James Seddon are baptized at the opening of the Convention. A resolution is adopted directing the secretary to address a notice to all such societies and ministers as have not reported to the Convention, inquiring into the reason of the neglect. A standing Book Committee and a standing Committee on Missions are appointed. The Missionary and Tract Board is abolished. The Rules of Order are amended, striking out the words into the New Church from the clause which makes baptism obligatory to all members of established societies. (The words stricken out were considered unnecessary, inasmuch as baptism into the New Church is the only real baptism, but the change, in effect, abolished the obligation--see p. 381.)  <p><Div Align = 'Right'>439</Div><HR><p>

 He subsequently took an active part in all the early movements of the New Church in Philadelphia, and introduced the Doctrines to a great number of persons who became zealous members of the Church. He married Miss Maria Barclay, a receiver of the Doctrines, in 1789, and located as a lawyer in Westmoreland Co., served as a Captain of the Militia against the Indians in 1792, removed to Greensburg in 1795, and was appointed presiding Judge of Western Pennsylvania in 1806, in which office he served with great distinction until the year 1837. It was he who supplied Johnny Appleseed with the New Church literature which the latter spread among the early settlers in Ohio, and by this and other more direct means he contributed greatly to the planting of the New Church in the district west of the Allegheny mountains. He was a profound student of the Writings and of the Word in the original tongues, and is said to have been, next to Jonathan Condy, of Philadelphia, the most intelligent layman of the Church in that age. Personally he was a fine specimen of the polite gentleman of the old school, benevolent, urbane, conscientious, innocent--a profound jurist, an upright judge, a Christian philanthropist and patriot.--N.

 The meeting is opened by Rev. Richard De Charms. Rev. Chas. I. Doughty is chosen president, Mr. William Chauvenet, secretary, and Mr. De Charms, corresponding secretary. The Central Convention is organized as a general body of individual members of the New Church, co-ordinate with the Eastern Convention.

The establishment of the Central Convention was purely a movement for ecclesiastical freedom; on questions of Doctrine and Church government its members had widely diverging opinions.<p>June 3-7.The Twenty-second General Convention is held in the temple of the Philadelphia Second society. Nine ministers and twenty-four delegates are present. Rev. Thomas Worcester is elected president. The ordination of B. F. Barrett and of S. F. Dike is granted. A communication addressed to the Eastern Convention is rejected as inadmissible. Various sections of the Rules of Order are amended. It is resolved that instead of the Committee of Ordaining Ministers, all the ministers belonging to this Convention constitute a Committee on Ecclesiastical Affairs for the ensuing year. The ordaining ministers, together with actual pastors, are constituted a Pastoral Committee, to whom may be referred any differences existing between members of the church, or in societies destitute of a pastor.--Conv. R. 1840, N. IV.: 2.<p>June 7.--Rev.

<p>Philadelphia, October 15-19.--Second Preparatory Meeting of the Middle Convention. The meeting is attended by the Rev. C. I. Doughty, Rev. Richard De Charms, and Rev. James Robinson, together with fifty lay members from various States. Rev. C. I. Doughty is elected president. A Constitution is adopted, various committees appointed, and steps are taken to publish a magazine, to be entitled The Newchurchman, as the organ of the Convention. In its Constitution this body, now calling itself The Central Convention, declares that it is to consist of such receivers in any part of the United States, whether isolated or members of societies, as may be disposed to join the same, who may feel a greater spiritual affinity for it than any other similar body. The Convention disclaims any right whatever to exercise control or dominion over the members of the New Church in their individual or collective capacity. The administration of the ecclesiastical affairs of the Convention is placed in the hands of an Ecclesiastical Council, constituted of all the ministers, of whatever degree, belonging to this body. The administration of the civil affairs is exercised by the general officers of the Convention, together with an Acting Committee, chosen from the lay members for the term of one year.--C. C.

<p>Germany. Reutlingen, February.--Rev. Gustaf Werner, a young Lutheran clergyman, is interdicted from preaching by the ecclesiastical authorities of WÃ¼rtemberg on account of Swedenborgian teachings. He attracts much attention by establishing a self-supporting institution for the education of orphans, in which the Doctrines of the New Church are regularly taught for a while.I. 1843:195.<p>Tübingen, May 31.--Dr. Tafel, in a letter to America, describes the conditions of the New Church in Germany. No regular societies have been formed as yet, religious freedom being considerably restricted. A number of Old Church ministers are secretly preaching the Heavenly Doctrines.

James Hindmarsh, April 7, 1790, and was the regular minister of the original society until May 13, 1792, when the great majority of the society, with him as pastor, removed to Store street, Tottenham Court Road, and subsequently, after various movings, to Friars street, near Ludgate Hill, on August 7, 1803. Here he remained as pastor until his death, giving his services gratis during his whole life, and gaining his support by secular work, first as a bookseller, then as a stenographer, and, after 1797, as an official of the Bank of England, where for twenty-five years he served as principal of the Chancery Office. Mr. Sibly was not a brilliant or profound preacher, but quiet, steady, hard working, and affectionate, avoiding controversy, tolerant, patient, and, above all, trustworthy. At his death he was the patriarch of the Church in England, respected and beloved by all its members.I. 1841:140.<p>Salford, August 11-15.Thirty-third General Conference.

Scara, May 13.--Death of Baron Leonard Gyllenhaal, one of the earliest and probably the most zealous of the New Church laymen in Sweden. Born in 1752, he received the Doctrines of the New Church through his kinsman, Professor Wahlfeldt, while a student at Skara, in 1770; was a student under Linnus at Upsala; entered the army and rose to the rank of major, but resigned in 1799, and devoted himself henceforth to the study of natural science. He was considered the greatest Swedish entomologist of the age, and gained a world-wide reputation in this science by his many and valuable works. He was a member of the Exegetic Philanthropic Society, and of the society, Pro Fide et Charitate, and, after the extinction of this secret New Church Society, he continued his activity as the principal supporter of Rev. Johan Tybeck, in defraying the expenses of his many publications.--Kahl. 4:22-28.<p>[Photo of Baron Leonard Gyllenhaal.]<p>Contrary to the usual custom, he communicated the Doctrines to his children; some of his descendants, now in America, are active members of the General Church of the New Jerusalem.  <p><Div Align = 'Right'>457</Div><HR><p>

<p>June 2-4.the Twenty-third General Convention. Five ministers and thirty delegates are present. A section is added to the Constitution, providing for the introduction of persons into the various degrees of the Ministry, viz.: For introduction into the first degree, application shall be made by the person who wishes to be ordained. For introduction into the second degree, application shall be made by the Society which desires to have a Pastor ordained over them. For introduction into the third degree, application shall be made by an Association; or by the Society of which the candidate is Pastor, together with two other Societies, which desire him to stand in the relation of an ordaining Minister to them. The Convention annuls the notorious squeezing rule of 1838 (see p. 429), adopting instead the following: It is recommended that all the Societies belonging to this Convention, and all that may propose to join it, should be organized in the manner above described; but if any Societies find it inconvenient to adopt this form, they may present their cases, and the convention will consider and decide upon them as they arise.

Williams, of Chillicothe, having been refused ordination, reads an abusive paper, after which the Convention passes a resolution, recommending him to withdraw from the membership of the Convention without delay. Mr. Williams did not withdraw, but continued to trouble the body for several years. He finally became a spiritist. A committee is appointed to investigate a charge of heresy made by D. Pancoast against his pastor, Rev. N. C. Burnham, the latter having said at divers times and places, that there are but few saved in the Old Church; out of which various heretical notions have arisen, which tend directly to destroy the peace and harmony of families, in begetting a fancied belief in the younger parts thereof, that they know more than their parents. The case was never formally tried, but Mr. Burnham soon afterwards married the daughter of Mr. Pancoast!--P. II. 356.

 This Committee is made to consist of one layman from each society, either the leader or the chairman of the church committee. The application of the societies in Maine for the ordination of the Rev. S. F. Dike into the third degree is referred back to those societies. The application for the ordination of Rev. B. F. Barrett into the third degree is granted. The Convention having been approached by committees of the Central and Western Conventions as to what might be done for the formation of a more general and representative Convention of the whole Church, it is resolved that, in the opinion of this Convention, the time has not yet arrived for attempting to form one general synod for the whole country. Nevertheless, a committee is appointed to confer with the committees of the other Conventions on the differences which exist in the Church, on the causes which led to them, and the means by which the peace of the Church may be restored.<p>About five hundred persons attended this Convention, over two hundred of these being visitors from other cities and guests of the Boston Society.--Conv. R. 1842.<p>The correspondence respecting Mr. De Charms is contained in the Journal of the General Convention for 1842, pp. 416-428, and is of great importance to an understanding of the differences in the New Church in America at this period. The society in Baltimore had intended to invite Mr. De Charms to visit them every three months. In the meantime the society wrote to Rev. Thomas Worcester to inquire whether such invitation would be disorderly, in view of Mr. De Charms present relations with the General Convention. Mr. Worcester, in replying, called attention to Mr. De Charms unfriendly actions towards the Convention, and charged him with having published things which were not true, with having administered the Holy Supper in public, having given the sacrament to one person who was not a member of the Church, having raised a standard of revolt, whence the peace of Jerusalem has been grievously disturbed;  <p><Div Align = 'Right'>477</Div><HR><p>

 and the golden streets of the Holy City have been defiled with blood, etc. These accusations coming to the knowledge of the Philadelphia First Society, of which Mr. De Charms was the pastor, that society demanded proofs of the accusations. Mr. Worcester, in reply, gave a long list of instances, which, he held, substantiated the charges. The Philadelphia society now declared, by resolution, that nothing appears in said letter [by Mr. Worcester] which is calculated to impair the moral or religious standing of Mr. De Charms with his congregation or the Church at large. The Baltimore society withdrew from the General Convention, and the correspondence served to increase and prolong the disunion in the Church.--Conv.

<p>Pennsylvania, Philadelphia.--The First Society is now conducting its services in Simmons Lecture Room, on Locust street, one door west of 8th Street. The attendance is large, and the society increasing. Mr. C. Chesebrough is the president, and T. S. Arthur, secretary. Mr. De Charms has resigned his position as pastor, on account of his duties in the missionary field, but still remains as the minister of the society.--C. C.

Born of French parents, in Philadelphia, 1784, he studied Law under his uncle, Jonathan W. Condy, from whom he also received the Doctrines of the New Church, in 1811. He soon rose to distinction in literary, political, and commercial circles, served as lieutenant-colonel in the war of 1812-1814, and as a member of the Pennsylvania Legislature, until 1819. In 1822 he was appointed U. S. Consul at Rio Janeiro, and, in 1825, Charge daffaires at the Court of Brazil. Here he served until 1829, when he returned to Philadelphia and entered into the journalistic profession, being editor of a number of journals, and chief spokesman of the Free Trade movement. During the latter part of his life he was president of the Atlantic Insurance Company and of the Philadelphia Chamber of Commerce. He was also one of the founders of the Philadelphia Saving Fund Society, in 1816. Mr. Raguet was no less prominent in the New Church than in the world. It was chiefly through his energy that the members of the Church in Philadelphia first organized themselves in 1815, and he was one of the founders of the General Convention, in 1817, when he served as the secretary of that body. He was also the chief mover in the reorganization of the Philadelphia First Society, in 1840, and in forming the Central Convention, of which he was elected the first president. His biography, written partly by Col. C. C. Biddle, and partly by Mr. De Charms, is published in N. II:264.<p>April 17.--Rev. M. B.

 His case was a remarkable one. A brilliant young priest of the Episcopal Church, he came over to the New Church in 1822, bringing with him a great part of his former congregation. He soon rose to great influence in the General Convention, but after some years became a dipsomaniac, and finally fell into a critical illness. On recovering he had completely forgotten everything which he had known before respecting the New Church and its teachings. He spent the latter part of his life as a physician in New Bedford.M. n. s.

 Mr. Christian Enslin, a book-seller and editor of the Deutscher-Kanadier, had received the Doctrines of the New Church about the year 1832, by accidentally procuring an unsalable copy of Dr. Tafels German translation of the Apocalypse Revealed. He soon afterwards procured the rest of the Writings in German or English, and began to propagate the Doctrines among his neighbors, but had, until 1841, gained but a single convert, Mr. Adam Ruby, while two or three other persons were reading with some interest. Mr. Enslin, on January 9, 1842, sent a first communication to The Newchurchman, of Philadelphia, and on May I applied for admission as a member of the Central Convention. Hearing, in the same year, of a New Church preacher, Mr. Harbin, at Chinquacousy, near Toronto, he wrote to the latter, who immediately visited Berlin, baptizing the two receivers, and delivering some lectures in English which were attended mostly by Germans. The little circle, slightly increased in number, now undertook the building of a small chapel, which was consecrated on December 25, 1842.--Mess. vol. 47:102; L. 1893:143; N. I:524; C. C.

Hofaker are at this time creating a great scandal in Southern Germany, bringing odium upon the New Church. Mr. Hofaker and Mr. G. Werner had established a kind of asylum for female seeresses, who prophesied in the public streets and created a great sensation. Mr. Werner at last tired of these vagaries, and endeavored to remove one of the seeresses from his house, and finally appealed to the police. This led to an open rupture between Werner and Hofaker.--C. C. R. 1843:14.<p>Great Britain. Birmingham, August 9-13.Thirty-fifth General Conference.

He soon afterwards took up his residence at Lausanne, in Switzerland, but continued his activity in the Church without interruption, assisting Dr. Tafel in the publication of the Writings in German, and publishing, at his own expense, a series of eight volumes of the Writings in French, from the manuscript translations of the late librarian Mot. He was a man of unusual intelligence and erudition in the Doctrines of the New Church, was a firm believer in the Divine authority of the Writings, and a decided opponent to the heresy of his own son, Charles Augustus Tulk.

 A very few knew why. He was a religious man, a very conscientious man, and his conscience was formed by the Ten Commandments and the Word of God, which, in private, he read much, His views concerning the Lord Jesus Christ as God manifest, concerning the Sacred Scriptures and the life they teach, concerning the moral government of the universe, and the civil government of nations, the humanity-man and the duty of rulers to protect and preserve the principles of humanity wherever found, in the highest and the lowest, were largely formed and influenced by the Writings of Swedenborg, furnished to him by his friend, Mr. I. S. Britton, about the year 1842 and 1843. The time has passed when the knowledge of this will disturb the feelings of any, and it may be well, and is due to history, that it should be preserved.--Mess. vol. 46:67.<p>The Hon. I. S.

<p>New York, Henderson, July 24.--Death of the Rev. Holland Weeks, the founder of the New Church in Abington, Mass., Detroit, Mich., Henderson, N. Y., and, indirectly, in many other places. While a Calvinist minister of high standing, he received the Doctrines of the New Church at Abington, Mass., in 1818, began to preach them openly, suffered much persecution, and was finally excommunicated in 1820. He was ordained into the Ministry of the New Church in 1821, and for a few years labored with much success as a missionary in Virginia, Pennsylvania, and New York. Owing to ill health and advanced age, he soon retired to his farm, near Henderson, N. Y., where he also served for many years as pastor of a small but devoted flock. Though a plain man, we have perhaps never had a stronger and more intensely intellectual one in the New Church than the Rev. Holland Weeks. He had been a leading minister in the Hopkinsian faith, and as such, was well known and much respected throughout New England. He was well versed in the learned languages, armed cap-a-pie in dogmatic Theology, and thoroughly grounded in the Letter of the Word.--Ex. 151; M. 17:80; Conv. R. 1844:424.<p>New York City, June 15-18.--Third Annual Meeting of the Central Convention. Five ministers and eighteen members are present. It is resolved to remove all controversial matter from The Newchurchman, and to publish such matter privately in a separate publication, to be entitled The Newchurchman Extra. The committee, appointed in 1841, to confer with the Eastern and Western Conventions, is discharged, at its own request, as its attempt: to approach the Eastern (or General) Convention has proved futile. The correspondence between the committees of the three Conventions is published in full in the Journal, and is of great interest. Rev. Thomas Worcester, as chairman of the committee of the General Convention, declines any discussion of the subject of forming a new, general and truly representative body of the whole Church, but confines himself to a willingness to confer on the differences which exist in the Church, on the causes which led to them, and the means by which the peace of the Church may be restored.  <p><Div Align = 'Right'>490</Div><HR><p>

 As such means he suggests, virtually, that the Central Convention should disown its pamphlet entitled Reasons and Principles and silence its organ, The Newchurchman, in its opposition to the principles of the General Convention. This opens up many old grievances, the committee of the Western Convention sympathizing with that of the Central Convention. The document is of great historical importance.--C. C. R. 1843.<p>Ohio, Cincinnati, January 7.Mr. Adam Haworth, of Accrington, now on an extended visit to America, in a very interesting letter to the Intellectual Repository, describes the distinguishing characteristics of the New Church in the United States, as follows: One is, that its members have generally adopted the temperance plan of abstaining from alcoholic drinks. Another is, that the Homoepathic System of Medicine is much in favor amongst them, and is adopted to a great extent. Another, that they cherish, as a religious denomination, a more exclusive spirit, or, as they themselves would perhaps term it, assume a form of greater distinctiveness, than is done by their brethren in Britain. Again, their ministers or pastors, have more external authority than ministers have in England, while the laity are in a more passive state.I. 1843:158.<p>January 31.--Rev. N. C. Burnham resigns the pastorate of the Cincinnati Third Society.--W. Conv. R. 1843:36, 37.<p>May.--Rev. M. M. Carll resigns the pastorate of the Cincinnati First Society.Ibid.<p>May 24-29.Eleventh Western Convention. The ordination of Mr. George Field is authorized.

Carll.Ibid. pp. 9, 26.<p>August 30.--Death of Rev. Adam Hurdus, the patriarch of the New Church in the West, the founder of the Cincinnati society. Born near Manchester in 1760, he had an adventurous youth, served in the navy, was captured by the French, and spent many years in military prison in France.  <p><Div Align = 'Right'>491</Div><HR><p>

 When liberated, he entered into successful mercantile pursuits in Manchester, was led to embrace the Doctrines of the New Church by reading Mr. Wesleys slanders against Swedenborg in the Arminian Magazine, and attached himself to the Rev. John Clowes. Disliking to see the New Church mixed with the Old, he soon afterwards joined in the movement for a distinctive New Church society, and became one of the founders of the Peter Street society. Emigrating to America, in 1804, he settled in Cincinnati, 1806, opened New Church services at his own house, 1808, organized the First New Church Society of Cincinnati, 1811, was ordained a minister by Mr. Hargrove, 1816, and was recognized an ordaining minister, by the General Convention, in 1828. An excellent man, humble, self-denying, affectionate and active, a simple but lucid and forceful preacher, an Israelite without guile.--M. 17:76; Ex. 97; P. II:79; I. 1812:201.

Adv. 1844:29, 44, 61.<p>London.--The London New Jerusalem Free School is at this time in a very languishing condition, and appeals for aid. Many of those who formerly supported it have now lost interest, the School not having produced any practical results in the way of benefiting the New Church. (It is to be observed that this School, like most of the New Church Free Schools in England, were charities for the benefit of the poor; very few of the members of the New Church sent their children to these Schools, and there was given but little instruction distinctively of the New Church.)--I. 1843:233.<p>January 16.--The London United Society begins to erect a new temple in Argyll [Argyle] Square.--I. 1843:117.

 he returned to Boston in 1820, was engaged in school teaching and in editorial work, 1822-1831, but continued during this period to preach to various societies in New England; removed to Bridgewater in 1833, was ordained into the Ministry, September 3, 1834, and served as pastor here until April 14, 1844. Mr. Worcester, according to his firm ecclesiastical opponent, Rev. Richard De Charms, was a strong man, with strong virtues and strong defects. A man of undoubted talents, great energy and decision of character, a sermonizer of the first order; ... an able, frank, bold, persevering man, but somewhat harsh and inclined towards arbitrary measures. He was one of the principal originators and most out-spoken defenders of the conjugial relation between a pastor and his society. His last years were beclouded by his connection with the New Era movement (see New York), but, as his end approached, the illusion was dispelled, he regained a state of peace, and there is every reason to believe that he sincerely repented of the evils into which spiritualism had betrayed him. (Rev. W. Woodman, in I. 1860:215). See also, Ex. pp. 286-291; the biography by his son, Rev. S. H. Worcester, in the account of the 10-27, and the pamphlet respecting the New Era, by S. H.

 His adherents assemble privately for worship, for the administration of the Sacraments, in a new and better way, and for the reception of immediate revelations from spirits and angels. A leading New Church minister associates himself with this circle, claims to have been ordained the high priest of the New Church by the spirit of Swedenborg himself, and proceeds to inaugurate a new priesthood for the New Church. His son, similarly, claims to have received ordination from Swedenborgs spirit, but, some years afterwards, rejects his former vagaries. Many disorders and moral evils are attendant upon this movement. We have no information as to its final history.--See De Charms Introduction to Sermons against Pseudo-Spiritualism, 1853, pp. 38, 41, and I. 1860:215.<p>New York City, June 12-14.The Twenty-sixth General Convention.

Charles John Doughty, the organizer and first minister of the New Church in New York. Born of Quaker parents, in the then village of Brooklyn, in 1784, he had entered upon a successful career as a lawyer when he received the Doctrines of the New Church in 1815, through Mr. Nathaniel Holly, his former school-master. He at once associated himself with the small New Church circle in New York, and became its recognized leader, organizing the first regular society in 1816, and receiving ordination into the Ministry, from Rev. M. M. Carll, in 1818. He now remained as the pastor of the First Society of New York until 1838, when he resigned this office. Together with Rev. R. De Charms, he took a leading part in the formation of the Central Convention, of which he was the first president. In 1841 he organized and became the pastor of the Second Society of New York, continuing as such until his death.  <p><Div Align = 'Right'>502</Div><HR><p>

Five ministers and twenty members are present. The report of the Committee to confer with the other Conventions is adopted. It is resolved that this convention sees no just ground for disavowing any of the reasons and principles on which it has hitherto acted. A Committee is appointed to take into consideration the subject of a new translation of the Word. The establishment of a complete New Church seminary is declared one of the most important uses to which the Convention could devote its best and most enduring energies. (This resolution expresses the conception which, many years later, led to the establishment of the Schools of the Academy of the New Church). The meeting declares that the Central Convention is in all respects co-ordinate, and in no respects subordinate, to any general body of the New Church, and that no persons can at one and the same time be members of two co-ordinate bodies or conventions. Mr. De Charms, having resigned as editor of The Newchurchman, Mr. Doughty is appointed editor of that journal, while Mr. DeCharms still remains as editor of The Newchurchman Extra.--C. C. R. 1844.<p>Australia. Adelaide, July 7.--The first New Church meeting for worship in Australia is held at the house of Mr. Jacob Pitman, on Rundle street. Four male adults are present.

 Rev. T. C. Shaw still serves as the pastor of the society. The building and the occasion is described in I. 1844:337.<p>August 13-19.The Thirty-seventh General Conference is held in the newly erected temple in Argyle Square. Present, ten ministers and twenty-two representatives; Rev. Edward Madeley, president. The time of the Conference is occupied chiefly in passing upon a complete set of New Rules for the body itself, for the members of the Conference, for the general officers, for committees, trustees, etc. The former rules are rescinded and the new ones adopted, as prepared by a special committee after a period of four years. The ordination of David Thomas Dyke, of Salisbury, is authorized. The societies at Haslingden, Longton, Ipswich, and Preston, are received into the Conference. The new temple at Preston, the gift of Hugh Becconsall, Esq., is received in Conference trust. A donation of 300 is received from Joseph Clover, Esq.<p>The Conference expresses its complete concurrence in the views on the subject of the trine in the Ministry, as expressed in a report presented at this session by a committee of the Conference. The Rev. Thomas Worcester, of Boston, in a communication from the General Convention in 1842. had asked for the opinion of the Conference on this subject, and also on the subjects of the order of the Church as consisting of a trine in just order, and on the relation of an orderly ministry and an orderly church to each other.<p>The Conference, through Rev. J. H. Smithson, replied in very general terms to the questions as to the trine, but expressed itself as follows on the relation of the ministry to the church: If the relation mentioned is intended to lead us to consider whether there be ... a conjugial relation between a pastor and his church, we would beg to say, most distinctly, most unequivocally, and most decidedly, that in our opinion no such relation has any existence; in other words, that there is not any conjugial relation whatever between a pastor and his flock, or church, ... no more than there is between any one member of the church and all the rest.--Conf.

<p>Indiana, Fort Wayne. Death of Jonathan Chapman (Johnny Appleseed), the New Church evangelist and circulating library of the wilderness, the primitive barefooted Christian, the long-haired pilgrim with a mush-pot for a hat,--probably the most romantic figure in New Church History. Born in Boston, about the year 1775, he drifted, while a young man, to Western Pennsylvania, where he received the Doctrines of the New Church (probably from the Hon. John Young, of Greensburg, with whom he kept in constant communication and who acted as his agent in procuring New Church books). In the year 1801ISoI he began to traverse the border settlements of Ohio with loads of apple seeds, which he planted in sheltered spots, leaving the young orchards to await the coining of future settlers. In this useful occupation, and in the unintermittent work of distributing New Church literature, he spent more than forty years of his life, a solitary, humble, unnoticed sower of good seed. Clad in the simplest raiments, barefooted par preference, with an old coffee-sack for overcoat, and for a hat the tin pot in which he prepared his meals, loaded with bags of apple seeds and packages of Swedenborgs Writings, this remarkable character was ever pushing forward further west in advance of the tide of civilization, leaving behind him thousands of flourishing orchards and grateful settlers. Thus he tramped all over Ohio and Indiana, unmolested by the Indians, who looked upon him as a great medicine man, and ever a welcome guest in the log cabins of the early settlers, to whom he was, indeed, a guide, philosopher and friend. As such he proved himself especially during the war of 1812, when he traveled unceasingly, day and night, warning the settlers against the raids of the Indian allies of Great Britain. He thus gained a wide and lasting reputation as a picturesque, eccentric philanthropist, of whom a thousand tales, amusing, pathetic and inspiring, are still being told. His greatest delight was the announcement of the glories of the New Jerusalem.  <p><Div Align = 'Right'>534</Div><HR><p>

 On entering a log cabin he would throw himself down on the floor, open his precious package of books, ask the people if they would have some news right fresh from Heaven, and then proceed to read aloud the strange Gospel to the astonished family around the hearthstone, or else expound the glorious truths with a glow of enthusiasm such as to affect even those who looked upon him as half-witted or a heretic. Unable to carry a whole library on his back, he would divide each volume of the Writings into sheets, and distribute these in the various cabins on his route, circulating them in rotation until each family had read a whole book, the last on the route naturally reading it backwards, from the end to the beginning. In this manner he undoubtedly did much to prepare the ground for the numerous New Church societies which at one time flourished in Ohio, and several earnest members of the Church are known to have received their first knowledge of the Doctrines from Johnny Appleseed. He applied himself especially to the children, among whom he was a great favorite. They would help him in planting his orchards, while he was telling them about the beauties of the other world, until he left them, enriched by presents of pennies and New Church tracts; (some of the latter are known to have taken root in after-life). Among his numerous eccentricities was a passionate tenderness for aged or abused horses, of whom, in various places, he kept a great number as pensioners. In 1838, feeling his occupation gone in the now well-settled districts of Ohio, he bid all his friends a solemn farewell, and betook himself westward to the further wilderness, where he wrought his good works until 1847, when he died peacefully and beautifully in a log cabin near Fort Wayne, Indiana.<p>A homely, humble-hearted man,--a spirit sent<br>To cheer the world and plant the newer gospel as he went.<p>For further particulars see 15th Report of Manch.

 Dr. Beers became acquainted with the Doctrines of the New Church in 1812, through the reading of the Halcyon Luminary, announced himself openly as a receiver of these Doctrines 1814, was ordained 1816, and before long succeeded in establishing New Church societies and circles at Danby, Spencer, Ithaca, and other places.

 The ordination of Mr. Abiel Silver and Mr. Jabez Fox is approved. The Journal of the Convention is ordered to be published separate from the New Jerusalem Magazine. The committee on the case of Rev. L. C. Belding reports that they are not satisfied that the rumors currently reported against his moral character are true. Nevertheless, the case is recommitted, but no report is returned, and Mr. Belding remains permanently suspended. It is resolved that that which has been regarded as the first grade in the ministry be hereafter abolished, and that for the present there be two grades only; that those of the first grade (formerly the second), be called Pastors and Missionaries, and those of the second (formerly the third), be called Ordaining ministers. It is further resolved that this Convention does not regard itself and does not wish to be regarded, as responsible for the views contained in the address prepared by a committee appointed by the Convention, and published in the New Jerusalem Magazine for September, 1840. (In this address, which is signed by the President of the General Convention, the claim is put forth that the precepts of this [spiritual] Father and Mother are to be applied to its life by the general church of the country, that is, the general church is to decide how these precepts are to be understood, and what they require all the parts of the church to shun or to do, and that when anyone assumes to pass judgment upon the deliberate and united doings of the whole, he assumes to have more of the church in him, or to be wiser than the whole, etc. [M. 14:25, 26.] It was this assumption of spiritual authority which caused the division of the church in 1840.) It is also resolved that no society shall be entitled to be represented in Convention by more than seven delegates, and that though this Convention recommends re-baptism, it wishes to leave the Ministers and Societies of the New Church free in regard to the subject.--Conv. R. 1849; M. 22:229.<p>June 17.--Messrs. Abiel Silver and Jabez Fox are ordained as missionaries by Rev. Thomas Worcester.--M. 22:241.  <p><Div Align = 'Right'>559</Div><HR><p>

Born 1786, and son of John Augustus Tulk, he took a leading part in the formation and development of the Swedenborg Society, but was opposed to the external organization of the New Church distinct from the Old. Becoming infected with the Idealism of Berkeley, Coleridge and other Gnostics, he attempted to interpret the Doctrines of the New Church from an idealistic point of view, and in time produced a curious system of Theology in which every fundamental doctrine of the New Church is essentially denied. Denying the reality of all material or outward objects, he denied also the reality of the Incarnation of the Lord, maintaining that it was not Jehovah Himself who assumed the Human, but that Jesus Christ was only an apparition, the representative outbirth of the idea of God as held collectively by the men of that age. In his efforts to introduce this doctrine into the New Church, Mr. Tulk published several tracts and volumes, and employed the pages of the New Jerusalem Magazine (London, 1820-1829), and the New Church Advocate (London, 1842-1896). The heresy was vigorously combated by Rev. Messrs. Clowes, Noble, Mason and others, in the Intellectual Repository, but none the less gained a number of adherents who, long after Mr. Tulks death, continued to propagate his teachings. For accounts of Mr. Tulks life and religious system, see Mrs. Hume-Rotherys Sketch of Charles Augustus Tulk (Boston, 1850), and the biography by Richard McCully in N. C.

Thomas Goyder, aged sixty-three years. Mr. Goyder received the Doctrines of the New Church in London, 1805, and at once associated himself with the Society of Rev. Joseph Proud, at York Street, and afterwards at Lisle Street. When the society at St. Georges Field was organized, in 1814, Mr. Goyder became its leader and minister, receiving ordination in 1817. Chiefly through his exertions the Society erected a new temple at Waterloo Road, 1818, where he opened the New Jerusalem Free School, 1822, and remained as pastor until 1833, when the Society disbanded. He now accepted the charge of the Society at Norwich, was made an ordaining minister, 1838, and was at his death the senior minister of the New Church in Great Britain. Mr. Goyder was better known as a writer than as a preacher.  <p><Div Align = 'Right'>561</Div><HR><p>
