<p>EDITORS EPILOG<br>In these two volumes of the Annals of the early Academy and of the General Church, there may be observed a number of emerging characteristics, patterns and features. Among these, though by no means all, we would note the following:<p>(1)&nbsp;The steady, progressing work of the General Church and the Academy, only minimally and rarely marked by spurts and set-backs.<p>(2)&nbsp;A gradual increase in the number and substance of the District Assemblies.<p>(3) An increase in the number of episcopal visits to local societies, circles and groups.<p>(4)&nbsp;The rise of the summer academies and camps.<p>(5)&nbsp;The beginnings of group and seminar methods.<p>(6)&nbsp;Growing flexibility in experimentation and new ideas. <p>(7)&nbsp;A solidifying process of consensus as to the doctrines of the New Church, caused by, and accompanying, a growing perception of the destructiveness of violent, proprial dissension and division, and also, perhaps, a greater clarity as to the difference between personal, and even institutional, interpretation and application on the one hand, and the Divine Doctrine Itself as it is in the Word, on the other hand.<p><br>We cannot close these pages without noting the many changes in personnel and administration which have taken place in this year, 1976.<p>Most important have been administrative changes in the administrative offices of the Academy and the General Church. Schedule for Sept. 1, 1976, these will be:<p>1.&nbsp;The retirement of Bishop Willard D. Pendleton as Executive Bishop of the General Church.<br>2.&nbsp;Acceptance by the 1976 General Assembly of the Rt. Rev. Louis B. King as Bishop of the General Church. <br>3.&nbsp;Appointment of the Rev. Alfred Acton II as President of the Academy.<br>4.&nbsp;So many other pastoral and official changes that altogether this year has witnessed an almost complete changing of the guard.<p>So be it. Change is often the sign of progression and growth.  <p><Div Align = 'Right'>261</Div><HR><p>
