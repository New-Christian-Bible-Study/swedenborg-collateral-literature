It was this period which witnessed the greatest growth in the bodies of the New Church so far, i. e., from memberships of 1,500 approx. to 7,500. It also included a great increase in New Church literature and a sometimes phenomenal outpouring of the Writings by the publishing houses to hundreds of universities and libraries in Great Britain and the United States. It saw the rise of the educational emphasis with the Academy of the New Church coming into being and the birth of a new body of the Church, i. e., the General Church, with New Church education as its special adopted use.<p>For the purposes and limits of this work, the reader is referred to the Preface of Volume I. by the Reverend C. Th. Odhner, which covers the years 1688-1850 and was published early in this century.<p>It should be noticed that the format and content of Volume II have been altered somewhat in the interests of brevity and compactness in relation to the great mass of material. As examples of this: all Notable Memorials. Meetings and Reports, and Ordinations mentioned in the main body or Chronology, but without any comment, have been lifted out and placed in lists in the Appendix. This does not mean that they are of little interest or value, but simply that the compilers, though recognizing their importance, evidently did not feel they were of sufficient value to warrant comment in the main body. However, a very little reading of the references in these lists will give the reader much of the flavor, direction, thoughts, and feelings of the New Churchmen involved and of the times in which they lived. To make comment on, or summary of, each of these items would have extended the work itself to many volumes beyond its limits of practicality, for this work is not a history but a chronicle and, hopefully, a source book for future historians.<p>We leave other observations to the reader and the work itself, only calling attention to the Appendix lists, with the cautionary note that these are by no means complete but only include items actually mentioned in the chronology.<p>It will be noticed that a key letter(s) has been placed at the end of each meeting or report mentioned in the main text and in the lists. These are very general classifications of the main subjects discussed, the key to which will be found below.<p>It is the custom in Prefaces for the editor to make acknowledgments of those who have assisted in a book. In this case, however, so many persons and agencies of the Church have contributed to this work that it would be too much to list them all. And besides, the editor would run considerable risk of leaving out some of the most important! The collecting of New Church periodicals and publications and their placing in the Academy of the New Churchs Collateral Literature Room by various persons of the Academy Library staff, the acquisition and cataloging of Archive material--all these efforts have given invaluable help to the work of the editor. In addition, there was the labor of reference-checking, composing the Appendix lists, the gathering and collating of material, the compacting, correcting, and final typing of the text. All these have demanded considerable devoted effort on the part of many people.<p>Morley D.

We maintain, on the ground of our argument, that, as the Lord made His second advent through the instrumentality of Swedenborg, the truths which he has been the means of revealing to us, are divine; that they are the Lords spiritual Word, being the spiritual sense contained in the natural sense of the Sacred Scriptures, wherein the divinity of the Word resides; that these truths have all divine authority, as the Lords Word to His New Church. The report is accepted. The Rev. E. A. Beaman notes dissatisfaction: and obtains leave to print: Views of the Nature of Swedenborgs Illumination. He concludes: How shall we regard Swedenborgs writings? Shall we regard them as human or as Divine? As human, of course; for, to regard them as Divine would be to regard them as Sacred Scripture, and thus as the Word. But we must regard them as of the very highest authority next to the Word. And we must regard them as a finality not because they are necessarily infallible, as the Word is but because they are a rational and true explanation, by the chosen servant of the Lord--by him whose special use or mission it was to do this work--of the internal sense of the Sacred Scriptures, and thus of the doctrines of the New Church. Messrs. Benade and Wilks also presented a Report on the Book of Principles. under consideration by the General Convention. The Book of Principles is approved, with important exceptions concerning the orders and duties of the priesthood.

The New Church claims to be a spiritual Church. and ought to regard all questions relating to the organization of the Church from a spiritual point of view, and all the relations of individuals to Societies, and of Societies to Associations as essentially spiritual; and<br>Whereas. The spiritual relations are prior to and more important to the spiritual welfare, and conduce more effectively to the use of the larger bodies; and<br>Whereas. The laws of charity also demand that Societies of the New Church should be left in entire freedom to choose their immediate social and spiritual relationships as may be most congenial to themselves; therefore<br>Resolved. That, while for convenience, or other external reasons, it is expedient. and perhaps necessary, that an Association of the Church should have certain geographical metes and bounds, which ought in general to be observed, yet the rule of geographical boundary should not be so gifidly applied as to interfere with the freedom of any Society to choose, from doctrinal, or other internal considerations, to affiliate itself with any Association with which it can conveniently act.<br>Note: The Committee on Ecclesiastical Affairs consisted of all the ministers belonging to the Convention with Rev.
