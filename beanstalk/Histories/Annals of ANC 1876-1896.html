(1897) We have, therefore, titled these two volumes under the latter name as being more general, and have made two parts of the first volume, viz. "The Academy, 1876-96", and "The General Church, 1897-1937". Vol. II is "The General Church, 1938-76".<p>It should be noted that we have not retained the former title, "Annals of the New Church," since the materials offered do not include items from other bodies of the Church, with a few exceptions.<p>In its beginning, the Academy was both a church and an educational institution. But by 1890, it was seen that the two uses should be more clearly distinguished. Accordingly and preliminarily, there was first formed "The Church of the Advent of the Lord". Finally, in 1897, there was formed "The General Church of the New Jerusalem" as the general religious body, the Academy becoming its educational institution.<p>Generally speaking, the material collected has been retained in its original form, style and content. There have been necessary, however, a large amount of editing, compacting, and some cutting as well as adding.<p>As in Vol. II of Annals of the New Church, there will be found the year-by-year chronicle of outstanding events, noteworthy articles, publications, and contemporary events. An Appendix lists Meetings and Reports, Notable memorials, and Ordinations. As previously, these are not complete by any means; they are selective, being lifted out of the main text.

The full text of the Declaration follows:<p>"In the work entitled "The True Christian Religion", written by the Lord, through Emanuel Swedenborg, His Servant, and containing the Universal Theology of the New Church, foretold by the Lord in Daniel VII: 13, 14; and in Revelation XXI:1, 2, it is declared: That at this day is the last time or end of the Primitive Christian Church, predicted in the Evangelists and in Revelation; that after this very night in which the preceding Churches have come to their end, there follows a morning, which is the Second Coming of the Lord; that this Second Coming of the Lord is in order that the evil may be separated from the good, and those may be saved who have believed, and who do believe in Him; and that a new angelic Heaven may be formed from them, and a New Church on Earth, without which no flesh could be saved:<p>That this Second Coming of the Lord is not in person, but in the Word, which is from Him, and is Himself, and that it is effected by means of a man, before whom He has manifested Himself, and whom He has filled with His Spirit, to teach the Doctrine of the New Church, by the Word, from Him:<p>That the man before whom the Lord has manifested Himself is Emanuel Swedenborg, whom He has sent on this office, having opened the sight of his spirit, let him into the Spiritual World, given him to see the heavens and the hells, and also to speak with angels and spirits; and, that from the first day of his call, this man received not anything which pertains to the doctrine of that Church, from any angel, but from the Lord alone, while he read the Word. That this is meant in the Revelation by the New Heavens and the New Earth, and the New Jerusalem descending thence.<p>That this New Church is the crown of all the Churches which have hitherto been in the World; which shall worship one visible God, in whom is the invisible God, and this conjunction of God with man be effected.<p>That this Church is to endure for ages of ages, as the bride and wife of the Lamb, as it is written: "Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and He will dwell with them, and they shall be His people, and He will be with them their God. And the nations that are saved shall walk in His light, and there shall be no night there. I, Jesus have sent mine angels to testify to you these things in the Churches. I am the Root and the Offspring of David, the bright and morning star. The Spirit and the Bride say, Come; and let him that heareth say, Come; and let him that is thirsty, come; and whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely. Even so, Come; Lord Jesus. Amen."

<p>In the full and rational acknowledgment of the Lord Jesus Christ, who is Jehovah in His Divine Humanity, of His Second Coming into the Word in the revelation of the spiritual sense of the Word, of the spiritual things of Heaven, of Hell, and of the World of Spirits, made through the instrumentality of Emanuel Swedenborg; in the full and rational acknowledgment of the spiritual sense of the Word thus revealed, as the Lord's Divine Doctrine for the New Church, and knowing no other law, and no other authority except the Lord Himself in this His Second Coming. We, who have hereunto subscribed our names, devoutly praying that the Lord's will may be done as in Heaven, so on the Earth, do hereby convenant together, and constitute ourselves into a body of the Lord's New Church, to be styled, "The Academy of the New Jerusalem", to the end, that by mutual counsel and assistance, and by united action, we may be the better prepared and provided in spirit and in life, to see the Lord's will in the interior revelations of His Truth, at this day given, and to do it; to cultivate and to promulgate a knowledge of those divine revelations in their spiritual purity, and to engage in those uses of spiritual charity, which have respect primarily to the growth and development of the Spiritual Church.<p>And, of these uses of spiritual charity, do we name specifically, as ends proposed by our Union: The instruction and preparation of young men for the Office of the Priesthood: the collection, publication and preservation of the Manuscripts and of the original editions of those writings, which constitute the Second Advent of the Lord; the preparation and publication of works treating more particularly of the spiritual doctrines revealed by the Lord, and having for their end the building up of the Church in an ever more rational and intelligent reception of its Heavenly Truths, and leading to an ever more interior love of the Lord and the Neighbor; so that the Lord in His coming may be received by His own, and the New Jerusalem may be established as His celestial and Spiritual Kingdom on the Earth.<p>Wm.

J. to Philadelphia to take charge of the Academy theological school in the absence of Chancellor Benade. His unusual doctrinal and literary ability was also revealed in the "Missionary Liturgy" and the first "Academy Liturgy" of 1876; also as editor of and leading contributor to Words for the New Church. One of the original founders of the Academy of the New Church, he became its first Vice-Chancellor. As Professor of Rhetoric, he served the Academy to the end of his life, when, at his request, he was buried by the side of the Rev. David Powell in the old Delaware County Society cemetery at Upper Darby, Pa. A wise, far-seeing leader of spiritual integrity, his human charity, energy and wit endeared him to his own generation and entitled him to the gratitude of the church to which he gave his entire life. - Biogr. by Rev.

<p>1883<p>AMERICA<p>UNITED STATES<p>FLORIDA<br>Orange Park, Nov. 14. - Death of the Rev. George Field, aged 73 years. Born in Norfolk (or Huntingdon), England, Feb. 10, 1810, he emigrated to the United States, and became a member of the Pearl St. Society, New York City, in 1836. After missionary work in the West, he began to preach in Detroit on Dec. 9, 1843, and came to be regarded as "the father of the New Church in Michigan". Author of The Early History of the New Church in the Western States and Canada (1879), and The Two Great Books of Nature and Revelation; or, the Cosmos and the Logos (1870).<p>A man of firm conviction, earnestness, and courage, he was sometimes a controversial figure. But his able and bold advocacy of the Writings won the respect even of his critics, and was especially eulogized by the leaders of the "Academy movement". - Mess., vol. 45, p. 308; biogr. sk., 45:319. Cf. L. 1884:1, 13, 28, 29, 32.<p>ILLINOIS<br>Chicago, Oct. - Under the heading, "The Episcopal New Church", the New Church Review (Oct.) comments as follows upon the newly-formed General Church of Pennsylvania: "That an association of New Church societies should organize a general Church upon the only ecclesiastical polity clearly defined in the writings of Swedenborg, is not so surprising as the fact that not until a century after the first attempts at church organization, this step should at last be taken, and then only to be regarded in the light of a curious novelty. This step has been taken by the Pennsylvania Association in the adoption of a complete prelatical organization, the adoption of the title of a General Church and the election of a Bishop. Far from being a new or unrecognized principle of church organization, this has from the first beginning of our Church's existence been not only recognized as plainly indicated in the Writings, but as endorsed by the best judgment of the Church at large. Thus the late Dr. Thomas Worcester openly declared in an article entitled "A View of the Pastoral Relation", (New Jerusalem Magazine, vol. xix, p. 182), that the Episcopal order is recognized as the true order in the New Church, and that every member of the Committee and of the Convention' who voted for a certain Rule of Order adopted relating to the office of Ordaining Ministers did so because he believed it to be a part of the true order'... The movement of the Church in Pennsylvania is one of deep interest and significance. It means to us an honest putting-off of timid subterfuges by which the people are either flattered or deceived, in regard to the real nature of their Church organization, and a willingness to call things by their right names and let the people judge of their usefulness by seeing them openly and honestly practiced".<p>MASSACHUSETTS,<br>Boston, June 1-5. - At the 63rd General Convention, a momentous resolution is offered approving of the freedom of any society to choose any Association.  <p><Div Align = 'Right'>31</Div><HR><p>

Glenn, in his 68th year. Born April 27, 1815, near Frankford, Pa., his father was Robert Glenn, one of the founders of the Frankford Society. Under the leadership of Rev. Richard de Charms I, he became a leading lay spirit in the Central Convention. Later, he was an ardent supporter of Bishop Benade, and had a leading part in the building of the Cherry St. temple and schoolhouse. He was prominent in the Philadelphia real estate business.

Benade (General Faster) presiding. 37 persons are present, including delegates from Philadelphia, Darby, Pittsburgh, Lancaster and Allentown. The president explains that "the recent action of the Convention in changing its constitution had left the various Associations free to adopt such forms of government as they wished". On behalf of the "Ecclesiastical and Executive Councils", he therefore submits a new Constitution for the government of the Association. The new Constitution is entitled, "instrument of Organization of The General Church of Pennsylvania, heretofore known as the Pennsylvania Association of the New Church." This includes statements of belief and organization and ten "Canons" for the government of the Association. By it the episcopal form of government is approved; and the Rev. William Henry Benade (former General Pastor of the Pa. Association), is recognized as "Bishop". The new Constitution is discussed, amended, and unanimously adopted. Bishop Benade appoints a Consistory and a "Council of the Laity". Mr. John Pitcairn, Jr., delegate from Pittsburgh, is elected Chairman of the Council. The membership at this time is estimated at 396; with seven societies in Allentown, Philadelphia, Darby, Lancaster, Greenford, Pittsburgh, and Utahville and Sanborn, also including 75 isolated members.  <p><Div Align = 'Right'>32</Div><HR><p>

<p>March 19-21. - Fourth (60th) meeting of the General Church of Pennsylvania; Bishop Benade presiding. Present 7 ministers 5 members of the Council of the Laity, and 13 delegates. The Allentown and Brooklyn German Churches send full delegations. The Bishop's address reviews the history of the Pennsylvania Association from 1845 to 1883. The principle of unanimity is urged. An extended discussion is waged on the question, "Shall all Church property be vested in the general body?" Also the question of the extension of the General Church regardless of geographical limitations. The Rev. Wm. F. Pendleton presents a historical sketch of the Immanuel Church (Chicago), and its relation to the ruling of the General Convention in 1883, (Minute No. 49). He also reads a paper on "The Function of an External Church", (text in Journal, p. 62, and, L. 66-8), which clarifies the relation of the Academy to the General Church of Pennsylvania, and increases harmony. A College Letter notes: "There seems to be a recognition on the part of members of both the Academy and the General Church of Pennsylvania of the position of each body, the Academy being an Internal Church, and the General Church of Pennsylvania an External Church". The report of the Council of the Laity (John Pitcairn, Chairman), urges a more complete record of the speeches and addresses of every general meeting of the Church. (This resulted in a very much enlarged Journal etc., and set a precedent which has been followed in the General Church to the present time). - See Journal, (75pp.); and Coll. Lre. No. 4, p. 6.

 The Rev. Louis H. Tafel resigns as Bishop's Assistant, and reports that, "my experience in the past year has convinced me that the concentration of power as taught and practiced in our body is not conducive to good effects". He urges following the teaching in D. P. 71, etc., which calls for the "greatest freedom in the operations of church societies, families, and individuals which may be compatible with...the preservation of order..." Bishop Benade interprets the doctrine to mean that "every man is at liberty to think and to will, but not to speak or say what he thinks, nor to do what he wills. Liberty is not in speech and act, but in will and thought..."<p>- It is unanimously resolved that the General Church accepts Mr. Tafel's withdrawal from the candidacy for the office of Assistant Bishop, and also from the "Commission for the translation of the Word"<p>- Nearly three sessions are devoted to the financial support of the ministry.

<p>On June 7th, 1890, Bishop Benade authorized Mr. Homer Synnestvedt and Mr. Joseph E. Rosenqvist as Candidates for the Ministry.<p>3. The General Church has suffered very greatly during the year, in consequence of the severe illness of our beloved Bishop, the Rev. W. H. Benade, who was prostrated during his visit to Europe last summer, on missions of the Church. Two or three times it has seemed as if he had nearly recovered, but on attempting work he was thrown back in each case, so far that now absolute rest is enforced. Although much of his work has been taken up and done by other hands, there remains a great deal which he alone could do, and the loss of his extensive knowledge, and wise counsel is seriously felt throughout this body of the Church.<p>4. As to Particular Churches, those not specially spoken of below have undergone no material changes, but have maintained their interest and activity in the uses of the Church.<p>The Church of the Advent was under the direct care of the Bishop of the General Church from the time of our last report to the middle of last summer, when the Rev. Leonard G. Jordan was called to and accepted the Pastorate. The Church has continued in a prosperous condition since that time. It has adopted a new Constitution more in harmony with that of the General Church of Pennsylvania, and changed its name from "New Jerusalem Society of the Advent", to "Church of the Advent". At present the Church is very harmonious and united.<p>The Pittsburgh Society has now the additional assistance of the Rev. Wm. H. Acton. In the report of this Society special mention is made of the custom of using wine at the social meetings of the Society. It is stated that this is done upon principle, on the ground that it is especially useful in inducing a sphere of brotherly feeling among the members, and as a true means to avoidance of excesses. It may be stated that this custom is general throughout the General Church of Pennsylvania.<p>The Rev. N. Dandridge Pendleton has been called to the assistance of the Rev. E. C. Bostock in his pastorate of the Immanuel Church, Chicago.<p>In the Greenford Society there were certain disturbances growing out of the disaffection of some members, associated with others not members, who proceeded in a most disorderly and violent method to carry out their purposes. Resort was had by the General Church to the civil courts for protection, and this resulted in the complete vindication of the Society. In all probability, affairs would not have proceeded to such extremes but for the unwise and uncharitable interference of representatives of the Ohio Association*.<p>5. At the annual meeting of the General Church, in November, 1889, the principal subject of discussion was that of the relation of the General Church to the General Convention, taken up in accordance with the recommendation to that effect, of the Council of the Clergy. It would not be practicable or desirable, perhaps, to present even an abstract of the proceedings, but it is proper that the Convention should be informed of certain of the facts and especially of official action taken.  <p><Div Align = 'Right'>64</Div><HR><p>

<p>The discussion was full and free, and, we believe, although in the nature of a family consideration of the situation, characterized by a desire to deal fairly and justly and in true charity with all. To this end there was a distinct intention and effort to keep out mere personalities, to state only what could be substantiated, and, above all, to apply the pure principles of the Revelation for the New Church of the LORD. The result was what appears to us to be a serious arraignment of the Convention for unkind, unbrotherly, and disorderly action toward this General Church.<p>Bishop Benade has recalled to our minds that some years ago, acting under the Constitution of the Convention as it then existed, a minister was suspended by the General Church of Pennsylvania. This act was offensive to certain members of the Convention, and an attempt was made to revise the action, evidently with a view to nullify it. Our representatives showed that this attempt was contrary to the law and order of the Convention itself but it was not until legal counsel of Massachusetts passed upon the question that the attempt was abandoned. Then so strong was the feeling against this action of the General Church taken under the provisions of the Convention's Constitution that the Convention determined to alter its Constitution so as to prevent a repetition of such action. In the course of this operation a committee was appointed and a compromise agreed upon. The right of suspension of a minister was thereby reserved to the Convention, but the right to enjoin a minister from acting as such within the limits of an Association was especially granted to the respective Associations.<p>In the course of time, the General Church saw fit to act In accordance with the powers thus conferred upon it by a compromise article formally adopted by the Convention. Against the earnest protest of representatives of this General Church being in violation of the Constitution, an attempt was made to revise the action of the General Church in this case. This was breaking a compact agreed upon not in ignorance, but after experience and as a compromise.<p>Also against the Constitution of Convention, and, as before, against the protest of the General Church, the matter was referred to the General Council of the Convention. That Council reported that an investigation into the facts and principles involved was impracticable and not likely to lead to the best results. Then the Convention proceeded to nullify this action of its Council and, without the least investigation, adopted a resolution implying censure of this General Church.<p>It is now proposed to take out from the Constitution the provision granting this right that was secured to Associations as a compromise. This proposition will be before you for action at this meeting.<p>On the other hand, another proposition has been made, which will also be presented for your consideration, to establish a court of appeal in all, such court to consist of the General Pastors of the Convention. We believe this to be in accordance with the order of the doctrine on ecclesiastical government quoted in the Constitution of Convention.<p>The Council of the Clergy of the General Church, in view of the disorder of the Convention, called attention to the following words of the Bishop of this General Church:  <p><Div Align = 'Right'>65</Div><HR><p>

<p>"The Convention's relation to the associated bodies needs to be considered and regulated. This cannot be brought into order until the Convention has one order for all or is willing to give to each Association the right of independent action in its own affairs. We are actually divided into three parties, and if we are to be governed by majorities, and not by the Constitution, we can only go forward to dissolution. The law must be recognized and have all power. Otherwise we shall have anarchy".<p>The Council of the Laity of the General Church presented the following expression of its views of the Convention:<p>"The members of the Council of the Laity, who represented the General Church, as delegates, at the recent session of the General Convention (at Washington), unanimously wish to express their protest against the manifest animosity shown toward this General Church of Pennsylvania, by the attitude and action of the General Convention, and to deplore that body's lack of adherence to its own Constitution, its lack of freedom in discussion, and its tendency to place human prudence above the doctrine of the Church".<p>The General Church as a body, by a rising vote, adopted the following resolution:<p>"The General Church of Pennsylvania, in annual meeting assembled, hereby unanimously confirms the statement made by Bishop Benade, at the last meeting of the General Convention, in regard to the injunction of the Rev. L. H. Tafel, formerly pastor of the New Jerusalem Society of the Advent, in which statement occur the following words:<p>"We objected to the injunction being considered by the General Council, not because we did not desire an investigation, but because the manner of the proposed investigation was unconstitutional. It was our desire that there might be the fullest possible investigation of this subject, and we proposed in the Council of Ministers that a tribunal of General Pastors should be formed by which such cases should be tried. I think it is right to the General Church that this should be stated here. Our action was taken under the law of our Church and of the Convention. We wish to be in order, and to proceed according to order. The act was not an act of the Bishop of the Church alone, but of the General Church of Pennsylvania by its constituted authorities, and it is not right to fasten it upon the one official. It must be understood that the action was the action of the law of the Church, to which the General Pastor, or Bishop, is subject just as much as any other member. There is no distinction in what is called the prelatical order of the Church between the subjection of the ministers and that of laymen to the law of the Church. They look to that which they believe to be the LORD'S revelation whether they hold this, that, or the other position. I think it is due to the General Church of Pennsylvania to state this".<p>In reference to the action of the Convention in this matter, the General Church adopted the following statement and resolution:<p>"The Constitution of the General Convention gives the Associations the right to enjoin a minister from the exercise of his functions within its own limits.  <p><Div Align = 'Right'>66</Div><HR><p>

 Acting under this law the General Church of Pennsylvania enjoined the Rev. L. K. Tafel.<p>"The General Convention, at its last meeting, held in Washington, passed a resolution which implied censure to the General Church of Pennsylvania for this act, and this in the face of the report of the General Council that a thorough investigation of the case in all its details of fact and principle was hardly practicable, and not likely to lead to the best results.<p>"Thus the Convention acted without any attempt at investigation and without any knowledge of the facts of the case except from the biased statements of the enjoined minister and his adherents.<p>"The Convention and the General Council in the various proceedings bearing on this matter, acted contrary to the plain letter of the Constitution and to the Act of Incorporation, which requires that the General Council shall be governed by the Constitution.<p>"The Divine law of the Church teaches that to act according to the law is to act from good, and to act contrary to the law is to act from evil: as may appear from n. 4444 of the Arcana Coelestia.<p>"The General Church of Pennsylvania, in its proceedings, has acted in conformity with the plain provisions of the Constitution and of the Divine law of the Church given in the Heavenly Doctrines: but the Convention has acted contrary to its own laws and to common justice.<p>"In view of these facts, be it<p>"Resolved, That the acts of the General Convention, enumerated above, merit and receive our condemnation; and that we deplore the lack of charity, of common justice, and of equity manifested by the majority in Convention".<p>Many are the principles of doctrine from revelation applicable to these affairs, but how can we enter upon a consideration and application of principles of internal truth and good while the law of the Convention itself, plainly stated in its Constitution, is not regarded or perpetuated if we act thereunder?<p>By order of the Joint Council of the Clergy and Laity.<p>LEONARD G.

<p>EUROPE<p>GREAT BRITAIN<p>Colchester, May 13. - Bishop Benade meets with members of the Rev. J. F. Potts' former Society. - L. 127.<p>London. Feb. 6. - A meeting of priests, with Bishop Benade presiding, considers the subject of order. Coll. Lre. No. 15:16. See A. A.<p>Feb. 7. - The first meeting, for members only, of the Particular Church of the Academy of the New Church in London is held at Burton Road, Brixton. 12 new members are received. Chancellor Benade makes a highly important speech, announcing a new development in the Constitution and government of the Academy. Because of its consequences, portions of the speech are here published: -<p>"The Academy has not a limited Constitution. Its law being the Divine of the LORD, and co-extensive with the Divine, is infinite, and leaves us in a state of wonderful freedom, and in a state from which we can advance step by step. The Academy has not receded; it has gone steadily on, and is going on: What was the law as we understood it ten or twelve years ago is not the law today, because the conditions have altered, and the law is applied according to the altered condition of things, and must continue to be so applied.<p>"The Constitution of the Academy as originally adopted has long since ceased to be operative as to many particulars. Hitherto we have had a certain form of government, in which the Chancellor was assisted in his administration by a mixed council of clergy and laity. That council has ceased to exist, and for a very simple reason. It was found that we needed to have our Board of Direction, or Finance Board, placed in a relation more conformable to the law of the State. Our own Constitution seemed to have carried us a little way from those laws, and it was seen that we should not be able to buy and sell property for our use, because we should come into conflict with the law of the State, as we were then constituted. For that reason we determined to divide the body into two great divisions, one, the Church, and the other, the Corporation. But the Chancellor has declined to have for his counsellors those who are obliged to conform their actions to the civil law. The Chancellor's office is an ecclesiastical office. This change in the Constitution of the Council has not been fully carried out yet, but will be, and the Chancellor has determined to choose a Council of Priests.<p>"The necessity of providing for the spiritual needs of adults, as well as providing schools for the children, led to the formation of a Particular Church of the Academy here, and will do so elsewhere. In the past, members of the Academy were selected by the Chancellor, with the Council. Now and hereafter they will be selected by the Priests of the Particular Churches, with the sanction of the Chancellor.<p>"This is a radical change. Minds have been disturbed. I think that disturbance will cease. A meeting of Priests was held yesterday in which we considered the subject of order, and we have come to a fuller understanding, think, of each other and each other's minds, in respect to all that is required (of us) as Priests of the Church.  <p><Div Align = 'Right'>93</Div><HR><p>

<p>
 I may here add that one of the things that has come to us is the desire for the practical carrying out of a principle which exists in the heavens, from which is formed the Church on earth, viz., that of openness and frankness of intercourse. In the heavens hearts speak. Whatever is loved and felt the thought utters in speech. In the heavens the angels have no fear of speaking with the utmost freedom and confidence, to each other, and there ought to be no fear of speaking or withholding of confidence in the Church, which is the heavens on earth. In the Academy this ought to prevail and have no doubt it will be the effort of all our Priests to carry this into practice. We have been considerably disturbed in our minds with reference to the changes that have taken place in our movement, but we have spoken to each other in a brotherly way, and I am convinced that we are ready to go forward hand in hand in the work that lies before us; and allow me to say to you brethren, go and do likewise. Let us have no unfriendly criticism of each other's way of acting. If there is any fault to be found go to your brother, give him full freedom to say all he thinks and use that freedom yourself. If we act on this principle we shall have more of heaven within us and without us.<p>"It has been the practice to keep the matters of our organization very much to ourselves, but I think the quality of the Academy ought not to be withheld. When I spoke of the celestial quality of the Academy it was after very long consideration of the matter, and I was convinced that it was the one to give us existence and permanence, and carry us forward into a state of freedom. The celestial angels, whether of the celestial heavens or of the spiritual heavens, are the freest of all angels. If we love our Academy and the members who constitute it, we shall come Into greater and greater freedom, individually in ourselves and in our connection with each other. If, then, there is anything in the minds of the members of the Academy, let them speak, and speak freely. We are ready to listen and respond as the Lord gives us power and ability to respond.<p>"Having made this commencement here in the older country, I think we shall be able to continue it in the newer country. It seemed to be fitting that it should have had a commencement here. The Academy, by its very nature and constitution, is not confined to any nationality. It is a universal Church; it can exist in any national church and perform its uses there. Like the kingdom of the heavens, it can come into all nationalities, and is to come there. We are of one spiritual nationality. Our brothers are to be those who love the LORD above all things and their neighbor as themselves. This is celestial. The essentially celestial is, love to the LORD and charity toward the neighbor. It is the simplest of all simple things, viz., this, that the good of love to the LORD and of charity toward the neighbor, makes the Church within us and forms the Church without us. Let us strive, by the power of the LORD to become this good, and so members of the LORD'S Church on earth and hereafter in the heavens and thus come into conjunction with Him who is our LORD and Saviour"<p>April 23. - Wedding of the Rt. Rev. Wm. H. Benade and Miss Kate Gibbs, of London; Rev. R. J. Tilon officiating. - L. 95.  <p><Div Align = 'Right'>94</Div><HR><p>

 After discussion it was unanimously decided that, in order "to leave the hands of the Chancellor free to administer legally the civil affairs of the body - by means of qualified and competent lay officials of his selection - the members...tendered to the Chancellor their resignation, retaining, however, membership in the Church of the Academy, with all ecclesiastical rights, privileges, and duties as before". As those present number considerably less than half of the total membership of the Academy, individual resignations are tendered; and a circular letter sent to all other members for information and individual action.

An (unpublished) address, by Pastor C. T. Odhner, summarizes the problems created by the two Churches. Bishop Benade declares that "the High Priest is the only one who is in the function of the supreme government, and in its illustration; therefore he is the one qualified to nominate his successor. Acceptance by the priesthood is essential to an effective reciprocal relation; but they have not a veto power... In the case of sudden removal of the High Priest, by death or otherwise, before he has nominated a successor, the power to choose its own head resides in the priesthood..." As to "the former three degrees of the Academy" - Council, College, and Associate membership" - in each of which were priests and laymen,... when the Council had been spoken of as the governing body, it was as when the Presidents' Cabinet is similarly spoken of..." (The) "...effort to establish order on a lower plane, - that of the civil law" (had) "necessitated a change and brought about the abolishment of the Council. Those who willed the change did not see the outcome".  <p><Div Align = 'Right'>108</Div><HR><p>
