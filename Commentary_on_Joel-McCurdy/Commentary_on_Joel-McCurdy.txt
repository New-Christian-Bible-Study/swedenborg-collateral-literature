How To Use This Study Guide

1. A careful, unhurried reading of Joel is essential. Reading the chapter before 
looking at the notes, while working with the notes, and after finishing with 
the notes will give each researcher a powerful sense of the series of meanings
within each chapter. It is important to be comfortable with all the names and 
places in the prophecy and to understand the announcements the prophet 
makes on behalf of the Lord. When possible, historical information will be 
included in the notes to increase reading comprehension and enhance 
application.

2. Our study of each chapter of Joel will begin with quotes from a work of the 

Writings called Summary Exposition of the Prophets and Psalms. This work 
includes a verse-by-verse overview of all three chapters of Joel that provides 
general information about the internal sense. Our research will help move us 
from the generals to the particulars of the internal sense.

3. Another important reference tool is Searle’s General Index to Swedenborg’s 
Scripture Quotations. This reference is used to find passages in the Writings 
where a verse(s) from the Word is either explained specifically or used to 
illustrate a doctrinal point that we can use in our study. There is also another 
use of this work. As we study, each researcher will be led by the Lord’s 
Providence in myriad ways, according to specific needs or states. Knowing 
how to use this book will help each of us to explore relevant topics and look 
up related passages to increase our knowledge of the three-fold Word.
4. You will soon discover that not every verse, word, name, etc. is directly 
quoted in the Writings. But there are often other references to the same 
name, place, or thing in the explanation of a different verse of the Word. The 
hope is that reflection on these other doctrinal explanations will help us see 
possible applications to our study of Joel. We will need to use "derived 
doctrine" often. Please don’t run away from this maligned term. If we use it 
properly and admit openly that it is derived doctrine, we bring no harm to the
internal sense.

5. Keep some kind of notebook handy during your study times. Write out 

insights, questions, and any summaries you find helpful in organizing your 
thoughts about each chapter. The goal of this study guide is not to give a 
detailed summary of the internal sense but to start each researcher’s quest 
for deeper insight.

6. At the end of each chapter in the study guide, you will find a study review. 
The review includes a summary of each section to help you reinforce and 
build on your understanding of several of the key points.

7. Begin each study unit with a devotional prayer asking the Lord to guide and 
direct your thoughts. Certainly, beginning in this sphere has the power to 
inspire and open our minds with a higher spiritual priority that will keep us 
in the company of the Lord’s angels. As the Writings teach, we must seek to 
love truth for truth’s sake. Such an approach will free each reader from 

4

preconceived ideas that might limit his or her ability to "see" the intent and 
message of the Lord’s Word.

Introduction

As we prepare to take up the study of Joel, let’s pause for a moment and learn what 
we can about the historical prophet Joel. The six questions listed below will guide 
our quest for information.

1. What do we know about Joel?

2. Can we put Joel in a timeline with the other prophets?

3.

Is Joel mentioned, or quoted, in any other books of the Word?

4. Are we familiar with any of the passages from Joel?

5. What are the major themes of Joel’s prophecy?

6. And lastly, what specific lesson or lessons in Joel’s prophecy are useful for the

New Church?

WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT JOEL?

Joel 1:1 reveals almost everything we know about this prophet. We know his name 
and the name of his father. Joel means "Yahweh is God." Some scholars note that the 
name Joel appears to be a combination of the two names of the Lord—Yahweh and 
Elohim.

Knowing the name of Joel’s father, Pethuel, doesn’t help us. Apparently, Pethuel was 
not a significant person in the history of Israel because there are no other references
to him in the Word. We have no hint of what kind of life or work Joel did prior to his 
call from the Lord. Was he a priest? We don’t know. Can we pinpoint where he lived 
in the land of Israel? Not really. Scholars assume that he lived in Jerusalem. Did the 
Lord call him from royal, priestly, or common stock? Was Joel, like Amos, a man who 
was not one of the "sons of the prophets"? There are no answers to these questions.

From a New Church perspective, it seems to be of the Lord’s Providence that we 
don’t know Joel’s personal history. It helps to keep us from focusing on the person to
the detriment of our study of spiritual principles.

5

CAN WE PUT JOEL IN A TIMELINE WITH THE OTHER PROPHETS?

No! Scholars are undecided about the dates of Joel’s birth and death, and about what
king or kings reigned at the time of his prophetic calling. Among scholars, there is 
very little agreement on the years of Joel’s prophecy:

 One theory proposes that he lived during King Jehoshaphat’s reign: 872-848 

BC.

 Another suggestion is that he lived during the period 792-740 BC.
 A third suggestion places him at 597-587 BC.
 And the last scholarly opinion has Joel living around 515-500 BC.

Why are these "guesses" so diverse? Joel’s prophecy gives no historical clues. He 
mentions no king. We are left only with "the timeless message of the Lord."

Again, we do well to ask why the Lord would keep the dateline so unclear. Is it to 
keep our minds steady and focused on the spiritual sense and not on people, places, 
and time/space concepts? I think we would agree that this seems to be a good 
reason for a vague timeline. We shouldn’t try to put the Word of the Lord in a finite 
context. We shouldn’t worry if we can’t make God conform to our spatial concepts. 
The Word is the Lord’s, and it has been preserved so that it may be studied to 
eternity. Angels don’t read names or dates. They behold the spiritual sense and draw
on the illustrations (immediate influx) that come from the Lord. We need to 
remember to emulate this approach as a goal while reading the Word.

IS JOEL MENTIONED OR QUOTED IN ANY OF THE BOOKS OF THE WORD?

There are twelve references to a "Joel" listed in Young’s Bible Concordance. Most of 
the twelve references to "Joel" occur in First and Second Chronicles and Nehemiah 
(11:9), which are not books of the Word. There is one reference to Joel in Acts 2:16. 
The only reference to a "Joel" in the Word occurs in I Samuel 8:2.

Here is a list of the places a "Joel" is mentioned in the Old Testament:

1. The eldest son of Samuel was named Joel (I Samuel 8:2). This son of Samuel is

also mentioned in I Chronicles 6:28, 33, and 15:17.

2.

I Chronicles 6:36 mentions a Levite priest named Joel.

3.

I Chronicles 4:35 identifies a chieftain of the tribe of Simeon named Joel.

4. An early leader in the tribe of Reuben was named Joel (I Chronicles 5:4, 8).

5. A chieftain of the tribe of Gad was named Joel (I Chronicles 5:12).

6

6. A chieftain of the tribe of Issachar was named Joel (I Chronicles 7:3).

7.

Joel, the brother of Nathan, was a tough hero in David’s army (I Chronicles 
11:38).

8. A Levite of the Gershon tribe was named Joel (I Chronicles 15:7, 11).

9. A Levite, the son of Ladan, was named Joel (I Chronicles 23:8 and 26:22).

10. A Levite, the son of Azariah, was named Joel (II Chronicles 29:12).

11. There was a son of Pedaiah, who ruled over half of the tribe of Manasseh, 

named Joel (I Chronicles 27:20).

12. A son of Zichri, of the tribe of Benjamin, was named Joel (Nehemiah 11:9).

Acts 2:16 quotes Joel 2:28-32.

ARE WE FAMILIAR WITH ANY OF THE PASSAGES FROM JOEL?

You will probably recognize more passages than you would imagine. I have listed 
here what I think are the major ones you have heard most often in our church 
services:

1.

2.

Joel 2:12-13: "Turn to Me with all your heart, with fasting, with weeping, and
mourning. So rend your heart, and not your garments; return to the Lord 
your God, for He is gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and of great 
kindness…"

Joel 2:28: "I will pour out My spirit on all flesh; your sons and your 
daughters shall prophesy, your old men shall dream dreams, your young men 
shall see visions…"

3.

Joel 2:31: "The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood…"

4.

Joel 3:10: "Beat your plowshares into swords and your pruning hooks into 
spears…"

This fourth passage in Joel is the opposite of Isaiah 2:4 and Micah 4:3: "They shall 
beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks…"

WHAT ARE THE MAJOR THEMES OF JOEL’S PROPHECY?

1. The sensual person has destroyed the church.

7

2. The Word has been scattered and stripped of its spiritual dignity.

3. The Word has been falsified.

4. Spiritual insanity reigns among the people of the dying church.

5. The day of the Lord is coming.

6. The day of judgment is coming, and there will be a great battle.

7. The Lord calls for repentance.

8. Sincere repentance will save the people (remnant).

9. The Lord will establish a new church.

10. The Lord offers acquittal to those who turn from their wrongful ways.

11. The people should be aware and respond; the Day of the Lord is here.

12. There will be a new illustration of the Word. People will see how the Word 

applies to their lives.

13. When this comes to pass, the church will be the Lord’s and the church will 

be from the Word.

AND LASTLY, WHAT SPECIFIC LESSON OR LESSONS IN JOEL’S PROPHECY 
ARE USEFUL FOR THE NEW CHURCH?

All too often, we worry about the slow growth of the New Church. Why isn’t the 
General Church membership in the thousands or millions? Why are other faith 
groups doing so much better? Is the spread of the Lord’s New Church on earth ever 
going to happen?

This nagging worry distresses us with a vague feeling that maybe we are "hitching 
our spiritual wagon" to a dying cause. The teaching of Joel is a pep talk. It contains a 
message of hope. The Lord is going to establish the church. He will win the spiritual 
war that is going to be waged. The New Church will be His, and His Word will catch 
hold of the world. But, there must be a consummation of the falsity that is still in our
world. The sensual side of humanity is still very much alive. The sensual is impatient
with the Lord. Looking beyond the moment is not an interest of the sensual person. 
The emphasis on faith alone or knowledge alone is an enemy of the conjugial 
principles of the Lord’s Church. These things temporarily disperse the ideas of the 
Lord. The locust attack mentioned in Joel depicts wave after wave of sensual 

8

philosophical and scientific arguments against the church. It appears that they have 
stripped the church and the doctrines of the Lord barren.

In Joel’s prophecy, we hear this message: "Stay alert! Respond, for the Day of the 
Lord is at hand. Don’t lose sight of the end. The New Church is the Lord’s, and His 
Word will be the core of the Church."

Will it happen? Will the battle bring victory to the Church? The prophecy of Joel 
preaches a positive end. It will come, and the Lord will gather His "remnant" 
together to start a church that will be the crown of all churches for ever and ever.

These things will come about because of the Lord, not the efforts of any group of 
people. So we need to be watchful and listen for the spiritual trumpet of the Lord. 
Hell and its menacing legions will not overcome the Lord. The Church will win, not 
because of our strength but because of the Lord’s strength.

Joel 3:10 has a teaching worth remembering and saying to ourselves often:

"Let the weak say, ‘I am strong.’"

I hope you read Joel with this sense of victory and strength in "the Day of the Lord."

Chapter One

JOEL 1:1-3

"The word of the Lord that came to Joel the son of Pethuel. ‘Hear this, you elders, and 
give ear, all you inhabitants of the land! Has anything like this happened in your days, 
or even in the days of your fathers? Tell your children about it, let your children tell 
their children, and their children another generation.’"

Passages From The Writings

Summary Exposition of the Prophets and Psalms (P&P)



"To all who are of the church."

Derived Doctrine

"The word of the Lord…"

 Arcana Coelestia (AC) 2 explains the nature of the Lord’s Word. "…of necessity
[the Word must] contain within it such things as belong to heaven, to the 
church, and to religious belief…unless it did so it could not be called the 
Lord’s Word, nor could it be said to have any life in it" (emphasis added).
 AC 129 teaches us, "the true order is for man to be wise from the Lord, that is, 

from His Word, and then all things follow, and he is enlightened even in 
matters of reason and of memory–knowledges…"

"…that came to Joel the son of Pethuel."



"Coming" or "came" signifies communication by influx (AC 5249). What kind 
of influx is meant here? Was it "mediate" or "immediate"? The passage 
identifies the Word of the Lord coming to Joel; thus, it seems sensible to 
decide this refers to immediate influx because that which comes directly 
from the Lord involves immediate influx. Mediate influx, on the other hand,
refers to that which comes through angels or some other indirect means.

 We have not a single teaching about the meaning or correspondence of 

"Pethuel." A New Church minister, the Rev. James Hyde, wrote: "The name 
Pethuel is derived from "pathu", which means ‘induced,’…To induce signifies, 
in a bad sense, to entice, or beget a deceptive infatuation." (An Exposition of 
the Prophecy of Joel, pages 47-48.)
Joel’s name means "Jehovah is God." Looking at the meanings of these two 
names (Joel and "pathu") in a positive light, could they signify that the Lord 



10

wanted to positively induce and entice the people to have a true "infatuation" 
with His Word?

 A "son" signifies a general truth (AC 3496). Sons signify those not born within 
the church, or nations who are remote from goods and truths and who have 
not been inculcated with the goods and truths of faith; sons also signify those 
who are in external worship (Apocalypse Explained [AE] 1133 [3]).

"Hear this, you elders, and give ear, all you inhabitants of the land!"

 To "hear" means to be in a state of obedience (AC 2691). Hearing signifies that
one who understands should obey what the Word teaches. Hearing means to 
both perceive and obey. See Apocalypse Revealed (AR) 87 and AE 588.
"Elders" signify those who are wise and in a wisdom that agrees with 
good(AC 5608 [7] and AC 6524).



 To "give ear" signifies that one who understands should obey what the Word 
teaches so that he or she might be made ready to be of the New Church, 
which is the New Jerusalem (AR 87).
"Inhabitants of the world" signify people of the church who are in the goods 
of doctrine, and so of life (AE 741 [6]). "Land" signifies the region where the 
church is—where the faith of the church resides (AC 2571).



"Has anything like this happened in your days, or even in the days of your fathers?"

 Questions are asked by the Lord to help us to seek either knowledge or 

confirmation (AC 1913 and AC 2693).

 The people of Judah experienced a devastating drought and a locust plague 
that stripped the land of its vegetation. The question asks the reader to 
reflect. Was this event simply "bad luck"? Was this a natural misfortune, or 
was it a significant happening of divine (providential) proportions?
"Your days" signify a kind of review or assessment of the successive states of 
regeneration (AC 6). "Days" and "years," in the Word, signify the states of 
life(Heaven and Hell [HH] 155).



 What about the "days of your fathers"? Could this question be a mandate to 
Judah to review the inherited tendencies toward evil they received from the 
present and prior churches? Could it be that the Lord wanted them to think 
about the inherited tendencies toward evil they had passed on? The question
could also suggest that they should review the inherited tendencies toward 
good they received from the churches of their fathers. Both are important 
points to reflect on when considering the Lord’s providential leading.

"Tell your children about it, let your children tell their children, and their children 
another generation."

 AC 2862 explains that "telling" signifies to indicate, to come to know, to 

inform, or to be informed. Reflection is also an internal telling.

11



"Children" signify bringing forth things that belong to one’s spiritual life (AR 
534). Offspring have birth from the marriage of the Lord with His church. 
Children are the offspring of goods and truths (Conjugial Love [CL] 121).
 A "generation" signifies those who are perpetually being created anew (AC 

1041).

 Does this teaching about perpetually being created anew seem to apply to the

meaning and process of children telling children?

Putting It All Together

To begin putting all of these ideas together, it is important that we look at the 
contrast within two passages relating to the three verses of Joel we are studying. 
First, let’s look at the quote from P&P that proclaims that this is a message:



"To all who are in the church."

Secondly, let’s look at the question Joel asks:



"Has anything like this happened in your days, or even in the days of your 
fathers?"

P&P directs the reader’s attention to the inclusiveness of the Lord’s message: "To all 
who are in the church." The Lord’s reaching out to all shouldn’t be missed. The 
Divine cares about all in the church. The Lord invites all to listen to His Word. Joel’s 
name means "Jehovah is God"; therefore, all need to have the ears of obedience for 
the things of the Lord. The Lord calls all to His Word because it contains and offers 
things that belong to heaven. His Word offers things that are essential for the 
church. The Word is vital for our system of religious beliefs. Seeking the Lord 
through the Word opens the way for the powerful sphere of immediate influx. The 
Lord will give "obedient ears" the vital, intuitive insights needed to thrive spiritually. 
Within the heart of every believer, there has to be some inducement, enticement, 
and infatuation (love) for the Word. Joel, "Jehovah is God," calls for the "elders," or 
the wisdom of the mind, to teach and improve the understanding within the church 
so the people can respond obediently. The elders represent the degree of wisdom 
that readies a willing worshipper to become a member of the New Church—the New
Jerusalem.

Choosing the Lord’s way will open to us a life that is peaceful, productive, and happy.
Casting the Lord off invites and prepares the way for unbelievable spiritual 
disasters, the magnitude of which has never been seen before, nor can they be 
described. Hence we have the catastrophic story and frightening events alluded to in
the second quote: "Has anything like this happened in your days, or even in the 
days of your fathers?" What natural and spiritual events did Joel point to? Joel 
describes four kinds of locust, one after another, swarming and entering the land to 
consume all the vegetation therein. In effect, Joel asks: Can you believe the travesty 

12

of this experience? Tell this story so as to warn the generations of children to come. 
It is a story of vital importance. "HEAR" is the first command following Joel’s 
lineage. Hearing requires a willingness to obey.

The full extent of this locust message is covered in our next section.

Read and Review

Read the selection from P&P.

Read Joel 1:1-3.

Questions to Stimulate Reflection

1. Did you notice how much we needed derived doctrine to help give us a larger 
glimpse of the spiritual sense of the first three verses? What did you think of 
this?

2. Are you clear on the point of the two contrasting passages? Obedience means 
giving ear to the Lord and His Word. Ignoring the Lord and His Word brings 
about spiritual calamities of unbelievable proportions. Can you think of any 
personal examples of these life states?

3. Can you describe the difference between immediate influx and mediate 

influx?

4. What did you think about the point of Joel’s father’s name being a derivative 
of a word meaning inducement, enticement, and infatuation? Can you see the 
possibilities of these inherited tendencies, if they are tendencies toward 
good, being a part of the Lord’s working through Joel?

5. How well do we do our job of telling the generations of our children about the
effects of our choices? Is it enough to count on our New Church school system
to do it for us?

6. Think of the song, "All that the Lord has spoken we will do and hear." Ever 
wonder why the doing occurs before the hearing? What are your thoughts 
about this?

7. The word "elders" can have a wide range of meaning. Elders signify truths of 
wisdom learned. They can be the remains built up and protected by the Lord. 
The elders are caregivers for the preparation and building of the New Church.
Do we listen to them often enough? What can they offer us?

13

8. New ideas are great. Our scientific achievements have given us longevity and 
greater freedom. Have we brought new ideas into our hearts and mind to 
augment or complement the elders?

JOEL 1:4

"What the chewing locust left, the swarming locust has eaten; what the swarming 
locust left, the crawling locust has eaten; and what the crawling locust left, the 
consuming locust has eaten."

Passages From The Writings

P&P



"Falsity from the sensual man and afterwards evil therefrom has consumed 
all things of the church."

AC 7643 [7]



"In Joel…1:4…‘locust’ denotes falsity in the extremes vastating truths and 
goods."

AC 7643 [8]



"…by ‘locust’ are signified reasonings from fallacies and the falsities thence 
derived, also confirmed by philosophical things. Thus also by the ‘locust’ are 
signified the falsities which are in the extremes with man, and which are 
more earthly and corporeal than all other falsities; and by which man may be 
easily deceived and seduced, for he apprehends what is obvious to the senses,
and with difficulty what is opposed to the senses."

AC 9331 [5]



In Joel 1:4 "…falsities and evils in the extremes—that is, in the external 
sensuous of the man of the church—are signified by the various kinds of 
insects here mentioned…for the subject treated of is the perversion of the 
truth and good of the church."

AR 424



"It is in consequence of falsities in the outermost parts consuming the truths 
and goods of the church, as they spring up in man, that they are signified by 
‘locusts,’ which consume the grass and the herbs of the fields, as may be 
evident from these passages…" Joel 1:4 is cited.

14

AE 543 [9]



"The ‘locust’ and the ‘caterpillar’ have a similar signification in Joel 1:4…
Evidently these noxious little animals signify falsities and evils devastating or 
consuming truths and goods with the man of the church…"

Derived Doctrine

"What the chewing locust left…"



"Chewing" signifies taking knowledges from the memory and analyzing 
them(Divine Providence [DP] 233 [8]). Chewing the cud signifies thinking over
things once learned and believed (AC 5135 [2]).

 AR 794 teaches that "them that are left" represent those "who do not search 

after [truths] nor receive them, because they are in falsities…"

"…the swarming locust has eaten…"

 AC 2122 describes the state of those who desire to become "the greatest." 
They think of nothing but what is filthy, obscene, and profane. They make 
nothing of and utterly despise all things that are of charity and faith. They do 
not acknowledge the Lord. They hate all who confess the Lord. These 
descriptions are followed by this statement: "At the present day such people 
flock [swarm] into the other life…"
"Swarming" in the positive sense refers to goods, multiplying to truths (AC 
1014 and 1016).



 To be "eaten" signifies to communicate, be conjoined, and to appropriate (AC 



2343).
In the negative sense, to "eat" signifies to live for self and the world and thus 
to appropriate evils and falsities (AE 840 [5]).

"What the swarming locust left, the crawling locust has eaten…"



"Crawling" signifies pleasures from the senses. When such pleasures 
originate from the proprium and lusts, the senses become filthy (AC 594).
 That which crawls signifies things belonging to the sensuous part of a person,
which, when separated from the spiritual part, become falsities from evils 
(AE 556 [6]).

"…and what the crawling locust left, the consuming locust has eaten."



"…the consuming locust has eaten" has been translated in the New English 
Bible as "the consuming locust has put an end to." The Revised Standard 
Version translates "consuming locust" as "destroying locust." The Jerusalem 
Bible translates "consuming locust" as the "shearer" locust.

15

 AC 10431 explains that "consuming" represents what happens to people 

when they turn away from the Lord. Such a turning away from the Lord is 
"consuming" in that people who turn away "perish in consequence of their 
evil."

NB: in the King James Bible, the four kinds of locust are called the palmerworm, the
locust, the cankerworm, and the caterpillar. What representations are given in 
the Writings for these insects?

 AE 403 explains that "palmerworms" signify falsity destroying good.
 AE 573 [15] speaks of these "noxious little animals, ‘the locust, the canker-

worm, the caterpillar, and the palmer-worm,’ signifying falsities and evils that
devastate or consume the truths and goods of the church…"

 Biblical scholars write about these four "noxious" insects as the gnawers, 

the swarmers or multipliers, the lickers, and the consumers or 
devourers.

Putting It All Together

P&P starts us on the path to understanding this verse. It is not a historical prophecy 
about four nations attacking Israel in the future. Instead, it is an eternal prophecy 
about what happens to a person whose heart and mind are focused wholly on the 
things of this world. The Writings call this kind of person the "Sensual Man." This 
sensual person doesn’t think deeply about the Word. His or her life is occupied with 
values that have no extension into the spiritual world. The sensual person looks for 
ease, comfort, and immediate gratification, and, in reality, is angry with the Lord. 
The sensual person is not willing to look beyond the grave.

Following the Lord involves pursuing infinite and eternal goals. Human life involves 
the here and now (time and space). In the process of growing spiritually, we learn 
how to bring our time-and-space existence into harmony with the infinite and 
eternal things of the Lord.

What little spiritual knowledge is known by the sensual person is, at best, 
fragmented, chaotic, and vulnerable to myriad philosophic, scientific, and self-
centered arguments. Without the inner sense of the Word, the heart of an individual, 
the church, is susceptible to devastating attacks from the "gnawers," the "swarmers,"
the "lickers," and the "consumers" that deprive the church of its "vegetables." 
Vegetables are not only beautiful and nourishing but represent the variety of 
celestial and spiritual things flowing from the Lord into our natural life. (See AC 
1632 for more on the meaning of vegetation.) Obviously, hell wants to consume such 
things to remove them from our minds.

Joel’s prophecy helps us to mentally picture how myriad spiritual locusts may 
darken the Lord’s sunlight. The beating of their wings is like a storm of sensual 

16

controversy trying to confuse the minds of the Lord’s people when they try to think 
of His truths. Imagine wave after wave of spiritual locusts feverishly and ravenously 
gorging themselves to the point of destroying a person’s spiritual crop of hope. Such 
is the effect within the hearts of those who are disinterested in the Lord and His 
Word.

This is a story we need to hear so we can alertly fight off periods of spiritual 
lethargy. The plague of the heart and mind is a reality hell wants us to face. The 
Word gives us an admonition to speak to the generation of children and our 
children’s children. We are to explain to them the devastating effects of the "sensual 
man." How do we warn them and ourselves about the unbelievable effects of the 
locust? How do we prudently tell this story to our children and their children? AC 
2862 reminds us that reflection and perception are to be the tools and means of 
unfolding the internal sense of the Word. We need to teach everyone ways to observe
and shun the disorders of hell. What better way than through the prophecy of Joel 
and the stories of the Word? Let’s close this summary by reading again the words of 
AC 2862: "…reflection and perception is an internal telling and saying." One way 
we are to be useful is by sharing the Word of the Lord and facilitating good and 
useful discussion about "survival" techniques that will protect us against the 
marauding noxious pests of hell. How can we frame a discussion of life issues in the 
context of warning one another about the effects of the locust? Doesn’t this section 
do a good job describing the kinds of sensual damage that self-love out of 
control can have on our spiritual growth? "Has anything like this happened in 
your days, or even in the days of your fathers?"

Questions to Stimulate Reflection

1. Can you see how those who are outside of the New Church might assume this 

is a prophecy about four nations attacking Israel?

2. Have you ever experienced or witnessed a swarming of ideas attacking 

something spiritual within you or someone else? What can you tell us about 
it?

3. Do you remember the purpose of the attack? To block out the sun; to 

devastate the vegetable kingdom, and to strip it of any vital life or fruit. What 
does this mean in practical terms?

17

4. Sensual people may have a clear self-image, but they often do not argue from 
fixed doctrine. Like the wind, they attack from one point and, if things are not 
progressing well on that front, they change direction. They see themselves as 
quite flexible or adaptable to theories or points of view. Sensual people 
charge spiritual people with being fixed, staid, and out of touch with reality. 
Sensual people view themselves as vibrant and agile. To them, the spiritual 
person is weak, sickly, and guilt-ridden. Can you attest to sensing or hearing 
any of these charges in your life as you seek to grow spiritually? Do you know
what the Lord answers to the sensual people regarding who is healthy and 
full of life?

5.

I once heard a lecture wherein the speaker said that the toughest things in 
life are not the major problems that we face. Somehow, we seem to rise to the
occasion and bravely survive. His point was that we suffer more under the 
daily little "pin-pricks" of life, the little gnawing, biting, distracting events we 
face all day long. These little pinpricks fray our nerves and put us out of sorts.
These are the things that bring us to snap at people we love. Do the little 
things seem like the gathering of a swarming enemy? How are life’s pinpricks 
like noxious insects chewing away at our patience and good nature?

6. We have asked ourselves this question often: How can we get serious about 
reading the Word? How can we put away our sensual side and develop our 
spiritual nature? Is this passage in Joel helpful? Does it paint a picture of 
unbelievable devastation to the "crops" within our mind? What crops are 
especially at risk?

7. What did you make of the four kinds of locust? What did the "gnawers," the 

"swarmers," the "lickers," and the "consumers" add to your mental picture of 
the hells and the "sensual man"?

8. The Lord gives us some strong images to think about. How do these rank 
among the many others we have in our minds? What are some of your 
favorite images from the Word?

JOEL 1:5-7

"Awake, you drunkards, and weep; and wail, all you drinkers of wine, because of the 
new wine, for it has been cut off from your mouth. For a nation has come up against 
My land, strong, and without number; his teeth are the teeth of a lion, and he has the 
fangs of a fierce lion. He has laid waste My vine, and ruined My fig tree; he has stripped
it bare and thrown it away; its branches are made white."

19

AC 9052 [4]



"In Joel 1:6, 7…‘teeth’ and ‘grinders’ denote the falsities that destroy the 
truths of the church; a ‘vine’ denotes the spiritual church…and a ‘fig-tree’ its 
natural good…That ‘teeth’ have this signification is plain also from the fact 
that they are attributed to a nation which will lay waste."

AR 435



"…the sensual things of the understanding are signified by ‘teeth;’…Sensual 
men who are in falsities from confirmation, seem to themselves to be in 
power over all things, so they cannot be conquered…That ‘teeth’ signify the 
ultimates of man’s life, which are called sensual things, and which, when 
separated from the interiors of the mind, are in mere falsities, and do 
violence to truths even to destroying them, may appear from the following 
passages…"Joel 1:6 is cited.

AE 278 [11]



"‘Lions’ in the Word signify also the power of falsity from evil by which the 
church is destroyed and devastated." Joel 1:6 and 7 are cited as an example.

AE 556 [4]



"In Joel 1:6 and 7 ‘A nation that cometh up upon the land’ signifies evil 
devastating the church, ‘nation’ meaning evil, and ‘land’ the church; ‘vigorous 
and without number’ signifies powerful and manifold; ‘vigorous’ is 
predicated of the power of evil, and ‘without number’ of the power of falsity; 
‘its teeth are the teeth of a lion’ signifying destroying falsities; ‘the jaw teeth 
of an immense lion’ signify truths falsified; ‘it reduced the vine to a waste, and
the fig-tree to froth,’ signifies the destruction of spiritual and natural truths; 
spiritual truths are those of the spiritual sense of the Word, and natural 
truths those of the sense of its letter…‘Teeth’ properly signify such things as 
are merely in the memory and are brought forth therefrom, for the things 
that are in the memory of the sensual man correspond to bones and teeth."

AC 5113 [13]



"…a ‘vine’ signifies the good of the intellectual part; and a ‘fig-tree’ the good 
of the natural man, or what is the same, that a ‘vine’ signifies the good of the 
interior man, and a ‘fig-tree’ the good of the exterior man, therefore a ‘fig-
tree’ is often mentioned in the Word at the same time as a ‘vine;’ as in the 
following passages…" Joel 1:6, 7, and 12 are cited as examples.

20

AE 403 [6]



"In Joel 1:6, 7, 12…This whole chapter treats of the devastated church; and 
‘the nation that comes up upon the land, vigorous and without number, 
having the teeth of a lion, and the cheek-teeth of an immense lion,’ does not 
signify any such nation, but direful evil and falsity therefrom; ‘the land upon 
which it comes up’ signifies the church; ‘the teeth of a lion’ signify the falsities
of such evil; and because these destroy all the goods and truths of the church, 
they are called ‘the teeth of the lion and the great cheek-teeth of a lion,’ ‘lion’ 
signifying [falsity] which destroys. Therefore, ‘it hath made My vine a waste, 
and my fig-tree foam,’ signifies that the church internal and external is 
thereby vastated, ‘vine’ signifying the internal church, and ‘fig-tree’ the 
external, ‘foam’ signifying where there is inwardly no truth; ‘in stripping it 
hath stripped it, and cast it away’ signifies that there is no longer any good or 
truth that is not destroyed, ‘to strip’ that is, of fruits and leaves, means of 
goods and truths, and ‘to cast away’ means to destroy entirely; ‘the branches 
thereof are made white’ signifies that there is no longer anything spiritual…"

Derived Doctrine

"Awake…"

 To "awake" (wake from sleep) signifies to seek enlightenment; sleep refers to 

an obscure state in comparison to being awake (AC 3715).

 To be awake signifies enlightenment in the natural (external) part of a 

person(AC 5208).

 To be awake implies a state of watchfulness to know truths and to live by 

them(AR 158).

"…you drunkards, and weep; and wail, all you drinkers of wine…"

 To be drunken, staggering, and reeling signifies to be insane in spiritual 

things from falsifying the truths of the Word (AC 1072).

 A person staggering or reeling signifies those who can see nothing of truth 
when they read or hear truth from the Word, particularly when spiritual 
things seek to inflow into the natural (AE 376 [32]).

 AR 788 gives us an insight into the meaning of "weep" and "wail." "…by 

‘weeping’ is signified mourning of soul, and by ‘mourning’ [wailing] grief of 
heart." In other words, this is a call for a new understanding and will.
 Drinking in the good sense signifies appropriating instruction in spiritual 
things (AC 2704). Drinking in the negative sense signifies appropriating 
falsified truths in one’s life (AR 635).

 Drinking wine in the positive sense signifies seeking instruction in the things 
of the Lord’s Divine truth—Divine wisdom. Such is the goal when receiving 
wine in the Holy Supper. See True Christian Religion (TCR) 711.

21

"…because of the new wine, for it has been cut off from your mouth."

 Reading this verse reminds us of the Lord’s sayings to His people. "You have 
heard it said of old…but I say unto you…" The Lord’s life, teachings, and 
examples brought new wine—truth—to the world. Some took and drank the 
new truth. Others cut it off, rejecting it and spewing it from their mouths.
 To "cut off" signifies that divine truth shall be taken from that people, but 



shall live again in a new church (AE 315 [23]).
"Mouth" signifies thought from the understanding (DP 80). AE 782 carries 
this correspondence a little further, explaining that the mouth signifies 
thought as it comes forth in speech such as teaching, preaching, and 
reasoning.

"For a nation has come up against My land, strong, and without number…"

















"Nations from afar" signify falsity from evil, or that of the sensuous man, 
destroying truths (AE 724 [27]).
"Nations" signify evils of the will (AC 622).
In the positive sense, "nation" signifies the Lord’s kingdom (AC 1416 [5]).
"Against" signifies the violence hell offers against the Lord’s spiritual 
kingdom, until, by the Lord’s divine power, it is brought under His yoke (AC 
8625).
"My land…" "Land" represents various things: the internal man of the church; 
the region where the church is; the church itself; the doctrine of love and 
charity where the church resides (AC 2571). "My" makes it clear that the 
opposition from hell will come up against the Lord’s church and not some 
physical or historical church.
"Strong," or strength, in the positive sense represents truth, which cannot be 
resisted (AC 426 [3]).
"Strong" in the negative sense represents the gathering or marshaling of the 
forces within the evil of the love of self (AC 6306 [4]).
"Without number" in the positive sense represents a setting in order (AC 
10218). It also signifies what cannot be counted, or multiplication to 
eternity(AC 1610).
In the negative sense, "number" signifies the attempt of hell to dissipate the 
divine truths by reasonings and falsities. Such was the "number" that 
attacked the Lord in temptation. See AC 3812 [7].

"His teeth are the teeth of a lion…"

 AR 435 gives us the most direct teaching about the meaning of these words. It
states that "the teeth of a lion" represent sensual men who are in falsities 
andbelieve themselves to be in power over all things, so they imagine they
cannot be conquered.

22

 AE 278 [11] teaches that a "lion" signifies the power of falsity that attempts to

destroy and devastate the church.

"…and he has the fangs of a fierce lion."






"Fierce" signifies a strong aversion from good (AC 6358).
"Fierce" signifies that the people turned from divine things. For when wrath 
or anger is said of the Lord, it means a turning away on the part of human 
beings(AC 10431).
"Fang" as a verb means to seize, to lay hold of. As a noun, a "fang" is also a 
long sharp tooth by which the prey is seized and held. Although we don’t have
any specific correspondence given for "fang," we can draw certain 
conclusions about the nature of hell. It wants to seize, hold, and trap spiritual 
people so as to tear and destroy them.

"He has laid waste My vine, and ruined My fig tree…"





"Waste" signifies evils and falsities destroying the good and truth of the 
church(AE 374 [5]).
"My vine" and "My fig tree" signify, respectively, the goods of the intellectual 
principle and the good of the natural principle, or the good of the interior 
man and the good of the exterior man (AC 5113). The "My" word calls our 
attention to the Lord. His Divine principles seek to help the interior and 
exterior life of human beings.

"…he has stripped it bare and thrown it away; its branches are made white."



Stripping signifies dispelling and annihilating the appearances of truth (AC 
4741).

 To "strip" signifies deprivation of divine truth in the externals (AC 10542).


"Bare" seems to be equivalent to the word "naked" in this verse. To get help 
with these terms, let’s turn to AC 213. In reference to the story in which Adam
and Eve claimed nakedness as a problem, we read "where there is no 
innocence, nakedness is a scandal and disgrace, because it is attended with a 
consciousness of thinking evil…and is predicated of a perverted church…" 
Could "he" (the hells) purposely have aimed at the innocence of the church so
as to make it appear as a scandal and disgrace?

 Does the phrase "branches made white" mean that the bark was stripped off?
What use does the bark provide for a tree? Not only does its tough external 
covering protect the tree from the elements, but it has a part in the flow of 
sap and the supply of life. Girdle a tree, and its death is imminent. Can we 
make an equal point for the spiritual meaning of this verse? "Branches" 
signify the power of truth from good. The "fig tree" is the good of the natural 
and the branch its affection. See AC 4231.

23



"…stripped…bare…thrown away." Each of these words convey within their 
meaning a sense of a wasted potential. What could have been productive was 
treated carelessly; thus, instead of use, there is despair and destruction. AC 
2121 exposes who really throws things away. "The Lord casts no one into hell,
but every one casts himself there."

Putting It All Together

The hallmark of this section comes when the Lord calls His people to wake up. They 
not only failed to see dangerous issues, but their sleep-like state made them 
vulnerable to the stealthy plans of the enemies of the Lord. The parable of the wheat 
and darnel illustrates this principle quite well.

Secondly, the Lord told them they were drunkards. Drunkenness represents being 
insane with foolish ideas of how smart and powerful they were. Like staggering, 
reeling, and unstable minds, they needed to sober up with the reality of the Lord’s 
eternal truths.

If they woke up, if they sobered up, they would see the need to weep and mourn 
over the foolishness they had previously allowed to direct their lives. Instead of 
drinking the wine of the sensual person, they were to drink of the wine provided by 
the Lord. The Lord’s drink quenches the thirst of the soul and brings with it 
necessary instruction and a new (living) will and understanding.

The Lord’s way benefits the weak and the heavy-laden. He promises to make our 
burden light. The lightness comes from the fact that He wills to help us. Refusing His 
offer of help leads us into states of despair. Listen to what is forecast: A nation that is
strong and without number will rise up against you. The enemy will bare its fangs. 
Like a fierce lion, its teeth will seize, tear, and waste us. The land, the church, will be 
wasted. The truth of the church will mean nothing. Obedience, the fig tree, will be 
stripped bare, stripped of its bark and thrown away.

Surely the awakened, repentant, sorrowful soul will avoid all of these direful 
consequences. And how will this happen? Alertness, soberness, attentiveness will 
allow and help us to bear spiritual fruit. The branches of the fig trees will not be 
stripped and made white with the gnawing away of the bark. There will be no 
throwing away; instead, there will be a gathering and building up of uses for the 
Lord and the neighbor.

What key words should we remember from this section? AWAKE; SOBER UP, WEEP, 
AND WAIL. These things will be sufficient in the day of the Lord and will rescue His 
church from the reeling, staggering effects of self-love.

Questions to Stimulate Reflection

1.

If you have children, think about how you warn them of dangers. How do you 
go about it? Do you work with their imagination, using illustrations of 
contrasts? Do you sometimes let them fail so they can learn the necessity of 
asking for help?

2. What can you relate about a significant incident in your life in which you can 
admit that you "fell asleep at the switch" and made yourself vulnerable to the 
enemy sowing seeds of discord in your life?

3. How well can you relate to the idea of the fangs of hell grabbing and tearing 

away at essential spiritual issues?

4. What are your thoughts about the stripping of the branches and the throwing

away described in our text? What does this look like in every-day life?

JOEL 1:8-13

"Lament like a virgin girded with sackcloth for the husband of her youth. The grain 
offering and the drink offering have been cut off from the house of the Lord; the priests
mourn, who minister to the Lord. The field is wasted, the land mourns; for the grain is 
ruined, the new wine is dried up, the oil fails. Be ashamed, you farmers, wail, you 
vinedressers, for the wheat and the barley; because the harvest of the field has 
perished. The vine has dried up, and the fig tree has withered; the pomegranate tree, 
the palm tree also, and the apple tree—all the trees of the field are withered; surely joy
has withered away from the sons of men. Gird yourselves and lament, you priests; wail, 
you who minister before the altar; come, lie all night in sackcloth, you who minister to 
my God; for the grain offering and drink offering are withheld from the house of your 
God."

"That ‘wine’ signifies truth from the good of love…That ‘oil’ signifies the good 
of love…By ‘fine flour’ is signified celestial truth, and by ‘wheat’ is signified 
celestial good. That the truths and goods of worship are signified by ‘wine,’ 
‘oil,’ ‘fine flour’ and ‘wheat,’ is because the drink-offerings and meal-offerings 
consisted of them, which were offered upon the altar together with the 
sacrifices; and by the sacrifices and by the offerings offered upon the altar 
worship is signified, for the chief part of worship consisted in them. That the 
drink-offerings, which were wine, were offered upon the altar together with 
the sacrifices, may be seen…" Joel 1:9 is cited.

AE 376 [25]



"This makes clear what is signified in Joel…1:9…namely, that worship from

things; thus by ‘wheat,’ interior good; and by ‘barley,’ exterior good."

AC 9295 [5]



"In Joel…1:9-11…the vastation of the church in respect to the truths of faith 
and the goods of charity is here described by such things as belong to the 
field, the vineyard, and the olive yard; the church itself is ‘the field;’ and its 
last state, which was called by the Lord ‘the consummation of the age, is ‘the 
harvest.’"

AC 10137 [3 & 4]



"That the ‘meat-offering,’ which was bread, signifies the good of love, and that
the ‘drink-offering,’ which was wine, signifies the good of faith, and that they 
are so perceived by the angels, can be seen from all that is said in the Word…
as in Joel…1:9-15…the subject here treated of is the last time of the church, 
when there is no longer in it the good of love and the truth of faith…From this
it is plain that by ‘the meat-offering and drink-offering which were cut off 
from the house of Jehovah,’ by ‘the field which was laid waste,’ by ‘the ground 
which mourned,’ by ‘the grain which was also laid waste,’ by ‘the new wine 
which was dried up,’ by ‘the oil which languisheth,’ and by ‘the vine’ and ‘the 
fig-tree,’ are signified such things as belong to the church and heaven; but the 
internal sense teaches what these signify. From this it is evident that by ‘the 
field’ is signified the church as to the reception of truth…by ‘the land,’ the 
church as to good…by ‘grain,’ all the good of the church…by ‘new wine’ all the 
truth of the church…by ‘oil’ the good of love…by ‘vine,’ the interior good of the
spiritual church…and by ‘fig-tree’ its exterior good…"

be seen from the following passages…" Joel 1:12 is cited.

AE 458 [7]



"…Joel…1:12…describes the desolating of truth and good in the church, and 
thence of all joy of heart, that is, of all spiritual joy; for the ‘vine’ signifies the 
spiritual good and truth of the church, the ‘fig-tree’ the natural good and 
truth therefrom, and the ‘pomegranate’ sensual truth and good, which is the 
ultimate of the natural; ‘palm’ signifies joy of heart, from spiritual good, and 
‘apple’ the same from the natural good derived from spiritual good; ‘the trees 
of the field that are dried up,’ signify the perceptions of good and the 
knowledges of truth, that there are none; and because spiritual joy and 
natural joy therefrom are signified by the ‘palm-tree’ and the ‘apple tree,’ it is 
added, ‘joy is dried up from the sons of man;’ ‘sons of man’ meaning in the 
Word those who are in truths from good, and ‘joy’ signifying spiritual joy, 
which is solely from good through truths. Who cannot see that vine, fig-tree, 
pomegranate, palm-tree, apple-tree, and the trees of the field are not here 
meant? Why should it be said in the Word and of what consequence is it to 
the church to say that these trees are withered and dried up?"

Derived Doctrine

"Lament like a virgin girded with sackcloth for the husband of her youth."

 To "gird" signifies readiness to receive the influx of good and truth from the 
Lord, and to respond to it (AC 7863). To "gird with sackcloth" signifies 
mourning for destroyed good (AC 4779 [8]).

 A "virgin" signifies purity from all falsities (AC 3081).


"Youth," in a positive sense, signifies the order of truths under good (AC 
5704).

 A "husband" signifies the rational principle (AC 265).

"…the priests mourn, who minister to the Lord."

 Priests are to teach truth, and so lead to good, and to the Lord (AC 10794).

29

 The priesthood of Aaron, his sons, and the Levites represents the work of 

salvation in successive order (AC 10017).

 Mourning signifies grief because truth is destroyed and because good is 

also(AE 1129 [2]).

 Ministers of the Lord signify those who are in love to the Lord and in 

derivative worship (AE 444 [7]).

 A "minister" signifies a representative and servant of a special kind of 

holiness that is present when people read the Word. This holiness acts as an 
intermediary between the Lord and people who only understand the 
outward sense of the Word (AC 9419).

"Be ashamed you farmers, wail you vinedressers."

 To "be ashamed" in the negative sense means or signifies being in a natural 

good to conceal evils (AC 216 and 217).



 To "be ashamed" or to feel shame in the positive sense signifies a willingness 
to face unclean loves. The call for shame is to those who will be of the Lord’s 
New Church. It is a call from the Lord to encourage them to seek and learn 
truths and to retain them. See AR 706.
"Farmers," husbandmen, plowmen, and tillers of the soil signify those who 
teach, or those who are of the church, for a field signifies the church and 
"farmers" are the implanters of truths (AE 652 [18]).
"Wail," "weep," "lament," and "mourn" are words used to express a state of 
grieving. Grieving over what? The loss of good and truth within the church. 
These words also represent the Lord’s grief because of the night-time state 
among the people as to the (lack of) truths of faith in the church. See AC 2910.
"Vinedressers" signify those who have truths and teach them (AE 911 [13]).





"…lie all night in sackcloth."

"Night" signifies all things of a person’s (own) proprium (AC 21).
"Night" signifies a person’s state when falsities arise (AE 167 [5]).



 Therefore, what we have here is a command to search for, discover, and 

mourn over the evils within our natural side.

Putting It All Together

The Lord saw and knew the condition of the church. The internal state of the church 
was not healthy. The visible aspects of the church appeared normal. Rituals were 
being observed by the priests and the people. High holidays were being kept. But 
within these normal appearances, the church was nearing spiritual death. The hells 
were laboring to bring about a spiritual drought of significant proportions. How 
could the Lord AWAKEN, SOBER UP, and bring His church to a WEEPING AND 
WAILING state of honest emotional cleansing? How could He invoke a spiritual 
honesty to lead the hearts and minds of His people away from rationalizations and 

30

self-justifications? We need to recall the serious weakness of the Israelites. They 
believed they were the chosen, or favored, people. A spirit of invincibility carried 
them along for centuries, and they fostered a belief that the Lord would always 
rescue and excuse them. Their supposed favored status would not carry them 
through the "day of the Lord."

Could a plague of four kinds of locust stripping the land snap the Israelites out of 
their fantasies? Would Joel’s speaking to the people about the wasted fields, the land 
mourning over the ruined grain, the wine drying up, the failure of the oil, the wheat, 
the barley, the vine, the fig tree, the pomegranate tree, the palm tree, and the apple 
tree withering and drying up accomplish anything? Could Joel’s reminder to the 
people that "joy has withered away from the sons of men" bring the church to a state
of repentance and reformation?

The Divinely inspired prophecy of Joel is not only a description of the problem at 
hand. The Lord outlined a workable plan that, if followed, would reverse the 
devastation of the land and the church and guarantee the restoration of joy to the 
church.

Let’s note the order of the plan that the Lord outlined for the revitalization of the 
church:

1. Virgins were to lament, gird themselves with sackcloth, and remember the 
husband of their youth. What is the Lord calling the church to do? He wants 
the church to get in touch with innocence again. They are to return to the 
conjunction and marriage of love and wisdom, remembering that the first 
love of the rational soul (the husband of youth) is to serve the Lord with 
gladness. They are to prepare themselves to receive good and truth from the 
Lord and respond to it wholeheartedly.

2. Priests, teach the truth. This is a command to lead people to the good of life 

and the Lord. The priests of the church must have a sincere care for the souls 
of those within the church. They are to offer a ministry of mediation in which 
they introduce the Word to the people and show how the truths relate to life. 
The Lord asks them to show genuine sorrow for having forgotten to do these 
things in the past and to rectify that deficiency as quickly as possible.

3. Farmers, you need to be ashamed. Why? Farmers represent the implanters of 
the Lord’s truth. They apparently failed to adequately prepare the field for 
the planting of truth. Perhaps the field was not cleared of weeds. Rocks, roots,
and hard soil were not giving truth the proper depth to find nourishment and
protection from the heat of the sun.

4. Lastly, the church needs to have a hearty crying time. She needs to wail and 

lie all night in the sackcloth of remorse. The Lord wants His church to face the
night-time of its unregenerate proprium. The church has to rein in the 
uncontrolled and stubborn self. The command to wear sackcloth is a call to 
mourn and search out the spiritual enemy of the soul by resisting the evils of 
self-love.

31

This is the "day of the Lord." When these things are done, joy will return to the 
church. The land will flourish again. The grain fields will wave in the gentle 
restorative breeze from the Lord. The wine will flow and taste better than that which
was served first. Oil will be plentiful. Fig trees, pomegranate trees, palms, and apple 
trees will bear abundant crops. Joy will fill the sons of men. The Lord’s New Church 
will restore the dignity of the church and the souls of its people.

Questions to Stimulate Reflection

1. Did you notice that we had 21 direct teachings to help us with this summary? 
There was less of a need to turn to derived doctrine. What was one striking 
teaching you noticed among those given in the Passages from the Writings 
section?

2. Did the "gloom and doom" theme diminish as you moved toward the spiritual

sense? Why or why not?

3. AR 706 gave a positive meaning to the experience of shame. It is a call to 

those who will be of the Lord’s New Church to encourage them to seek and 
learn truths and to retain them. Had you ever thought about shame in this 
way? What aspects of this positive idea of shame can you see in daily living?

4.

Is the passage about the virgin and "the husband of her youth" supposed to 
remind us of love in its beginning stages? When it comes to religion, have we 
retained that feeling of youthful excitement and spontaneity in loving the 
Lord or have we fallen into a rut of boredom and begun taking the Lord and 
the church for granted? What are some ways to address this problem?

5. The picturesque description of the failure of the crops and the fruit trees is 
intended to get us thinking about what? AE 109 [4] teaches that trees 
represent the interiors of a person belonging to his or her mind and 
disposition, and the leaves and fruit represent the things that come from 
the interiors. So the fig-tree represents the natural good (obedience) being 
in-filled with interior things; the pomegranate tree represents external 
knowledge being in-filled by doctrinal things from the Word; the apple tree 
represents the joy of the heart that draws its strength from spiritual good. 
Given this brief overview, can you refine this concept specifically to your life 
or some example? Work with this slowly and with a friend or two.

32

6. What about the healthiness of having a good cry to work out a resolution of 
guilt or shame? How can one have a good cry and then get over it by doing 
something positive? The Lord wants repentance, not moroseness.

7. What state of mind brings us joy? How about this idea as revealed in AC 3118:
"…in the Word ‘gladness’ is predicated of truth, and ‘joy’ of good…Gladness is 
of the countenance [face], but joy [is] of the heart; or…gladness is of spiritual 
affection or truth, but joy is of celestial affection or of good; thus gladness is 
in a degree less than joy…"

8. What did you get from the Lord’s message to the virgin, the priests, and the 

farmers, and the directive to the priests to lie all night in sackcloth?

JOEL 1:14

"Consecrate a fast, call a sacred assembly; gather the elders and all the inhabitants of 
the land into the house of the Lord your God, and cry out to the Lord."

Passages From The Writings

P&P



"Exhortation to be converted…"

Derived Doctrine

"Consecrate a fast, call a sacred assembly…"



"Consecrate," or sanctify, signifies to "represent the Lord and the holy things 
which are from Him…thus it denotes to be led by the Lord, because the Lord 
alone is holy, and everything holy proceeds from Him…" (AC 9988, 10111, and
10128)

 A "fast" signifies an unhappy state when good is no longer conjoined with 

truths (AC 9182 [10]).

 To "fast" signifies to mourn on account of the lack of good and truth (AE 1189

[2]).

 Fasting corresponds to temptation (AE 730).


"Sacred" means dedicated, set apart in honor, holy, hallowed, inviolable, and 
not to be profaned.

 AC 10796 presents the following thoughts on what is holy (sacred): "Priests 

must have dignity and honor on account of the holy things which they engage
in; but those of them who are wise give the honor to the Lord, from whom 
come all holy things; and not to themselves. But those of them who are not 
wise attribute the honor to themselves. These take it away from the Lord. 

33

Those who attribute honor to themselves…set honor and profit above the 
salvation of souls, which they ought to have regard for. But those who give the
honor to the Lord and not to themselves, set the salvation of souls above 
honor and profit."
"Assembly" signifies setting things in order. For goods and truths cannot be 
assembled if there is no order. See AC 6338.
"Assembly," or "the Tent of meeting," signifies where the presence of the Lord 
is (AC 9784).





"Gather the elders and all the inhabitants of the land into the house of the Lord your 
God, and cry out to the Lord."



 What is gathered, stored up, assembled, and picked up signify the things that 
are in a person’s memory. It "further implies that both goods and truths 
should be gathered in man before he is regenerated; for without [them being]
gathered together, through which as means the Lord may operate, a man can 
never be regenerated…" (AC 679).
"Elders," which signify "all things that are of the natural man, such as 
memory-knowledges of whatever kind, are nothing but things of service; for 
they serve the rational by enabling it to think equitably and will justly." (AC 
3019)
"Inhabitants of the world" signify people of the church who are in the goods 
of doctrine, and so of life (AE 741 [6]).
"Land" signifies various things: the internal person of the church, the region 
where the church is, the church itself, the doctrine of love and charity where 
the faith of the church resides (AC 2571).
"Into the house of the Lord" signifies the church wherein love is the 
principal(AC 710).







 To "cry out" is to indicate intense thought with the full intention of doing (AC 

7119).

 Crying out signifies supplication to the Lord from grief (AC 8353).

Putting It All Together

P&P states that this verse refers to the Lord’s exhortation to the people to be 
converted. How were the people to accomplish their conversion?

1. Be led by the Lord alone.

2. Start this process by giving up the food of natural thought (fasting) and 
seeking to conjoin the good and truth of the Lord. These actions are the 
sacred assembly.

3. Do the work of the priesthood with dignity and care for the salvation of souls.

34

4. Dedicate the work of the church to setting things in order. Where there is no 

order, there can be no influx of the Lord.

5. Assemble goods and truths with the goal that they will become the means for 

the Lord to regenerate all the people within the church.

6. Gather the land together in the house of the Lord where love is the principle 
goal, and where the people can cry out with a united voice that the intention 
of the church is to do the Lord’s will.

All of these actions will bear fruit if the church listens to and believes in the sacred 
call to conversion. These things are not for the merit or honor of the people. They 
are for the honor of the Lord, who cares for the salvation of souls.

Questions to Stimulate Reflection

1. The Lord called for a "fast." His message seems to be a reminder to us that the
foods of the natural mind are not sufficient for the soul. In addition to natural 
food, we need the added enrichment of spiritual food. Fasting calls for us to 
admit that we cannot live "by bread alone." This call to fast is intended to 
inspire us to reflect: Will we search for spiritual truths as a part of our on-
going spiritual growth? Worship, meditation, and reflection can help us 
organize and assemble goods and truths in a formidable way. How does the 
Lord call us to fast in daily life? When does He call us?

2. Recall for a moment the meaning of "elders." Elders signify a gathering of 
memory-knowledges of every kind for the purpose of service. They are 
to serve the rational mind. Elders are to enable us to think equitably and to 
will justly. Is this a process that you are aware of and that you find alive and 
well in your spiritual growth? How can you call on your "elders" in various 
areas of your life?

3. What does the word "conversion" mean to you? Conversions are not what the
televangelists talk about and promise to their listeners. Nor is conversion 
achieved while listening to a gifted preacher/teacher. Conversion is a gift 
from the Lord that comes to us when we love the truths of the Word and 
make them the principle part of our inward church. Conversion comes about 
when we are led by continuous degrees from ignorance to enlightenment. 
The Lord sees our sincere desire to learn and to be guided by His Word, and 

35

He lifts us upward, through discrete degrees, to see the spiritual and celestial 
levels of His truth. Only the Lord lifts up the mind to conversion. No one 
can force a "conversion" by wit or strength.

4. Let’s read HH 253: "…man’s interior and exterior faculties are such that they 
are turned either towards the Lord as their common center…or towards self, 
that is, backwards from the Lord. Those that are turned towards the Lord are 
also turned towards heaven. But those that are turned towards self are 
turned also towards the world. And to elevate these is a difficult matter; 
nevertheless the Lord elevates them as much as is possible, by turning the 
love about, which is done by means of truths from the Word."

"Almighty" signifies the Lord’s Omnipotence. The Lord alone reigns in the

Putting It All Together

In Revelation 6:10, the Lord opens the fifth seal of the great scroll that is in His hand. 
When the fifth seal is opened, the souls of those who "had been slain for the word of 
God and for the testimony which they held" cry out with a loud voice saying "How 
long, O Lord, holy and true, until You judge and avenge our blood on those who dwell
on the earth?"

How many times, while studying the prophets, have we read about "the day of the 
Lord" when the awesome vastation of the church and the establishment of the New 
Church would finally come about? Like the souls of heaven, do we wonder when 
and how long, O Lord it will be before the New Church is the crown of all churches 
whose kingdom will be forever and ever?

With war, murder, brutality, and disregard for the ways of the Lord evident in our 
daily news, it’s difficult not to become troubled with the apparent "slowness" of the 
Lord to bring an end to such blatant forms of disrespect and hatred of the neighbor. 
The repetition of a promise such as what is described in this verse of Joel intensifies 
the hope that "the day of the Lord" will come to pass.

The first word of Joel 1:15 is "Alas," to express the Divine sadness and grief that there
are, and will be, people who will choose not to listen to Him or follow His ways. The 
Lord is never capricious or angry. The people of the church will be given every 
opportunity to reform and repent. The evil people, and not the Lord, will cast 
themselves from the presence of heaven. So the Word repeats the theme of "the day 
of the Lord." The church will be emptied of those who twisted the Word and the 
memory-knowledges. The wicked will be held accountable and will answer to the 
Almighty. The Great Omnipotence will offer a steady and firm hand to the beautiful 
construction of the Holy City New Jerusalem. His ability, power, and confidence will 
win the day. The doors of the Holy City are wide open, and the Sun of Heaven leads, 
and shows, the way into heavenly order and peace.

For our part, in spite of recurring times of doubt and impatience, we need to read on 
and believe the promises of the Word, and stay faithful to the testimony written 
within each prophecy.

P&P sums up the reason we have this verse in Joel, with these words: "to reflect that
thus will be the last time, when the Lord will come…"

Questions to Stimulate Reflection

1. The word "alas" signifies grief. What can you imagine about the kind of grief 
the Lord feels for those who reject and throw away their place in heaven? Is 
the Lord’s grief infinite?

2. Do you think things in the world have gotten worse with passing time? We 

accept things today that would never have been accepted ten or twenty years 
ago. Have we loosened up on things because we have been enlightened? Or, is 
the acceptance of things part of the vastation process?

3. What is your view of "the day of the Lord"? Is it coming soon? Will it be in our

lifetime? Do you see any signs that the Lord’s New Church is growing 
throughout the world? What are they?

4. How much spiritual comfort did you receive when reading the summation in 
P&P? "To reflect that thus will be the last time when the Lord will come."

5. We believe in the second coming of the Lord. We welcome the Lord’s second 
coming in the revelation of His threefold Word. Can we imagine what our life 
would be like without the revelation of the Writings? Think of all the areas of 
your life that are touched by your beliefs.

"Food" signifies the goods and enjoyments of affections supplied by the Lord 
that one may be regenerated (AC 677).
"Food" signifies spiritual and celestial nourishment, which is faith in the Lord
and love (AC 680 [4]).
"Food" signifies things of use to the soul (AC 5293).
"Cut off" signifies that divine truth shall be taken from the people, but shall 
live again in a new church (AE 315 [23]).

 The word "clod" is mentioned in two places in the Writings: TCR 333 and CL 

232. Both references cite those who stand in one place and do not think about
higher things. They only want to debate about issues and are not really 
interested in finding the truth or making spiritual progress. They want to "…
tread and grind a single clod, and not to advance."

 To gather things into "the barn" signifies to conjoin with heaven (AE 911 [5]).
 AC 5959 teaches that "grain" "sometimes signifies the good of truth, and 

sometimes the truth of good…"

 The word "withered" has already been discussed above. It signifies that the 

truths of good are dying.

Putting It All Together

P&P directs our minds to consider this beginning point: "…everything of the church 
has been devastated…" How is this illustrated in the literal sense of Joel?

1. The food of the church, the necessary things of love (good) and wisdom 
(truth), will be cut off. Why? The Lord cut the church off to prevent the 
people of the church from seriously hurting themselves or blaspheming the 
holy things of the church. How was this protection accomplished? They found
spiritual food unappetizing, bland, boring, or tedious; their desire for it was 
erased from their view or presence by the plague and drought of self-love.

2. Their eyes missed the joy and gladness of the love and wisdom of the Word.

3. The love of being useful was no longer the highest priority in the house of 

God (the church).

4. When the love of being useful to the Lord and the neighbor is lost, it only 
makes sense that what was to produce or beget those useful acts loses its 
power of procreation. So the seed shriveled.

5. The great clods of the natural mind weighed down and smothered any seeds 
of good and truth. The wonderful image given in CL 232 and TCR 333 shows 
that debating and standing, or walking, in one place advances us nowhere. 
Stagnation of mind and heart are a sure-fire method of killing spiritual 
spontaneity.

42

6.

In such a state, the mental storehouses of the people in the church fell into a 
shambles with the weight of conceit. Belief in their own cleverness and 
opposition to the Lord created disarray that would bring their house down.

7. The love of truth or the truth of love dried up and withered away. Such is the 
heart or message of these verses. The Lord, through Joel, poses a silent 
question: Is anyone listening? Are you willing to change? If not, know that 
everything in the present church will be devastated.

Questions to Stimulate Reflection

1. The two passages of Joel under consideration pose some interesting 

questions for us to reflect on.

o Are we hungry for the food of the Lord?

o Do we feel a joy and gladness for the Word (good and truth) of the 

Lord?

o Are we content to stand in one place "marking time" with little or no 

advancement or extension in spiritual matters?

o Do we love to debate truth for the sake of appearing wise or learned?

o Have we allowed "clods" to smother the potential growth of the Lord’s

seeds?

2. Can we identify with the imagery of the empty storehouses, the barns in 

shambles, the withering grain? Remember, these things are said in the Word 
to show us what the church will be like if it refuses to seek first the kingdom 
of heaven and all of its blessings.

3. Such a picture is not intended to be gloomy. Instead, it reminds us that this 

sad illustration has to be shunned. It serves to inspire us to move onward and
upward with the Lord’s Word, looking toward the New Church’s birth in the 
hearts and minds of the people.

4. As we look back at these passages, we can ask ourselves: were we listening to

Joel’s message with joy and gladness or fear and trembling? Why?

JOEL 1:18-20

"How the animals groan! The herds of cattle are restless, because they have no 
pasture; even the flocks of sheep suffer punishment.

O Lord, to You I cry out; for fire has devoured the open pastures, and a flame has 
burned all the trees of the field. The beasts of the field also cry out to You, for the water
brooks are dried up, and fire has devoured the open pastures."

Passages From The Writings

P&P



"…for which reason there is lamentation."

AR 567



"That men, as to their affections, are meant by ‘beasts,’ may appear from 
these passages…" Joel 1:16, 18, and 20 are cited among many other 
references.

AE 650 [37]



"In Joel 1:16, 18, 20…The state of the church [described occurs] when there 
are no longer in it any truths of doctrine or good of life. ‘The food cut off from 
the house of God’ signifies spiritual nourishment, which is from truths that 
are from good, ‘the house of God’ signifying the church; ‘the beast groaneth, 
the droves of cattle are perplexed’ signifies the lack of the affections of truth 
and thence of knowledges in the natural man, and grief on that account, 
‘droves of cattle’ signifying the things of the natural man in the whole 
complex."

AC 6078 [5]



"‘Pastures’ in these passages denotes the truths in which man is instructed, 
here such things as regard spiritual life; for spiritual life is such that if this 
pasturage fails, it languishes and as it were pines away as does the body when
it lacks food. That ‘pasture’ denotes the good and truth which restore and 
sustain the soul or spirit of man, is clear from the Lord’s words in John 
10:9…" Joel 1:18 is cited as a passage where the signification is similar.

AE 482 [3]



"As it is known in the church that ‘to feed’ signifies to instruct, ‘pasture’ 
instruction, and ‘shepherd’ an instructor, a few passages only in which 

44

‘feeding’ and ‘pasture’ are mentioned shall be quoted without further 
explanation." Joel 1:18 is among the passages cited.

AC 2708 [8]



"That ‘wilderness’ is predicated of a church altogether vastated, and of those 
who are altogether vastated as to good and truth, who cannot be reformed is 
thus shown in…Joel 1:19, 20."

AR 546



"That by ‘a wilderness’ is signified the church devastated, or in which all the 
truths of the Word are falsified, such as it was among the Jews in the Lord’s 
time, appears from these passages..." Joel 1:19-20 is cited among many other 
passages.

AE 504 [34]



"…a church that can be in the light of truth from the Word is called ‘the forest 
of the south’ but that is now in knowledges alone without spiritual light; ‘the 
trees that the fire will devour’ signify such knowledges…that evil cupidities 
will deprive such knowledges of all spiritual life, and that there will be no 
longer any truth in clearness…" Joel 1:19-20 is cited as a sign of this 
devastation.

AE 730 [13]



"In Joel…1:19, 20…‘The fire hath consumed the habitants of the wilderness 
and the flame hath burned all the trees of the field’ signifies that the love of 
self and the pride of self-intelligence have consumed all the perception of 
good and all the understanding of the truth of doctrine from the sense of the 
letter of the Word, ‘fire’ signifying the love of self, ‘flame’ the pride of self-
intelligence, ‘the habitations of the wilderness’ the goods of doctrine from the
sense of the letter of the Word, and the ‘trees of the field’ the knowledges of 
its truth. The sense of the letter of the Word is called a ‘wilderness’ when it is 
merely understood naturally, thus according to appearances, and not at the 
same time spiritually, or according to the genuine sense. ‘The beasts of the 
field pant after Thee’ signifies the lamentations of those who are natural and 
yet have a desire for truths; that ‘beasts’ signify the affections of the natural 
man may be seen above (n. 650); ‘for the streams of water are dried up, and 
the fire hath consumed the habitations of the wilderness’ signifies that 
consequently there are no longer any truths and goods of life."

Derived Doctrine

"How the animals groan!"







In the good sense, "animals," or "beasts," represent affections longing to be 
instructed or spiritually nourished (AE 650 [10]).
"Groaning" signifies grief on account of the effort of falsities to subjugate (AC 
6803).
"Groaning" and "sighing" signify the destruction of the affections of good (AE 
863 [2]).

"The herds of cattle are restless…"

 Could the word "restless" describe a state of being "perplexed" or 







"distressed"?
"Perplexed" signifies confusion of external knowledges mixed in the outer 
memory (AC 2831).
"Distressed" signifies a state in which the internal is alienated from the 
external (AC 5470).
"Distressed" signifies the beginning of temptations acting on the conscience 
in a case in which the person does not know the origin of his or her fear and 
distress (AC 4249).

 Your attention, for the signification of the rest of this passage, is redirected to 

AE 730 [13] as cited above.

 Let’s ponder for a moment the meaning of "open pastures" being devoured. 
This phrase occurs twice in our lesson. When the Word mentions something 
twice, it is not for poetical effect or repetition. Usually, when something is 
mentioned twice, it is to teach us about what is happening to the will and 
understanding.
"Open," in the positive sense, signifies to bring out, to be taught, to 
communicate and conjoin things that had been concealed (AE 303). In the 
negative sense, devouring "open pastures" seems to represent a loss of the 
ability to communicate and conjoin (use and nurture) spiritual goods and 
truths.



Putting It All Together

Hard as it may be, we are to picture the church totally devoid of any truths of 
doctrine or good of life. What does that mean? Can we think of any examples of this 
state occurring in our lifetime, or in history?

The spiritual sense of Joel’s prophecy explains that the problem arises when the love
of self and the pride of intelligence go out of control. The church, lacking the Lord’s 
guidance, misuses the literal sense of the Word with no thought about the meaning 

46

of the spiritual sense. For which reason, P&P teaches, there is just cause for 
"lamentation." How does the Word picture for us the devastation of the church?

 Animals groan. Affections long to be instructed and nourished.
 Herds of cattle are restless. Internals and externals feel a sense of 

alienation.

 There is a loss of pastures. The understanding languishes because of the 

lack of instructional feeding.

 The flocks of sheep suffer punishment. Innocence of wisdom is conflicted.
 Fire devours the open pastures. Self-love burns away at the core of a 

person’s understanding.

 The flame has burned all of the trees of the field. There is a loss of 

knowledge.

 The beasts of the field cry out to the Lord. There is a sense of desperation 

for the Lord’s help.

 The water brooks are dried up. Thirst for the living waters of the Lord is 
felt when human wisdom can’t quench the soul’s deep thirst for genuine 
truth.

 Fire devours the open pastures. Self love burns away the core of a person’s 

will.

Have we come any closer to understanding this section of the prophetic meaning of 
the church’s lamentation? Is the universal church of our time experiencing anything 
that sounds akin to these spiritual symptoms?

Questions to Stimulate Reflection

1. How many times have we read about the church being devastated? It seems 
that this is a theme that runs throughout the Prophets. Does hearing it so 
often dull or numb the "alarm" system of the conscience?

2. What usually brings about the devastation of the Church? The church is 
devastated when people fall in love with themselves and their own 
intelligence. Did this happen to everyone in the church? Weren’t there a few 
faithful souls in the church? Can you picture a whole church gone off the deep
end of self-love and self-intelligence? I can picture some sweet elderly 
woman or man doing charitable good to others. Can you, too? The Lord 
always preserves a remnant of the church, on which the new church can be 
founded. The devastation of the church happens when the Word is ignored, 

47

when the literal sense is twisted and misapplied, when people no longer seek 
the spiritual sense of the Lord’s Word. Notice what action the Lord takes in 
this situation. He brings about the spirit of lamentation, a longing for 
innocence and peace.

3. Have you ever thought this process through? If we fail to study; if we fail to 
look for the inner sense; if we rely on our own wisdom and not the Lord’s, 
lamentation rightly begins. The Lord grieves for us. His providence works to 
empty such self-centered thoughts from His Holy Temple. Do we share His 
zealous endeavor to guard the Word?

4. How can we keep indifferent attitudes from coming into our hearts? A loving 
worship of the Lord can keep the doors wide open. We can become mindful of
the need to have periodic self-examination so the light of heaven can keep us 
on the right path. Do we? Will we?

5. Last question: Please take the time to read CL 532 and 533. What inspiration 
did you feel after reading these numbers? Do you have any ideas of how we 
can make the truths, written on the paper, shine like a star again?

Chapter Two

JOEL 2:1-3

“Blow the trumpet in Zion, and sound an alarm in My holy mountain! Let all the 
inhabitants of the land tremble; for the day of the Lord is coming, for it is at hand: a 
day of darkness and gloominess, a day of clouds and thick darkness, like the morning 
clouds spread over the mountains. A people come, great and strong, the like of whom 
has never been; nor will there ever be any such after them, even for many successive 
generations.”

AC 1861 [14]



"…‘fire’ denotes the infernal punishment of those who…pass their lives in the

"…those who are in falsities are called in the Word ‘powerful,’ ‘vigorous,’ 
‘mighty,’ ‘strong,’ ‘heroes,’ ‘rulers,’ ‘terrible,’ ‘dreadful,’ and wasters, as can be 
seen from various passages, as from the following." Joel 2:2 and 7 are cited.

AC 2495 [2 & 3]



"…in the consummation of the age (or last period of the church) there will no 
longer be any love, or charity, nor therefore any faith. That this is the meaning
is evident from similar words of the Lord in the Prophets, as in…Joel…2:2, 
10."

Derived Doctrine

"Blow [sound] the trumpet in Zion, and sound an alarm in My Holy mountain!"





"Sound" signifies the influx of truths and also the announcement of truth (AC 
9926).
In AC 8815, we read "…‘the voice,’ or sound, ‘of a trumpet,’ [signifies] the truth
of celestial good…and ‘a trumpet’ celestial good…"

 To "sound" a "trumpet," or "horn," signifies to announce that the intellectual 







of the church has been laid to waste (AC 4592 [10]).
"Zion" signifies heaven and the church where the Lord alone is 
worshipped(AR 612).
"Zion" signifies a new church among the gentiles that should acknowledge 
the Lord (AE 721 [8] and AE 730 [27]).
"Zion" signifies the advent of the Lord, and the establishment of the church by
Him among those who are in the good of love (AE 433 [8]).

 To "warn" the people represents "that they should not desire to go up to the 

heaven where the Divine celestial is." In other words, the warning was issued 

53

that they should not seek to bring damnation upon themselves by seeking to 
become god-like (AC 8830).
"Mountain of holiness" signifies heaven, especially the inmost heaven where 
love to the Lord prevails (AE 314 [4]).



 The "mountain of Jehovah" and "rock of Israel" signify the Lord and goods of 

love, and the Lord and goods of charity, respectively (AC 795 [3]).

"Let all the inhabitants of the land tremble…"







"Inhabitants of the world" in the positive sense signify people of the church 
who are in the goods of doctrine, and so of life (AE 741 [6]).
It would appear that those who were not in the goods of doctrine and a life in 
accordance to them needed to tremble. "Trembling" signifies feeling distress 
during temptation (AE 282 [6]).
"Land" signifies various things: the internal man of the church, the region 
where the church is, the church itself, the doctrine of love and charity where 
the faith of the church resides (AC 2571).

"A people come, great and strong, the like of whom has never been; nor will there ever 
be any such after them…"

 As an important reminder of what this passage means, recall the direct 

teachings of AE 1135 [2]. The people of this church played games with the 
power of their reasoning. They took falsities and used them to assault truths, 
to make truths look like lies. We are given an example of the magnitude of 
their malignancy. They imagined themselves to be invincible giants in the 
land. "…nor will there ever be any such after them." That is not a compliment. 
That is a reassuring promise from the Lord. The rise and establishment of the
Lord’s New Church would subdue the spiritual lunacy of hell. Hell’s imagined 
invincibility would melt away in the presence of the Sun of Heaven. Never 
again! Never again!

Putting It All Together

The last paragraph of the Derived Doctrine section sets us on course to "put it all 
together" in this section.

P&P teaches that the Lord will come and execute judgment. For the evil, it will be a 
day of terrible judgment. Of course! The evil sense that their power to twist truth 
into lies is over. Evil’s imagined power over others will end. For the evil, it will be a
day of darkness and gloominess. The evil will feel the loss of their control, and they 
are not happy about that. The giants of hell are to be made insignificant "midgets," 
and they are sad about that reality. How do we know that this is so? The Lord has 
said so! He is the all-knowing and all-powerful Lord of heaven. Nothing can stand in 
His presence and challenge Him.

54

On the other side of this prophecy stands the Sun of Heaven offering light, warmth, 
and optimism to the faithful remnant preserved by the Lord. The Lord shares with 
the faithful the news that never again will there be the likes of these adulterers, 
prevaricators, deceivers, intimidators, and haters of the Lord. Their reign of terror is 
over! To the faithful, this is a day of joy and good news. Take heart all you who wait 
for the Lord. He is coming. Sound the alarm. Spread the good word from His holy 
mountain: "This is the day that the Lord has made. We will be glad and rejoice in it."

Does your heart thrill at the news of this righting of wrong and terror? It needs to 
because the next portion of Joel’s prophecy speaks of the hells attempting to be men 
of war and heroes. Hell threatens the city. The hells act like strong horses leaping 
over mountaintops. They climb the walls of the city and break in through windows. 
They lunge with weapons. Chaos breaks out throughout the city.

While reading further in Joel, we must come back to these verses to remember the 
Lord’s promise that hell will be defeated. Knowing this truth calms the spirit and 
builds our anticipation of good winning out over evil.

Questions to Stimulate Reflection

1. Why is it that evil never learns that it cannot stand against the Lord and win?

2. How can evil love to twist truth to falsity?

3. Hellish spirits want to make others unhappy. They enjoy and burn with a plan
to pull people away from the Lord. Does the thought of this plan rally you to 
the cause of working with the Lord to overcome their plan?

4. The lunacy of hell is sad, empty, and illogical. The sanity of heaven is happy, 
full, and lucid. Is there really a question about which one we want for our 
lives to eternity?

JOEL 2:4-9

"Their appearance is like the appearance of horses; and like swift steeds, so they run. 
With a noise like chariots over mountaintops they leap, like the noise of a flaming fire 
that devours the stubble, like a strong people set in battle array. Before them the 
people writhe in pain; all faces are drained of color. They run like mighty men, they 
climb the wall like men of war; every one marches in formation, and they do not break 

55

ranks. They do not push one another; every one marches in his own column. Though 
they lunge between the weapons, they are not cut down. They run to and fro in the city,
they run on the wall; they climb into the houses, they enter at the windows like a thief."

to ‘run to and fro’ denotes the doctrinals of truth…The ‘houses into which 
they shall climb’ denote the goods which they destroy…The ‘windows

possession of the abode previously occupied by truths and goods."

"‘Man and brother’ signify truth and good, and in the contrary sense falsity



"Since good and truth are taken away from those who are in dead worship, as
if it were done by a thief in the dark, therefore in the Word the same is 
sometimes likened to a thief, as in the following passages…" Joel 2:9 is cited as
an example.

AR 898



"…a wall great and high, signifies the Word in the sense of the letter from 
which is the doctrine of the New Church…Nothing else is meant by its ‘wall’ 
but the Word in the sense of the letter…for that sense protects the spiritual 
sense, which lies hidden within, as the wall does a city and its inhabitants…
And that this sense is the guard, lest the interior Divine truths, which are 
those of the spiritual sense, should be injured…It is called ‘a wall great and 
high,’ because…‘great’ is predicated of good, and ‘high’ of truth…[as may been 
seen] in the following passages…" Joel 2:9 is cited.

TCR 318



"…to steal means to deprive others of the truths of their faith, which is done 
by means of falsities and heresies. Priests, who minister solely for gain or 
from a lust for honor, and teach what they see or might see from the Word to 
be untrue, are spiritual thieves, since they take away from the people the 
means of salvation, which are the truths of faith. Such are called thieves in the
Word, in the following passages…" Joel 2:9 is cited.

AE 193 [7]



"In Joel (2:9)…The vastation of the church through falsities from evil is here 
treated of; ‘city’ and ‘wall’ signify the things of doctrine; ‘houses’ and 
‘windows’ things pertaining to the mind that receives; ‘houses’ that part of 
the mind that is called the will, where good is, and ‘windows’ that part of the 
mind that is called the understanding, where truth is. (That ‘city’ in the Word 
is doctrine, see Arcana Coelestia, n. 402, 2449, 2712, 2943, 3216, 4492, 4493;
that ‘wall’ is the truth of doctrine defending, n. 6419; that ‘house’ is that part 
of the mind which is called the will, where good is, n. 2231, 2233, 2559, 3128,
5023, 6690, 7353, 7910, 7929, 9150; and ‘windows’ that part of the mind 
which is called the understanding where truth is, n. 655, 658, 3391.) From 
this it is clear what is signified by ‘running upon the wall,’ ‘coming up into the 
houses,’ and ‘entering in through the windows like a thief."

AE 1005



"‘Behold I come as a thief, signifies the Lord’s coming and the Last Judgment 
at that time. This is evident from the signification of ‘coming as a thief,’ as 
being in reference to the Lord, His coming and the Last Judgment…This is the 
signification of ‘coming as a thief,’ because taking away the knowledges of 
good and truth, and devastating the church, as a thief takes away wealth and 
robs a house, is attributed to the Lord; also because the church is then in 
night and in darkness, that is, in falsities from evil, and the last state of the 
church is called ‘night,’ and the falsities of evil that then prevail are called 
‘darkness,’ and a thief comes in the night when it is dark. This is why the 
Lord’s coming and Last Judgment are compared to a thief…" Joel 2:9 is cited 
as an example.

Derived Doctrine

"Their appearance is like the appearance of horses…"

 AC 589 teaches "…the Word was spoken according to the appearances with 

man. Whoever therefore desires to confirm false principles by the 
appearances, according to which the Word was spoken, can do so by 
passages without number. But it is one thing to confirm false principles by 
the Word, and another to believe in simplicity what is in the Word. He who 
confirms false principles…scrapes together and accumulates confirmations 
wherever he can, thus also from the Word, until he so strongly persuades 
himself that he can no longer see the truth" (emphasis added).

 The word "appearances" is mentioned twice. Could such a repetition be used 
to illustrate how the will and understanding are influenced to confirm an 
error by appearances?

 AR 298 teaches that "horses" signify the Word and the understanding of the 
Word. Think about the colors of the horses mentioned in Revelation 6: white, 
red, black, and pale. The progression of colors from white to pale is used to 
signify the stages the Word goes through when it is falsified.

"…like swift steeds, so they run."



"Swift" is used when referring to intelligence and the affection of truth. In the 
opposite sense, "swift" signifies reasoning against truth. See AE 281 [7 & 10].
 The word "steed" is used when referring to a spirited horse, a stud horse, or a



war horse, according to Webster’s Dictionary.
"…like swift steeds" has a positive and negative usage in the Word. Which way
are we to understand the meaning of this passage? It seems that we are led to
see it in the negative sense. Hell imagines itself to be swift, virile, and so 
clever.

58

"…so they run."

 Picture the meaning of this in your mind. We have an expression, "running 

with our thoughts." Can we see the hells running with their insane thoughts 
like wild steeds? What kind of emotions do they display to all they hope to 
intimidate? Listen to the next part!

"With a noise like chariots…"

 AC 5321 [10] defines "chariots," in the negative sense, as representing the 

doctrine of evil and falsity with the outward (worldly) knowledge or "facts" 
confirming it. The noisy shouting of how wise and true evil’s thinking is 
comes to mind.
If these things had been said of the Lord, they would have corresponded to 
doctrinal things of good and truth leading the way to salvation (AE 355 [4] 
and AC 5321 [6]).



"…like chariots over mountaintops they leap, like the noise of a flaming fire that 
devours the stubble."



"Over" signifies having a glimpse of what is within (AR 800).


 Because we know this passage is describing the hells, we can turn to the 
negative correspondence of "mountain." AR 336 and AE 411 describe 
"mountains" as signifying evils which spring from the love of self and of the 
world.
"Leaping" in the positive sense represents an expression of joy from the 
conjunction of good and truth. Thus, there is a sense of joyousness (AE 710 
[31]). Once again, we must consider this correspondence of "leaping" in its 
negative sense. In a negative sense, this meaning of "leaping" suggests that 
the hells were delighted with themselves over their delusional false 
perception of their mighty disjunction of good and truth.
"…the noise of a flaming fire…" Can we hear the snap and crackle and see the 
flying sparks of self-love burning away within their hearts? AC 306 describes 
the meaning of "flame of a sword" as self-love "with its insane desires and 
consequent persuasions…carried away to corporeal and earthly things…"
"Devours" signifies the destruction of doctrine at its inception (AR 542). AC 
9348 [4] teaches that "devours" signifies the destruction of goods and truths.
"Stubble" signifies outward knowledges we are taught by other people (AC 
7131). Stubble is also referred to as "chaff," which signifies the casting down 
and subjugation of the hells by the Lord when external knowledges are 
scattered and removed (AC 2468).







59

"…like a strong people set in battle array."





"Strong" in the good sense signifies truth, which cannot be resisted (AC 426 
[3]). "Strong" in the good sense also signifies the celestial church that is in the
good of love to the Lord (AC 4545 [2]). "Strong" in the negative sense 
describes the evil of the love of self (AC 6306 [4]).
"Battle" in the negative sense signifies falsity fighting the truth of the New 
Church (AR 431 and 704). "Battle array" refers to armament, or battle 
clothing, worn by a warrior. What would an angel wear? What would an evil 
warrior wear? For hellish spirits, the clothing would consist of secular 
reasoning that would support their claim of invincibility and power over the 
Lord and His church. They would use practiced, smooth, cunning angles to 
prey on the unsuspecting, spiritually uninformed, and uneducated souls. In 
contrast, angels would be clothed with the finest truths of eternal unity with 
the Lord and His Word.

"Before them the people writhe in pain…"





"Writhing" signifies cunning and deceit (AE 581 [8]).
"Pain," "sore," and "sorrow" signify conflicts with resulting anxieties (AC 261).
"Pain" signifies lusts that cause misery (AC 4496).

"…all faces are drained of color"

 Note Bene: The New King James Bible uses "faces are drained of color," and 
the Revised Standard Version has "all faces grow pale." Whereas the King 
James Bible and the Writings read "all faces gather blackness." What do we do
with this difference? My inclination is to go with the "faces gathering 
blackness" because of the direct teaching we have in AE 412 [30].

"…every one marches in formation, and they do not break ranks."

 AC 3901 [7 & 8] explains the meaning of "marching through the breadth of the
land" as signifying the vastation of the truths of the church. In the positive 
sense, "marching" signifies the enlightenment of the gentiles by the Lord 
when He assumed the Human (AE 594 [13]). In this verse, it appears that 
"marching" is meant to illustrate both senses. In the negative sense, it 
announces the inevitable judgment on the vastated church, which would 
occur even though it appeared solidly organized, in step, and unified. And it 
could be a positive prophetical promise that enlightenment would be 
restored to the world and church through the advent of the Lord.

60

"…they do not push one another; every one marches in his own column."

 Let’s first focus on the spiritual meaning of "push," shove, or jostle. AC 

8593describes the nature of hellish genii as "pushers" of anyone who tires or 
weakens in the process of regeneration. AC 4585 describes the minds of 
people who don’t want to believe in things that belong to eternal life as 
people who like to "push" ideas from themselves and at heart reject truth 
from the moment they see it. New Jerusalem and Its Heavenly Doctrine 71 
describes the spiritually insane and those with immoderate lusts as people 
who aspire to "unlimited power and glory," who desire "to push their rule 
into heaven and transfer to themselves the Divine power of the Lord…
and constantly crave to go even beyond this" (emphasis added). Spiritual 
Experiences (SE) 2121describes vicious groups, hard to control, who gang up 
and harass people, relishing the chance to push people around in an insolent 
manner, constantly trying to bring harm and destruction upon many.

 What does the above information tell us about the possible meaning of this 
verse? I sense that hell doesn’t argue with itself when it purposes to "push" 
the spiritual things of the Word around. Hell hopes to find the Lord’s 
believers in a tired and wavering state. Hell is unified in its rejection of the 
Lord’s truth from the moment it sees or hears it. Hell is marching in unison to
usurp the Divine power of the Lord. Hell is an unruly gang that acts up in an 
insolent way to bring harm and destruction to those who love the Lord. 
Therefore, they don’t push each other, and they all assume their own 
column to wage war against the Lord and His followers.
 The image of everyone marching in his own column seems to be 

representative of the idea that they had their cadence, their own ideas, and 
eventually, their own spiritual rut. The expression, "Johnny One-Note," refers 
to this kind of absence of variety or harmony. It describes the shouting of one 
idea without consideration of the myriad avenues truth has to offer.

"Though they lunge between the weapons, they are not cut down."

 How are we to picture what this passage means? Do we see them thrusting 

their weapons wildly to and fro? Do they jump between the thrusts, narrowly 
avoiding being cut or killed?

 AC 9141 [4] teaches that in the negative sense, "weapons" signify the 

consuming and desolating of good and truth. In the positive sense, "weapons”
signifies the truths of doctrine from the Word, which afford protection from 
the falsities of evil.

 Will the rebellious ones escape accountability for their assault on the city? 
We know the answer to this question. In the end, evil loses. The Lord will 
win!

Putting It All Together

The Lord outlines for us in this section of the Word a story of hell’s imagined power. 
He shows us the hoard of spirited warriors. He lets us see their imagined agility and 
likens them to horses, swift steeds, and chariots. They have a leaping ability; they 
run like mighty men and climb the walls of buildings, entering through the windows.
It appears that they march in ordered rows with a cadence of deafening proportion. 
Their faces are blackened and ugly. They thrust their weapons in chaotic motions. 
Amazingly, they don’t do harm to themselves. They are not our friends. Instead, they 
are called thieves, and they wish to rob us of our goods.

Is the Lord’s purpose in telling us this just to scare us? I don’t think that is the plan. 
Instead, I believe He shows us this picture so that we have a feeling of revulsion for 
the hells. Listen to this teaching in AC 1740 [3]:

"…the greater the horror that is conceived for evils and falsities, the more of love for 
goods and truths is insinuated by the Lord. And further, the greater the horror for 
evils and falsities the less do evil spirits dare to approach, for they cannot 
endure aversion and horror for the evils and falsities in which their life 
consists…" (emphasis added).

CL 249 urges us to become involved in the uses and resistance plan outlined by the 
Lord in the Word. By doing this, we let our mind be "bound and circumscribed as by 
a circle, within which it is successively integrated into a form truly human. From this 
as from a house [each person] sees the various lusts as outside of himself, and from 
sanity of reason within, banishes them."

Scary as hell might appear in these verses, it is essential that we know and 
remember, at all times, that hell is not what it appears to be. The Lord has a plan for 
us that is powerfully summed up in this passage of AC 1717 [2]: "…he who is in 
combats of temptations, and conquers, acquires more power over evil spirits…until 
at last they dare not attempt anything" (emphasis added).

Questions to Stimulate Reflection

1. Were you able to put the bullies of hell in their proper perspective after 

reflecting on the meaning and uses of these verses? When do we most need 
to do this?

62

2. Do you feel you can use the Lord’s plan for revulsion against the hells? If yes

—how? If no—why not?

3. Why were the hells able to thrust their weapons wildly and not bring harm to

themselves?

4. Doesn’t the Lord do this in the deepest of the hells as well? He mercifully 

sends His tender angels there to snap them, ever so briefly, back to a moment 
of sanity so they can’t do harm to themselves and others. What does this tell 
us about the Lord?

5. What did you think about the passages in the Putting It All Together section 

that tell us of the great victories we can have over hell?

who are in hatreds against all things of love to the Lord and of charity toward 
the neighbor, the light of heaven actually appears as thick darkness; on which
account it is said in the Word that to such the ‘sun was blackened;’ by which 
is signified that they rejected everything of love and charity, and received 
everything that is contrary thereto…As in Joel 2:10…"

AC 3355 [3]



"In Joel 2:10…the subject is the day of the Last Judgment; the ‘earth quaking’ 
denotes a changed state of the church; the ‘sun and moon,’ the good of love 
and its truth (n. 1529, 1530, 2441, 2495), which are said to ‘become black,’ 
when goods and truths are no longer acknowledged; the ‘stars’ denote the 
knowledges of good and truth (n. 2495, 2849)."



Joel 2:10, among other references, is cited: "In these passages the ‘sun’ 
signifies love, and the ‘moon’ faith, and ‘stars’ knowledges of good and truth. 
These are said to be darkened, to lose their light, and to fall from heaven, 
when they are no more. That the Lord is seen as a sun in heaven is evident 
also from His appearance when transfigured before Peter, James, and John."

evils from falsities and falsities from evils. Evils from falsities are with those 
who assume the falsities of religion, and confirm them till they appear as 
truths, and when they live according to them they do evils from falsities, or 
the evils of falsity…When light is extinguished, there comes darkness." Joel 
2:10 is cited as an example.



"In Joel…2:10…‘Earth and the heavens’ here, as often elsewhere, signify the 
church; ‘earth’ the external church, and ‘heavens’ the internal church. The 
external church means the worship from good and truth in the natural man; 
and the internal church, the good of love and the faith, which is in the 
spiritual man, from which is worship; for as there is an internal and external 
man, or a spiritual and a natural man, so is it with the church…A change and 
perversion of the church is signified by ‘the earth trembled, and the heavens 
quaked;’ ‘the sun and the moon were blackened’ signifies that there is no 
good of love or truth of faith, and ‘the stars withdrew their brightness’ 
signifies that there were no longer any knowledges of truth and good."

Canons, chapter IV [5]



In this passage, Joel 2:10 is cited as an example of the following: "The 
progression of the church to its end, and the end itself, are described in very 
many places in the Word."

Derived Doctrine

The direct teachings on Joel 2:10 are so complete that we have no need to use 
derived doctrine this time.

Putting It All Together

To get into the meaning of this verse, let’s think about end, cause, and effect. End 
relates to that which is first—love of the Lord. Cause relates to that which is of 

65

wisdom from the Lord. Effect relates to uses or the application of love and wisdom 
in life as shown by the Lord.

When love for the Lord (End), represented by the sun, is significantly perverted in 
the heart and mind of the church, consequences follow the pollution of that love. The
faith (Cause), represented by the moon, loses its light. From science classes, we have 
learned that the moon has no light of its own. The moon reflects the light of the sun. 
On the spiritual plane, it thus makes sense that if the spiritual sun is darkened by 
our actions or lack of love, the spiritual moon will be darkened. Since the earliest 
times, stars have been likened to knowledge. Reading the stars was a science among 
the ancients. When love darkens and faith loses its light, it follows that the stars will 
fall from the heavens. The loss of love leads to a loss of wisdom; darkness covers the 
way of faith, and without the stars, we lose the ability to chart the course of life’s 
voyage.

Lastly, let’s not overlook a quote found in AR 331: "…when the state of the church is 
perverted anywhere and there is change, there is an earthquake…these things are 
to be understood as being done in the spiritual world…not in the natural world…" 
(emphasis added). Implied in this quote is an "end, cause, and effect" challenge to 
the church and each individual within the church. We need to keep the sun of heaven
shining brightly. We need to seek out the Lord’s wisdom so the moon of our faith 
reflects the truths of the Word. Anything less perverts and pushes for changes in the 
alignment of the stars.

I can’t imagine how horrible and devastated our natural world would be without the 
sun, moon, and stars. Disorientation, psychotic feelings of hopelessness, and death 
would overtake life quickly. What must it be like within someone’s spiritual life 
when they purposefully choose to exclude the Lord from their daily life?

Questions to Stimulate Reflection

1. With a dozen direct quotes from the Writings, it appears that we should have 

little trouble understanding the meaning of Joel 2:10. Was this your 
experience? What did you get from this verse?

2. How much do you think the events of the world have caused "quakes" in the 

spiritual world, or vice versa?

66

3. When we make church policies, have you ever wondered about the long-term 
effects these policies might have on the life of the church? How can we guard 
against setting into motion things that might eclipse the sun of heaven?

4. The choice to exclude the Lord from our lives was addressed in our study of 

Joel 2:10. Have you come up with a mental picture of the darkness this causes 
within?

5. Having asked that question, let’s examine what we can do to protect the sun, 
moon, and stars of our spiritual life. Can a daily study regimen do us good? 
Will application of doctrine to life do it?

6. Lastly, the Writings teach us that thinking from END to CAUSE to EFFECT is 

the correct way to follow the Lord. Thinking from EFFECT to CAUSE to END is
the wrong way. Why would this be so?



"…where the coming of the Lord is treated of…His ‘army’ denotes truths

that doeth His word’ denotes one who does truth Divine."



"Their ‘strong ones,’ and ‘enemies,’ are the hells, for all there feel hatred



"That the angels are called ‘hosts’ is evident from the following passages. In 
Joel…2:11…The angels gathered together, or a company of them, is called ‘a 
host,’ because ‘the angels,’ the same as ‘hosts,’ signify Divine truths and goods,
because they are recipients of these from the Lord…"

Derived Doctrine

It would appear from the number of direct teachings we have for this passage that 
there is no need for us to seek additional help from derived doctrine. Therefore, we 
will move on to "putting it all together."

Putting It All Together

P&P states, "The Lord will fight with them." Who are the "them" mentioned in this 
verse?

 The hells are "them."
 Those who feel hatred toward the Lord are "them."
 Those who oppose His advent are "them."
 Those who are in a continual effort to assault the Word of the Lord are 

"them."

 The ‘strong ones’ and ‘enemies’ are the ‘them’ who cannot endure the Lord’s 

army.

What forces will the Lord draw together to wage war against "them," and what will 
be the result of this war?

 His "voice," which is truth Divine, will enlighten and perfect those who are in 

good and truth.

 His "voice" will devastate and terrify those who are in evil.
 The Lord’s "camp," His church, will become His "army." The "camp" and its 

"army" will have the finest armament of goods and truths.

 Angels, the hosts, whose faces look to the Lord and receive instruction from 

Him, will assist the church in the fight against "them."

Those of us who feel hell is out of control and running amok in this world need to 
recall the words the Lord spoke in Joshua 23:6. He presents a powerful challenge to 

69

choose this day whom we shall serve: "Therefore be very courageous to keep and
to do all that is written in the Book of the Law of Moses, lest you turn aside 
from it to the right hand or to the left…hold fast to the Lord your God…"

We need to remain confident that hell ("them") will be devastated, that they will 
tremble and not endure when the day of the Lord comes. For the "voice" of the 
Lord has said so.

Questions to Stimulate Reflection

1. Can you imagine the voice of the Lord calling together His army? Can you see 
the order of the camp? Do you remember Balaam’s reaction when he was on 
the mountain looking down on the order and arrangement of the tribes of 
Israel? The order of the encampment prevented him from pronouncing a 
curse on Israel.

2. The hellish forces, misjudging their strength and ability to overthrow the 

Lord, come to a devastating end. When will they, when will we, learn that hell 
has no power in the presence of the Lord?

3. Did this verse boost your level of courage? Did it make you feel the worth of 

fighting against "them"?

4. "This day is to the Lord Jehovih Zebaoth a day of vengeance, that He may take 
vengeance of His enemies" (Doctrine of the Lord 14 [4 & 5]). Do these words 
comfort the "army" and strike fear in "them"?

JOEL 2:12-17

"‘Now, therefore,’ says the Lord, ‘turn to Me with all your heart, with fasting, with 
weeping, and mourning.’ So rend your heart, and not your garments; return to the 
Lord your God, for He is gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness; 
and He relents from doing harm. Who knows if He will turn and relent, and leave a 
blessing behind Him—a grain offering and a drink offering for the Lord your God? 
Blow the trumpet in Zion, consecrate a fast, call a sacred assembly; gather the people, 
sanctify the congregation, assemble the elders, gather the children and nursing babes; 
let the bridegroom go out from his chamber, and the bride from her dressing room. Let
the priests, who minister to the Lord, weep between the porch and the altar; Let them 
say, ‘spare Your people, O Lord, and do not give Your heritage to reproach, that the 

70

nations should rule over them. Why should they say among the peoples, ‘Where is their 
God?’"

Passages From The Writings

P&P



"Exhortation to be converted to Him, to repent, and to be wise."

AC 588 [3]



"‘Repentings’ plainly denote great mercy. So in Joel…2:13…where also to 
‘repent’ manifestly denotes mercy."

AC 598 [3]



"That there is a distinction in the Word between ‘mercy’ and ‘grace’ is evident
from many passages where Jehovah is called ‘merciful and gracious’ (as in…
Joel 2:13)…That ‘grace’ relates to spiritual things, which are of faith, or of the 
understanding…and that ‘mercy’ relates to celestial things which are of love, 
or of the will…"

AC 10441 [4 & 5]



"…Jehovah is said to have ‘repented,’ when yet it cannot be that He repents, 
because He knows all things before He does them; from which it is evident 
that by ‘repenting’ is signified mercy…That ‘repenting,’ when said of Jehovah, 
denotes mercy, is plain in…Joel 2:13…"

AC 10577 [2]



"That ‘to show grace’ denotes to endow with spiritual truth and good, and ‘to 
show mercy’ to endow with celestial truth and good, is because ‘grace’ is 
predicated of faith, and ‘mercy’ of love; and…those who are in the Lord’s 
spiritual kingdom speak of ‘grace;’ and those who are in the Lord’s celestial 
kingdom speak of ‘mercy’…Unless there were such a difference between 
grace and mercy, it would not have been said, ‘show grace’ and ‘show mercy.’ 
From this it is that Jehovah is called ‘gracious and merciful." Joel 2:13 is cited 
as an example.

AE 340 [17]



"In Joel…2:14…‘blessing’ signifies spiritual blessing, which in general has 
reference to good and truth proceeding from the Lord and given to man, 
therefore it is said, ‘He will leave behind Him a blessing, a meal-offering and a

71

drink-offering to our God,’ ‘the meal-offering,’ which was bread, signifying 
good, and ‘the drink-offering,’ which was wine, signifying truth, both from the
Lord, for it is said, ‘from our God.’"

AC 5608 [7 & 9]



"In Joel…2:15, 16…‘elders’ denotes the wise; ‘babes and those that suck the 
breasts,’ the innocent…Man is so created that when he grows old and 
becomes like a little child, the innocence of wisdom conjoins itself with the 
innocence of ignorance which he had in infancy, and so he passes into the 
other life as a true infant."

AR 797



"By ‘a bridegroom,’ in the highest sense, is meant the Lord as to the Divine 
good; and by ‘a bride’ the church is meant as to the Divine truth from the 
Lord." Joel 2:16 is cited among many other passages from the Word.

AE 1189



"…so ‘bridegroom and the bride’ mean the conjunction of the Lord with the 
church, and also the conjunction of good and truth. Because all spiritual joy is
from that conjunction, it follows that ‘the voice of the bridegroom and the 
bride’ signifies the joy therefrom. Moreover, the angels have all their wisdom 
and intelligence, and thus all their joy and happiness from that conjunction…
This is the signification of ‘the voice of the bridegroom and bride,’…" Joel 2:16 
is cited.

Doctrine of Sacred Scripture 86



"That repetitions of the same thing occur in the Word on account of the 
marriage of good and truth, may be seen quite clearly from passages where 
‘nations’ and ‘peoples’ are mentioned…" Joel 2:17 is cited.

AR 483



"That ‘peoples’ signify those who are in truths or falsities of doctrine, and 
‘nations’ signify those who are in goods or in evils of life, may appear from 
many passages in the Word…Where ‘peoples’ and ‘nations’ are mentioned 
together…‘peoples’ relate to truth, and ‘nations’ to good." Joel 2:17 is cited.

TCR 251



"Nations and peoples are mentioned together, because by nations those are 
meant who are in good, and in the opposite sense those who are evil; and by 

72

‘peoples’ those are meant who are in truths…Therefore those who are of the 
Lord’s spiritual kingdom are called ‘peoples,’ and those who are of the Lord’s 
celestial kingdom are called ‘nations;’..." Joel 2:17 is cited as one of many 
representative passages.

Derived Doctrine

"Now, therefore, says the Lord, turn to Me with all your heart, with fasting, with 
weeping, and mourning."



Is "now" used as a means to mark a transition from one thought to the next? 
Or is "now" used with a sense of immediacy? The present time is always a 
good time to begin changing.

 To "turn" signifies to begin a period of reflection upon revelation, to diverge 









from what one had previously been thinking (AC 6836).
"Turn to Me" is a Divine directive from the Lord. The Lord is asking people to 
turn from thinking about themselves to thinking about the Lord, and to do so 
with all of their heart or love.
"Fasting" signifies doing something to get over an unhappy state when good 
is no longer conjoined with truths (AC 9182 [10]).
"Weeping" signifies both sorrow and joy (AC 5773). Thus, we need to be sorry
for the periods of our life when there was a separation or removal of truths 
and feel consolation, or joy, when truths are restored to our life by the Lord.
"Weeping and mourning" signify the grief of the soul and grief of heart; for 
weeping and mourning are representatives of the loss of truth and good (AE 
1164).

"So rend your heart, and not your garments…"



"Rending" signifies mourning on account of the destruction of truth or the 
absence of faith (AC 4763). It also signifies mourning because of the 
deprivation of Divine good and Divine truth (AC 9960).

 One’s "heart" signifies the will. AC 3813 [4] reminds us that the Own 

(proprium) residing in the heart needs to be emptied out so that it can be 
vivified. Ridding ourselves of the human proprium and taking on the Lord’s 
Proprium is a necessary work of regeneration. See Doctrine of Life 95-97.
"Garments" in the positive sense represent truth in its lowest form. 
"Garments" represent the truths of memory such as appear in the Word. See 
AC 9372 [8]. Are these truths what is meant in this passage?



"Return to the Lord your God, for He is gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and of 
great kindness…"



"Grace" and "mercy" were explained in AC 598 [3]. "Grace" relates to spiritual 
things, which are of faith and the understanding, and "mercy" relates to 

73



celestial things which are of love and the will. How do we get grace and 
mercy? By returning to the Lord with a willingness of heart and a sense of 
humility.
"Slow" signifies successive states of preparation (AC 4381). "Anger" signifies 
in the highest sense the zeal of the Lord to protect and save. The work of the 
Lord to overcome evil is a slow and successive preparation. It is a plan that 
will root out all the tentacles of hell with a zealous love for His flock.

 The "kindness," or unfailing love, of the Lord signifies the protection afforded 

by His interior and superior truths (AC 4391).

"…and he relents from doing harm."

 Please read AC 587. The Lord only appears to relent as He sees and provides 
all things from eternity. The Lord intends nothing but good. Evil resisting the 
Lord’s good ways calls His providential leading "doing harm." Evil projects 
itself in its image of the Lord, viewing His actions as interference with the 
way it seeks to have free rein and avoid abiding in His truth.

"Who knows if He will turn and relent, and leave a blessing behind him—a grain 
offering and a drink offering for the Lord your God?"

 Every day, in thousands of ways, the Lord’s Providence gifts us with blessings.
Most of the Lord’s blessings slip by our conscious sense of awareness. It’s 
only later while looking back on our life that we see dimly a finite portion of 
the loving ways the Lord blessed our life. Our lack of perception doesn’t stop 
the Divine benefactions. They flow on like a mighty river, carrying us in the 
"stream of Providence." Like the Psalmist, we can say "My cup runs over."

 A "grain offering" signifies interior goods and truths (AC 7112).


"Drink" signifies a spirit of inquiry to investigate things belonging to faith (AC
1071). "Drink" signifies to inquire whether truth can be conjoined or 
appropriated (AC 3089).
"Who knows" is a question that can broaden our spiritual awe of the Lord’s 
love for us.



"Blow the trumpet in Zion, consecrate a fast, call a sacred assembly…"

 A "trumpet" or horn signifies Divine truth about to be revealed out of 



heaven(AE 55 and 502).
"Zion" signifies the advent of the Lord and the establishment of the church by 
Him among those who are in the good of love (AE 433 [8]).

 To "consecrate" represents to prepare oneself for the Lord and to receive 

truth by good from Him (AC 10111).

 Fasting with consecrated efforts requires taking a spiritual inventory to see 
what spiritual goods and truths are lacking in life and application to uses.

74



"Assembly" signifies to set things in order, for goods and truths cannot be 
assembled if they are lacking order (AC 6338). A "sacred assembly" speaks 
clearly about what kind of order is needed.

"…gather the people, sanctify the congregation, assemble the elders, gather the 
children and nursing babes…"

 To "gather" signifies to store up truths in the memory (AC 679). To "gather" or
"assemble" signifies to excite to do combat (AR 707). To "gather" or "collect" 
signifies to procure (AC 6451).

 By "gather the people" is signified the gathering of truths. Depending on the 
meaning of the internal sense, "people" can represent evil truths or good 
truths(AR 483).

 Elders, children, and nursing babes are discussed in AC 5608 [7 & 9].

"…let the bridegroom go out from his chamber…"

 AC 4638 [4] describes the meaning of "bridegroom" as the Lord coming for 

judgment. AR 797 teaches that "in the highest sense," a bridegroom 
represents the Lord as to Divine good.

 A "chamber" signifies the church as to its goods (AC 3900 [1]).
 AC 9927 gives us a clue about the meaning of "going in and going out." 

Whatever belongs to motion, such as "walking," "going," or "advancing," 
signifies a state of life. "Going out" among "the ancients was a customary 
form of speaking to say that they knew a person’s coming in and his going 
out, or his entrance and his departure, when they meant that they knew 
every state of his life." Thus, they were talking about knowing the quality of a 
person’s good and truth in worship, and the thoughts and affections that 
flowed from worship into life. Now let’s apply this knowledge to the Lord. He 
knows our "coming in" and our "going out" with respect to His "judgment" as 
the bridegroom.

"…and the bride from her dressing room."

 A "bride" signifies the proprium being made new and vivified by the Lord (AC
155). A bridegroom signifies the Lord as to divine good, and a bride signifies 
the church as to divine truth from Him (AR 797).

 A "dressing room" is a place where one puts on clothes that are appropriate 

for the occasion. In this case, the bride is there to put on her wedding clothes. 
"A ‘wedding garment’ signifies the intelligence of the spiritual man, which is 
from the knowledges of truth and good; but ‘he that had not on a wedding 
garment’ signifies a hypocrite, who by a moral life counterfeits the spiritual 
life..." (AE 195 [11])
"Clothing" signifies memory-knowledges that support one’s external life (AC 
9003).



75

 To "clothe" a person signifies to instruct that person in truths (AE 240 [4]).
 NB: Clothing serves as a kind of protection for the body, keeping us warm and
helping us to look more attractive then we would without it. In the same way, 
our minds can be clothed and protected by good and truth. The Lord’s Word 
makes our minds much more interesting and attractive!

 The word "from" in this phrase ("from her dressing room") calls our attention
to AC 9927 again. "Motion" signifies a state of life, and also the quality of good 
and truth in one’s worship and application to life.

"Let the priests, who minister to the Lord, weep between the porch and the altar…"





"Let" means allow, permit, don’t impede, don’t obstruct, give, and offer 
assistance to another person.
"Priests" are to represent the Lord as to the Divine good in the work of 
salvation (AC 9809). The priests of Aaron and his sons, and the Levites, 
represent the work of salvation in successive order (AC 10017). Priests are to 
teach truth, and so lead to the good, and to the Lord (AC 10794).

 To "minister" signifies to serve and to mediate (AC 9419). To "minister" 

signifies to serve as a representative of the Lord (AC 9809). To "minister" 
signifies worship and preaching (AC 9925). To" minister" means to be called 
into warfare or military service because to minister represents the Lord’s 
work of salvation in removing evils and falsities from hell that are continually
fighting against goods and truths (AE 734 [14]).
"Weeping" in the positive sense signifies the Lord’s love and mercy. It is also a
sign of the Lord’s grief on account of the "night" state among His people as to 
the truths of faith in the church. See AC 2910. "Weeping" signifies both sorrow
and joy (AC 5873).



 A "porch" signifies exterior truths that lead to interior things (AC 7353). A 
"vestibule" signifies truths leading to goods, which in turn reveal more 
interior truths (AC 9659 [5]).

 An "altar" signifies the Lord and the holy element in worshipping Him (AC 

4541). An "altar" signifies the falsities from evil, which are to be 
dissipated(AC 10642). An "altar" signifies the preparation of the Lord’s 
Human Divine for undergoing the last degrees of temptation (AC 2811). 
Lastly, this idea regarding an altar of incense: it signifies the grateful hearing 
and reception by the Lord of all the elements of worship that are from love 
and charity (AC 10176).

 Weeping between the porch and the altar signifies having preparation for 

conjunction of truth and good (AC 10237a).

"Let them say, ‘spare Your people, O Lord, and do not give Your heritage to reproach, 
that the nations should rule over them…’"

 Let (permit) them to say…To "say" sometimes signifies "to perceive" and 

sometimes "to think" because saying involves both (AC 2619).

76








"Spare" signifies intercession from love (AC 2253) and also salvation (AC 
2262). "Spare" signifies the destruction of falsities before they are 
confirmed(AE 573 [11]).
"Heritage" signifies the truths of the good in the natural man (AE 714 [25]).
"Reproach" is translated as shame or disgrace. "Shame" signifies lacking the 
power to resist evils and falsities (AC 10481). "Shame" signifies having no 
power to resist evils from the proprium (AE 654 [59]). "Shame" is said to 
those who will be of the Lord’s New Church to encourage them to learn truths
and to retain them (AR 706).
"Nations from afar," although not the exact wording of our passage, has an 
interesting signification. It signifies falsity from evil, or that of the sensuous 
person, destroying truths (AE 724 [27]). "Nations" signify evils of the will, or 
lusts, while "people" signify falsities of the understanding, or persuasions (AC
622).

 To "rule" signifies having a degree of dominion. What kind? Is it the dominion

of freedom from the Lord or the dominion of slavery from hell?

"Why should they say among the peoples, ‘Where is their God?’"

 A believer’s understanding alone is incomplete and subject to a host of false 
conclusions. Love and wisdom, working together, make it possible for us to 
achieve a conjunction with the Lord. "People" signify falsities or persuasions 
from the understanding. So, based on this understanding, we can perhaps see
why the people came up with the question: "Where is their God?" The Lord 
taught us in the Beatitudes "Blessed (Happy) are the pure in heart for they 
shall see God." Two people looking at the same scripture—one a believer 
and one an unbeliever—will not see the same thing. The believer will say 
"there is God!" The unbeliever will say "where is your God? I don’t see Him."

Putting It All Together

P&P sums up the prophecy of Joel 2:12-17 by saying it is an "Exhortation to be 
converted to Him, to repent, and to be wise."

This is a directive from the Lord and not Joel. The directive comes with a mission 
plan:

1. Turn to the Lord with all your heart. This is a call for our total commitment to

the Lord.

2. The command to consecrate a fast means we are to take an inventory of the 
spiritual resources at our disposal. If a significant shortage is detected, we 
need to weep and mourn over the deficiencies found. But then something has 
to be done to restock. We need to supplicate the Lord for His help. We need to
desire a new life with new resources.

77

3. Rending one’s heart and not one’s garments is a call to do the work of the 

Lord from substance and not form. This can also be seen as a call for action 
and not words. We are to walk the walk of love and not the walk of talk.

4. Why should people return to the Lord? His way is gracious and merciful. His 
way is not the way of anger. It is a way of great kindness. Hell loves all that is 
ungracious and unmerciful. Hell’s way is full of anger and has a plan of 
destructive domination.

5. Be prepared. Enlist in the military service of the Lord and His church. Hell 
will engage us in warfare. Don’t fear the battle. The Lord’s Intelligence and 
Love is sufficient to battle all disorders.

6.

In preparation for what is to come, gather together the love of innocence and 
the wisdom of innocence so that a marriage, or conjugial conjunction, may 
take place.

7. The pure in heart shall see God. That which is invisible will become visible.

8. Those who see the Lord have the assurance that they will not be among the 
lost and confused who ask "Where is your God?" The committed solider of 
the Lord knows the ways of the Lord and confidently walks in them.

Read and Review

Read the selection from P&P.

Read Joel 2:12-17.

Questions to Stimulate Reflection

1. Does the Lord’s plan ask too much of us? Is it possible for us to give Him our 

whole heart, mind, and soul?

2. Self-examination, making one’s self guilty, supplicating the Lord for help, and 
living a new life are the components of a well-known process we are taught 
about in the Writings. This portion of Joel certainly illustrates that it is a 
consistent plan of the Lord’s. The Writings urge us to follow this plan once or 
twice a year just prior to Holy Supper. Do we follow this suggested plan?

3. AE 734 [14] calls for our enlistment in the Lord’s military service. He advises 
us that warfare will incur. I did not hear in His plan a call for negotiations. It is
to be a battle where only one outcome is predicted. The Lord will overcome 
the hells. Do we ever try to "bargain" or negotiate a peaceful settlement with 
hell? What is the result?

78

4. The gift of seeing God is a promise in the declaration of the New Church. That 
which is invisible will become visible. Do you find the Lord is clearly seen at 
all times, or do you find it necessary to keep refreshing your view of the 
Lord? How do you do this? TCR mentions that the Word of the Lord is like a 
mirror in which we see the image of the Lord. Such a teaching makes it a 
necessity to read the Word with a degree of consistency. Our hope is that a 
project such as this one will assist in your pursuit of daily "mirrors" in which 
to see God.

5. Do you come in contact with those who ask "Where is your God?" What 

happens when you do?

JOEL 2:18-19

"Then the Lord will be zealous for His land, and pity His people. The Lord will answer 
and say to His people, ‘Behold, I will send you grain and new wine and oil, and you will 
be satisfied by them; I will no longer make you a reproach among the nations.”

Passages From The Writings

P&P



"The Lord will establish the church, to which He will give its goods and 
truths..."

AC 8875 [1, 6, & 7]



"…the zeal of the Lord, which in itself is love and compassion, appears to 
[those in falsity] as anger; for when the Lord from love and mercy protects 
His own in heaven, they who are in evil are indignant and angry against the 
good and rush…with the endeavor to destroy…‘the zeal of the house of 
Jehovah’ denotes His love toward those who receive good and truth…the zeal 
of the Lord protects the good…" Joel 2:18 is cited among other passages as an 
example of this truth.

AE 433 [27]



"…it can be seen how far from the truth those have wandered, who believe 
that at the end of time the Jews will be converted to the Lord and brought 
back into the land of Canaan…because they have known nothing of the 
spiritual sense of the Word…In these passages those also are meant who 
were to be brought into the church, and thence into heaven from the earth 
after the Lord came, not only where the Christian religion is received but 
everywhere else. "Joel 2:18-27 is cited among many other passages.

79

Derived Doctrine

"Then the Lord will be zealous for His land, and pity His people."

 AC 8875 teaches that "zealous" means love and compassion. "Land" 

represents where the doctrine of love and charity reside in the church (AC 
2571). "Land" also represents the internal spiritual person, for that is where 
the church is (AE 365 [41]).
"Pity" or "compassion" signifies the inflow of charity from the Lord (AC 6737).
"Compassion" signifies the influx of the Lord into those who are ignorant of 
truths and yet desire them (AC 9182 [7]).



"The Lord will answer and say to His people…"



"Answer" has some very interesting representations. "Answer" signifies 
reciprocity when assent is given (AC 2919). "Answer" signifies influx, 
inspiration, perception, and information. "Answer" also signifies mercy and 
aid. See AE 295 [6] and AE 471 [2].

 When we read in the Word that "Jehovah said," it signifies that He perceives 
from the Divine Celestial (AC 2619). When "said" is predicated of Jehovah, it 
signifies to inform by divine truth from the literal sense of the Word (AC 
8041).

"Behold, I will send you grain and new wine and oil…"

 The word "behold" means to have or to keep in sight, to look at, to watch, to 
observe, or survey and discern. Which of these synonyms should we use 
when seeking the signification of behold? AC 2329, 2770, 3495, and 3711 all 
use one or more of these words to say they represent thought and reflection, 
acknowledgment and confession of the Lord. Proper "beholding" brings us 
into the presence of the Lord.
"Send" signifies something being revealed by the Lord through heaven to 
those who are in the good of love (AE 8 [2] and AR 5).
"Grain," "barley," "wheat," and the like denote interior truths and goods (AC 
7112).





 AC 3941 [4] quotes Joel 1:10, 11, 13: "The field has been laid waste, the ground
has been mourning because the grain has been laid waste, the new wine has 
failed, the oil languishes. It is evident to anyone that here the state of the 
church when it is vastated is what is described…‘the field,’ ‘the ground’ means
the church, the ‘grain’ its good, and the ‘new wine’ its truth."
"Oil" has many uses. There is oil for cooking, oil for anointing, and oil for 
lamps. In general, "oil" signifies the good of love or charity to the neighbor 
from the Lord (AC 10, AC 261, and AE 375 [24-26]).
Is it a surprise to you that the Lord sends new "grain," new "wine," and new 
"oil" when He establishes His new church? The former church ended with the





80

four kinds of locust ravenously stripping the land. There was a drying up of 
the grain, the wine, and the oil. There was turmoil and shock the likes of 
which had never been seen. Then came a new beginning with the Lord’s zeal 
providing for the new start for His church. Look now at the next part of this 
verse.

"And you will be satisfied by them."

 To be "satisfied" signifies to enjoy peace and good from mercy (AE 146). 

"Satisfy" signifies that all spiritual nourishment is from the Lord and that as 
much is given as one wills (AC 8410).

"I will no longer make you a reproach among nations."

 To remove "reproach" signifies that the affection of internal truth will no 

longer be barren or dead (AC 3969). The Lord promised the removal of shame
and disgrace from the church. The torn, the tattered, the tired elements of the
church were going to be removed—replaced with a new vitality by the Lord. 
Dignity, respectability, honor, and wholesomeness would infill the doctrines 
and all of the forms of worship and uses.

Putting It All Together

P&P summarizes the meaning of Joel 2:18-19 with these words:

"The Lord will establish the church, to which He will give its goods and truths…"

The direct teachings and the derived doctrine add a degree of warmth, compassion, 
zeal, protection, mercy, feeding, and restoration and a grand sense of hope to this 
summary from P&P. In place of the swarming locust and the barren fields in Chapter 
One, this portion of the prophecy offers the news that there will be a full crop of 
grain, new wine, and flowing oil once again.

As with every Old Testament prophet we study, Joel’s prophecy begins with a bleak 
synopsis of the trouble the church got itself into by ignoring, twisting, and misusing 
the literal sense of the Word. As a consequence of this failure to learn from the literal
sense, the heart of the church lost its conjunction with the Lord and, blinded, 
couldn’t find its way to the light of heaven. Falsity needed to be emptied out. The 
church had to confess its evils as sins against the Lord. The church needed to admit 
its guilt and genuinely supplicate the Lord for help. Most importantly, the church had
to want the new life that was based on the Lord’s way.

Satisfaction is promised by the Lord. There will be an enjoyment of peace and good 
from the Lord’s mercy. Reproaches will not follow the revitalized church. Nurturing 
will be accommodated to the individual level and need of all in the church. 

81

Wholesomeness of doctrine and uses will flow out of the hearts of the people in the 
Lord’s New Church.

As I wrote these things, I felt a sense of joy and hope that I might be part of such a 
grand awakening and restoration of the church. How about you? Did you want to say
"How long O Lord?" Well, maybe our prayerful wish for these things to come to pass 
is an important step within the stream of Providence. It could be that the Lord wants
more of us to feel this way so that He can usher in a church whose grain, wine, and 
oil is definitely new.

Questions to Stimulate Reflection

1. Did you find yourself challenged with a sense of hope and consolation?

2. Was the bleak theme of the opening chapter replaced with a new song of 

"This is the day that the Lord has made"?

3. New grain, new wine, and new oil—does any example of these gifts come to 

mind?

4. What kind of "putting it all together" would you have written for this section?

JOEL 2:20

"But I will remove far from you the northern army, and will drive him away into a 
barren and desolate land, with his face toward the eastern sea and his back toward the
western sea; his stench will come up, and his foul odor will rise, because he has done 
monstrous things.”

Passages From The Writings

P&P



"…and will remove falsities of evil, and thus hell."

82

AE 422 [16]



"In that day signifies His coming, and the ‘eastern sea’ signifies the last limit 
toward the east in the spiritual world, at which there was no reception of 
Divine truth before the Lord’s coming, but where there was reception when 
Divine truth proceeded from His Divine Human. That the ultimates in the 
spiritual world are like seas may be seen above (n. 342b, c); and that there 
are dry places and wastes there may be seen in Joel (2:20)."

Coronis 56



"From all these passages [Joel 2:20 is one of them] it may be seen what 
‘vastation’ and ‘desolation’ are; and that it is not a vastation and desolation of 
the peoples of a land, and of cities, but of the goods and truths of the church, 
whence there is nothing but evils and falsities."

Derived Doctrine

"But I will remove far from you the northern army…"

 Please note the definite sense of the opening. It is not "I may," nor is it "I 
might," but it is "I will." This same definiteness is carried throughout the 
whole of this twentieth verse of Joel.

 To "move" signifies to turn away from error (AC 6290). To "move" also means 







to "cut off."
"Far" in the spiritual world is not marked off in measurable distances. 
Instead, it represents a remoteness of spirit (AC 9261). Thus, it seems the 
Lord is teachings us that evil and falsity will be removed from His church. 
They will be pushed to the remote or furthest limits of heaven.
"Army," in the positive sense, signifies the truths and goods that protect the 
church. "Army," in the negative sense, represents the self-justifying falsities 
and evils that destroy the church. See AR 862. AE 573 [2] gives us the same 
representation.
"Northern" signifies those who are out of the church and in darkness as to the
truths of faith, and also the relative darkness in people (AC 1605). "Northern" 
signifies what is sensuous and natural (AC 426 [2]). "Northern" signifies those
who are in obscurity as to truth because they do not have the Word (AE 401 
[28]).

"…and [I] will drive him away into a barren and desolate land."



"Drive" signifies to put away with strength and power (AC 7189). To "drive 
away" signifies that evil and falsities will be separated from every truth of the
church (AC 386).

83






"Barren," in a positive sense, represents those who recognize they are not in 
the Word and long for its truths. In the negative sense, "barren" represents a 
picture of evil and falsities in an idolatrous worship with no capacity to 
reproduce itself any further. See AC 1371-1372.
"Desolate" signifies evil without any visible truth (AC 6141).
"Land" represents the church, the internal man, and the doctrine of love and 
charity where the faith of the church resides (AC 2571).

 And who is the "I" in this verse? The Lord God Jesus Christ, the One God of 

heaven and earth.

"…with his face toward the eastern sea and his back toward the western sea…"











"Face" signifies the interior things, or thoughts and affections within the 
internal man. The Lord beholds the internal face and not the external face. 
See AC 4299.
"Face toward the eastern sea…" represents the last limits in the spiritual 
world where there was no reception of Divine truth prior to the coming of the
Lord(AE 422 [16]). Could these words represent the falsities that were 
brought into the spiritual world prior to the advent of the Lord? The thick 
dark clouds of falsity, prior to the advent, entering in from the World of 
Spirits, needed to be turned away from the face of all people. The true east 
became clear when the Lord made His advent. He came to show heaven and 
earth the true, inner, source of light from the East.
"Sea" signifies a collection of spiritual and natural knowledges in the 
memory(AC 28 and AC 991).
"Back," in the positive sense, signifies the externals of the Word, the church, 
and worship (AC 10584). "Back" signifies the subordination of voluntary 
(love) things (AC 8194). In the negative sense, "back" signifies a denial of the 
Lord God, and this was one of the abominations of the decadent Jerusalem 
(AE 401 [32]). "Back" signifies departing from truth by not wanting to 
understand the Word (AC 6401).
"West" signifies those who are in self-love and interior thick darkness who 
think themselves wise (SE 5676). "West" signifies faith separated from 
charity because of the evils of life (AE 316 [16]). AC 7702 describes "…the 
signification of a ‘sea’ or west ‘wind’ as being the cessation of Divine influx 
through heaven…"

"…his stench will come up, and his foul odor will rise, because he has done monstrous 
things."

 Those who oppose the Lord and His truth give off an odor of decay (death), a 

stink, a stench of aversion and abomination (AC 4516).

 The "foul odor", in the Writings, is coupled with the word "cupidities." "Foul" 
is linked with cesspools, excrement, and many other horrible stenches. 
Essentially, the "foul" hells are made up of people who have wholly engrossed

84



themselves in the pursuit of their own pleasure. See AC 1, 285, and 540 for 
examples of the "foul."
"Monstrous things," or forms, are graphically presented in the Writings by 
faces. There are faces that are devoid of life. There are faces that are sunken, 
faces twisted because of their hatred toward the Lord, faces that take on the 
forms of hatred, cruelty, deceit, adultery, and hypocrisy. But in their own light,
the spirits with these grotesque faces see themselves as attractive because of 
their own fantasies (AC 4798). Sadly, these monstrous forms want to get away
from the Lord, so they cast themselves headlong into hell. The deeper the 
hell, the better. See AC 5057.

Putting It All Together

In light of this verse, is there any doubt about what the Lord will do for His church?

1. He will remove the northern army far from the church. The Lord will remove 
the self-justifying falsities and evils that destroy a church. Those who turned 
their back to the true East will have their shallow wisdom exposed.

2. The Lord promises to remove the non-productive things of idolatry that carry
with them no potential usefulness for the future. Idolatry and barrenness are 
a spiritually sad end—cause—effect choice of the heart and mind.

3. Without the Lord’s advent, the collection of knowledges (seas) would have 

held the minds of people in a state of denial regarding the Lord. Without the 
Lord, there would have been a "wanting" to know and understand the Word 
without fulfillment of this desire.

4. Without the day of the Lord and His judgment, the dead church would have 
continued giving off its stench of aversion, abomination, and self-serving 
cupidities. These attitudes and ways of life put on the face of respectability, 
but they represented a fantasy world. The Lord saw the reality of their faces. 
To His eyes, their faces were masks of monstrous forms of hatred, cruelty, 
deceit, adultery, and hypocrisy. Before the Lord’s advent, those who lived 
contrary to the Lord lived "wholly engrossed in the pursuit of their own 
pleasure." No more. It is over. How do we know this will be so? The great "I 
will" has said so, and He keeps His word.

Questions to Stimulate Reflection

1.

Is there any doubt in your mind that the end of the dead church has come 
about and that a New Church will come?

2. What monstrous masks are you aware of? Do you think these masks continue

to fool people into mistaking them for forms of respectability?

3. AC 5056 said something sad about those who vehemently oppose the Lord. 
They cast themselves into hell. The deeper the hell, the better. Can you 
picture someone so opposed to the Lord that they would choose the deepest 
hell? That is a lot of hate.

4.

Is there a growing sense of the "good news" for the church in our study of 
Joel? Are we finished hearing about the disorders of the church? Do you 
suppose we might have some more overturning of church disorders before a 
flurry of positive things finishing the prophecy of Joel?

5. Well, looking ahead to the next five verses, we can expect more good news 
about the restoration of the internal church. "Fear not," "Be glad," and 
"Rejoice" are some of the messages ahead. Are we ready for these 
encouraging words from the Lord to help us with our travails?

JOEL 2:21-25

"Fear not, O land; be glad and rejoice, for the Lord has done marvelous things! Do not 
be afraid, you beasts of the field; for the open pastures are springing up, and the tree 
bears its fruit; the fig tree and the vine yield their strength. Be glad then, you children 
of Zion. And rejoice in the Lord your God; for He has given you the former rain 
faithfully, and He will cause the rain to come down for you—the former rain, and the 
latter rain in the first month. The threshing floors shall be full of wheat, and the vats 
shall overflow with new wine and oil. So I will restore to you the years that the 
swarming locust has eaten, the crawling locust, the consuming locust and the chewing 
locust, My great army which I sent among you."

great things;’ therefore ‘the beasts of His fields’ mean those who are in the 
affections of good and long for instruction from the Word, ‘beasts’ meaning 
those who are in the affections of good belonging to the natural man, and 
‘fields’ the doctrinals from the Word."

Coronis 3 [2]



"That the states of the church are likewise described in the Word by beasts…
is evident from numberless passages…[Joel 2:21 and 22 are cited.]…Hence it

My fields?’ ‘The habitations of the desert are made full of herbs’ signifies that 
with such there will be knowledges of truth where there were none before, 
‘the habitations of the wilderness’ meaning the interiors of the mind of those 
in whom these did not exist before, ‘full of herbs’ signifying the increase and 
multiplication of these; ‘for the tree beareth her fruit, the fig-tree and the vine
shall yield their strength,’ signifies that they have natural good and spiritual 
good, ‘strength’ here meaning the production of fruit."



"In Joel…2:23, 24…‘The sons of Zion’ signify those who are in genuine truths

the Lord with such flows in with the good of love, and from that good into 
truths, is signified by ‘He shall give them the former rain in righteousness;’ 
‘righteousness’ is predicated in the Word of the good of love, and ‘the 
righteous’ mean those who are in that good…That the Lord continually flows 
into truths with the good of love is signified by ‘He shall cause to come down

truths and goods of the church…‘locust and caterpillar’ signify the falsities 
[and evils] of the sensual man."

Derived Doctrine

With twenty-seven references covering Joel 2:21-25, it seems we have enough 
exposition to go to the Putting It All Together section. Every major point seems to 
have been addressed.

Putting It All Together

We need to focus on the theme of restoration and compensation. Why? In Joel 1:4, 
the four kinds of locust stripped the land of its vegetation. The land, the grain, the 
vine, the fig-tree, the new wine, and the oil dried up. Never in the lifetime of those 
witnessing these things had they seen anything like it. Joy and gladness left the 
people with the shriveling seeds, the stripped branches, the dried-up clods of grass, 
the broken barns, and the cattle groaning. All of these things represented the demise
of the vastated church. Those who had ignored and twisted the Word were being 
replaced by the Lord. The church needed to be vivified by the Lord.

Those who in their hearts loved the good of truth and the truth of good would be 
brought to the forefront of the Lord’s new church. Don’t let these terms slip by you. 
Good of truth and truth of good are terms the Writings use to show how a person 
approaches the Word with charity and uses for the Lord and the neighbor.

Let’s look first at good of truth. In place of good, put the word love. In place of 
truth, put the word wisdom. Now we have the love of wisdom. The emphasis of 
this approach is to let love lead to wisdom. Now let’s do the same thing with truth of
good. For truth, use the word wisdom. For good, once again use love. Now we have 
the wisdom of love.

The good of truth (love of wisdom) is the approach of the celestial angels. The truth 
of good (wisdom of love) is the approach of the spiritual angels. The two approaches
are mutually inclusive. They work toward a wholesome conjunction with the Lord 
through the study of His Word. The love of wisdom has an intuitive aspect to it. It’s a 
love that knows the truth instantly when the truth from the Word is read. The 

91

wisdom of love is a more rational approach where the understanding seeks to be 
enlightened by a love for the Lord and His Word.

Why do we need to know these things? Because the Lord, in these verses, announces
that He will restore the church, the grass, the fig-tree, the new wine, and oil through 
these two angelic approaches. Please read again AE 644 [15] to see that this is so.

The Lord needs both—good of truth and truth of good—for the building up of the 
new church. Never allow the hells to engage you in an argument as to which of these 
is better. We are not to choose one over the other. It is not an either/or question. The
church grows when both thrive for the Lord and His church. Fear not; do not be 
afraid; rejoice; He will restore the years of the consuming locust. Compensation 
comes from the Lord. Our job is to sing in our hearts the words, "All that the Lord has
spoken we will do and hear."

Questions to Stimulate Reflection

1. Did you read all twenty-seven references in preparation for understanding 

the spiritual sense?

2. How well can you distinguish the good of truth and the truth of good? If you 

are still unsure about these terms, read Doctrine of Life 32.

3. Have you listened to or participated in a debate regarding the importance of 
love and wisdom? Some feel love is primary. Others feel truth is primary. 
Doesn’t hell just love to get us arguing about such things to divide us?

4. Think about restoration and compensation with the former rain and latter 

rain restoring life to the plants, animals and mankind. What does this mean? 
We are taught that the former rain signifies the Lord flowing in with the good 
of love, and from that good into truths—the former rain is righteousness. 
What then is the latter rain? Could the latter rain be the tranquility of peace 
when the Lord made His advent and defeated the hells? Could the latter rain 
be that sense of calm when combat ceases with the Lord winning out over 
hell?

5. Are you still basking in the light of this prophecy about the strength and 

power of the New Church?

92

6. The words "do not fear"; "do not be afraid"; "rejoice"; and "restoration" are 
words of comfort and encouragement. Can we somehow tell people in the 
church about this message of Joel?

JOEL 2:26-27

"You shall eat in plenty and be satisfied, and praise the name of the Lord your God, 
who has dealt wondrously with you; and My people shall never be put to shame. Then 
you shall know that I am in the midst of Israel: I am the Lord your God and there is no 
other. My people shall never be put to shame."

Passages From The Writings

P&P

 We must preface this quote with what was started in verses 21-25: "They will
have trust in the Lord, from which they will have goods and felicities…" The 
portion for the present verses is "…and acknowledgment from the heart."

AR 809



"…[that] ‘to praise God’ signifies to worship Him, and hence that the praise of 
Him is the worship of Him, is evident from many passages in the Word, a few 
only of which are adduced…" Joel 2:26 is cited.

Derived Doctrine

"You shall eat in plenty and be satisfied…"






"Eat" signifies to communicate, to be conjoined, and to appropriate (AC 2343).
In "plenty," or in "abundance," signifies the external knowledges to which 
good from the celestial level of the spiritual person can be applied, during 
states when truths and goods are multiplied. See AC 5192 and 5292. These 
numbers explain the meaning of the seven years of abundance in Egypt.
"Satisfied" signifies that all spiritual nourishment is from the Lord and that as
much is given as one wills (AC 8410).

"…and praise the name of the Lord your God."



"Praise" signifies internal worship (AC 1171 [3]). "Praise" comes when there 
is a love of truth (AC 3880 [5]). "Praise" is given by the Lord through 
innocence(AC 5236 [4]).

93

 The "name of the Lord" is the sum of all by which the Lord is worshiped, 
consequently His name is the essence of everything of love and faith (AC 
2724).
"…the Lord your God…" When both "God" and "the Lord" are named, divine 
good and divine truth are signified. For where Divine Good is meant, the 
names "Lord" and "Jehovah" are used, and where Divine Truth is meant, the 
name God is used. See AE 689.



"Who has dealt wondrously with you…"

 No correspondences come to mind with these words. What could be of value 
is to recall all of the miracles the Lord provided in the wilderness experience 
and the miracles of the Lord in the New Testament. These things He 
wondrously gave the children of Israel, and the effects of them live on to 
eternity.

"…and My people shall never be put to shame."





"People" in the spiritual sense represent the church, the good and truth of the
Lord’s Word (AC 1259-60 and AC 5342). In other words, the Lord’s "family" of 
good and truth will not be put to shame.
"Shame" signifies the presence of unclean loves (AR 706). This number goes 
on to encourage us to learn the truths of the Lord and to retain them.

"Then you shall know that I am in the midst of Israel…"

 The "midst," or middle, signifies what is inmost and primary, the best and 



purest things. The "midst" is perfection and purity. See AC 9666.
"Israel" in the supreme sense is the Lord in relation to the internal of the 
church (AE 768 [15] and AC 4570).

"I am the Lord your God and there is no other. My people shall never be put to shame."

 Can we not, on our own, draw all of the above points together in this verse to 

get the meaning?

 The Lord is the center of the church. He is our purity and highest perfection. 
His miraculous deeds are infinite. The hells will never be able to use their 
falsity to tarnish His Love and Wisdom. His people, His Church, will never be 
put to shame.

Putting It All Together

Do we really need to pull this section together? The message is so simple and 
straightforward. The days of hell polluting the church are over. The days of hell 
making the church feel ashamed are over. We need to repeat this phrase again and 

94

again. IT IS OVER. IT IS OVER. The Lord’s New Church will reign for ever and ever. 
"They will have trust in the Lord, from which they will have goods and felicities and
acknowledgment from the heart." (P&P)

Questions to Stimulate Reflection

1. Can we, the next time the hells try to embarrass us, pull this lesson into the 
"midst" of our thinking? Can we say the words, "His People, His Church will 
never be put to shame"?

2. These words will put the hells to flight. Hell can’t stand to be in the presence 
of the Lord’s sphere. His wondrous miracles exist in our lives. Do we ever 
allow ourselves enough time to think about the miracles in our lives and then 
thank the Lord for them? Or do we slip into feeling sorry for ourselves?

3. The miracles of life are manifold. Each miracle is personal. They spill out in 
many ways and places. We touch the lives of others in ways we have no idea 
about unless someone tells us.

4. Do you think a church banner ought to be created with this message as its 
contribution to church events such as Charter Day or New Church Day?

JOEL 2:28-29

"And it shall come to pass afterward that I will pour out My Spirit on all flesh; your 
sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your old men shall dream dreams, your young
men shall see visions. And also on My menservants and on My maidservants I will pour 
out My Spirit in those days."

Derived Doctrine

"…it shall come to pass afterward…"



"Pass" signifies what relates to the will and understanding (AC 683). To "pass 
through" signifies to know and to perceive the quality (AC 3992).

 The word "afterward" is not a past-tense correspondence. AC 5216 gives us a 
clue about the possible meaning of "afterward". "…‘after’ denotes what is 
successive in time; in the spiritual world, and consequently in the spiritual 
sense, there is no notion of time, but instead of it the kind of state that 
corresponds."

Putting It All Together

"By His Divine the Lord will fill those who are of that church, with all things, 
and vivify them" (P&P)

The Lord’s spirit, His Holy Spirit, will be poured out on all. He will help all to 
understand and teach the truths of doctrine; He will open the way to receive 
revelation and to perceive doctrine. He will increase within the church the number 
of people who will have a spiritual affection for truth and good; wisdom and 

97

intelligence will sparkle with a radiance of His love and wisdom; and we shall all be 
vivified—made alive like never before. A feeling of mental youth and agility will be 
ours because the Lord gives us truth both immediately and mediately. Gone will be 
the control of the corporeal selfishness crowding out spiritual priorities. He 
promises vivification of mind and soul to the church.

"And all the people shall answer and say, ‘Amen!’" (Deuteronomy 27:15)

"Your throne, O God, is forever and ever." (Psalm 45:2)

blessed be His glorious name forever! And let the whole earth be filled with His 
glory. Amen and Amen." (Psalm 72:18-20)

Questions to Stimulate Reflection

1. What reaction did you have when you read the passages of our lesson? Do 
you recall hearing these verses being read in a church service? Do you 
remember what feelings you had about their message?

2. There is a calm sphere with these words. There is a sense of peace and an 
assurance that all is right with us because the Lord is in charge. Does any 
resistance to this vision surface from the "corporeal" person?

3. Our positive theme carries on. Our encouragement to look for the spiritual 
New Church is in this prophecy. How can we pray for the Holy Spirit to be 
poured out on us? Should we be praying to receive revelation and the ability 
to perceive revelation?

4.

In answer to these questions, I would hope we all will say—so may it be 
evermore—Amen.

Derived Doctrine

"And I will show wonders in the heavens and in the earth…"

 The word "wonders" is not given a doctrinal explanation. "Wonder" is. 
"Wonder" signifies that with the Lord all things are possible (AC 2211). 
"Wonder" signifies awe and admiration (AC 1756 [3]).
"Heaven" signifies the spiritual and celestial things of the Lord’s kingdom 
both in the heavens and on earth, in the church and every human being (AC 
2162 [8]).



Putting It All Together

"Falsities of evil and evils of falsity will dissipate influx on the day of 
judgment."(P&P)

The meaning of the word "dissipate" is to scatter aimlessly, to break up, to squander, 
to waste away. With the day of the Lord coming to bring about the consummation of 
the dead church, hell musters together a massive covert plan to be covered or 
hidden in a huge black cloud of smoke called falsity and evil. Hell’s goal is to 
interrupt, to destroy, and to scatter aimlessly any influx of the Lord from heaven. 
Will it work? Not if we look at the opening words of the Lord. "I will show wonders 
in the heavens and in the earth." Even though hell frantically blows black and 
billowing smoke from its fiery, glowing ovens, the Lord will not be deterred. The 
blackness of their hearts is clear as day to Him. So the wonders of the heavens and 
the earth will be shown by the Lord. In the presence of the Lord, there will be signs 
of awe and admiration of His power. For with Him, all things are possible.

The hellish spirits will seek to turn the sun into darkness and the moon into blood. 
They want the "sun" of the Word to be falsified and its good adulterated. They want 
the "moon" of our faith falsified and violated so truth looks like evil and evil looks 
like truth.

But it will not work. Pass on the good news. The Lord will rid the church of evil and 
falsity and will establish His New Church.

Questions to Stimulate Reflection

1. Let’s talk about the purpose of smoke screens. The purpose of a smoke 

screen, militarily, is concealment and to permit stealth-like tactics. When the 
smoke is thick, the people on the other side of the smoke can’t see or focus on
the alignment or movement of their foe. There is an element of terrifying 
suspense involved. It’s like a psychological torture. Our passage describes a 
hellish attempt at concealment to prevent the Lord’s influx from coming to 
us. Do you get the sense of hell’s plan?

2. Has hell ever given you a temporarily blackened sun? Have you had a time or 
incident that just shook your faith in the Lord? Did someone you trusted ever 
let you down, and did you feel like your world was collapsing?

3. Have you ever been taught a falsity as a truth or a truth as a falsity? What 

happened?

4. Hell wants us to give up on the Lord and the New Church. If we focus on 
persons in the church and not the principles of the church, we can have 
momentary "black-outs." Therefore, we need to create times to let the Lord 
show us the wonders of heaven and earth. What ways of seeing the Lord’s 
power and awe work best for you? Is it a walk in the beauty of nature? Is it 
the presence of a child? Is it spending time with your best friend? Is it reading
the Word? Is it listening to music? Is it writing a letter or poetry?

5. Please take a moment to reflect on how many times in this chapter the Lord 
says "I will." These positive words are full of assurance and a source of 
encouragement.

JOEL 2:32

"And it shall come to pass that whoever calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved. 
For in Mount Zion and in Jerusalem there shall be deliverance, as the Lord has said, 
among the remnant whom the Lord calls."

"…but those who acknowledge and worship the Lord will be saved."

AC 5897 [5 & 6]



"…man is continually among evils and falsities, and is held in captivity by 
them…Therefore unless the Lord were to gather up the goods and truths 
which as occasion offers are insinuated into a man during the progress of life,
the man could not possibly be saved, for without remains there is salvation 
for none…From this…it is manifest that by ‘remains’ are meant…goods and 
truths…because these are what do no perversity, nor speak a lie, neither is a 
tongue of deceit found in their mouth." Joel 2:32 is cited.

AC 5899



"From these passages it is plain what it is ‘to escape,’ namely, that they who 
‘escape’ are they who have remains, and that ‘to escape’ is to be delivered 
from damnation." Joel 2:32 is cited.

AC 7051 [2]



"Hence…it is that most persons in the Christian world…believe that that 
nation will again be chosen, and will then be brought back into the land of 
Canaan and this according to the sense of the letter, as in many passages…Joel
2:32…"

AE 433 [27]



"From this it can be seen how far from the truth those have wandered, who 
believe that at the end of time the Jews will be converted to the Lord and 
brought back into the land of Canaan…In these passages those also are meant
who were to be brought into the church, and thence into heaven from the 
earth after the Lord came, not only where the Christian religion is received 
but everywhere else…" Joel 2:32 is cited as an example of how people have 
wandered from the truth.

Derived Doctrine

"And it shall come to pass that whoever calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved."



"Pass" signifies to flow in or to receive influx, and "pass" relates to the will 
and understanding (AC 683). May we then conclude from this promise, from 
the Lord, that He would pour out the influx of His spirit and power to the 
faithful remnant? Is it a promise that their will and understanding would be 
strengthened with the resolve of the Lord’s truth?

 To "call on the name of the Lord" (Jehovah) signifies to worship from 

charity(AC 1455). Review for a moment what this means. Worship from 
charity is a worship that is based on love of the Lord and the neighbor. It is 

104



free from the hidden agendas of self-interest. It is a service in which genuine 
love flows out from the heart of the internal person.
"The name of the Lord" represents thinking of the essence or qualities of the 
Lord. "Calling on the name of the Lord" signifies thinking about the sum of all 
by which the Lord is to be worshiped, that is, to count all of the blessings we 
receive from His love and wisdom (AC 2724).

 To be "saved" means to be rescued, or delivered, from the effects of the 

damnation brought on by self-love. The "remains" stored up in every one of 
us by the Lord are the means by which the Lord effects the rescue. Please 
read AC 5897 [5 & 6] again. It is cited above in the Passages from the Writings.
It is one of those passages that is well worth reading often.

"For in Mount Zion and in Jerusalem there shall be deliverance…"







"Zion" signifies the advent of the Lord, and the establishment of the church by
Him among those who are in the good of love (AE 433 [8]). AR 612 teaches 
that Zion signifies heaven and the church where the Lord alone is 
worshipped.
"Jerusalem" signifies "the church as to worship, and therefore also the church
as to doctrine, for worship is prescribed in doctrine, and performed 
according to it…" (AR 880)
"Deliverance" and "remains" are synonymous. The Lord, and the Lord alone, 
knows where our remains are and which of them should be called forth at the
precise moment of need. Trusting the Lord, following His providential 
leading, brings about our deliverance. AC 5897 [5 & 6] and AC 5899 are 
important passages about the power of remains and the message of 
deliverance. How can this be said with conviction? Look at the closing 
sentence of this chapter.

"…as the Lord has said, among the remnant whom the Lord calls."

 Doesn’t this sum up well what we have just studied above regarding remains?
 The words "deliverance" and "escape" are used in our lesson about 

redemption. In some ways, I like the use of both words. "Deliverance" gives 
me a picture of the Lord taking our hand, and "escape" gives me a picture of 
Him leading those who call on His name to come out of the war zone to a safe 
place. What an escape plan that is! He leads us past sneak attacks. He helps us
avoid traps laid out for us. Yes, "escape" seems like a powerful image to hold 
on to when we think of our deliverance.

Putting It All Together

P&P says "…those who acknowledge and worship the Lord will be saved."

105

This quote along with all of the quotes from the Writings shed great light on the 
meaning of the prophecy of Joel. What are the points of Chapter 2?

1. The Lord would come to visit the fallen church. How did the church fall? Its 
people allowed the holy things of the church to fall into a natural mode of 
thinking and living. The thinking of the natural world set the standards by 
which decisions were made. Eternal ends were not being sought by those in 
the church.

2. Therefore, falsity and evils were dispersing the knowledges of the Lord 

within the church. The church was dying. People were in danger of losing the 
light of heaven. So the Lord lovingly fought with the church.

3. The Lord exhorted the church to repent, to be converted, and to choose 

wisdom. He called for them to value His good and truth so as to remove the 
falsities of hell.

4. The Lord called on them to trust Him. He called on them to acknowledge Him 

from their hearts.

5. The Lord promised to vivify and fill the church with His presence and His 

ways.

6. Such an endeavor would not come easily. Hell would seek to dissipate any 

influx from heaven. Hell would lay down a huge amount of black and choking 
smoke from the ovens of self-love. Hell would seek to prevent the sun of 
heaven from shining on the church. The reflected light of the moon would be 
filled with blood so that its light would be lost, too.

7. But then the promises of the Lord and the call for deliverance cut through the
efforts of hell. The Lord, in His positive and calm manner, announced that He 
would win out over hell and the dead church. A new church would rise up out
of the death and despair of the present church.

8. He revealed His way of deliverance. The escape plan was laid out. Who will 

find these things? The remnant. Deliverance will come in the gifts of remains 
within those who are willing to be lead from Mount Zion and Jerusalem.

The Lord—the great "I will"—shall prevail against the morose and perverse plans of 
hell. His Hand is held out to "those who acknowledge and worship" Him. They shall 
be saved.

Questions to Stimulate Reflection

1.

I’d like to share something of the inspiration I got from reading about 
remains. Remains do no perversity. Remains speak not a lie. Nor is there a 
tongue of deceit found in their mouth. Remains give us deliverance. Remains 
provide us with the means to escape from the clutches of hell. Now for a two-
part question: Have you given remains much doctrinal thought? Now that we 
have read these things about remains, are they more important to you than at
any time before this lesson?

2. What has been your feeling about Israel being a favored nation in the eyes of 
the Lord? Does it make sense to you why many people, Christians as well, 
have believed this? We know the literal sense has many passages that seem to
support the "favored nation" concept, but in light of what the Writings say, 
can we correct this idea in our minds?

3. Hell’s black smoke screen to prevent the Lord’s influx is quite graphic in the 
Word. How about in your life experiences? The moon filling with blood is 
another example. The moon represents faith. The moon has no light of its 
own. It reflects the light of the sun. So what do you think is the meaning of 
these examples of spiritual phenomena?

4.

I am struck with the ending repetition of the prophet’s messages. They all 
deal with the death of the church—be it the Jewish Church or the Christian 
Church. They announce the advent of the Lord and the birth of the New 
Church. But why do we need to hear this theme so many times? Granted, each
story focuses on a different element of the death of the Church. Is the 
message repeated because we have failed to receive it? Or is this theme 
prevalent to ensure that, no matter what prophet we read, we will hear this 
story at least once?

5. Looking ahead to the third chapter, what message would you anticipate 

reading? Will we read about the gathering up of the remnant? Will we study 
more about the struggle ahead of the new church? Will we read about the 
eventual triumph of the Lord over the hells?

6. Will the Word recapture the hearts and minds of the faithful?

Jehoshaphat; and I will enter into judgment with them there on account of My people, 
My heritage Israel, whom they scattered among the nations; they have also divided up



"Bring back" signifies that the internal person will reduce everything in the 
external to a state of agreement (AC 1717).
"Captives" signify a mind in darkness about good and truth (AC 7950).
"Judah" signifies a celestial love to the Lord, with all who are to be of His new 
heaven and new church (AR 350).
"Jerusalem" signifies those who will be in the church who will receive 
interiorly the Divine Proceeding (Holy Spirit) and will receive it exteriorly 
(AE 629 [6]).

"…gather all nations and bring them down to the valley of Jehoshaphat…"

 To "gather" or to "store up" signifies the truths in the memory. AC 679 teaches
us that "...‘gathering’ is predicated of the things that are in man's memory, 
where they are gathered together."

 The "valley of Jehoshaphat" signifies the falsification of the Word (AE 911 

[8]).

 To "gather all nations" signifies the evils of the will, or lusts, and nations 
(people) the persuasions of the falsities of the understanding (AC 622).
 Do we see what is being said here? In order for the Lord to bring back the 
captives, He must collect all of the truths in the memory of the people. The 
gathering of the nations is a collection of the evils in the will and 
understanding. He must expose how these corrupted vessels brought about 
the falsification of the Word. The Lord didn’t do this in the mountain. It took 
place in the valley where battles occur, where the daily life was more impure 
and profane. See AC 1292.

"…I will enter into judgment with them there [in the valley of Jehoshaphat]..."

 The doctrine of good relates to Justice and the doctrine of truth to Judgment 
(AC 612 and 2231). To "enter into judgment with them" signifies that the Lord
will bring His truth into the center of their falsification of the Word for the 
purpose of exposing and expelling the disorders of their evils.

"…on account of My people, My heritage Israel…"



"Heritage" has a good representation. AE 650 [53] teaches that "heritage" 
signifies the church. AE 727 [10] describes "heritage" as signifying the church 
that has Divine truth, and its power against falsities. AE 727 [6] teaches that 
the "flock of heritage" signifies those in the church who are in spiritual things 
of the Word, which are the truths of its internal sense. "Heritage" in the 
negative sense is described as the "heritage of Esau" wherein the natural 
person’s good is destroyed by the falsities of the sensuous person (AE 714 
[25]). And lastly, AE 730 gives us this: "‘Esau’s heritage’ signifies the falsities 
from evils."
"Israel" in the highest sense means the Lord in relation to the internal of the 
church and also the church with those who are interiorly natural and have 
truths there from a spiritual origin. "Israel" signifies the church that is 
spiritual-natural (AE 768 [15]).
"People" signify truth or falsity, and "nation" signifies good or evil (AC 1259-
60). Note this interesting quote from AC 1259 [6] and 1672: "Before the sons 
of Israel sought for kings, they were a nation…but after they desired a king…
they became a people."

"…whom they have scattered among the nations; they have also divided up My land."









"Scattered" signifies to spread falsities from evil (AE 67). "Scattered" signifies 
an infernal enjoyment of mixing or mingling falsity with truths (AC 10464-
65). "Scattering" signifies the dissemination of falsities by those who are not 
in truths (TCR 137).
"Among the nations" signifies the enjoyment of scattering falsity in the will or
good of the church. See AC 1259 for the signification of "nation."
"Divided" signifies the devastation of the church and its end, when there is a 
separation of its truths and goods (AE 710 [24]).
"Land" signifies various things: the internal man of the church; the church 
itself; the doctrine of love and charity; where the faith of the church resides 
(AC 2571).

"They…have given a boy as payment for a harlot, and sold a girl for wine, that they 
may drink."

"Give" in the positive sense signifies that all things are the Lord’s (AC 2026). 
The question jumps out at us—were they giving away that which was the 
Lord’s?
"Payment" or the act of buying means that they sought to make acquisitions 
for themselves. Truth that constitutes faith is never an acquisition that a 
person makes; it is a gift instilled and conferred by the Lord. See AC 5664. 
What did they want to buy?
"Boy" signifies the truth and good of innocence (AE 863 [11]).
"Harlot" signifies to falsify the truths of the Word (AE 863 [10]).
"Sold," or "sell," signifies to claim for oneself (AC 3325). "Sell" signifies to 
remove something from oneself (AC 4752). "Sell" signifies to ascribe 
something to someone else (AC 5371). "Sell" signifies those who make 
personal gain from holy things (AE 840 [4]). In the positive sense, "sell" 
signifies to set aside all self-love to procure the divine truth in the Word (AC 
840 [9 & 10]).
"Girl" signifies goods and their affections and the derivative gladness (AC 
2348).
"Wine" in the positive sense signifies faith from charity. To "drink wine" 
signifies a wish to investigate what belongs to faith (AC 1071). The "wine of 
whoredom" signifies adulterated truths of faith (AC 1072 [4]).

 To "drink" signifies to inquire whether any truth could be conjoined or 

appropriated (AC 3089). "Drink" signifies instruction in spiritual things (AC 
2704). We can, from the context of this verse, see that "they" did not want to 
investigate the Lord’s truth. Instead, they wanted to investigate ways to falsify
and pollute the Word.

Putting It All Together

"Then the church will be gathered together, and then judgment will be executed 
upon those who have scattered the goods and truths of the church." (P&P)

Can we picture the great spiritual gathering of the church? I don’t necessarily picture
throngs of people as much as I picture the Lord "reviewing" the doctrines, the 
policies, the attitudes that misled the church over the years. It’s not as if the Lord 
wasn’t aware of these things up to this point. That’s not His nature. All along the way,
He was intricately involved. Each step of the way, He tried to mediate things. He tried
to lift the church. If someone wanted to choose a disorder, He worked to get that 
person to choose a lesser disorder. The life of humanity was in great peril. In effect, 
the church and its people had run out of spiritual options. The "time" left to them 
was at its end. The Lord needed to act on behalf of the church. Doctrine of the Lord 3 
outlines the seriousness of the situation for us:

111

"The Lord came into the world in the fullness of times, which was when He was no 
longer known by the Jews, and unless He had then come into the world and 
revealed Himself, mankind would have perished in eternal death."

How does this quote fit into our lesson from Joel?

1. The spiritual barrenness of the church was "gathered together" so it could be 
made plain to the church what gross evils they had come to live and love.

2. Their actions, their choices were reviewed in the valley of Jehoshaphat, a 

valley of decisions where a "war" was going to take place. The outcome would
not be in doubt. The Lord was going to make a judgment on the folly of their 
thinking. He was going to end the reign of evil and falsity, and give birth to a 
new church.

3. What issues would come under the scrutiny and light of the Lord? The 

falsities of the sensual person had destroyed natural good. The scattering of 
the people spoke of the infernal enjoyment the hells derived from mixing and 
mingling falsities with truths. The clever subterfuges used to mislead the 
church would be exposed. The mocking laughter and glee of the hellish spirits
would end.

4. Hellish loves worked tirelessly to divide the will and understanding. There 
was devastation in the land. Lots were cast. We are taught that casting lots 
signifies the plan of hell to dissipate the truths of the Word. The hells 
propounded the idea that they could "buy" their way into heaven or 
anywhere else they wanted to go. This was illustrated with the buying and 
selling of the young boy and girl. The philosophy of "payment" was wrong. 
The things they tried to claim for themselves were not theirs to buy or own. 
The Lord owned them. It was His choosing to do with them what He wanted. 
The Lord conferred divine things freely on the faithful. The faithful needed no
money. The hells could not sell the holy things of the Lord for their own 
profit. It was now time for the Lord to completely expose the layers of falsity 
and evil within the fallen church.

5. Humankind, the church, had spiritually and morally bottomed out. The Lord’s
love and mercy needed to come into the world to provide a way out of the pit 
of hell. If the Lord had delayed His coming any longer, it would have been all 
over, spiritually, for the church.

Questions to Stimulate Reflection

1. The word "Jehoshaphat" in Hebrew comprises various meanings. It means 

"Yahu judges or has judged." It also is identified with the term decision. But 
when considered in a larger context, it is speaking of a verdict being made by
the Lord. Would you agree that the choice of the valley of Jehoshaphat in the 
prophecy was not a random choice? How is it relevant to the situation?

2. The story of the tower of Babel comes to mind when I read about the buying 
and selling theme in Joel. The builders of that tower felt they could force their
way into heaven and become god-like. Do you see some of this outlook when 
you think about the hells’ brazen attitude about purchasing whatever they 
wanted?

3. Our lesson portrays hell’s glee and delight in mixing and mingling falsity with
truth. As always, we need to think of some example of this in our day. What 
examples come to mind?

4. One of the quotes in our Derived Doctrine section mentioned that before 

Israel had sought a king, they were a "nation." After they took on a king, they 
were called a "people." What do you make of this point? Doesn’t this sound 
like a loss of cohesion moving from nation to people? The unity of the nation 
was lost when "Everyone did what was right in his own eyes." (Judges 17:6)

5. The giving and selling of the boy and girl signifies the cheapening of the good 
of innocence and the conjugial quality. What application of this principle can 
we make in today’s issues of life?

6. Does the quote from Doctrine of the Lord 3 awaken your mind to the 

desperate conditions of the world before the advent of the Lord? Have 
conditions improved since the advent? How? Does the fact that we have the 
Writings improve our opportunities to combat the forces of hell?

JOEL 3:4-8

"Indeed, what have you to do with Me, O Tyre and Sidon, and all the coasts of Philistia?
Will you retaliate against Me? But if you retaliate against Me, swiftly and speedily I 
will return your retaliation upon your own head; because you have taken My silver and
My gold, and have carried into your temples My prized possessions. Also the people of 
Judah and the people of Jerusalem you have sold to the Greeks, that you may remove 
them far from their borders. Behold, I will raise them out of the place to which you 
have sold them, and will return your retaliation upon your own head. I will sell your 
sons and your daughters into the hand of the people of Judah, and they will sell them to
the Sabeans, to a people far off; for the Lord has spoken."



"In Joel…3:4, 5…‘all borders of Philistia’ denote all the interior and exterior

Philistia,’ or all ‘the borders’ of it. ‘Silver and gold’ here are the spiritual and 
celestial things of faith; ‘desirable good things’ are the knowledges of them. 
That they ‘carried them into their temples,’ is that they possessed and 
proclaimed them; and that they ‘sold the sons of Judah and the sons of 
Jerusalem,’ signifies that they had no love and no faith; ‘Judah’ in the Word is 
the celestial of faith, and ‘Jerusalem’ is the spiritual of faith thence derived, 
which were ‘removed far from their borders.’"

correspondence signifies the good of love, may appear from the following 
passages…" Joel 3:5 is cited.

AC 1151 [6]



"…in Joel…3:6…‘The sons of Judah’ denote celestial things of faith; ‘the sons of
Jerusalem,’ spiritual things of faith—thus things internal; and ‘the sons of the

Derived Doctrine

"Indeed, what have you to do with Me, O Tyre and Sidon, and all the coasts of 
Philistia?"

 Does the word "indeed" mean "in truth," "in fact," or is it an exclamation of 



surprise, irony, or incredulity?
"Tyre" and "Sidon" (Zidon) represent those who perverted spiritual things. 
The Lord is making it quite clear that these two cities had no interest or part 
of Him in their hearts and minds. They were dangerous and arrogant 
neighbors of Israel.

 As we think about the meanings given above for "…and all the coasts of 

Philistia," it may be helpful to consider Ezekiel 25:16: "…therefore thus says 
the Lord God: ‘I will stretch out My hand against the Philistines, and I will…
destroy the remnant of the seacoast." AE 275 explains the spiritual sense of 
this passage: ‘the Philistines’ signify those who are in the doctrine of 
faith alone, and the remnant of the seacoast signify all things of truth."

"Will you retaliate against Me? But if you retaliate against Me, swiftly and speedily I 
will return your retaliation upon your own head…"

 There is a "law of order" in the spiritual world that is constant and perpetual. 
When an evil spirit intends harm to be inflicted on others, whether they are 
companions or enemies, the intended evil recoils upon the spirit who willed 
it to be done (AC 8223). The spirit of retaliation faces the constant and 
perpetual law of order. Can we see this law written within this passage? 
Those who want to retaliate against the Lord will experience swift and 
speedy retaliation upon their own head. The spirit of retaliation comes only 
from the evil and not from the good because the good continually desire to do
good to both foes and friends.

"…because you have taken My silver and My gold, and have carried into your temples 
My prized possessions."

 To "take away" signifies to remove every good and truth of the church for the 
purpose of leaving no power to resist falsities (AE 727 [12]). According to AC 
10540, to "take away" signifies to destroy defending truths.
"My silver" relates to understanding truths of the Lord. "My gold" relates to 
willing the things of the Lord. Hence, this phrase describes a removal of the 
understanding and the will.



 What would be a "prized possession" of the Lord’s? It most likely would be 

the conjugial principle within all things. What is that conjugial principle? CL 
316 teaches, "The conjugial principle is present in the tiniest details of each 
human being." AC 3915 shares with us, "The conjunction of good and truth is 
the conjugial principle in the Lord’s kingdom." So the crime here is that the 

116

prized possession was carried into the temple of self-love so that it could be 
disjoined, severed, and lost.

"Also the people of Judah and the people of Jerusalem you have sold to the Greeks, that 
you may remove them far from their borders."



"The people of Judah" signify love to the Lord, with whom the church was to 
be established (AC 10329). The people of Jerusalem signify the church with 
whom the Divine Proceeding (Holy Spirit) was to be received (AE 629 [6]).
"Sold to the Greeks" signifies being among a nation of falsities (AE 242 [12]). 
"Selling" signifies the desire to have personal gain from holy things.
 Removing the people "far" from their borders is an effort to diminish the 



memory-knowledges of truths stored up from the Word. To carry people "far 
from their borders" is to trivialize the things of the Word learned from 
childhood. AE 518 [17] drew me to the possibility of applying this meaning to 
the passage.

Putting It All Together

P&P focuses our reflection on the heart of the problem in these verses. "…
knowledges alone and faith alone" are what destroyed the truths of the Word and 
the doctrine drawn from the Word. Aloneness fosters separation of the will and 
understanding instead of a balanced conjunction. It dissolves the conjugial principle 
within what the Lord intended to be united.

Did the frequent use of the word "retaliation" come to your attention? In the 
passages we are considering, the word "retaliation" occurs three times. The 
dictionary defines retaliation as "To return like for like; to return evil for evil."

Why did the fallen church feel it had to retaliate? What led them to decide they must 
give the Lord "like for like" or "evil for evil"? The Lord does no evil. He only seeks to 
do good to all of His children. Could the anger they felt stem from their belief that 
the Lord hindered them from doing what they wanted to do? Was their anger a form 
of displaced hostility? When self-love is out of control, it favors no one except self. 
Anyone or anything that gets in the way of self-love is attacked. We know from many 
teachings in the Writings that hell burns to blot out the name of the Lord. They long 
to destroy the Lord and all those who love Him. Hell enjoys attacking good and truth.

The Lord introduces us to an important "law of order." He shows us the results of the
spirit of retaliation. Those who wish harm on others will have a like harm return to 
them. Those who wish good to a friend or neighbor will have a like good return to 
them. The fallen church was in for a sad end. "Swiftly and speedily," their retaliation 
would "be upon [their] own head."

117

But we should not end on this retaliatory note. The Lord promises to restore and 
return His "prized possessions" to the temple. He will return those who were held 
captive by self-love and bring them into the presence of the gold and silver in the 
temple. The good of love (gold) and the good of truth (silver) will once again be the 
conjunctive means to restore a balanced worship of the Lord. The bleak aloneness 
will be removed. "Knowledge alone and faith alone" will no longer be present in the
hearts and minds of His people. The conjugial principle will thrive in the church. The
great gate of conjunction will be open wide, inviting all to enter into the warmth and 
protective fellowship of the Lord’s new church.

Questions to Stimulate Reflection

1. Can you recall a time when you wanted something strongly and no warning 
advice against getting it was allowed in the pursuit of your goal? What 
happened?

2. Did you feel antagonism toward the person speaking against your goal? 

Sometimes, our persistence is for something good. But think now of a time 
when you insisted on getting your own way and the situation ended sadly. 
Why do we sometimes fail to listen to the advice offered to us?

3. What about the "law of order" regarding retaliation? Do you see it being so? 

Did it worry you? What are the fruits of getting even with someone?

4.

I hope we will be able to recall the positive aspect of the "law of order." Our 
good wishes for others also return to us.

5. Do you see the danger of "aloneness"? Separating the will and the 

understanding brings sad results. Hell wants to get us arguing about which is 
most important, Good (affections) or Truth (understanding). The Jacob and 
Esau story in the Word illustrates in many ways the strife between the will 
and understanding. What illustrations of this point can you think of?

6. Have you ever participated in a debate about the importance of "feelings" 

over the rational approach to problem-solving?

7. The gold and silver stolen away have quite a rich application to life. Please 
note the Writings say that these "prized possessions" of the church were 
taken away by "the craftiness" and purpose of those who "contrive evil 

118

against others." We are taught that these crafty ones are those who are in the 
love of ruling. Any ideas of how we may see this application to our lives and 
times?

8. One last suggested question: Do we sense that there is a conjugial principle in
all things created? If that principle is ignored, hated, or separated, do you see 
the ramifications of how the spiritual church within us dies and becomes 
antagonistic to the Lord? Aloneness is a cold and lifeless way of existing.

JOEL 3:9-12

"Proclaim this among the nations: ‘Prepare for war! Wake up the mighty men, let all 
men of war draw near, let them come up. Beat your plowshares into swords and your 
pruning hooks into spears; let the weak say, ‘I am strong.’ Assemble and come, all you 
nations, and gather together all around. Cause Your mighty ones to go down there, O 
Lord. Let the nations be wakened, and come up to the Valley of Jehoshaphat; for there I
will sit to judge all the surrounding nations."

Derived Doctrine

"Proclaim this among the nations: ‘Prepare for war!"



 AC 10412 explains that to "proclaim" signifies that the true Divine is shown as
the essential of the church, and it is to be announced that this Divine is to be 
perpetually worshipped. In AE 302, "proclaim" signifies that an exploration is 
to be made. The influx of the Lord will make known the states of life of 
everyone in heaven and on earth.
"Nations" signifies the evils of the will, or lusts, whereas "people" signifies the
falsities of the understanding, or persuasions (AC 622).
"Prepare" signifies making ready to receive truth (AC 3142 [2]). "Prepare" 
signifies to make one ready to live according to divine order (TCR 110 [5]). 
To "make ready" signifies that the church was to be conjoined with the 
Lord through the Word (AR 881).
"War" signifies spiritual fighting against the lusts of evil and the persuasions 
of falsity (AC 1663, 1664). "War" signifies the combats of the Lord with the 
hells (AE 817 [7]).





"Wake up the mighty men, let all men of war draw near, let them come up."





"Wake" signifies a clear and alert state (AC 5210). "Wake" signifies a state in 
which people begin to know that they do not live from themselves. Thus, they
"wake up." See AC 147.
"Mighty men" or mighty warriors signify those who are strong in faith (AC 
1179). "Mighty ones" signify those who love good (AE 922 [2]). In the 
opposite sense, "mighty men" signify those who live falsities because of self-
love (AC 8317). Mighty warriors signify those consumed by self love (AC 583).
 To "draw near" signifies receiving influx to be conjoined to the Lord through 

love (AC 8159).

"Beat your ploughshares into swords and your pruning hooks into spears…"



 To "beat" signifies the arrangement and disposal of truths in their order and 
series (AC 10303 [2]). To "beat" or hammer signifies to make good solid (AC 
9550). The rain and wind beating on the house built on the rock signifies to 
form the person of the church so that he or she does not fall but conquers (AE
411 [11]).
"Ploughshares" signify the goods of the church that cultivate truths (AE 734 
[3]).
In AC 2799, "swords" are described as signifying the truth of faith combating. 
A "sword" in the internal sense signifies the truth of faith combating and also 
the vastation of truth. In the opposite sense, a "sword" is falsity combating 
truth, and the punishment of falsity. AE contains at least eight passages 
stating that a "sword" signifies falsity destroying truth and good.





"Pruning hooks" signify doctrinal truths and also signify perceptions and 
knowledges of truths (AE 734 [2]).
"Spears" signify truths of use in spiritual warfare, which, with regeneration, 
become preparatory to the reception of truths from good (AC 1664 [3] and AC
5895).

 Before passing on to other derived doctrine, please note that Isaiah 

 and 

 Micah 4:3

2:4 
  reverse this command from the Lord.
passages command the Israelites to "beat their swords into ploughshares and
their spears into pruning hooks."

  These two 

"Let the weak say, ‘I am strong.’"



"Weak" signifies being without supporting truths (AC 6344). "Weak" signifies 
that the affections of external truth have a feeble and wavering 
understanding (AC 3820).

 AE 922 [5] has an explanation about strength that seems to apply to the 

words "I am strong." "As all strength in the Word is in the letter, it is said (in 
Isaiah 63:1) ‘walking in the multitude of His strength.’" In other words, we 
need to know and feel the strength of the Word and walk in the ways of truth, 
which "cannot be resisted" (AC 426 [3]).
"Let" means to allow or permit. "Allow" signifies to have or obtain spiritual 
food regularly to become freed from sins (AC 2165).



"Assemble and come, all you nations, and gather together all around."

 AC 6338 explains that "assemble" signifies to set goods and truths in order, 







for goods and truths cannot be assembled if they are not in order.
"Come and see" signifies giving attention to and having a degree of 
perception (AE 354).
"All you nations" possibly represents the gathering of those in the Lord’s 
kingdom. See AC 1416 [5]. The indication here is that the natural, spiritual, 
and celestial of the Lord’s kingdom have a divine calling to gather. There was 
to be a combined and unified mobilization of heavenly forces to oust the hells 
from the church.
"Gather together all around." "Gather" signifies to excite the truths in the 
memory for combat (AR 707). All in the same goods and truths gather to meet
and organize forces (AC 6451). Please note the call to gather "all around." The 
Divine circle. The total or complete protection for the day of the battle.

"Cause Your mighty ones to go down there, O Lord."

 The word "cause" seems to imply "make," "send," "direct," or "command." 
"Your mighty ones." There is another important word to focus on: "Your" 
mighty ones. This battle is being waged from the Lord’s resources and not 

121

 
 
 
humanity’s. When the battle occurs and victory is secured, human prudence 
has no claim to the victory. The Lord’s mighty ones assured the victory.

"Let the nations be awakened, and come up to the Valley of Jehoshaphat…"

"Awaken" signifies enlightenment. To be asleep signifies to be in an obscure 
state (AC 3715).
"Come up" signifies to progress from what is external to what is internal (AC 
5202).

 The "Valley of Jehoshaphat" signifies the falsification of the Word (AE 911 

[8]). In other words, the Lord was directing His mighty ones to the source of 
all the spiritual problems. Listen now to the closing portion of this verse.

"For there I will sit to judge all the surrounding nations."

 To "sit" signifies a state of thought (AC 2684).
 To "judge" denotes the Lord opening the doctrine of His truth (AC 2231). 
When He opens His truth, all veneers will melt away. All pretenses will be 
uncovered. True motives will be seen. Things misjudged or improperly 
learned will be straightened out. "The crooked places shall be made straight 
and the rough places smooth; the glory of the Lord shall be revealed, and all 
flesh shall see it together." (Isaiah 40:4-5)
"All surrounding nations" will see and witness the eradication of falsity. The 
Word will be restored to its Holy place in the hearts and mind of the church.



Putting It All Together

P&P summarizes these verses with an announcement from the Lord of a combat 
against evils and falsities. The literal sense of the Word boldly declares, "Prepare for 
war!" The internal sense declares what must be done to prepare for war:

 We must live according to divine order.
 The church must be conjoined with the Lord and the Word.
 We must be awake, be alert, and realize that we cannot live from ourselves 

alone.

 Ploughshares must be beaten into swords, meaning that good must be made 

solid and firm, and then it must put truths in order.

 The sword of faith must combat evil.


Instead of calling our efforts weak, we need to trust the Lord and believe that 
with His guidance, "I am strong." The hells flee from us when they see that we
believe this truth because the Lord told us to say it.

The day of the Lord’s judgment is at hand. The pretense and false front of the hells 
will be exposed and removed by the Lord and His mighty ones. The Lord will sit in 
judgment in the valley of Jehoshaphat—the falsification of the Word—and He will 

122

return the Word to His people and His New Church. All of the nations, all of the 
heavens, will sit and witness this magnificent restoration of good and truth. The 
crooked will be made straight, and the rough places will be made smooth. There will 
be a new highway built by the Lord, and He will guide His people to the eternal 
Promised Land through the process of regeneration.

So let us "Gather together all around." Let us share the exciting news from the Lord 
with confidence and feel the surge of power from heaven so we can say in unison: "I 
am strong!"

Questions to Stimulate Reflection

1. Did you find this section spiritually invigorating? The Lord minced no words. 
There was going to be combat. There was going to be order and arrangement 
of resources. There was going to be a hardening up of good and truth. There 
was a call to be awake. What do you make of all these preparations by the 
Lord?

2. Did you feel like you wanted to be part of the winning army? Isn’t it 

comforting to know that hell will not win despite its defense?

3. How may we practice the "I am strong!" speech to ourselves?

4. Why would the quotes from Isaiah and Micah about ploughshares and spears 

be different?

JOEL 3:13-15

"Put in the sickle, for the harvest is ripe. Come, go down; for the winepress is full. The 
vats overflow—for their wickedness is great. Multitudes, multitudes in the valley of 
decision! For the day of the Lord is near in the valley of decision. The sun and moon 
will grow dark, and the stars will diminish their brightness."

Derived Doctrine

"Put in the sickle, for the harvest is ripe."

 A "sickle" signifies "the Divine truth of the Word…because by a ‘harvest’ is 
signified the state of the church as to Divine truth, here its last state; 
therefore by ‘reaping,’ which is done with a sickle, is here signified to put an 
end to the state of the church, and to execute judgment…" (AR 643).



 A "harvest" signifies the last state of the church preceding the Last Judgment 
when everyone is explored by the Lord and there is a separation of the evil 
from the good (AE 908).
"Ripe" has some interesting meanings. AC 5117 describes its meaning as the 
progress of rebirth or regeneration. In the "unripe" state, truth predominates.
But when good has the primacy, the "ripe" state exists. AR 645 defines "ripe" 
as the last state of the old church. AE 911 says "ripe" signifies the time to 
collect the good and to separate them from the evil.

"Come, go down; for the winepress is full. The vats overflow—for their wickedness is 
great."

 To "go down" signifies to move toward the exterior or lower natural and 
earthly things (AC 5406). To "come down" when said of the Lord signifies 
judgment (AC 1311).

 A "winepress" signifies in the negative sense violence offered to divine 



truth(AE 922 [5]). AR 651 teaches that a winepress signifies an examination 
of the quality of works, and the quality is determined by the products (uses).
"The ‘vats’ overflow—for their wickedness is great": we need some lead-in to 
achieve a glimpse of the spiritual sense of this phrase. AE 644 [15] develops a 
series of positive things that have a "vat overflow." It speaks of the Lord’s 
continual influx intro truths with the good of love. From this influx, a person 
has a good love towards a brother or companion, and from this they have the 
truth and good of love to the Lord. AE 695 [23] explores the negative sense of 
"vats" overflowing, noting that "The floor and the wine shall not feed them" 
signifies failure to draw from the Word the good things of charity and love. 
The wine vat signifies the Word in respect to the goods of love, and the "vat" 

127

means they were so full of themselves that they had no room for the good of 
charity and love. AE 922 [3] teaches that the "vats" overflowing signifies that 
there was nothing except falsities from evils. And what were the results of 
this? They separated faith from charity and made faith without works "the 
law of saving."
"Wickedness" needs a moment of reflection so we can clearly define it and 
know more accurately what effect wickedness has on our lives. What is at the 
heart of wickedness? Consider this quote from AE 257 [7]: wickedness 
signifies "all the falsities of evil committed to the complete destruction 
of good and truth in a person."



"Multitudes, multitudes in the valley of decision! For the day of the Lord is near in the 
valley of decision."

 AE 750 [10] has this explanation for "multitudes." "Multitudes" (hordes) 

signify the false beliefs and wrong opinions of those who array themselves 
against the truths and goods of the church.

 When the word "multitude" is used twice, it is not for effect or emphasis. 



When one word is repeated, it speaks of a heavenly marriage in the positive 
sense. In the negative sense, it represents the effort of evil to destroy the 
conjugial principle of the will and understanding.
"The valley of decision" needs to be looked at from two vantages. A "valley" 
represents the natural portions of the mind where battles occur between 
truth and falsity. A "valley" signifies what is external in worship "wherein is 
what is profane." (AC 1292) "Decision" is identified with a church that has 
come to "its old age, or its winter, or its night; and its time and state then are 
called ‘decision,’ and ‘fulfillment.’" (AC 2905)

"For the day of the Lord is near in the valley of decision."



"Day of the Lord" signifies vastation and the last time and state of the 
church(AC 488 [3] and AC 1839 [5]).

Putting It All Together

P&P summarizes this section as "Then evil is consummated." The word 
"consummated" means to bring to completion, to sum up, or to carry to the utmost 
extent.

The consummation of the external church did not take place on the mountain of the 
Lord. It took place in the "valley of decision." Therefore, we are looking at the last 
days of the external church. The Lord was coming to the harvest of that church. His 
"sickle" had to sort things out from the "harvest." Judgment in the Word is often 
depicted as a man sitting down on the shore to separate good fish from bad fish. Or 
it is presented as the sheep being separated from the goats. Such a day of decision 

128

was crucial. The Word had, for many years, been falsified. Errors, misdeeds, and 
falsity during that long period of time had gained credence within the church. Falsity
was accepted as truth, and truth was being accepted as falsity. Vastation came to the 
church so that "spiritual things" could be emptied out and freed from the 
smothering effects of the hells. Truth was to be ousted. Falsity was to be removed 
and banished from the church.

Is it any wonder then that the Writings gave us many quotes regarding the meaning 
of the sun, moon, and stars losing their light? Falsity was blocking out the Lord who 
is our "sun of heaven." Falsity was causing the "moon of faith" to lose its reflection of 
the light of the sun. Falsity caused the "stars" of knowledge to fall from the heavens.

Exploration came from the Lord so that violence to the Word would end. 
"Multitudes" and "multitudes" of false beliefs and wrong opinions had arrayed 
themselves against the Lord, but their day, their end, was at hand. The external 
church, a church in a state of "old age," a church in a "winter" state, a church in a 
state of "night" was being called into the valley of decision.

Who did the calling? It was the Lord, the sun of heaven, who is true and mighty. 
What will this day of decision be like? Isaiah 60:4-5, in a prophecy of the advent of 
the Lord, captures this day of enlightenment with these words:

"Lift up your eyes all around, and see…you shall see and become radiant, and 
your heart shall swell with joy…"

Questions to Stimulate Reflection

1. The process of the sun, moon, and stars losing their light is a theme found in 
many prophesies of the Old Testament and in the New Testament. Have you, 
by now, pictured the meaning and the process of this happening to the 
previous churches?

2. Will this same thing happen to the organized New Church on earth?

3.

Isaiah 60:20 promises that the spiritual New Church will not experience the 
loss of the sun, moon, and stars. Listen to that prophecy: "Your sun shall no 
longer go down, nor shall your moon withdraw itself; for the Lord will be 
your everlasting light, and the days of your mourning shall be ended."

"The Lord also will roar from Zion, and utter His voice from Jerusalem; the heavens 
and earth will shake; but the Lord will be a shelter for His people, and the strength of

My holy mountain. Then Jerusalem shall be holy, and no aliens shall ever pass through

signifies heaven where the Lord reigns by the Divine truth, and ‘Jerusalem’ 
signifies doctrine therefrom, it is clear what is signified by ‘Jehovah shall roar 
out of Zion, and shall utter His voice from Jerusalem.’ That the Lord is present
where He reigns by His Divine truth, both with the angels of heaven and with

passages…" Joel 3:17, 18, and 20 are cited.

Derived Doctrine

"…the heavens and earth will shake…"

 The Lord’s first advent reordered all of the heavens and the earth. "The 

‘heavens’ are the celestial and spiritual things (thus the inmost things) of 
both the Lord’s kingdom in the heavens, and the Lord’s kingdom on the earth,
that is in the church, and also in every man…the ‘earth’ is all lower things…as 
the lower rational and natural things…" (AC 2162)

 To "shake" signifies to divest the heart and mind of unclean things (AC 1748). 
To "shake" signifies to get rid of evil lest what is damned should adhere (AE 
365 [8]).

"…the Lord will be a shelter for His people, and the strength of the children of Israel."

 The word "shelter" has no correspondential explanation in The Swedenborg 
Concordance. There is a suggestion made by Alice Sechrist, in A Dictionary of 
Bible Imagery, to look at the correspondence of "shade," "shadow," or "cloud" 
when considering the word "shelter." Let’s see if the explanation of a "cloud" 
offers any meanings that could apply to "shelter" as well.

 A "cloud" signifies "…the ultimate of the Word, which is therefore relatively 

obscure…That this is ‘the cloud’ is because the Divine truth which is from the 
Lord cannot possibly appear in the very brightness in which it is, for man 
would thereby perish, because his understanding would be totally blinded by 
the light of truth, and his will would be wholly extinguished by the fire of 
good; thus all his life would be annihilated. Hence it is that Divine truth is 
accommodated to each person’s apprehension, and as it were veiled with a 
cloud…" (AC 9433)

 The strength, the fortification, of the Lord is His truth, which cannot be 

resisted (AC 426 [3]). The Lord’s strength is the Divine good and truth in the 
church (AE 288 [4]).

"So you shall know that I am the Lord your God…"

 To be able to "know" and "name" the Lord is an important part of the process 
of making that which is invisible visible. To "name" signifies to know the 
essence or quality of all the affections of the Lord that are to be worshiped 
(AC 2724).

133



"You shall know" is both a positive and encouraging idea to hold within the 
heart during this period of "shaking" the heavens and earth, this vastation of 
the dead church.

Putting It All Together

"This is from the Lord…" P&P teaches that the new church will come to 
acknowledge the Lord and will know that the church is from Him.

The Lord as a "roaring lion" is not a reference to the sound of anger. Instead, the roar
of the Lord is filled with a loving zeal to protect His beloved. The Lord "roars" when 
He sees His church being carried away by devils. He roars when He sees His enemies
assaulting the faithful within the church. His mighty roar strikes terror in the heart 
of the hells.

His roar is not all noise signifying nothing. He steadily saw to the reordering of the 
heavens and earth. He caused His truth to bring about a spiritual shaking to rid the 
church of unclean things. The shaking helped to rid the new church of the "dust" of 
falsity so that it wouldn’t adhere to the mind and heart of the new church. While the 
hells were being consummated, the Lord spoke words of comfort to the faithful.

"And it will come to pass in that day that the mountains shall drip with new wine, the

fountain shall flow from the house of the Lord and water the Valley of Acacias. Egypt 
shall be a desolation, and Edom a desolate wilderness, because of violence against the 
people of Judah, for they have shed innocent blood in their land. But Judah shall abide 
forever and Jerusalem from generation to generation."



"The Lord will then teach them the Word, and falsifications of the Word will 
be removed."

AC 2184 [6]



"In Joel…3:18…Speaking of the Lord’s kingdom; ‘milk’ denotes the celestial 
spiritual. In the Word the land of Canaan also (by which the Lord’s kingdom is
represented and signified) is called a ‘land flowing with milk and honey’…and
in these passages nothing else is meant by ‘milk’ than an abundance of 
celestial spiritual things, and by ‘honey’ an abundance of the derivative 
happinesses; the ‘land’ is the celestial itself of the kingdom, from which those 
things come."

AC 2702 [7]

passages…" Joel 3:18 is cited.

AE 376 [5]



"In Joel…3:18…This treats of the Lord’s coming, and of the new heaven and 
the new church from Him. It is well known that the mountains in the land of 
Canaan, or in Judea, did not then drop down sweet wine, nor the hills flow 
with milk, nor the water-courses of Judah flow with waters more than before,
therefore these words must mean something else than new wine, milk, and 
waters, or than mountains, hills, and water-courses, namely, ‘that the 
mountains shall drop down sweet wine…’ or wine…means that from the good
of love to the Lord there shall be genuine truth; ‘the hills shall flow with milk’ 
means that from the good of charity towards the neighbor there shall be 
spiritual life; and ‘all the water-courses of Judah shall flow with waters’ 
means that from the particulars of the Word there shall be truths. (For ‘Judah’
signifies the Lord’s celestial kingdom, and also the Word, see A.C., n. 3881, 
6363; therefore ‘its water-courses’ signify the particulars of the Word; that 
‘mountains’ signify the good of love to the Lord…And ‘hills’ the good of 
charity towards the neighbor…and this because in heaven those who are in 
the good of love to the Lord dwell upon mountains, and those who are in the 
good of charity towards the neighbor dwell upon hills…)"

new earth at that time; ‘the mountains shall drop down sweet wine’ means 
that all truth shall be from the good of love to the Lord; ‘the hills shall flow

[sweet wine], and the hills shall flow with milk, and all the water-courses of 
Judah shall flow with waters,’ may be seen explained above (n. 433c); and 
that ‘a fountain shall go forth out of the house of Jehovah and shall water the 
brook of Shittim’ signifies that there shall be truth out of heaven from the 
Lord illustrating the knowledges and cognitions that are in the natural man."

AE 518 [10]



"In Joel…3:18…‘The fountain that shall go forth out of the house of Jehovah’

Shittim that it shall water,’ signifies the illustration of the understanding."

AC 3654 [9]



"So in Joel…3:18, 20…from all the particulars in this passage also it is 
manifest that by ‘Judah’ is not meant Judah, nor by ‘Jerusalem,’ Jerusalem, but 
those who are in the holy of love and of charity; for these ‘shall abide forever, 
and to generation and generation.’"

Doctrine of Sacred Scripture 51 [8]



"He who reads the Word without doctrine does not see the consistency of 
what is said in the Prophets about the Jewish nation and Jerusalem—that the 
church with that nation, and its seat in that city, will remain to eternity; as in 
the following passages…Joel 3:18-20…In these passages the Lord’s advent is 
treated of, and that this [establishment of the Jews] will then come to pass."

AE 433c [13]



"In Joel…3:18-20…Here, too, the Lord’s coming and a new heaven and a new 
earth at that time are treated of. ‘The mountains shall drop down must 
[sweet wine]’ signifies that all truth will be from the good of love (that 

137

‘mountains’ signify the good of love see above, n 405a-f; and that ‘wine’ and 
‘must’ signify truth see also above, n. 376a-f). ‘The hills shall flow with milk’ 
signifies that spiritual life will be from the good of charity towards the 
neighbor; and ‘all the water-courses of Judah shall flow with waters’ signifies 
that from the particulars of the Word there will be truths, through which 
there will be intelligence; ‘a fountain shall go forth out of the house of 
Jehovah, and shall water the brook of Shittim,’ signifies that out of heaven 
from the Lord there will be truth of doctrine that will illustrate those who are
in cognitions and knowledges; ‘Egypt shall be a waste, and Edom shall be a 
waste wilderness’ signifies that false principles, and the evils of the love of 
self, both from the natural man, will be destroyed; ‘because of the violence to 
the sons of Judah, whose innocent blood they have shed in their land,’ 
signifies because of the truths of the Word falsified and its goods adulterated, 
which they have corrupted and destroyed; ‘Judah shall sit to eternity, and 
Jerusalem to generation and generation,’ signifies that the Word and the 
doctrine of genuine truth therefrom will remain to eternity with those who 
are in love to the Lord. This makes clear that ‘Judah’ does not here mean 
Judah, nor ‘Jerusalem’ Jerusalem."

AC 6353 [8]

 A ‘man of violence’ denotes those who destroy the truths of faith and the 

goods of charity; their fighting against these truths and goods…" Joel 3:19 is 
cited.

AC 9262 [7]



"In the proximate sense ‘the innocent’ signifies one who is without guilt and 
without evil…" Joel 3:19 is cited.

AR 503



"‘Egypt,’ in the opposite sense, signifies the natural man separated from the 
spiritual, and then the pride of his own intelligence, and thence insanity in 
spiritual things, in these passages…Joel 3:19…"

AR 546



"That by ‘wilderness’ is signified the church devastated, or in which all the 
truths of the Word are falsified, such as it was among the Jews in the Lord’s 
time, appears from these passages…Joel 3:19…"

138

AE 654 [72]



"In Joel…3:19…‘Egypt shall be a waste’ signifies that the natural man will be 
without truths, and thus in mere falsities; ‘and Edom a waste wilderness’ 
signifies that the natural man will be without goods and thence in mere evils; 
‘because of the violence to the sons of Judah, whose innocent blood they have 
shed,’ signifies because they have offered violence to the truths and goods of 
the Word, which they have perverted."

AE 730 [20]



"In Joel…3:19…‘Egypt’ and ‘Edom’ signify the natural man that has perverted 
the truths and goods of the Word; that it is to be so destroyed as to see only 
such things as serve for confirmation is signified by ‘Egypt shall be a waste, 
and Edom a waste wilderness;’ that this will be because of the adulteration of
every good and truth in the Word is signified by ‘because of the violence to 
the sons of Judah, whose innocent blood they have shed;’ ‘violence to the sons
of Judah’ signifying the adulteration of the Word in respect to good, and 
‘shedding innocent blood’ the adulteration of the Word in respect to its 
truths. (That ‘Judah’ signifies the celestial church, and also the Word…and 
that ‘shedding innocent blood’ signifies to do violence to Divine truth, thus to 
adulterate the truth of the Word…) The adulteration of the Word is effected 
by the knowledges (scientifica) of the natural man when these are applied to 
confirm falsities and evils, and the natural man becomes a ‘waste’ and a 
‘wilderness’ when his knowledges are used to confirm falsity and evil; ‘Egypt’
signifies such knowledges, and ‘Edom’ the pride that falsifies by means of 
these."

Derived Doctrine

With twenty direct quotes from the Writings, there is little need for us to use derived
doctrine this time.

Putting It All Together

P&P summarizes these passages this way: "The Lord will teach them the Word, and 
falsifications of the Word will be removed."

And how will the Lord do this? Let’s look at the steps outlined in our text:

1. The Lord will cause spiritual forces to "come to pass." His Divine influx will 
organize and put into place new beginnings, a fresh start with the states of 
the new heavens and the new church.

139

2. The good of love to the Lord (genuine truths) and the good of charity toward 

the neighbor will become the centerpiece of the church’s spiritual life.

3. The Lord will open the Word so that the particular truths from the Word will 
be illustrated. Knowledges and cognitions will be highlighted to the natural 
side of each person.

4. The particulars from the Word will be like an abundant fountain flowing into 

the heart and mind, bringing inspiration and great happiness.

5. The former sadness of Egypt and Edom will be no more. What was the 

sadness of Egypt and Edom? Egypt was the pride of intelligence, and Edom 
was the pride of self-love. What did these two bring to the church? The 
slaughter of innocence and the falsification of the Word.

6. The Lord, with His coming, will show what desolation and waste these two 

attitudes had while seeming to be in charge of the church.

7. The mountains will drip with "new wine." The hills will flow with "milk." The 
brooks of Judah shall be flooded with "water," and "a fountain shall flow from 
the house of the Lord." Is there any doubt as to what these things signify 
regarding the restoration of the Word and the Lord’s church with the new 
church?

The Lord will teach [us] the Word, and the falsification of the Word will be 
removed.

Read and Reflect

Read Joel 3:18-19.

Questions to Stimulate Reflection

1. Can we put some examples before us that represent Egypt’s love of self-

intelligence and Edom’s love of self?

2. Are any of the examples you picked examples of acts that do harm to the 

church and kill the innocent?

3. Think for a minute about some verse, chapter, or lesson from the Word that 

illustrates some special truth for you. What were your feelings when this part
of the Word opened up for you? Do the Writings give us that feeling of 

140

illustrating the truth? Do the Writings help us love the Lord and love the 
neighbor on a deeper level? How?

4. Once again, we have the positive voice of optimism and good winning out 

over evil. The Lord is taking away the falsity of hell, instructing us in the way 
of order. Isn’t it refreshing to read this message again and again?

JOEL 3:20-21

"But Judah shall abide forever and Jerusalem from generation to generation. For I will 
acquit them of the guilt of bloodshed, whom I had not acquitted; for the Lord dwells in 
Zion."

Passages From The Writings

P&P



"Then the church will be the Lord’s and from the Word."

AC 6239 [5]



"And in Joel…3:20…‘eternity’ is here predicated of Judah, because by Judah is 
represented the celestial church…and ‘generation and generation’ is 
predicated of Jerusalem, because by ‘Jerusalem’ is signified the spiritual 
church…"

AC 10248 [10]



"…Joel 3:20…Where by ‘Judah’ is signified the celestial church, of which it is 
therefore said, ‘according to the days of an age,’ is signified the spiritual 
church, of which it is said …‘to generation and generation.’"

AR 350



"…by ‘the tribe of Judah’ is signified celestial love, which is love to the Lord; 
but because they were such as to the Word, and as to the Lord, therefore by 
‘the tribe of Judah’ is also signified the opposite love, which is the love of self, 
properly the love of dominion from the love of self, which love is called 
diabolical love. That by ‘Judah’ and his tribe is signified the celestial kingdom 
and its love, which is love to the Lord, is evident from these passages…Joel 
3:20…"

141

Derived Doctrine

"…Judah shall abide forever…"

 The word "abide" in the New English Bible has been translated as "to remain 
united." This addition of the word "forever" certainly enhances the meaning. 
The celestial church (Judah) will remain forever united with the Lord.

"I will acquit them of the guilt of bloodshed, whom I had not acquitted…"

 The word "acquit" means to clear, purge, discharge as a debt, to pronounce as
not guilty, or to exculpate. Does the word "forgive" seem to apply as well?
"Guilt" involves rejecting good and truth (AC 5469).
"To shed blood" signifies offering violence to good (AC 3400).



 We have little help with "whom I had not acquitted." Does this mean that 

some people were not acquitted for all things of which they were guilty? Does
this indicate that some responsibility for allowing themselves to be led away 
from the Lord had yet to be cleared up?

 The promise is that the Lord will forgive (acquit) where there is a spirit of 

repentance.

"…for the Lord dwells in Zion."

 This is the closing statement of this prophecy; we must look here for the 
summation of all that preceded it. AE 594 [15] teaches that "‘The dwelling 
place of Mount Zion’ signifies the good of the celestial church…"
"Zion" signifies heaven and the church where the Lord alone is 
worshipped(AR 612). "Zion" signifies the advent of the Lord, and the 
establishment of the church by Him among those who are in the good of love 
(AE 433 [8]).



The prophecy of Joel began with the declaration that the Word had been devastated 
by the falsities of "the sensual man and afterwards evil therefrom," which 
"consumed all things of the church." The plague of the locusts dramatically 
illustrated this for us.

The last verse of Joel’s prophecy ends with an affirmation that all has been made 
right. Evil, the falsification of the Word, the power of self-intelligence, the power of 
self-love will not prevail against the Lord’s celestial church. The conjugial principle 
of Divine Love and Divine Truth will forever "abide" in the Lord’s New Church. With 
the Lord dwelling in Zion forever, the heavens and the church can rejoice and feel 
safe again.

The P&P summary of this closing verse triumphantly heralds the Lord’s message:

142

"Then the church will be the Lord’s and from the Word."

Putting It All Together

The closing statement, as outlined above, seems to pull things together. Forgiveness; 
acquittal; a returning of the faithful to a church where the Lord is at the center; the 
cleansing of the Word from all of the falsities the dead church had surrounded it 
with—these themes make quite a closing statement. The Lord is in His Heavens, and 
all is right with His people and His church.

Read and Reflect

Read the selection from P&P.

Read Joel 3:20-21.

Questions to Stimulate Reflection

1. These verses talk about acquittal for those who did violence to the Word. 

Does this strike you as an answer to those who try to portray the Lord as a 
hard and stern taskmaster? Isn’t there a sense of forgiveness that is needed 
when we err in our spiritual thoughts?

2. How will you go about reviewing the three chapters of Joel? Do you think you 
will use the Epilogue section to do this? The Epilogue can’t do it all for you, 
but it can form an outline for your review.

3. Do you think you might go back over some of the notes to pick out your 

favorite points? For instance, there is the section where the army of hell leaps
up the walls and breaks in through the windows. For all of their bravado and 
appearance of being in step, what was their end?

4. Or you might revisit that chapter where remains are defined in a way that I 

don’t recall ever hearing about in a class or lecture. Look at page 97. Read AC 
5897 [5 & 6]. Why is this a passage worth remembering?

5. What will you remember about the positive progression of this prophecy? 

Out of hellish disorder, the Lord’s Church rises with a sense of victory and joy.
How can we retain that feeling of hope in our daily battles against hell?

6.

I hope you have gained much from this study. I also hope it will inspire you to 
continue with the whole series of twelve study guides on the Minor Prophets. 
Our need is to study daily the Word of the Lord. Is this method helping you to 
achieve that reflection time with the Word?

Epilogue: A Summary of the Three Chapters of Joel

The following summary draws and expands on the outline given in the Summary 
Exposition of the Prophets and Psalms.

CHAPTER ONE

The message of the prophecy of Joel is for all people. It is a message that needs to be 
shared with our children, the children of our children, and their children to another 
generation.

What is the story the Lord, through the prophecy of Joel, wants us to tell them? We 
are to tell them about the dangers of the "sensual man." The sensual person is not 
interested in, nor cares for, spiritual things. The sensual person does not look toward
the life that awaits the soul after death. Immediate gratification is of greater 
importance to the sensual person, and therefore sensual people become vulnerable 
to a myriad of philosophical, scientific, and self-centered arguments that induce 
hateful and oppositional feelings toward the Lord and His Word. The falsity from the 
sensual person and afterwards the evil therefrom "consumes all things of the 
church."

The plagues of the four kinds of locust represent the intent of the spiritual attack 
hell waged on the Word. There are the "gnawers," the "swarmers," "the lickers," and 
"the consumers." With the terrifying sound of the beating of their wings, and 
numbers so great, they blocked out the light of the sun, they consumed all things in 
wave after wave of their attack. They stripped the external church, and its doctrines 
from the Word, bare.

A call for repentance was made by the Lord. The Lord provided examples of how the 
evil of the sensual people worked, and He illustrated the kind of destruction they 
brought to the church.

A call for mourning was issued by the Lord. He wanted the people to sincerely grieve
over the destruction of the goods and truths of the church.

The Lord delivered an exhortation to be converted and to reflect that the "day of the 
Lord" was at hand. The Lord announced the imminent approach of His advent. This 
advent was crucial because everything of the church was devastated, and thus, there 
were serious reasons to lament over the state of the Word and church.

144

CHAPTER TWO

Because the sensual people had destroyed the "whole church" with falsities and evil, 
it was time for the Lord to come and execute His judgment. The variety of insanities 
of the sensual people caused good and truth, and knowledges, to be dispersed.

The Lord was going to wage war against the sensual people. He blew the trumpet to 
sound the alarm. His approach would cause those who were opposed to Him to 
tremble. Upon the proud and resistant, there was to be a terrible judgment. The evil 
felt the approach of the Lord, and they did not want to lose their power.

So the evil took on the appearance of "steed horses." They hooked themselves up to 
chariots. They started fires in the stubble of the field. A call was made to form up a 
mighty army. They lined up in a formation and did not break rank. They lunged with 
their weapons, running throughout the city. They climbed the walls of the city, 
breaking through the windows of the houses like thieves.

The battle was not without some temporary negative aspects. The action of the 
sensual person caused the darkening of the sun and moon, and it made the stars of 
heaven fall from the sky.

Another call was made by the Lord to His people. He asked them to return to Him 
with "all your heart, with fasting, with weeping and mourning…Rend your hearts 
and not your garments." The exhortation here is to be converted and repent, and to 
be wise.

We are taught that the Lord will establish the church again; He will give it goods and 
truths, and He will remove evil and thus hell. The new church will have trust in the 
Lord and will acknowledge Him from the heart. The Divine of the Lord will fill those 
of the new church with all things, and He will vivify them. Falsities of evil and evils of
falsity will dissipate in the "day of His judgment." Those who acknowledge the Lord 
will be saved.

The theme of this chapter is a call to "awake," to hear the Word of the Lord and 
respond to His battle cry. For there is no doubt regarding the outcome of this battle: 
The Lord will, in the end, win the battle for His Word and His Church.

CHAPTER THREE

The church will be gathered together, and the great judgment will be executed upon 
those who resisted the Lord and were responsible for the scattering of the goods and
truths of the church. Those who sought to separate the conjugial principle with their
focus on faith "alone" and knowledges "alone," and who thereby had destroyed the 
Word and doctrine, would face the consequences of their decisions. The light of 
heaven would be restored. The sun, moon, and stars would be seen again.

145

We are taught that the Lord’s Divine Love and Divine Wisdom will be too much for 
the evil. In His presence, their evil will be consummated. Their reign of terror, their 
variety of insanities and boastful claims will be removed under the guidance of our 
powerful and loving Lord.

For the remnant, there will be a spirit of newness in the truth taught to them. They 
will be acquitted, lifted, and forgiven. A new form of illustration of the truths of the 
Word will enter their life. Forgiveness will be extended to those who made errors of 
judgment and had misunderstood the Word. Let us listen to the closing statement of 
the Writings regarding the outcome of this great judgment:

Then the church "will be the Lord’s" and the church will be "from the Word."

Until these events occur, Joel 3:10 reminds us that we are to remain very courageous:

"Let the weak say, ‘I am strong.’"

146
