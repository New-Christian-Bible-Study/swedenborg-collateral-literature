years' reading and study in the Heavenly Doctrines, Bishop W. F. Pendleton =
made notes on various subjects which especially interested him, intending a=
t some future time to write upon them. The opportunity to do this came when=
 his retirement from office had afforded him greater leisure. He then turne=
d to these memoranda and began a series of short articles under the title o=
f "Topics from the Writings" which he contributed to NEW CHURCH LIFE. The f=
irst appeared in October, 1921, and their favorable reception encouraged th=
e author to continue writing them until thirty-six monthly installments had=
 been published, the concluding article appearing in November, 1926. In res=
ponse to the wish expressed by many who found the "Topics" of exceptional i=
nterest and value, the whole series is now reprinted in book form, with the=
 addition of an Index of Subjects which provides a ready means of reference=
 to the wide range of subjects dealt with in the volume.</p><p>ABBREVIATED =

</p><p>TOPICS FROM THE WRITINGS</p><p>I</p><p>The Need and Use of the Memor=
abilia.</p><p>In the Spiritual Diary (4123), we are told that the Memorabil=
ia, or revelations concerning the spiritual world, are in the place of mira=
cles, and that unless men read, and believe, and are affected by them, they=
 will be unwilling to hear anything of the interiors of the Word. And in th=
e Apocalypse Explained (410), we read of the importance of knowing what is =
in the spiritual world, in order to understand the internal sense. The Memo=
rabilia stand related to the historicals of the literal sense, which are th=
e first introduction to the spiritual truth of the Word. It may be said tha=
t the Memorabilia are the historicals of the spiritual world. They are the =
first thing for new receivers of the Doctrine to learn, and the first to be=
 imparted to children and the young.</p><p>Swedenborg advised to leave out =
the Memorabilia.</p><p>Swedenborg was urged by Count H=C3=B6pken not to inc=
lude the Memorabilia in his Writings, but he answered that he was commanded=
 by the Lord to publish them (Documents, I: p. 66; II: 409, 416). Cuno wrot=
e Swedenborg to the same effect (Doc. II: 469). The Writings, or the intern=
al sense of the Word, without the revelations concerning the spiritual worl=
d, would be like a house without doors, into which there can be no entrance=
; or like the spiritual sense without the letter as introductory to it. The=
 historicals of the two worlds, as contained in the two revelations, are th=
e things which introduce to the mysteries of the Word, without which the Wo=
rd and heaven itself would be sealed forever.  </p><p></p><div align=3D"Rig=

</p><p>The Language of the Angels in the Memorabilia.</p><p>Does Swedenborg=
 reproduce the language of the angels in relating the arcana of the spiritu=
al world? This is the appearance, but in reality he translates their though=
t, using his own language. Angelic thought is expressed in angelic speech, =
which is not in any language of the world; but descending into the natural =
of a man, it takes on the form of his language. Thus angels and spirits mak=
e use of the language of the man to whom they speak. (A. C. 1637, 10752; H.=
 H. 255; C. L. 3264; S. D. 3157, and elsewhere.) Concerning himself in this=
 connection, Swedenborg says, "I collected into a summary these things from=
 their discourse." (C. L. 183.) His habit in this respect has been used to =
cast doubt on the revelation, notably in the case of Emerson.</p><p>What ar=
e Temptations?</p><p>The ordinary idea of temptation is that it is "a state=
 of being tempted or enticed to evil," and while this is true as far as it =
goes, it does not present a full idea of temptation as given in the Writing=
s. The word means trial, and this is the meaning that is followed everywher=
e in the Heavenly Doctrine. It is the trial a man suffers when he resists e=
vil or the delight of evil to which he is inclined. Evil spirits are in thi=
s, his delight. The exciting of his evil delight is their mode of assault u=
pon man's spiritual life. But the angels inspire him to resistance. He is t=
hen as if torn between two forces; and the trial or suffering, that is, the=
 temptation, is at times exceeding great. Temptation, then, is the sufferin=
g which the regenerating man endures when he resists the delight of evil as=
 of himself from the Lord. Natural trial, though it appears so great, is as=
 nothing when compared with spiritual temptation.  </p><p></p><div align=3D=

</p><p>The Grievous Temptations of the Lord in the Human.</p><p>That the te=
mptations of the Lord were far greater than any man can endure, is taught t=
hroughout the Writings, and treated of at large in the spiritual sense of t=
he Psalms and Prophets. For instance, this: "I am... like the slain that li=
e in the grave, whom Thou rememberest no more.... Thou hast laid me in the =
lowest pit, in darkness, in the deeps." (Psalm 88: 5, 6.) These words signi=
fy that "He seemed to Himself to be in hell among the damned, so atrocious =
and enormous were the temptations which the Lord sustained." (A. E. 659.) S=
o great was His love for the salvation of mankind! It is thus that He made =
Himself in His Human our Father in heaven, the same Father whom we address =
in the Lord's Prayer, and in all the prayers of the church. Eternity cannot=
 suffice to fulfill the measure of human gratitude! For if He had not come =
to save, all would have perished in eternal death. The human race would hav=
e ceased to exist.</p><p>What it is to Love the Lord.</p><p>In the Gospel o=
f John it is plainly taught that to love the Lord is to love to do His comm=
andments. "If ye love me, keep my commandments." (14:15.) He that hath my c=
ommandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me." (14:21.) "If a man=
 love me, he will keep my words." (14:23.) "If ye keep my commandments, ye =
shall abide in my love." (15:10.) "Ye are my friends, if ye do whatsoever I=
 command you." In the Writings we are also taught, as involved in the above=
, that to love the Lord is to love His Word and doctrine from it, to love g=
ood and have aversion to evil, to love use, to love His kingdom, to love Hi=
s Providence,--all based on loving to do His commandments. To love the Writ=
ings is also to love the Lord, for they are the Lord in His Second Coming. =

</p><p>What it is to Love the Neighbor.</p><p>It is interesting to note tha=
t love towards the neighbor rests upon the same basis as love to the Lord; =
for "love towards the neighbor is the love of obeying the Lord's commandmen=
ts." (A. R. 356.) But the differentiation follows in the teaching that love=
 towards the neighbor is especially the love of obeying the commandments th=
at are contained in the second table of the Decalogue; as, "Thou shalt not =
kill," "Thou shall not commit adultery," etc. The first table is the Lord's=
 table, but the second is also His; for it is the Lord in the neighbor that=
 is to be loved. The two tables are the same as the two great commandments,=
 on which "hang all the law and the prophets." And we read that "all things=
 of the doctrine of the New Jerusalem relate to love to the Lord and love t=
oward the neighbor." (A. R. 903.) Readers of the Doctrine should note also =
the distinction between the terms "love" and "charity." By "love" is meant =
love to the Lord, and by "charity," love to the neighbor (Faith 22); and it=
 is added, "There is with man no love to the Lord but in charity." For "in =
charity the Lord conjoins Himself with man." (Ibid. See the same in A. R. 9=
03.) The one love cannot exist without the other. (T. C. R. 456.)</p><p>Lov=
ing the Neighbor more than Self.</p><p>It is thought that to love the neigh=
bor as one's self is the highest exercise of human love; but we are told th=
at if men would be as the angels they would love the neighbor more than sel=
f, and that in celestial love there is nothing of the love of self. (A. C. =
548, 2196; H. H. 406; S. D. 3906.) Such a love does indeed appear among men=
, or an imitation of it; as where husbands or wives are willing to die for =
each other, where a mother will suffer hunger that her children may have fo=
od, where a man is willing to die that his country may be free, where one i=
s willing to serve others for their sake and not his own, where a host and =
hostess will give preference to guests over themselves.  </p><p></p><div al=

 This love, or the appearance of it, is what constitutes a gentleman and a =
lady. It is the most complete image of the Lord's love in coming into the w=
orld and suffering death that men might live in heaven forever. It is the l=
ove that is meant by the "new commandment" which He gave to His disciples, =
"that ye love one another, as I have loved you. Greater love hath no man th=
an this, that a man lay down his life for his friends." (John 13:34; 15:12,=
 13.)</p><p>Three Kinds of Love towards the Neighbor.</p><p>"There are thre=
e kinds of love which constitute the celestial things of the Lord's kingdom=
, namely, conjugial love, love towards infants, and the love of society, or=
 mutual love. Of all these, conjugial love is the principal, for it has in =
it the end of the greatest use, namely, the propagation of the human race, =
and thereby of the Lord's kingdom, of which the human race is the seminary.=
 Love towards infants follows next, being derived from conjugial love. Afte=
rwards succeeds the love of society, or mutual love." (A. C. 2039.) These t=
hree are based on keeping the second table of the Decalogue or shunning the=
 evils mentioned therein, especially the evil of adultery. But they are nau=
ght unless the first table is also kept, or unless the Lord Jesus Christ is=
 acknowledged and worshipped as the one God, from whom alone is all power t=
o shun evil and do good; and unless a man looks to Him, he has no power aga=
inst the evils inspired by infernal spirits. The one hope, and the great ho=
pe, is to pray for help, and then struggle to resist as of one's self from =
the Lord. To those who do this, all things of human and angelic good are po=
ssible.</p><p>Does the Spiritual Sun appear in all the Heavens?</p><p>We ar=
e told in the Arcana Celestia (6832) that "the Lord appears as a sun to the=
 angels of the inmost heaven, as a moon to the angels of the middle heaven,=
 and as light to the angels of the ultimate heaven." Are we to understand f=
rom this that the Lord is never seen as a sun in the lower heavens?  </p><p=

 The answer is given in the Divine Love and Wisdom (85): "The angels of the=
 third heaven see that sun continually, the angels of the second heaven ver=
y often, and the angels of the ultimate heaven sometimes." Herein is illust=
rated the importance of a comparison of passages in the study of any subjec=
t in the Writings.</p><p>The Essential of Happiness in Married Life.</p><p>=
"He who is in love truly conjugial loves what the other thinks and what the=
 other wills." (A. C. 10169.) It is added that they thus become as one man,=
 and that this is what is meant by the words of the Lord, that "they are no=
 longer two, but one flesh," that is, one will. We read further that "there=
 is freedom to each when one loves what the other thinks and what the other=
 wills. Hence the will to rule in marriages destroys genuine love, for it t=
akes away its freedom and its delights." (10173.) What is here said calls f=
or effort, and yields to cultivation as a garden of flowers; and the basis =
of it all is in looking to the Lord and shunning evils as sins against Him.=
</p><p>Where are we to look for the Increase of the Church?</p><p>In the Ar=
cana Celestia (1610) the teaching is, that the multiplication of the Lord's=
 kingdom will be, "not only from those who are within the church, and their=
 children, but also from those who are without the church, and their childr=
en." And their children! This stands as a distinct teaching as to the sourc=
e of increase. It will be mostly from the children. But to be genuine, a sp=
iritual increase must precede. There must be a spiritual faith and a spirit=
ual intelligence with the parents. It is from parents, and later from teach=
ers and ministers, that children draw the inspiration to spiritual life. Th=
e increase will then be like that of the seed of Abram, which was to multip=
ly "as the dust of the earth," "as the sand of the sea," and "as the stars =
of heaven." (See 1610.)  </p><p></p><div align=3D"Right">7</div><hr><p>

</p><p>II</p><p>The Lord does not need the help of man.</p><p>It is a commo=
n fallacy that the Lord is in need of human help. But we read that "the Lor=
d has need of no one." (A. C. 587.) Also, that "the Lord acts mediately thr=
ough the heavens, not because He needs help, but that the angels may have f=
unctions and offices, and consequently life and happiness according to thei=
r offices and uses." (A. C. 8719. See also 6482.) He did not need any one w=
hen He came into the world. (Isaiah 63.) That He does not need the help of =
man, may be seen when we reflect that He has ah power, all knowledge, and i=
s everywhere present. He does not need man, but man needs work that he may =
live. He needs the Lord in work; for the Lord is not present except in work=
 or use; which means that the Lord is present only where there is love to t=
he neighbor.</p><p>The Creation of the First Man.</p><p>That the Lord does =
not need the help of man, is illustrated in what is revealed concerning the=
 creation of the first man. "The first man, and those born at first, were n=
ot led by any other than the Lord alone. For the Lord is all in all.... He =
alone sustains the human race; like as formerly, but now by mediate angels =
and spirits, as also immediately, without angels and spirits." (S. D. 2591.=
) Thus the Lord Himself cared and provided for the first man created, both =
internally and externally, without the help of any man, spirit, or angel; f=
or none such existed. "The Lord is the All in all." "He hath need of no one=
." But men are in need of use on earth and in heaven.</p><p>Removal of Evil=
 and Falsity.</p><p>An interesting fact is revealed, and important to be kn=
own, that evils and falsities are removed while man is reading the Word.  <=

 "With those who believe these things, and love it to be so, all evil and f=
alsity are removed while reading the Word, because the Lord then enlightens=
 and leads them.... These are they who understand the Word, and are affecte=
d by the truths from it, and also love to live according to them." (A. C. 1=
0638.) It is made clear that this is done with those who acknowledge the Lo=
rd and keep His commandments in their daily life. These are they that "read=
 the Word holily" (A. C. 9280), that is, in a sphere of holy worship. This =
applies both to individual and collective reading, or to both private and p=
ublic worship. Evil spirits dare not approach where there is the delight of=
 the affection of truth. This is the delight that is active when the Word i=
s read "holily." Falsities are then removed, and the evils that are in them=
. In view of this, both mind and body at such a time should be in a state o=
f rest.</p><p>No Regeneration in Sickness.</p><p>In the Divine Providence (=
142), the following statement is made: "No one is reformed in a state of bo=
dily disease, because the reason is then not in a free state; for the state=
 of the mind depends on the state of the body. When the body is sick, the m=
ind is also sick, by removal from the world.... For the mind removed from t=
he world thinks indeed concerning God, but not from God, for it is not in f=
reedom of reason.... But he may be confirmed, if he was reformed before he =
fell sick." From what is here said, and in the context, it is made plain th=
at regeneration cannot go on when, from any cause such as sickness, a man i=
s removed from the active life of the world, and thus rendered unable to pe=
rform uses; for an active devotion to a life of use is the basis and founda=
tion of all regeneration. An unhealthy condition of the body that does not =
remove one from his daily work is not meant. (Compare D. L. W. 330.)  </p><=

</p><p>Christian Paganism.</p><p>"If, at the end of the church, they do not=
 approach the Lord Himself, and live according to His commandments, they ar=
e left by the Lord; and when they are left by the Lord, they become as paga=
ns who have no religion; and then the Lord is with those only who are of Hi=
s New Church." (A. R. 750.) This teaching exhibits the fact that Christian =
paganism is with those who have rejected the dogmas of the former Christian=
 Church, and with it all revelation and all religion, living for the world =
alone, and cherishing its delights. The number of these is steadily increas=
ing. It is of such the Lord speaks when He says, "It were better for him th=
at a millstone were hanged about his neck, and he were drowned in the depth=
 of the sea." (Matt. 18:6.) It is better to be wholly immersed in the life =
of the world than to remain in the church and profane holy things. Some may=
 be drawn even out of this state and finally be saved (C. L. 351, 536); and=
 it is shown (T. C. R. 525) how a man may be rescued from Christian paganis=
m and become truly Christian.  </p><p></p><div align=3D"Right">10</div><hr>=

</p><p>Athens and Sparta.</p><p>New Churchmen are delighted when they read =
of the visit to the heaven of ancient Greeks, and learn that many of their =
great minds are there, especially those of Athens. (T. C. R. 692-694.) Spar=
ta was distinguished for military efficiency, but Athens for intellectual c=
ulture. The great philosophers were there. Sparta left little to the genera=
tions following, but the heritage of Athens has enriched the thought of the=
 world from that time to the present. Sparta conquered Athens after a war o=
f twenty-seven years, but both went down under the Roman power. The intelle=
ctual life of Athens remained, and conquered Rome itself. It has been said =
that there were more great minds in Athens, in the period from the victory =
of Marathon to the close of the Peloponnesian war, than has ever existed at=
 one time, and at any one place, in the history of the world. What is of in=
terest to New Churchmen is, that while the Jewish nation was the means used=
 in the Providence of the Lord for His first coming, the Greeks were instru=
mental in the preparation for His second coming. The intellectual thought a=
nd life of Greece, handed down through the ages, prepared the mind of Europ=
e for the time when it should become lawful for the understanding to enter =
into the mysteries of faith. (T. C. R. 508.)</p><p>Idleness the Devil's Pil=
low.</p><p>The idea of idleness as an evil has taken form in proverbs in va=
rious nations. There are several in English. The above is the form used in =
Sweden, and is quoted in the Writings. (S. D. 6072; A. E. 831; D. Wis. XI: =
4; C. 168.) Evil spirits enter and take possession when the mind is not det=
ermined to use. For "idleness is a life of the love of self and of the worl=
d." (A. E. 1226.) "It is the root of all evil." (S. D. 6088.) "A man is not=
 of a healthy mind, unless use is his affection and occupation." (D. Love X=
V.) Like all things natural, idleness has a spiritual origin, which in this=
 case is a false idea of eternal rest in heaven. (A. C. 454; H. H. 403; D. =
Min. 4805; A. E. 1194.) But temporary idleness, or leisure, for the refresh=
ing of the body and mind in some form of recreation, is necessary and a pos=
itive good. (C. L. 5; T. C. R. 434; A. E. 1194, 1226; Charity 189.) It mini=
sters to a sound mind in a sound body. (A. C. 6936.)</p><p>Preservation of =
Order in the World.</p><p>In the Spiritual Diary (2323), under the heading =
that "The Lord rules the Universe," we are told that disturbances in the wo=
rld of spirits are not allowed to extend beyond certain limits, and that eq=
uilibrium is quickly restored. Then it is added that "this may be evident f=
rom the human race, and the fact that the greatest disturbance does not ext=
end itself widely." The Lord does not permit that any destructive evil, suc=
h as war, famine, or pestilence, should become universal, and bring an end =
to the human race.  </p><p></p><div align=3D"Right">11</div><hr><p>

 This is especially true since the Last Judgment has been performed, and th=
e New Church, which is the New Jerusalem, is about to be established. This =
truth stands as a guiding star in the midst of any great disturbance like t=
hat of the late war.</p><p>Why Ex Post Facto Laws are Contrary to Order.</p=
><p>Ex post facto,--that is, "after the deed is done,"--is a legal phrase u=
sed in reference to a law that is passed to punish a crime after it has bee=
n committed. By a constitutional provision, no legislative body is now perm=
itted to pass such a law. This prohibitive principle has its origin in a la=
w of the spiritual world. No one is punished in that world for evils he has=
 done here, but for those he does there. The evil state acquired returns af=
ter death, and leads him to do similar deeds. For these he is punished, but=
 not for those done in the former life. (See A. E. 989; S. D. 3489.) If he =
then refrains from committing them, there will be no punishment. In this we=
 find the origin of the prohibition of ex post facto laws. A perception of =
the laws of the spiritual world is given when the mind thinks of use.</p><p=
>"Vengeance is Mine."</p><p>Paul advised the Roman Christians not to return=
 evil for evil, saying among other things, "Vengeance is mine; I will repay=
, saith the Lord." (Romans 12:19.) Similar words occur in Deuteronomy 32: 3=
5, and elsewhere. The operative effect of the laws of Divine order upon the=
 evil appears like vengeance, but it is evil reacting upon itself, or evil =
punishing itself. The Lord never exercises vengeance upon anyone, though it=
 so appears in the letter of the Word. Nor has man any need to return evil =
for evil, return, we make ourselves like unto him.  </p><p></p><div align=

 To cherish resentment is to cherish the desire for revenge. It is a saying=
 that "revenge is sweet." It is as a sweet morsel upon the tongue. But see =
the infernal nature of the delight of revenge, as described in the Spiritua=
l Diary 1488-1497, 5096-5098, and elsewhere in the Writings.</p><p>Can ther=
e be Error in a Divine Revelation?</p><p>The question answers itself at onc=
e in the negative. Yet there are those who have found errors in the Writing=
s. Let a single example illustrate. Swedenborg says (A. C. 10300) that salt=
 will cause oil and water to mix. "It will not do so," says one, "for I hav=
e placed oil and water in a vessel, and stirred in a portion of salt. Since=
 the oil and water did not mix, I conclude that Swedenborg is mistaken." Bu=
t wait a little. The Divine canon of criticism is to look to what is meant =
more than to what is said (John 7:24), even in judging human utterance. Swe=
denborg is speaking of the physiological effect of salt. It was a fact earl=
y known to him, that "salts copulate all parts of the blood." (E. A. K. I:9=
1, 92.) Salt is not only conjunctive, but also preservative, and preservati=
ve because it is conjunctive. The correspondence of salt, its spiritual sen=
se, rests upon the basis of its conjunctive power.</p><p>Inquisition into t=
he Life of Others.</p><p>"It is not angelic to inquire into the evils apper=
taining to a man, unless the goods are inquired into at the same time." (A.=
 C. 10381.) The angels rejoice to see good in another, whereas those who ar=
e in no charity, but in the love of self, consequently in hatred of others,=
 rejoice to find evil. These "see nothing in their neighbor but his evils, =
and if they observe any good; they either regard it as nothing, or interpre=
t it as evil; it is altogether otherwise with those who are in charity.... =
These scarcely see another's evils, but observe all that is good and true i=
n him, and interpret favorably what is evil and false.  </p><p></p><div ali=

 Such or injury for injury. The wicked will suffer in the end the consequen=
ces of their own evil,--a punishment far greater than any we can inflict. I=
f we do evil to him in are all the angels, and this disposition they derive=
 from the Lord, who bends all evils to good." (A. C. 1079.) This teaching i=
s so plain that it requires no further comment; nor does that which now fol=
lows: "They who are dragons, although they make no account of the life, yet=
 accuse the faithful in the spiritual world, if they observe in them any ev=
il of ignorance; for they inquire into their life, in order that they may r=
eproach and condemn, and hence they are called the accusers (of our brethre=
n). (A. E. 746. See also A. C. 751, 761, 5031, 6097, 8159, 8960.) Those who=
 are ruled by this spirit of accusation are they who crucify the Lord. They=
 see naught but evil in the works of His Providence and nothing but error o=
r falsity in Divine Revelation. They are the false witnesses that rose up t=
o condemn the Lord. (Matt. 26:60.)  </p><p></p><div align=3D"Right">14</div=

</p><p>III</p><p>The Natural Sun is Dead.</p><p>When the term "dead" is use=
d, it is customary to think of the bodies of men and animals when life has =
become extinct. But it is a word with a broader meaning, even in common dis=
course; for it is used to express what is inanimate, motionless, etc. This =
broader view is much more widely extended in the Writings. "The sun of the =
natural world ... is dead; and nature, because it derives its origin from t=
hat sun, is dead." (D. L. W. 157.) And what is dead is that which "does not=
 act of itself, but is acted upon." (Ibid.) The appearance of life in natur=
e, in the form of force and motion, is thus accounted for. Nature does not =
act, but is acted upon. Although all things of nature are dead, "still they=
 are encompassed by the spiritual things which inflow from the sun of the s=
piritual world." (D. L. W. 158.) Natural substances are acted upon by the f=
orces of the spiritual world, and the former, being dead, resist and react.=
 (D. L. W. 260.) The action which the senses observe in nature is thus naug=
ht but reaction to spiritual forces.</p><p>There is no life in the natural =
particle, but there is life around it, or living force girding it about, pr=
essing upon it, producing the appearance of motion.</p><p>The Worship of th=
e Sun.</p><p>From the teaching above adduced we are able to see that "of al=
l the forms of the worship of God, the worship of the sun is the lowest, fo=
r it is altogether dead, like the sun itself." (D. L. W. 157.) But the wors=
hip of the sun with the primitive Gentile is less harmful than the like wor=
ship in modern science. This, too, is worship of the sun, or of nature from=
 the sun; and men confirm themselves in it by "scientifics unknown to the a=
ncients."  </p><p></p><div align=3D"Right">15</div><hr><p>

 The primitive man is more excusable than those who sin in the light of Chr=
istian revelation. It is especially their worship that is "altogether dead,=
" and "is called 'abomination' in the Word." (D. L. W. 157.)</p><p>The exte=
rnal worship of the sun is also the lowest or most external of all the form=
s of worship; but in the worship of images of the human form there is prese=
rved some idea of God as a Man,--the one supreme thing that makes worship a=
 living and salvable quantity, and without which no one can be led to adore=
 the Lord Jesus Christ as God.</p><p>Vital Heat.</p><p>It is known to physi=
ologists that there is a vital heat, but it is not known what it is in itse=
lf. It has been observed that the normal heat of the body is about ninety-e=
ight degrees Fahrenheit. But the real cause of this cannot be known without=
 revelation. The subject of vital heat is referred to frequently in the Wri=
tings, and we are told that, in itself, it is love from the spiritual sun, =
in which the Lord is. (See D. L. W. 95, 379, and elsewhere.) Men of science=
, without revelation, ascribe the origin of vital heat to the natural sun. =
But there is nothing vital or living in the natural sun, as the Writings fr=
equently declare; and since that sun is not living, it cannot produce life.=
 Spiritual heat, or love from the spiritual sun, descends into the interior=
s of the body, and joins itself with natural heat, producing what is called=
 vital heat.</p><p>There is vital heat in the animal kingdom generally, and=
 to some extent even in the vegetable kingdom.</p><p>"What News from Earth?=

 We learn from the Book of the Acts (17:21) that the Athenians spent their =
time in the market place "either in telling or in hearing some new thing." =
And Adam Clarke, in his Commentary, quotes Thucydides and Demosthenes as sa=
ying the same of their countrymen. He notes also the existence of this habi=
t in the modern world, giving rise to the newspapers of our day. We are not=
 surprised, then, to read that "the spirits of our earth are curious, and d=
esire to know many things, especially such as are terrestrial and material.=
 (S. D. 1435.)</p><p>But habits formed in the world become spiritual after =
death with the good. Hence the ancient sages have now little interest in th=
e natural doings of men, but much as to the state of the church on earth. W=
hen they inquire, "What news from earth?" their thoughts are not determined=
 to civil and political affairs, but to the things of spiritual intelligenc=
e, and they lament when they hear of the state now existing with men.</p><p=
>Curiosity.</p><p>The state of mind as evinced by the Greek philosophers, n=
ow in heaven, in questioning newcomers concerning the present state of the =
world, may be expressed by the term curiosity, using that word in its legit=
imate application. Curiosity is defined as a "disposition to inquire, inves=
tigate, or seek after knowledge." This is not necessarily a bad thing, and =
we find the Writings speaking of both a good and an evil curiosity; the one=
 leading to wisdom, and the other to folly. It is at first, as with childre=
n, a mere curiosity, and nothing more; but afterwards a spirit of inquiry i=
s aroused, which may lead to a desire to know the spiritual things of the W=
ord.</p><p>When curiosity is stirred in children, to know what is beyond th=
eir physical environment, an opportunity is given parents to interest them =
in spiritual things, by suitable answers to their simple questions, avoidin=
g elaborate explanations, not using abstract terms as yet, for these confus=
e rather than clarify.  </p><p></p><div align=3D"Right">17</div><hr><p>

</p><p>The Abstract and the Concrete.</p><p>Children and primitive men cann=
ot comprehend terms expressive of abstract thought. The growth of the mind =
is in its ability to ascend into the realm of abstract thinking. "He who ca=
nnot think abstractedly from material things cannot comprehend anything of =
the spiritual sense of the Word." (A. C. 9407. A. E. 653(10).) For this rea=
son, "abstract speech is angelic speech." (A. C. 8985.) To see truth in abs=
tract light is necessary to an interior acknowledgment of the Lord, to see =
Him as a Man, not so much as a Person, but as Love and Wisdom. It is the as=
cent of the mind above time and space. In this the intelligence of the anci=
ent Sophi consisted, and it is the essence of angelic wisdom. But children =
and primitive races do not rise at once into this interior region of though=
t.</p><p>They can reach it only by a gradual process of mental development.=
 There must be accommodation to their simple states of thought.</p><p>The a=
bstract is the rational, and there is a natural rational and a spiritual ra=
tional, the former for the world and the latter for heaven.</p><p>Civilizat=
ion, Ancient and Modern.</p><p>The rise of civilization among the Greeks an=
d Romans was marked by an increase in the use of abstract terms. In the Dar=
k Ages there was a return, a descent, to the concrete of the primitive nati=
ons, who invaded from the North. The writings of Plate, Zenophon, Aristotle=
, Cicero, and others, lay in the cellars of the monasteries unread for cent=
uries. Modern civilization arose when men began again to read the books of =
the ancients, by which the human mind was to be prepared to rise from the c=
oncrete or literal sense of the Word--in which there are but few abstract t=
erms--to a contemplation of its spiritual glories as given in the Writings =
of the New Church, which are replete with abstract terms, in an abundance s=
carcely dreamed of, even by the ancient writers.  </p><p></p><div align=3D"=

</p><p>Jesting from the Word.</p><p>In the Writings, the evil of jesting fr=
om the Word is treated of, and shown to be profane. (A. C. 961; D. P. 231; =
S. D. 1304; A. E. 1064.) We are told that it is a habit which goes with man=
 into the other life, and is not removed except after severe punishment. "T=
he Word is the very Divine Truth of the Lord with men, and the Lord is in i=
t, and also heaven.... Wherefore, to jest from the Word, and concerning the=
 Word, is to sprinkle the holy things of heaven with the dust of the earth.=
" (A. E. 1064.) For such jesting contains in it contempt for holy things. H=
ow common this evil is, is well known. But in the New Church we are to heed=
 the Divine admonition and cultivate reverence, even for the copies of the =
Word, and lead our children to do likewise. Reverence for the Word as a boo=
k will open the way to reverence for that which it contains, and for the Lo=
rd who is in the Word, and who is the Word.</p><p>Good Conduct.</p><p>Is go=
od conduct what is meant by a good life in the Writings? Only in a small de=
gree. Good conduct is not life itself, but the effect of life. It is the ou=
tward appearance of the life within. The thought from the intention of the =
will is the real plane of man's life. It is where evils are to be shunned. =
It is where the true worship of God is.</p><p>We see, then, what is meant w=
hen it is said that the truth is to be applied to life. When evils are shun=
ned in mind and heart, the conduct takes care of itself. The angels pay lit=
tle heed to the conduct of man, but look to the intentions of his will. (A.=
 E. 185.) It follows that we are not to regard the conduct of another as th=
e necessary expression of his real life. It may or may not be. We cannot kn=
ow. It is in the other world that men are known by what they say and do, ha=
rdly in this.  </p><p></p><div align=3D"Right">19</div><hr><p>

</p><p>IV</p><p>The Rarity of Love Truly Conjugial.</p><p>"Love truly conju=

t it is." (C. L. 58, 59.) And it is "rare in the Christian world, because f=
ew there approach the Lord." (C. L. 337.) But while "spiritual conjugial lo=
ve is not given, except with a very few in the Christian world, still it ca=
n be given there." (C. L. 369.) Although it is so rare, still "it is capabl=
e of being raised up again by the God of heaven, who is the Lord." (C. L. 7=
8.) And "love truly conjugial cannot be given, except with those who are of=
 the Christian Church." (C. L. 337.) For "a Christian has the faculty, abov=
e a man who is not a Christian, that he can be regenerated, and thus become=
 spiritual, and also acquire love truly conjugial." (C. L. 339.) And since =
this love "was inspired into our first parents, it is capable of being insp=
ired into Christians." (C. L. 112.) And further, that "the inclination to l=
ove one of the sex, and the faculty of receiving that love, is implanted in=
 Christians from birth, because that love is from the Lord alone, and has b=
een made a matter of religion" (C. L. 466); that is, Christians have made m=
arriage to be a sacrament of the church. Therefore, the means are provided,=
 and the conditions exist, by which love truly conjugial may be implanted i=
n the Christian world, although few among the many will take advantage of t=
he opportunity presented to them; but with those few the New Church can be =
established.</p><p>The Christian Conjugial.</p><p>"The Christian conjugial =
only is given chaste; ... and by the Christian conjugial is meant the marri=
age of one man with one wife." (C. L. 142.) And "the chaste is predicated o=
nly of monogamic marriages." (C. L. 141.)  </p><p></p><div align=3D"Right">=

 The Christian conjugial was established by the Lord Himself at the foundin=
g of the Christian Church. (Matthew 19:5, 6.) From that time "it has been l=
awful for Christians to marry but one wife." (C. L. 338.) Hence monogamic m=
arriage has been established by law in all Christian countries. In fact, Eu=
rope became the field of Christian evangelization, because monogamic marria=
ge already existed there. The Christian Church could not be established in =
Asia, because of polygamy. And so it follows that "love truly conjugial can=
not be given, except with those of the Christian Church; therefore, also, p=
olygamy is there altogether condemned." (C. L. 337.) Also, that "the genuin=
e conjugial is more deeply inscribed on the minds of Christians than on the=
 minds of Gentiles, who have embraced polygamy." (C. L. 338.) What is the r=
eason why "there is not given a chaste conjugial, except in the Christian w=
orld, and that if it is not given, still it can be given"? (C. L. 142.) It =
is not because of the fact of monogamic marriage alone, but because conjugi=
al love is from the Lord; and since the Lord is known to Christians, He can=
 be approached and worshipped as God, which is not the case outside the Chr=
istian world. (C. L. 337.) It follows that the New Church can exist in the =
Christian world, and gradually increase (A. R. 547; A. E. 730-732), but not=
 with the people of Gentile lands until they become Christian by acknowledg=
ing the Lord and rejecting polygamy.</p><p>An Adulterous Generation.</p><p>=
The Lord speaks of the Jewish nation as "an adulterous and sinful generatio=
n." (Mark 8: 38, Matthew 12:39 and 16:4). This was because of their adulter=
ation and falsification of the Word. (A. R. 134.) There is both spiritual a=
dultery and natural adultery. The former is the cause, and the latter the e=
ffect. The cause produces the effect, and the effect reacts upon the cause.=
 He who is in the one is potentially in the other. What is said of the Jewi=
sh Church is true of every vastated church.  </p><p></p><div align=3D"Right=

 It applies with even greater force to the Christian Church than to the Jew=
ish; for, because of a more interior revelation, it has been guilty of more=
 interior falsification of the Word. Hence the universal prevalence of the =
sphere of adulterous love. It infests every man born into the world, which =
is the reason why "love truly conjugial is at this day so rare that it is n=
ot known what it is, and scarce that it is." Still, love truly conjugial is=
 possible to Christians, and to those who become Christian. In addition to =
the reasons given above, there is the fact of a more interior revelation to=
 Christians, and the momentous fact that the Lord has made His Second Comin=
g in the Christian world; so that love truly conjugial is now within the re=
ach of every Christian man. All that is necessary is for him to shun adulte=
ry as a deadly sin, looking to the Lord God the Savior for help in the comb=
at against the evil forces rising up from hell, which act with tremendous p=
ower to destroy the true love of marriage. Without the help of the Lord aga=
inst this power, vain will be the help of man.</p><p>Agencies at Work.</p><=
p>The sphere of adulterous love is universal; but it is to be remembered th=
at the sphere of conjugial love is also universal (C. L. 222, 387), and tha=
t everyone will feel it, especially in the age of youth and early manhood. =
Both spheres have their agencies at work. The agencies operating from the u=
niversal sphere of conjugial love are: 1. The teaching of the Lord in Genes=
is (2:24) and in Matthew (19: 4-6). 2. The teaching and practice of the chu=
rch looking to monogamic marriage. 3. The laws of the State, requiring the =
same. 4. Literature, especially poetry and fiction. 5. Public opinion favor=
ing such marriage. 6. The universal conjugial sphere flowing into the nativ=
e love of the sex with the young of both sexes, inspiring them to desire an=
d to seek for one with whom there can be union of heart and soul.  </p><p><=

 7. This universal sphere endeavors to implant itself wherever there is a g=
round of reception. The universal sphere of adulterous love is also present=
 where all the above agencies are at work, endeavoring to falsify, pervert,=
 and destroy. It is in the free choice of the individual to receive and bre=
athe the one sphere or the other. And it is in the free choice of the one o=
r the other of these spheres that a man's state and lot is determined in th=
is world and in the life after death.</p><p>"Baby Talk."</p><p>A learned pr=
ofessor has lately advised parents to use good English from the start in ad=
dressing their children. But this would be forcing intellectual development=
 prematurely. Early childhood is the period for the formation of the will, =
but not as yet of the understanding. It is the period when children are wit=
h the celestial angels, but not as yet with the spiritual. Parents can cont=
ribute to a useful delay in this period, and one way is by talking to the l=
ittle ones in their own language, thus simulating their affections, and the=
reby putting on somewhat of their state. We see here an image of the manner=
 in which the Lord approaches man, accommodating Himself to human limitatio=
n. The use of strictly correct language in addressing children at this earl=
y period would be too stimulating. It would be like giving them strong wine=
 instead of milk. The instinct of parents, especially of mothers, is a bett=

 How important this is can be seen in the teaching of the Writings that the=
 literal sense is introductory and, in fact, is the only pathway to the int=
ernal sense of the Word. For when the literal sense of any portion of the S=
cripture is fully understood, the way is opened to the spiritual sense, pro=
vided there is at the same time a knowledge of correspondence and of the do=
ctrine of genuine truth, accompanied by a state of illustration from the Lo=
rd. (De Verbo 21; S. S. 25, 26.)</p><p>The first thing in the preparation o=
f such a work would be the collection of the explanations of the literal se=
nse contained in the Writings, which are more abundant than may be seen fro=
m a cursory reading. These are plentiful, for instance, in the Arcana Celes=
tia; see no. 4113, where more than half a page is devoted to explaining the=
 literal sense. Such explanations abound throughout; and even where they ar=
e not given, the spiritual sense throws light upon the letter, which anyone=
 can see from a close examination. The theological literature of the Old Ch=
urch also affords abundant material, to be squared with the facts, as menti=
oned above.</p><p>Worry.</p><p>Worry is a state of mental disturbance arisi=

en we reflect that the future is known to the Lord alone (A. C. 5331; D. P.=
 333), and that He never reveals it to man in advance of the event. Hence t=
he evils imagined seldom, if ever, turn out the way we think. It is the une=
xpected that happens. If the future were revealed man would interfere with =
the order of Providence. Even the angels do not know the future; nor do the=
y wish to know. They simply say, "The Lord's will be done." (A. C. 2493; L.=

 In this is an intimation that all disease is from the spiritual world, a f=
act openly declared in the Writings. (A. C. 5711, etc., 8364; S. D. 4733.) =
It is from the spiritual world through the interiors of the natural mind, c=

ach more than the rest of the bodily organs. (A. C. 5177-5179, 6202.) Hence=
 the cause of indigestion, dyspepsia, and the like. This is usually from av=

 serious aspect to our minds. But soon they are forgotten, or present a dim=
 outline in our memory. A thing that seemed a great trouble years ago is no=
w as nothing. So that which troubles us now will also pass into oblivion, e=
ven as the trials of childhood have passed away, or the worries of the nigh=
t which seem insignificant in the morning. "'Tis a long lane that has no tu=
rning." The darkest day will have passed away on the morrow. No pain or sor=
row, however great, will endure forever. When we reflect, the truth be come=
s clear that our present troubles are but trifles, even as nothing in the s=
ight of the Lord, who has permitted them that we may fight against the spir=
it of unrest, the spirit of distrust, of murmuring and discontent. Hence,</=

</p><p>Complaint.</p><p>Querimony (querimonium) is a word used in the Writi=
ngs to express the murmuring and discontent of the Children of Israel when,=
 in the midst of their trials in the wilderness, they chided with Moses and=
 tempted the Lord. (Exodus 17:l-7.) By this are represented certain states =
in the temptations of the regenerating man, when he "almost yields," and "c=
omplains against heaven and the Divine itself, and at length almost disbeli=
eves the Divine Providence." (A. C. 8588.)</p><p>The spirit of complaint is=
 universal, and becomes active when the natural man, or our selfish and wor=
ldly loves, gain control. The regenerating man is no exception, for he has =
a natural in common with all men, and it is a long time before the natural =
in him is subdued and becomes subservient to the government of the spiritua=
l man. We read that "to murmur is to rebel against the Lord." (A. E. 3248.)=
 Thus to rebel is to resist the laws of His Providence, whether those laws =
appear in the operations of nature, or by influx from the laws of the spiri=
tual world. All resistance to law brings its punishment, and resistance to =
the laws of Providence exhibits its effects in the human body itself. The c=
ondition that is covered by the term "nervousness" is from no other source.=
 Nervous and irritable conditions are in their origin hereditary, but becom=
e one's own by practice. Medicines and the observance of hygienic rules ass=
ist, but the roots are not removed except by the observance, at the same ti=
me, of the spiritual laws of health,--self-examination, repentance, active =
combat, and prayer to the Lord for help.  </p><p></p><div align=3D"Right">2=

</p><p>V</p><p>The First Chapters of Genesis.</p><p>The first chapters of G=
enesis are from the Ancient Word, and were copied thence by Moses. (T. C. R=
. 279; S. S. 103; S. D. 5605.) Up to the twelfth chapter, there is nothing =
historical. (A. C. 482.) But though not literal history, it is written in t=
he form of history, or composed of "made historicals." (A. C. 605, 755, 102=
0.) It was the ancient custom to speak and write in this manner, a remnant =
of which still exists in the ancient epics, the mythologies of various nati=
ons, and in the fables, fairy stories, and folklore that have come down to =
us. It may also be said that this style of "made historicals" is still in a=
 measure preserved in the modern works of fiction, but without the science =
of correspondences known to the ancient writers.</p><p>A modern story, or a=
n ancient "made historical," is true in spirit, if not in the letter. It is=
 a truth, even if it is not a fact. It is hurtful to children to tell them =
that they are not true, especially when speaking of the early Scripture sto=
ries. Tell them that they are true, and wait until later for a rational exp=
lanation in the light of the spiritual sense; otherwise a skeptical spirit =
may be aroused that will be difficult to remove. Even the adult likes to th=
ink of a story or play as true, when it is read or heard, and he does not a=
t the time welcome a suggestion that it is not true. To say that they are n=
ot true is going beyond the truth. Let us guard our children, that doubts o=
f Revelation may not enter and disturb before the time.</p><p>Correspondenc=

d from Asia into Greece, we are told in the following passages:</p><p>"The =

 "This manner of writing existed even with those who were outside of the ch=
urch, as in Arabia, Syria, and Greece, as is evident from the books of thos=
e times." (A. C. 9942.) "The science of correspondences was carried from As=
ia ... into Greece; but there it was turned into fables, as is evident from=
 the writings of the earliest authors there." (S. S. 21; De Verbo 156.) Bec=
ause of the science of correspondences, derived from Asia, "the Gentiles in=
 Greece fixed Helicon on a high mountain, and Parnassus on a hill below it,=
 and believed that the gods and goddesses dwelt there." (A. E. 405.)</p><p>=
Remains of the science of correspondences are found, not only in Greece, bu=
t by writing or tradition in all the religions of the world; for the Ancien=
t Church spread itself in some form over the face of the whole earth.</p><p=
>The Trojan Horse.</p><p>An example of the above kind of writing is given i=
n the story of the Wooden Horse. We are told that the author of this story =
merely wished to describe by correspondences "an artful contrivance of the =
understanding to destroy the walls" and thus take the city (A. C. 2762), th=
e writer knowing that a horse corresponded to the understanding.</p><p>In t=
his connection, it becomes clear that by that time, in Greece and other anc=
ient nations, the science of correspondences had so far degenerated that th=
ey had mostly lost the knowledge and perception that natural things corresp=
onded to things spiritual, or to things in heaven,--such knowledge and perc=
eption as the Ancient Church had derived from the Most Ancient Church. But =
while the essence was gone, they still preserved the form, or the ancient s=
tyle of writing, the form and style of "made history" (A. C. 1020), in whic=
h they used the historical form, describing by correspondences the doings o=
f men, and other things, such as the phenomena of nature.  </p><p></p><div =

 The writings of this kind took the form of poetry; but later, in a more co=
mplete decline of the science of correspondences, men began to describe act=
ual events in prose; hence the historical works of Herodotus, Thucydides, a=
nd others.</p><p>The conclusion follows, that in the mythology of Greece an=
d other ancient nations there are invaluable stores of history for the New =
Church student,--an immensely more fertile field than the ruins of ancient =
cities.</p><p>Structure and Function.</p><p>Does structure precede function=
, or function structure? This question has been discussed by anatomists and=
 others, with the weight of argument in favor of the position that structur=
e is first, and that function, or the use of an organ, cannot exist until t=
here is structure. On this subject the Writings speak clearly and definitel=
y. "Before the organic forms of the body existed, use was, and the use prod=
uced and adapted them to itself, but not vice versa; but when the forms are=
 produced, or the organs adapted, uses thence proceed; and in this case it =
appears as if the forms or organs are prior to the use, when yet it is not =
so; for use inflows from the Lord through heaven, according to the order an=
d form in which heaven is arranged by the Lord, thus according to correspon=
dences." (A. C. 4223. See also A. C. 4926 and H. H. 112.)</p><p>It is indee=
d true that the use does not appear in the outer world until a structure is=
 provided for it, in order that it may ultimate itself. But the use existed=
 before, or in the spiritual world, and created the organ as a suitable ins=
trument for itself, that it might descend into the world of nature.</p><p>H=
erein is illustrated the importance of a knowledge, not only of the existen=
ce of the spiritual world, but also of its immediate presence, that we may =
understand the facts and laws of nature, and be delivered from the dominion=
 of appearances. "Judge not according to the appearance, but judge righteou=
s judgment." (John 7:24.)  </p><p></p><div align=3D"Right">30</div><hr><p>

</p><p>Speaking Ill of the Dead.</p><p>It is a saying that no one should sp=
eak ill of the dead. This carries with it the idea that we should not even =
think ill of any one that is gone into the spiritual world, and what is mor=
e, that we should cherish no ill feeling against him. Most sayings or prove=
rbs have their origin in some law of the spiritual world. The saying in que=
stion has to do with the probable effect upon the departed, when ill is spo=
ken of him by those who are still here. This probable effect is, that spiri=
ts are also excited thereby to speak ill of him, and to him. We read that "=
he who is not led by the Lord, not only acts in consort with evil spirits, =
but also excites evil spirits so to act." (S. D. 1591.) For a man is not le=
d by the Lord when he speaks ill of another from a ground of ill will. This=
 is hurtful, even if the one who is gone is now an evil spirit. In a passag=
e of the Spiritual Diary (no. 1246), this subject is treated of, and part o=
f it is summarized in the Concordance as follows: "The infernals are to be =
pitied, and not to be harshly spoken to." And it is further said that "they=
 would in this case have torments added, which would be against mercy and c=
harity, for to will well even to them is a Christian duty." In the light of=
 this teaching, we can well imagine the distress or ill effect, even upon a=
 good spirit preparing for heaven, of words harshly spoken to him, inspired=
 by one still in the world who thinks ill of the departed one.</p><p>Let us=
 remember, then, the intimate association of the two worlds, and the quick =
extension of thought from the one world into the other.</p><p>Prayer for th=
e Church.</p><p>At a District Assembly in Bryn Athyn, the suggestion of pra=
yer for the church was made. The suggestion finds a basis in direct stateme=
nts of the Apocalypse Revealed, as follows: "And the spirit and the bride s=
ay, Come, signifies that heaven and the church desire the Lord's coming." (=

 "By let him that heareth say, Come, is signified that he who hears and the=
nce knows anything of the Lord's coming, and of the New Heaven and the New =
Church, thus of the Lord's kingdom, should pray that it may come. By let hi=
m that is athirst come, is signified that be who desires the Lord's kingdom=
, and at the same time desires truths, should pray that the Lord may come w=
ith light.... The words in this verse have the same significance as the fol=
lowing in the Lord's Prayer, Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done, as in heav=
en, so upon the earth (no. 839); the Lord's kingdom is the church which mak=
es one with heaven." (A. R. 956.) It is thus made plain that this passage i=
n the Lord's Prayer is a prayer of the church that His kingdom may be estab=
lished and perpetuated on earth as it is in heaven. We read that "the angel=
s repeat that Prayer daily, as men do on earth." (A. R. 839.) The angels re=
peat the Lord's Prayer daily, because they long for the existence of the ch=
urch, that heaven may have foundation to rest upon in the natural world.</p=
><p>The spirit of that Prayer should breathe in all the worship of the chur=
ch, public and private, supplicating the Lord that His kingdom may be estab=
lished and continue with us and our children, and extend to all who are abl=
e to receive it.</p><p>The Writings as the Word.</p><p>It has been said tha=
t in the early days of the Academy the Writings were not spoken of as the W=
ord; that this mode of speaking arose after the organization of the General=
 Church of the New Jerusalem, in order to create a more marked distinction =
between our body and the rest of the Church, and to establish a reason for =
a separate existence,--a reason that is regarded as artificial and unnecess=
ary. This raises the suspicion that those who have said this did not unders=
tand the Academy in its beginning, and are unable to see now that a continu=
ed existence of a separate body is vital to the establishment of the New Ch=
urch on the earth, and that without this separate existence a true knowledg=
e of the Lord in His Second Coming would not be handed down to posterity.  =

 A further suspicion suggests itself, that those who have labored for the e=
stablishment of a separate and distinct body are thought to have been actua=
ted by secret or sinister motives in what they have done.</p><p>But that a =
true and charitable judgment will be formed by those who are to come after,=
 when all the facts are known to them, we cannot doubt.</p><p>The Facts of =
the Case.</p><p>The facts, in general, are as given in what now follows.</p=
><p>It has been shown in past numbers of NEW CHURCH LIFE that the founder o=
f the Academy spoke of the Writings as the Word many years before the initi=
ament of the body itself in 1876, and that he read a paper before the Confe=
rence of New Church Ministers at Cincinnati in 1873, under the title, "The =
Standard of Authority in the New Church." This was reprinted in the LIFE fo=
r July, 1902. The purpose of the paper was to show that the Writings are th=
e Word and the Divine Human of the Lord. He says: "The doctrines of the New=
 Church are the Divine Word in its spirit and life." "They are Divine, alto=
gether Divine, and nothing but Divine." "What is revealed from or out of th=
e Word, in doctrine drawn therefrom, is the Lord in His Divine Human. All r=
evelation is the coming of the Lord in His Divine Human." Thus all revelati=
on is the Word, since it is the Lord appearing in His own Divine Truth, and=
 as the Divine Truth. What is Divine Truth but the Word, and what is the Wo=
rd but Divine Truth? The one involves the other. The one is the other. To t=
he rational mind, the transition is easy from the idea of the Writings as D=
ivine Truth to the idea of the Writings as the Word, to the idea of the Wri=
tings as the Lord Himself in His Second Coming.  </p><p></p><div align=3D"R=

</p><p>The Early Practice.</p><p>It is true that Bishop Benade used the wor=
d "Authority" in the title of his paper, and that Dr. R. L. Tafel followed =
it with his work on Authority in the New Church. It thus became the usual p=
ractice with us to speak of the "Divine Authority of the Writings," the "Di=
vinity of the Writings." Nor was it common then to speak of them as the Wor=
d. Still it was occasionally done. The writer remembers hearing Bishop Bena=
de use the phrase, after the Academy had been, organized and its work in fu=
ll operation.</p><p>On a certain occasion in the year 1875, during an argum=
ent on a point of doctrine, the Writings were quoted; but the answer made w=
as, "That is merely Swedenborg's opinion." To which came the reply, "The Wr=
itings of Swedenborg are the Word of God. The one who made this reply was n=
ot then a member of the Academy, but was admitted afterward with this as th=
e leading idea in his mind. In a sermon delivered in Chicago on September 2=
5th, 1881, these words occur: "The New Church has in her midst the Word in =
a twofold aspect, namely, the Word in its representative or correspondentia=
l form, as it exists in the letter, and the Word in its doctrinal form, as =
given in the Writings of Swedenborg; in both forms, it is Divine, because g=
iven by the Lord Himself."</p><p>When this truth was proclaimed at the inau=
guration of our present body, it was not thought of as anything new, and it=
 was taken by the members assembled as a matter of course.</p><p>Fiat Justi=
tia, Ruat Caelum.</p><p>"Let justice be done, though the heavens fall,"--a =
saying that has come down to us from the wise ancients. Generally interpret=
ed, it means, "Do right, no matter what the consequences may be." For the L=
ord is in what is right, and in the consequences. He will protect. This is =
also the teaching of the Writings.  </p><p></p><div align=3D"Right">34</div=

 The merely natural man "does what is just and equitable for the sake of se=
lf and the world, that is, for the sake of his own honor or fame, for the s=
ake of the wealth and possessions of the world, and also for fear of the la=
w." (A. C. 4167.) But the spiritual man "feels delight in doing good to the=
 neighbor for the sake of truth and good, and not for the sake of self or t=
he world." (A. C. 5340, and elsewhere.) Thus the spiritual man is not guide=
d by expediency or self-interest, but looks first to the good of his countr=
y, the church, and the Lord's kingdom. He does right because it is right, a=
nd not because it is to his own self-advantage. A great statesman once said=
 that "the right and justice of the thing should determine the course to be=
 pursued." Even the natural man admires this in others, or when his self-in=
terest is not involved. The deep reason why it is admirable is, that to do =
right because it is right is to be led by the Lord, and not by one's self; =
and he who is so led is safe. "For no misfortunes or fortuitous evils can h=
appen to the man who is with the Lord." (S. D. 4138.)  </p><p></p><div alig=

</p><p>VI</p><p>The Acknowledgment of the Lord.</p><p>"The primary thing of=
 all religion is to acknowledge God" (D. P. 322), and the first essential o=
f the Christian religion is to acknowledge the Lord. For it is the Lord God=
 the Savior alone who opens heaven or the spiritual mind (C. L. 340), and H=
e opens it to those only who acknowledge Him as the God of heaven and earth=
, and live according to His commandments. (C. L. 341. See T. C. R. 151.) It=
 cannot possibly be opened to others. The essentials of salvation are two, =
but the second is not anything without the first. Keeping the second table =
of the law contributes nothing to spiritual life, unless the Lord's table b=
e kept also. It is merely a moral life without religion, in which there is =
nothing salvable. The supreme necessity of the acknowledgment of the Lord, =
if men are to be saved, is shown in the Lord's words in John, "Unless ye be=
lieve that I am, ye shall die in your sins." (8: 24.) "Those who do not ack=
nowledge the Lord must needs be in falsities and evils." (A. C. 10281. See =
also D. P. 91 and T. C. R. 339.) "The denial of God makes hell, and in the =
Christian world the denial of the Lord." (D. L. W. 13.) "The state of every=
one ... in the spiritual world is according to his acknowledgment of God an=
d the worship of Him,... and after this time they who acknowledge the Lord =
Jesus Christ to be God are in heaven." (T. C. R. 795.) "Hereafter no one co=
mes into heaven unless he believes in the Lord God the Savior, and goes to =
Him alone." (T. C. R. 107.)</p><p>This is the supreme essential of all spir=
itual life,--the acknowledgment and worship of God as a Man, the God Man, J=
esus Christ. This is the one beacon light in the darkness of the Christian =
World,--the only Way, the only Truth, and the only Life. (John 14:6.) Witho=
ut this, no evil can be shunned as sin. "For without me, ye can do nothing.=

</p><p>A Moral Life without a Spiritual Life.</p><p>A spiritual life is a l=
ife of religion, and the life of religion is to love and worship the Lord G=
od the Savior, and to do good or live morally from Him, There can be a mora=
l life from religion, or from Him who is the life of religion, and there ca=
n be a moral life without religion. The latter kind of a moral life is very=
 common at this day in the Christian World, but it is a life that is void a=
nd empty of everything of heaven, though it is frequently mistaken for a sp=
iritual or religious life.</p><p>What a dead thing a moral life is without =
a spiritual life, is set forth in full in the Apocalypse Explained, no. 182=
: "A moral life is to act well, sincerely, and justly with one's companions=
 in the functions and business of life,... but a moral life from the love o=
f self and the world is not in itself a moral life, although it appears as =
such. For the man who is in such a life acts well, sincerely, and justly fo=
r the sake of himself and the world only. To him, what is good, sincere, an=
d just serves but as a means to an end, that he may be elevated above other=
s and rule over them, or that he may acquire wealth." (The subject is treat=
ed at large in this number.)</p><p>A moral life without a spiritual life is=
 used as a cloak to cover evil designs, producing a deceptive appearance th=
at easily blinds and leads astray. It is an enemy to the New Church, and to=
 all who in heart desire to live a truly religious life; for it closes heav=
en, and separates man from the Lord.</p><p>A Snare.</p><p>Spiritually, a sn=
are is evil putting on the appearance of good, thereby deceiving and leadin=
g astray. (See A. C. 9348.) It is doing good without shunning evil. It is a=
 life of morality without religion. "If a man wills and does goods before h=
e shuns evils as sins, the goods are not good." (Life 24.) "So far as a man=
 has not been purified from evils, his goods are not good, his piety is not=
 pious; neither is he wise." (Life 30.)  </p><p></p><div align=3D"Right">37=

 Nor is his morality really moral. In such case he merely covers and concea=
ls his evils, causing them not to appear before the world, while they are s=
till active within. (Life 108.) Even as the Lord said to the Pharisees, "Ye=
 make clean the outside of the cup and of the platter, but within they are =
full of extortion and excess.... Cleanse first that which is within the cup=
 and platter, that the outside of them may be clean also. (Matthew 23:25, 2=
6.) Such is the nature of unregenerate good, or the good that is done witho=
ut shunning the evil of the heart as sin against God. Such is the nature of=
 all good works that are without charity in will and thought, without the a=
cknowledgment and worship of the Lord God the Savior. Hence we may not be s=
urprised at the injunction, "Cease, therefore, to ask thyself, What good mu=
st I do to receive eternal life? Only abstain from evils as sins, and look =
to the Lord; and the Lord will teach and lead thee." (A. E. 979.) Then, and=
 not before, does man's good become really good, his piety really pious, an=
d his morality really moral.</p><p>"I am God Shaddai." (Genesis 17:1.)</p><=
p>"I appeared unto Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, as God Shaddai. By my name Je=
hovah was I not known unto them." (Exodus 6:3.) Shaddai was the name of the=
 god worshipped by Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. They knew not the name Jehova=
h. That name had been lost from the time of the Ancient Church, but was rev=
ealed anew to Moses in Egypt. Moses had asked the God who appeared unto him=
 His name, and He had said, "I am Jehovah." (Exodus 6:2.) In the English ve=
rsion, Shaddai is rendered "Almighty." Genesis 17:1.) The translators did n=
ot know, or were unwilling to believe, that the fathers of the Israelitish =
nation worshipped any other god than Jehovah, and that they were idolaters.=
 That the Lord appeared to them as the God they worshipped, and "was willin=
g to be represented by the name Shaddai, was because He never wills suddenl=

In the teaching concerning the worship of the god Shaddai by the Israelitis=
h fathers, there is involved an essential truth as relating to the Christia=
n Church and the Second Coming of the Lord. The Apostolic fathers worshippe=
d the Lord Jesus Christ; but when the Lord came again into the world, the C=
hristian Church was worshipping another god. They did not know the true God=
 of heaven and earth. He had to be revealed again. Since they did not know =
the true God, they did not know the Word of God. They did not know even the=
 literal sense of the Word, for that sense had been falsified from beginnin=
g to end. His vesture had been "dipped in blood." (Revelation 19:13. A. R. =
825.) It had therefore become necessary, not only to reveal the spiritual s=
ense of the Word, but also to reveal anew the Word in its literal sense, ev=
en as it had become necessary to reveal anew the name of the true God to th=
e Israelites in Egypt. The name of God is the Divine Human of the Lord, or,=
 what is the same, it is His Word. It had become necessary to reveal this a=
new in the Christian world, for it is a name that had been lost, destroyed =
by the falsifications of its truth. It could not be restored, except by rev=
ealing it again unto men. This is what is meant by His "new name" (Revelati=
on 2:17. 3:12), and by "Behold, I make all things new." (Revelation 21:5. S=
ee A. R. 196; A. E. 224.)</p><p>Swedenborg's Philosophy.</p><p>The early wo=
rk of Swedenborg, his study of nature and the human body, was a preparation=

 He was to be prepared by natural truth to enter into the domain of spiritu=

 Calling them a "science" has led to a claim that modern science has advanc=
ed beyond Swedenborg; and hence his work is considered to be out of date, a=
nd of little value to the New Church. This is a lamentable error. That phil=
osophy is of great value, because it is a new philosophy, far surpassing th=
e work of any other philosopher, ancient or modern, and will be of perpetua=
l value to the Church of the New Jerusalem. Swedenborg's philosophy exhibit=
s the universal laws of nature, and as such will reign supreme in natural s=
cience, ordering and regulating it for all time to come. The science of the=
 world can never supersede the philosophy of Swedenborg.</p><p>Swedenborg n=
ot a Scientific Investigator.</p><p>Swedenborg made but little research int=
o the visible facts of nature. He began it, but soon desisted, for reasons =
which he gives in the introduction to The Economy of the Animal Kingdom. Af=
ter praising the work of Malpighi, Leeuwenhoek, and others, he says, "Assis=
ted by the studies ... of these illustrious men, and fortified by their aut=
hority, I have resolved to commence and complete my design; that is to say,=
 to open some part of those things which it is generally supposed that natu=
re has involved in obscurity." In fact, he resolved to enter the unoccupied=
 and unexplored field of invisible nature, depending upon the scientific re=
searches of others as a basis for his studies of the interior world of natu=
ral things. "On deeply considering the matter," he says, "I deemed it best =
to make use of the facts supplied by others." And further, "I therefore lai=
d aside my instruments, and, restraining my desire for making observations,=
 determined rather to rely on the researches of others than to trust to my =
own." He considered that it was not necessary for him to investigate visibl=
e phenomena, for this had been done by able men; and the facts he needed as=
 a groundwork for his studies were already at his hand. In the Principia (c=
hapter 1, 8), he makes plain his purpose.  </p><p></p><div align=3D"Right">=

 "The sciences, which have now been for some thousand years adding to our e=
xperience, may at this day be said to have so far advanced that an inquiry =
into the secret and invisible operations of nature need no longer be deferr=
ed." He therefore determined to use the facts of others as the means of int=
roducing himself into the hitherto closed field of nature.</p><p>There is a=
n external and an internal to all things. So there is an external and an in=
ternal world of nature. Men of science had explored the phenomena of the vi=
sible world, and had gathered innumerable facts, had even approached the bo=
rders of the internal, invisible world, but had feared to enter it. Swedenb=
org, under a providential guidance, which no other man had, boldly entered =
and explored its inmost recesses. It was necessary that he should do so, fo=
r the world of invisible nature is intermediate between the world of matter=
 and the world of spirit; and before this latter world could be revealed to=
 him, he must needs know that world which is intermediate between the spiri=
tual and the material, invisible to the physical eye or to the finest micro=
scope, and only to be entered by the inductions of enlightened reason.</p><=
p>Swedenborg, therefore, is not to be classed as a man of science, seeking =
to add to the vast store of visible facts already accumulated by others, bu=
t as a philosopher, even as he himself says (Influx 20), seeking for the un=
iversal laws of the invisible world, hidden behind visible phenomena, that =
he might thereby be prepared to become, under the Divine guidance, the theo=
logian of all the ages, the willing and obedient instrument of the Lord for=
 His Second Coming into the world.</p><p>Swedenborg, at this time, did not =
know of that for which he was being prepared, but he had received certain i=

</p><p>VII</p><p>Early Obedience.</p><p>In the approach of parents to their=
 children by tokens of affection, ministering thus to the formation of the =
will, it is not to be forgotten that there are other means of such formatio=
n, especially that of obedience. In fact, we are told that obedience is its=
elf the beginning of the will. (A. C. 3870.) But as the will continues and =
never ceases to be formed, so obedience continues as the basis of all futur=
e growth,--the obedience which begins in early childhood. The foundation la=
id then will be present as a reactive plane forever. Salvation, if it is to=
 come, cannot come without this.</p><p>There is a fallacy abroad that child=
ren are to be led only by acts of kindness. This comes, perhaps, as a react=
ion from the stern Puritanism of our fathers. But in swinging away from the=
ir requirements of a rigid obedience, let us not reject what was true in th=
e methods of the Puritans. We may reject their hardness and harshness, and =
their lack of sympathy with childhood; but the habit of obedience, establis=
hed in that early period, is fundamental to spiritual life in adult age. Th=
e child that is not taught to obey will probably have no inclination, when =
he becomes a man, to keep the Commandments as laws of religion, to shun evi=
ls as sins against God. Even if he lives a moral life, it will be a moral l=
ife for the sake of the world, and not for the sake of heaven and the Lord.=
</p><p>Meditation When Alone.</p><p>The use of meditation when one is alone=
, or not in company with others, as at home or in the bed-chamber, is frequ=
ently set forth in the Writings. For the internal will and thought is the r=
eal man; and we cannot become acquainted with this real man, if we always t=
hink and act in and from the outer world.  </p><p></p><div align=3D"Right">=

 When a man is alone, he thinks from the interior love of his spirit (D. L.=
 W. 418.) When he meditates by himself at home, he thinks only from his own=
 spirit. (D. P. 61; D. L. W. 391.) He is then in his real life, good or evi=
l. (D. L. W. 261.) Then is his opportunity to commit knowledges from the Wo=
rd to life by thinking and willing them. (A. E. 193 end.) The same is indic=
ated in passages of Scripture. "Enter thou into thy chambers, and shut thy =
door after thee; hide thyself as it were for a little moment, until the ang=
er be over- past." (Isaiah 26:20.) "When thou prayest, enter into thy close=
t, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret;=
 and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly." (Matthew 6=
:6.) In the Christian Church, this injunction of the Lord led to the practi=
ce of individual prayer in a condition of retirement. Rightly applied and u=
nderstood, this is incumbent on everyone desiring advancement in the regene=
rate life. In sincere prayer and meditation when alone, the way is laid ope=
n to discover the evils that have been hidden from the world, even from one=
's self, and the inclination to resist them is then inspired.</p><p>Retirem=
ent from the world was much abused in the days of asceticism, but it was th=
e abuse or perversion of a truth, a truth now made clear to the New Church.=
 </p><p>Hurry.</p><p>"The more haste, the less speed."--A saying of our for=
efathers, or of some wise ancient to whom was given a perception. Speed is =
the thing, not haste or hurry. In speed there is gain, but in hurry there i=
s more lost than won. Speed involves an equable frame of mind,--repose. In =
hurry there is anxiety and impatience. These, becoming a permanent conditio=
n of the mind, descend and attack the nervous system, and finally the body.=
 The cure is to be looked for in prayer and combat, remedial measures coope=
rating. This will open the way to a gradual release. The laws of Providence=
 never operate in haste.  </p><p></p><div align=3D"Right">44</div><hr><p>

</p><p>In the anxiety which attends all haste or hurry, there is a violatio=
n of some law, not only of the mind or spirit, but of the body and nature. =
It is well to remember that the laws of nature are also laws of Providence,=
 and that to act contrary to them is to act against the Author of them. The=
 violation of law, spiritual or natural, brings sin, suffering, and all ill=
 health into the world; that is, the violation of law is attended with its =
punishment. We can thus see the truth contained in the words of the Apostle=
, "The wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life." (Romans=
 6:23.)</p><p>In this general connection, the suggestion is made to read Ar=
cana Celestia no. 8478.</p><p>Tranquillity.</p><p>"The Muses love a tranqui=
l mind." (Swedenborg, Introduction to The Economy of the Animal Kingdom.) T=
o be tranquil is to be "free from agitation or disturbance. (Webster.) The =
Writings frequently speak of tranquillity. It is to the natural mind what p=
eace is to the spiritual mind. (A. C. 3696.) Uses are performed when there =
is tranquillity. (A. C. 92.) All orderly arrangement is effected in a state=
 of tranquillity. (A. C. 8370.) A tranquil state arises from contentment of=
 mind. (A. C. 6408.) The tranquillity of peace follows spiritual temptation=
s (A. E. 419(24)); when the storm of wind ceased, "there was a great calm."=
 (Mark 4:39.) The ancient wise men said there is tranquillity of mind when =
withdrawn from sensual things. (A. C. 6313.) There is tranquillity in the b=
eginning of life, or in infancy. (A. C. 3696.) Remembering this, men often =
express a wish to return to the state of their childhood, not realizing the=
 great tranquillity of peace which, after death, is to follow the labor and=
 combat of this life. They are in need of the knowledge of genuine truth, a=
nd of that elevation into spiritual light which is called illustration, in =
which light they would see light. (Psalm 36:9.)</p><p>Crystallization, it i=
s said, takes place in a state of rest.  </p><p></p><div align=3D"Right">45=

 In order that uses may be efficiently performed, there should be rest or t=
ranquillity of mind and body. A man provides this for himself, or Providenc=
e through his efforts, by means of sleep, proper food, and other measures w=
ithin the reach of all.</p><p>Old age is or should be a period of tranquill=
ity; but, like conjugial love, it is rare in our time. See what Cicero, tha=
t wisest of Romans, says on the subject of old age in his treatise De Senec=
tute. Cicero was saved. (H. H. 322; S. D. 4094, 4415-4417.)</p><p>Evil Not =
from Man Himself, but Inflows.</p><p>Neither good nor evil is from man. Goo=
d is from heaven, and evil from hell. But they may become man's own, and be=
 in him as his. The teaching is: "All evil inflows from hell, and all good =
through heaven from the Lord; but the reason that evil is appropriated to m=
an is because he believes that he thinks and does it from himself, thus mak=
es it his own. If he should believe as the case is, he would not appropriat=
e evil to himself, but would appropriate good from the Lord; for when evil =
inflows, he would think that it is from the evil spirits with him; and when=
 he thinks this, the angels avert and reject it; for the influx of the ange=
ls is into that which a man knows and believes, but not into that which he =
does not know and believe." (A. C. 6206, 6324. The subject in full, D. P. 3=
20, 321.)</p><p>When a man believes that good is from the Lord, it is appro=
priated to him as his; but when he believes that it is from himself, it is =
not appropriated. On the other hand, if he believes that evil is from hell,=
 it is not appropriated, does not become his own, however much it may conti=
nue to infest; but if he believes that it is from himself, the angels have =
no power to remove it, and it becomes a part of his life. To believe is not=
 only to think, but also to will, to love, and to do. There is no other bel=
ief that is planted in the mind as faith.  </p><p></p><div align=3D"Right">=

 In genuine faith, there is not only thought, but also the endeavor to do. =
So when good appears in the thought, let us acknowledge that it is from the=
 Lord, and give thanks; but when evil so appears, let us acknowledge that i=
t is from evil spirits, and pray far help. A man can neither receive good n=
or reject evil, "except it be given him from heaven." (John 3:27.)</p><p>Ce=
rberus.</p><p>The dog Cerberus, guarding the entrance to the infernal regio=
ns, is among the representatives of the Ancient Church preserved in the Gre=
ek mythology. It is spoken of and explained in passages of the Writings. "I=
 saw a great dog like the one called Cerberus by the ancient writers.... I =
was told that such a dog signifies a guard lest a man should pass over from=
 heavenly conjugial love to the infernal love of adultery." (De Conjugio 10=
4. See also A. C. 2743, 5051.) As the use of dogs is to guard, so in the Wo=
rd and in all representatives, when used in a good sense, a spiritual watch=
 or guard is signified. (A. E.1198.) Thus the dog Cerberus, guarding the mo=
uth of hell, signifies the guards or watches established by the Lord in His=
 merciful Providence, lest conjugial love be turned into its opposite. Thes=
e guards are everywhere in both worlds. They are the truths of the Word; th=
e fundamentals of all order,--the Ten Commandments; the letter of Scripture=
 in general; laws, regulations, customs, called also the safeguards of soci=
ety; they exist wherever morality is taught and preached; they are the know=
ledge in the mind that adultery is a sin, or at least destructive of social=
 order. Without such guards, society could not exist, and human life on ear=
th would not be possible.</p><p>Even clothing is a guard. (See what is said=
 in S. D. 4719. De Conjugio 67. See also S. D. 2114, 3854.)</p><p>The doors=
 of hell are opened when the guards are removed.</p><p>Let the supreme impo=
rtance of these guards be impressed upon the minds of the young.  </p><p></=

</p><p>Friendship in Marriage.</p><p>"With those who are in love truly conj=
ugial, the conjunction of minds increases in proportion as friendship conjo=
ins itself with love." (C. L. 214.) "Since love truly conjugial conjoins th=
e souls and hearts of two, it is united also with friendship, and is exalte=
d above all other friendships." (C. L. 334.) "When friendship and confidenc=
e conjoin themselves with the first love of marriage, conjugial love is the=
 result." (C. L. 162.)</p><p>Friendship, to exist and continue in married l=
ife, must be cultivated. It was spontaneous in the betrothal period, and in=
 the early days of marriage, but this spontaneity may cease, or be drawn ba=
ck into the interiors of the mind. It must be invited to come forth, and th=
is is done by cultivation, by practice. For in order that the beginnings of=
 conjugial love, which sprouted in their early life together, may not be lo=
st, but may increase, effort is required. A thing that is of permanent valu=
e is worth fighting for. The battle in this case is with the enemies of the=
 conjugial. That which was Divinely given in the days of their primitive lo=
ve must be fought for, in order that it may be preserved. Two consorts, in =
a life of good will to each other, exhibited in an active friendship, and i=
n a common worship of the Lord God the Savior, will receive all things that=
 are good in the world to come.  </p><p></p><div align=3D"Right">48</div><h=

</p><p>VIII</p><p>The Demon of Socrates.</p><p>A demon, in Greek usage, was=
 a good or evil spirit. The demon of Socrates was clearly a good spirit, th=
e subject of some angelic society. Socrates testified that this demon was a=
lways with him as a guide to his conduct, never telling him what to do, but=
 what not to do. This is evidence to a New Churchman that the demon was a g=
ood spirit, following the angelic example. It is evil spirits who delight i=
n telling others what they are to do, seeking in this way to obtain dominio=
n over them. The modern explanation is, that Socrates meant the voice of co=
nscience, the learned world being unwilling to admit the presence of angels=
 and spirits. It is true that angels speak to the conscience of man, in ord=
er that it may appear to him to be from himself; but the case of Socrates i=
s unusual. He can indeed be called a prophet, or a teacher of new things, p=
reparatory to the Christian Church which was to come. He died the death of =
a martyr. No Christian martyr ever met a more undeserved death. It was nece=
ssary that the influence of perverted representatives in mythology should b=
e broken. Socrates was instrumental to this end. His teachings, which were =
essentially spiritual moral, rang through the ages. By common consent, in a=
ncient times and modern, he has been regarded as one of the greatest of man=
kind. A study of his work, in the light of the Heavenly Doctrine, will reve=
al more than has been seen before.</p><p>Socrates. Pallas Athene.</p><p>The=
 presiding genius or divinity of Athens was Minerva or Pallas Athene. Like =
the names in Scripture, the names of mythology were representative of some =
society in the spiritual world that presided over a nation or city in the n=
atural world, guiding its destinies, and appearing at times through a subje=
ct spirit. (Concerning subject spirits or emissary spirits, see A. C. 5856,=
 5861; H. H. 255.)  </p><p></p><div align=3D"Right">49</div><hr><p>

 It has been suggested that the demon of Socrates was such a subject spirit=
, or a Pallas. This seems likely from what Swedenborg said of Aristotle: "A=
 woman was seen by me who stretched out her hand, wishing to stroke his che=
ek. He said that, when he was in the world, such a woman was often seen by =
him.... The angelic spirits said that such women were sometimes seen by the=
 ancients, and were called Pallases by them." (A. C. 4658(5); S. D. 3952.)<=
/p><p>From all that we learn of Socrates, it seems clear that it was such a=
 Pallas or spirit that appeared to him, guiding him as indicated in the not=
e above. Plato tells the story of his death. His weeping friends were gathe=
red around him, before he drank the hemlock. They urged him to escape, whic=
h he refused to do, because he would not disobey the law of the state. He t=
ells them of a vision he had had the preceding night. "It seemed to me that=
 a woman in white raiment, graceful and fair to look upon, came toward me, =
and calling me by name, said, 'On the third day, Socrates, thou shalt reach=
 the coast of fertile Phthia.'" Was this not his demon or Pallas? He drank =
the poison, and departed for "the coast of fertile Phthia." Plato says: "Su=
ch was the end of our friend, a man whom we may well call, of all men known=
 to us in our day, the best, the wisest, and the most just." It is said tha=
t Cicero could never read the story without tears. Cicero himself met a vio=
lent death. Both men are now in heaven. (T. C. R. 692; H. H. 322.)</p><p>Ly=
ing.</p><p>We have been told of George Washington as a boy, that he would n=
ot lie to protect himself from punishment; and of Epaminondas, that he woul=
d not lie, even in jest. The story of these men, their truthfulness and pat=
riotism, is instructive and inspiring to the young. Children should be taug=
ht a rigid speaking of the truth. Later in life, when the age of rationalit=
y is reached, they will know how to discriminate between a mild or relative=
ly harmless departure from the truth and that which is hurtful or malicious=
.  </p><p></p><div align=3D"Right">50</div><hr><p>

 Teaching children to speak the truth, even in the most simple things, is i=
llustrated by the Lord's words: "He that is faithful in that which is least=
 is faithful also in much; and he that is unjust in the least is unjust als=
o in much." (Luke 16:10.)</p><p>In general, a lie is "an untruth spoken wit=
h the intention to deceive." (Webster.) "It is willful deceit that makes a =
lie." (Paley.) What is willful is that which is of set and deliberate purpo=
se. The end which is evil goes forth from the heart with the intention to d=
eceive, and is confirmed in the thought is what is called a sin. On the oth=
er hand, a mild untruthfulness, where there is no intention to deceive or i=
njure another, is not a sin; yet it may become so, if continuously practise=
d. The danger is where a mild or harmless prevarication becomes a habit of =
thought and conduct. Children cannot as yet distinguish the mild and harmle=
ss from the deceitful and malignant. Therefore, let them be taught always t=
o speak the truth, that the habit of truthfulness may be formed. All things=
 of the future depend upon the habits formed in childhood.</p><p>Bearing Fa=
lse Witness.</p><p>"Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor"=
 is the decree against lying, proclaimed as a Divine Law from Mount Sinai, =
and thus made known as a sin against God. The Commandments were already kno=
wn to men, and had become incorporated in the civil and moral law of all na=
tions. But the knowledge that any violation of them was not only against so=
ciety and the state, but also a sin against God, had been lost. Hence it wa=
s necessary that this should be revealed anew, or there could be no salvati=
on to mankind. (A. C. 8862; Doct. Life 53.)</p><p>In the natural sense, to =
bear false witness is to testify falsely in a court of justice, as well as =
all lying and hypocritical pretense looking to an evil end. (T. C. R. 321.)=

 In the spiritual sense, to bear false witness is to persuade another that =
the falsification of the Word is the very truth of doctrine. (T. C. R. 322.=
) Every false doctrine is spiritually a lie. In the celestial sense, to bea=
r false witness is to blaspheme the Lord and His Word. (T. C. R. 323.)</p><=
p>Lies, in the spiritual sense, are of two kinds,--falsity of evil, and fal=
sity not of evil. Falsity of evil is falsity from evil in the will confirme=
d by reasonings in the understanding. Falsity not of evil, but which may le=
ad to evil, is falsity held in ignorance of the truth, but which can be dis=
sipated when the truth is made known. Those in the former are in the way to=
 hell; those in the latter can be turned toward heaven, when the truth is r=
eceived and there is repentance of life.</p><p>What a happy world, if there=
 were no lies, natural or spiritual! But this only in heaven.</p><p>First T=
ruths are Appearances of Truth.</p><p>We read that "appearances are the fir=
st things by which the human mind forms its understanding" (D. L. W; 40); t=
hat "the first truths with man are appearances of truth from the fallacies =
of the senses, which yet are successively put off, as he is perfected in wi=
sdom" (H. D. 27; A. C. 3131); and that "unless man were instructed by means=
 of appearances, he would never suffer himself to be instructed." (A. C. 18=
38.) It is thus made clear that apparent truths must enter the mind, and gi=
ve it its first formation, before genuine truths can be received, and thus =
that apparent truths are the means of introduction to those that are genuin=
e.</p><p>The difference between genuine truth and the appearances of truth =
may be illustrated by the sun, which, though it appears to rise and set, re=
mains fixed in the heavens, while the earth revolves and moves around the s=
un. (D. P. 162.) Such appearances are innumerable in nature, and the litera=
l sense of the Word abounds with them. (A. C. 1408.)  </p><p></p><div align=

istress. It is, in general, a state of anxious care for the morrow. (A. C. =
8478. See A. C. 6210, 6315; S. D. 1908; Matthew 6:24-34.) And it arises fro=
m the love of the world. (A. C. 1675.) We read that spirits and men would b=
e "in the highest joy, if they were content with their lot, which the Lord =
gave them, and did not desire higher things from phantasy." (S. D. 2513.) A=
 state of phantasy, or false imagination, exists when the mind is occupied =
with things that are trifling, unreal, false. It is the opposite of a genui=
ne imagination, which occupies itself with real things, truths, uses, shunn=
ing all else as contrary to the law and order of God.</p><p>Discontent with=
 one's lot, with its attendant anxieties, when it descends into the body an=
d entrenches itself there, giving rise to abnormal conditions, in all proba=
bility cannot be wholly removed until the body is laid aside. (A. C. 3938.)=
 But it can be removed in spirit, Preparatory to the great change to follow=
 after death.</p><p>Not being satisfied with what we have and are, with a d=
esire for improvement, for a betterment of present conditions, cannot prope=
rly be classed as discontent. The desire for growth, progress, increase, na=
tural or spiritual, is inspired from above, and is according to the order o=
f creation.  </p><p></p><div align=3D"Right">53</div><hr><p>

 If this may be called discontent, it is the use of the word in an affirmat=
ive sense.</p><p>Content in God.</p><p>It is well known, and oft spoken of,=
 that a man should be content with his lot. But the whole truth is not so w=
ell known. A man should be content in God. This whole truth is pointed out =
in the Writings: "The blessing of Jehovah is to be content in God, hence to=
 be content with the state of honor and wealth in which one is, ... making =
the latter of no account, but eternal life the essential." (A. C. 4981.) Be=
ing content with one's lot is therefore a truth that is limited, if merely =
applied to life in the world. There must be in it the idea of God and etern=
al life. Otherwise, there is no real content.</p><p>Being content in God is=
 the one thing on earth that corresponds to the peace of heaven, that conta=
ins that peace concealed within. We are told that the peace of heaven canno=
t be described "such as it is in itself, because human words are inadequate=
, but only by words such as may be compared to the rest of mind which those=
 have who are content in God." (H. H. 284, 288.) And that this exists only =
when the cares and anxieties of the world have been put away (A. C. 3938), =
when they have been put away on the basis of a truly religious life.</p><p>=
Even when the whole truth is seen, it is not maintained without a struggle.=
 The line of duty is plain. Aim for it, think about it, even though it be s=
een but as from afar. Ask it of the Lord. Fight against the obstacles that =
stand in the way. In this lies the hope of the promised reward.</p><p>A Nee=
ded Index.</p><p>Every reader of the Writings has observed the abundance of=
 illustrations used to give additional light to the subject in hand. These =
illustrations are either comparisons, which are correspondences, or they ar=
e examples of doctrines related to the subject, but more simple and familia=
r, better known, more concrete and applied, more easily understood, in the =
light of which a greater light may be seen. (See A. C. 2588, 7272, 7318; T.=
 C. R. 178.)  </p><p></p><div align=3D"Right">54</div><hr><p>

 The True Christian Religion is especially rich in comparisons which illust=
rate by correspondence. (See T. C. R. 531 and throughout.)</p><p>An Index t=
o these illustrations would be of great use to ministers and teachers in th=
eir work of instruction. Such illustrations are of frequent occurrence in t=
he Writings, for the reason, sometimes mentioned, that there are minds not =
able to see clearly the truth that is being presented, without the aid of i=
llustration by examples of related truth, or by comparisons which are corre=
spondent and representative of the truth.</p><p>The word "illustration" is =
used in a twofold sense in the Writings: first, to express a state of enlig=
htenment of the understanding, in which truths are seen clearly, because in=
 spiritual light; second, to express the idea of an added light thrown on a=
 subject by means of examples and comparisons, for the sake of reaching sim=
ple states of mind, especially the minds of children and the young, who can=
not see the truth at once in its own light, as it is seen by those with who=
m the rational mind is fully opened.</p><p>An Index of this kind will requi=
re time and labor, for it means a thorough reading of the Writings from beg=
inning to end.</p><p>IX</p><p>Without Sin.</p><p>The Lord, although He had =
by birth the hereditary inclination to evils, was yet without sin. "Which o=
f you convinceth me of sin?" (John 8:46.) The Apostles saw this truth. Paul=
 says, "He was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin." (Heb=
rews 4:15.) And Peter, "He did no sin, neither was guile found in His mouth=
." (1 Peter 2:22.) Also John, "He was manifested to take away our sins, and=
 in Him was no sin." (1 John 3:5.)  </p><p></p><div align=3D"Right">55</div=

 Also in the prophet Isaiah, "He had done no violence, neither was any dece=
it in His mouth." (53:9.) The Writings testify the same. "The Lord had no a=
ctual evil, or evil that was His own." (A. C. 1573.) But the hereditary inc=
lination to evil must needs appear, in order that it may be seen and remove=
d; and it appears in the form of purpose. (D. P. 283.) This took place even=
 in the Lord. The purpose of evil does not become sin, if it is resisted wh=
en seen and overcome. With man, it frequently goes forth into the act itsel=
f, but never with the Lord. Hence, with man, acquired evil is added to his =
hereditary inclination; but it was not so with the Lord. The evil that a ma=
n acquires and confirms by action in the world may be subdued, but is never=
 wholly removed. (A. C. 9333; D. P. 79, 279.)</p><p>No man can even approxi=
mate the Lord's life on earth; yet he, too, should resist evil as soon as i=
t appears. (D. P. 283.) "Agree with thine adversary quickly, whilst thou ar=
t in the way with him." (Matthew 5:25.) </p><p>The First Man.</p><p>The que=
stion is sometimes raised, that since the Lord operates upon and sustains e=
very man by means of angels and spirits, how was it with the first man? The=
 answer is given in the Spiritual Diary. After stating that the Lord has al=
ways led the human race, it is shown "how the first man, and those who were=
 born first, before the Grand Man was formed, could have existed," that is,=
 how men could live before there were angels and spirits to vivify and sust=
ain them. Then we read that "the first man...was not led by any other than =
the Lord alone.... For the Lord alone sustains the human race as formerly; =
but now by means of spirits and angels, then also immediately, without ange=
ls and spirits." (S. D. 2591.)</p><p>To suppose that angels and spirits wer=
e called from other earths for this purpose merely moves the question back =
to the first inhabitant of the first earth.  </p><p></p><div align=3D"Right=

 The Lord's power is not limited, nor does He need the help of man or angel=
, but He gives functions that they may be happy. (A. C. 8719.) The Lord Him=
self performed all the offices necessary for the first little one created. =
He does this even now, except that He now acts mediately through angels, sp=
irits, and men; not that their help is needed, but that they may have uses =
to perform, and may be made happy in the performance.</p><p>A Very Small Re=
mnant.</p><p>When a church comes to an end, unless there are a few left who=
 are in good, there would be no hope for mankind. "Except the Lord of Hosts=
 had left unto us a very small remnant, we should have been as Sodom, and w=
e should have been like unto Gomorrah." (Isaiah 1:9.) Elijah, when he viewe=
d the desolation of Israel, spake words of despair when he said, "I, even I=
 only, am left.... And the Lord said unto him, Yet I have left me seven tho=
usand in Israel, all the knees which have not bowed unto Baal." (1 Kings 19=
:10, 14, 18.) Elijah represented the Lord in His temptations, and in His de=
spair of the human race, even as is told of Him in the Psalm. (116:11.) "I =
said in my haste, All men are liars." And so the man of the church may at t=
imes think in his despair that he alone is in the effort to live a regenera=
te life. But let him remember the answer to Elijah, and the Lord's words co=
ncerning Himself, "I said in my haste."</p><p>Still, while there is hope th=
at the New Church will be established, it will at first be with a few, "a v=
ery small remnant." "When a church is vastated,... there are always preserv=
ed some with whom good and truth remain, although they are few." (A. C. 530=
.) And the New Church at first will be with a few. (A. R. 546; A. E. 730.) =
With these few, regeneration is possible. (A. C. 9439; L. J. 38.) On the ot=
her hand, it is said that "many who hold every kind of dogma are regenerate=
d by the Lord." (A. C. 1043.)  </p><p></p><div align=3D"Right">57</div><hr>=

 Thus "many" and "few" are relative terms. The seven thousand of Israel who=
 had not bowed the knee to Baal were a few, or were many, according to the =
point of view. Once, in the spiritual world, out of three hundred of the le=
arned only forty chose the way of wisdom. (D. Wis. I. 5. See also C. L. 415=
5.) These latter are a few, yet the same proportion when millions are count=
ed would produce relatively a large number.</p><p>Rebellion.</p><p>To rebel=
 signifies to make war against (re-bellum). It is resistance to lawful auth=
ority. Sometimes rebellion is patriotism. It is an old saying that resistan=
ce to tyrants is obedience to God. But rebellion may have its rise in a des=
ire to rule. The natural man does not wish to be ruled. He thirsts for domi=
nion, but veils his desire in the name of freedom. Rebellion is a word of f=
requent occurrence in the Old Testament. The disposition to rebel against t=
he law of Jehovah was continual with the Jews. Spiritually, it is resistanc=
e to the law and order of heaven, a spirit that is implanted in all men. Ev=
en the regenerating man rebels at first. (A. C. 5647.) For hitherto the nat=
ural had dominion, and is unwilling to yield without a struggle. Hence aris=
e spiritual temptations, or the combat between the internal and external ma=
n.</p><p>To rebel against the order of heaven is the perpetual endeavor of =
every evil spirit. "Rebellious commotions in hell are continual, because ev=
eryone there wills to be the greatest, and burns with hatred against others=
. (H. H. 514.) What exists in hell has its beginnings in the world; and, if=
 not subdued in this life, the spirit of rebellion endures forever. There i=
s one only road to its removal,--submission to the will of the Lord, to the=
 rule of Divine Law; not a passive, but an active submission, one that invo=
lves combat and resistance to the forces that rise up from below and excite=
 the spirit of rebellion.  </p><p></p><div align=3D"Right">58</div><hr><p>

 The tendency to rebel does not cease until the natural is subdued, and is =
ready to submit to Divine order. For "that the Lord may render any One bles=
sed and happy, He wills a total submission." (A. C. 6138.)</p><p>The Bitter=
ness of Rebellion.</p><p>The wars of this world may give us a faint idea of=
 "the rebellious commotions" in hell, where war is perpetual, but magnified=
 a hundredfold. Hence the bitterness or misery of life in hell cannot be ex=
pressed in human language.</p><p>What is bitter is undelightful to the tast=
e. Hence it signifies what is spiritually undelightful;--the undelight whic=
h arises when there is resistance to Divine order. All in hell are in this =
undelight. They inspire the natural in man to a similar resistance. Hence a=
rises all grief of mind, all bitterness of spirit; and it is signified in t=
he Word by bitter substances, such as wormwood, gall, myrrh, wild grapes, c=
olocynth, etc. (A. E. 618.) It is also involved in the word "rebellion" in =
Hebrew, which signifies bitterness, and, by derivation, calamity, misfortun=
e, grief, and all anguish of spirit. Bitterness, or all undelight, is cause=
d by acting against Divine order. Such action meets with resistance from he=
aven. This reaction of hell is the cause of all evil, natural and spiritual=
, all disease of the body and disorder of the mind. The confirmed reaction =
of hell against the order of heaven is what is called sin. Evil spirits who=
 inspire such reaction can be removed only by Divine means, only by the Lor=
d when a man acts, resists, and continues to resist, as of himself, from th=
e Lord. This is the only road to health, natural and spiritual.</p><p>Hence=
 the part of wisdom is not to rebel against the conditions in which we find=
 ourselves; for this is to cooperate with evil spirits in their reaction ag=
ainst Divine order; for in this is the bitterness of rebellion, the continu=
ous and permanent condition of hell.  </p><p></p><div align=3D"Right">59</d=

</p><p>Gossip.</p><p>The word "gossip," as commonly applied, has reference =
to personal remarks about others, often ill-founded, and sometimes even of =
a scandalous character. There is a legitimate interest in the affairs of ot=
hers, and conversation concerning these is not in itself improper. But when=
 what other people are thinking and doing becomes the chief interest in lif=
e, then too often such persons are as "spies ... who seek for nothing but f=
aults and blemishes, ... that they may find fault and condemn." (A. C. 5432=
:4.) "It is wonderful that one can speak chidingly of another who intends e=
vil, or say to him, 'Do not do this, because it is sin'; and yet with diffi=
culty can he say it to himself; the reason is, because the latter moves the=
 will, but the former only the thought next to the hearing. It was inquired=
 in the spiritual world who could do the former, and they were found to be =
as few as doves in a spacious desert." (T. C. R. 535.) Dow the Writings ope=
n and reveal the heart of man! To see this is to see evidence of their Divi=
ne origin. In them the Lord speaks as never man spake. (John 7:46.) We are =
to view what others are thinking and doing, not from ourselves, but from th=
e Lord. The view will then be from good will, from charity and mercy; and t=
hen we shall not judge from the appearance, but judge a righteous judgment.=
 (John 7:24.)</p><p>The Thought of Persons.</p><p>A personality is defined =
to be "anything said of a person, especially if disparaging." It is the dis=
paraging thought of the neighbor that is discouraged in the Writings; for t=
he man that lives and breathes in the atmosphere of personalities is a pure=
ly natural man, and hence devoid of charity and good will. We read that in =
the internal sense of the Word there is no thought of persons (A. C. 1434, =
4857); that thought and speech in the other life is abstracted from persons=
, and hence the thought there is universal (A. C. 5287); that thought deter=
mined to persons limits and bounds the ideas (A. C. 6653:2; A. E. 405:2);  =

 that the angels are unwilling to speak about persons, because this turns a=
way the ideas from what is universal (A. C. 7002); that, in angelic speech,=
 the person is not mentioned, but that which is in the person and makes the=
 person (A. R. 872); hence to love the neighbor, regarded in itself, is not=
 to love the person, but the good which is in the person (T. C. R. 417); an=
d further, that the Lord is the only Person in the internal sense (L. 2); a=
nd yet even to love the Lord is not to love the Person, but to love the thi=
ngs which proceed from Him, for these are the Lord with man (A. E. 973(2), =
1099(3)); and we are told that to love the Lord merely as a Person is a nat=
ural, and not a spiritual love. (A. R. 611:7; D. Love XIII; D. Wis. XI.)</p=

ith them begins with the individual; but the wise parent or teacher looks f=

Lord, who is present in all good.</p><p>Conversation.</p><p>Nothing ought t=

 communication of ideas. We have but to take heed to the quality of the ide=
as that we wish to impart, withholding such as do not look to charity and g=
ood will.</p><p>The Writings have much to say on the uses of conversation. =

 Writings, constantly reiterated, is that man can do nothing from himself, =
but only from that which is prior to himself. This law is universal, admitt=
ing of no exception, in man, in nature, in the spiritual world, in all crea=
tion. It is a new truth in theology and in the doctrine of churches; new in=
 philosophy, in morals, and in natural science. The belief that man lives a=
nd acts from himself is well-nigh universal. Any belief in the truth is exc=
eptional, limited, and local, held darkly in the mind of a few. But it is n=
ow revealed to the New Church, and is to be in that Church as a guiding sta=
r, as a beacon light leading to heaven. If man could live or act from himse=
lf--if this were possible-we would be God. But we are told that God alone a=
cts from Himself, and all created things act from Him. The very prayer for =
help is a prayer that we may have power to act as of ourselves from the Lor=
d, who is the First, the Supreme, and the Omnipotent. This truth is so vita=
l that no church, nor any religion in the world, is left wholly without som=
e teaching of it.  </p><p></p><div align=3D"Right">62</div><hr><p>

 A. C. 4101. Influx 144, and elsewhere.)</p><p>The subject is fully explain=

 himself (D. L. W. 117), and that the angels can do good from themselves. (=
A. E. 897.)</p><p>Illustrated by the Fallacy of Perpetual Motion.</p><p>The=
 term "perpetual motion," as usually understood, means that a machine can b=
e constructed which, without any supply of power from a source outside of i=
tself, will continue in motion without cessation, or until the materials we=
ar out. Fortunes have been spent in the endeavor to make such a machine. "B=
ut this is now known to be absolutely impossible." (Chambers' Encyclopedia.=
) While this is seen to be impossible as a practical fact, the fallacy that=
 is its spring and source still exists in the belief that man lives and act=
s from himself, that the operations of nature exist from no source prior to=
 themselves, and that the sun is in a condition of perpetual motion, and do=
es not act from anything prior to itself. Universal nature is thus believed=
 to be like a machine wound up by the Creator in the beginning, and then le=
ft to run itself from itself forever, or until the last day; and man himsel=
f, after he is once created, is believed to be like a self-perpetuating, se=
lf-regulating machine, having no need of a higher power to sustain him. The=
re is a belief in some kind of higher power, but this is outside of man, wh=
o thinks and acts in a condition of independence of any force or impulse ex=
cept that which is self-derived. The body, with its brain, is a perpetual-m=
otion machine that ceases to operate only with its death; and in this the m=
ind is regarded as similar to the body. It is indeed said that God has all =
power, but this is not seen or acknowledged in any rational or spiritual li=
ght.  </p><p></p><div align=3D"Right">64</div><hr><p>

</p><p>Nothing Unconnected Exists.</p><p>There is nothing in the created un=
iverse that is unconnected with something prior to itself, from which it de=
rives its impulse and power to act. And so we read that "a thing which is u=
nconnected does not exist." (A. C. 2886.)</p><p>"It is a general law that n=
othing can exist and subsist from itself, but only from another, that is, b=

 and by means of things prior with that which is First, perishes in an inst=

onnection with what is prior to itself, consequently with what is First, th=
at is, with the Lord. What is unconnected, and thus independent, cannot exi=
st even a single moment, for the cause of its subsistence is its connection=
 with and dependence upon that from which comes all existence." (A. C. 5377=
.)</p><p>"No one, either in heaven or in hell, thinks, speaks, wills, and a=
cts from himself, but from others, and thus finally, all and each from the =
general influx of life which is from the Lord." (A. C. 5986.)</p><p>"Nothin=

hich is not continually held in connection with the First by intermediates =
is forthwith dissolved and altogether dissipated." (H. H. 9. See also D. L.=
 W. 303. A. E. 349:5, and elsewhere.)</p><p>Revelation, therefore, plainly =
teaches that there is not anything self-existent in the created universe. G=

</p><p>Impatience.</p><p>An article on the subject of "Impatience" was publ=
ished in NEW CHURCH LIFE for June, 1907. On account of the importance of th=
e subject, some of the things then said will bear repeating. It will not be=
 denied that impatience is one of the most grievous evils of human life, fr=
om which hardly any one is free, though its injurious effects vary with dif=
ferent individuals. Impatience may be defined as the unwillingness to bear,=
 suffer, or endure from another any opposition to what one wishes to carry =
into effect. It is, in fact, anger because of obstacles, whether these are =
from the neighbor, or from the dispositions of Providence in the affairs of=
 life, or in the operation of natural laws. In one word, it is anger at opp=
osition, and there is stored in it the love of domination. It is not only a=
nger at obstacles, but it is unwillingness to wait for these to be removed =
according to the laws of order, or in the regular and unerring dispositions=
 of Providence,--apparently slow, but absolutely sure. Impatience not only =
vexes and distresses the spirit of man, but affects the body itself, and ma=
y give rise to grievous disease. We learn (S. D. 4587) that the origin of i=
mpatience is with malicious spirits, who induce torment of the mind, especi=
ally when the body is in a state of weariness. "They employ much art to inf=
use weariness and thence weakness," so that there is then an absence of sel=
f-control. It is well known that impatience or irritability most frequently=
 arises when there is weariness of body; also that impatience in one tends =
to excite a similar state in another. The diseases that are usually classed=
 as "nervous" are largely from this source. But there is a remedy,--a remed=
y that is gradual but sure. The mercy of the Lord is ever present to apply =
the remedy and give aid to him who supplicates, and who acts as of himself =
from the Lord in making a perpetual war against this or any evil that is su=
bversive of the life and order of heaven.  </p><p></p><div align=3D"Right">=

</p><p>Insanity.</p><p>As ordinarily understood, insanity is a disorder of =
the mind, an unsoundness of the mental faculties, so that, with the complet=
e loss of reason, there is a doing away with moral responsibility, and an i=
nability to distinguish between right and wrong. And we are told by experts=
 that the loss of self-control marks the beginning of insanity, and is its =
constant attendant. This is the insanity of the external or natural mind, v=
isible to the world. But we are taught that there is a spiritual and moral =
insanity that exists in the interiors of the natural mind, not apparent to =
the outer world, being held under restraint, and which for the most part do=
es not break forth during the life of the body, because the natural or exte=
rnal understanding is still intact, and the man appears to his neighbors as=
 a good and useful citizen of the world, and perhaps even as an upright mem=
ber of the church, distinguished for acts of piety. But all this is changed=
 after death, for the external is then taken away; and with it all self-con=
trol departs, and the man or spirit appears as he is and has been interiorl=
y, worse than the brute animals, and even as a raging maniac, whom nothing =
any longer restrains, except the fear of punishment. This is interiorly the=
 state of every evil or unregenerate man in the world, but which, as was sa=
id, does not break out into the open, for reasons of natural prudence; and =
laws are provided that such a breaking out may not take place, for then soc=
iety would be destroyed. But even in this world there are occasions when th=
ere is an overriding of all law, when the internal insanity of the natural =
man appears, and there is a temporary overturn of the civil and moral law, =
as frequently happens when wars are going on, or in the case of robberies, =
murders and adulteries, disturbances in families, or when a man is in the m=
idst of boon companions. He then appears as anything but an upright gentlem=
an or an exponent of the moral law.</p><p>The regenerating man also has his=
 states of interior insanity, which we will be able to discover by self-exa=
mination and reflection, and gradually remove by repentance.  </p><p></p><d=

. 267:3.)</p><p>Every evil or unregenerate man "is wise while in the body, =
but insane while in the spirit; and no man is wise in the spirit but from t=
he Lord." (C. L. 269:5.)</p><p>"With the evil, the internal mind is insane =
and the external mind is wise; but with the good, the internal mind is wise=
, and from this the external mind also." (C. L. 477:3.)</p><p>"The Lord gov=
erns the good by internal bonds, which are those of conscience; but the evi=
l He governs by external bonds; if these were-broken, everyone would become=
 insane." (A. C. 4217:3, 1944.)</p><p>"The thoughts and affections, especia=
lly the interior intentions which men fear to manifest, are so insane in so=
me that, unless they were restrained by external bonds, they would rush int=
o murder and robbery." (A. C. 4793.)</p><p>It is shown (S. D. 4829) that al=
l would have become insane, even in externals, if the Lord had not come int=
o the world.</p><p>"Evil spirits are insane." (S. D. 4334.) This number ind=
icates that insanity has its spring in the love of self, or, what is the sa=
me, in hatred of others.</p><p>Conceit, or the love of one's own intelligen=

ans was insane.</p><p>It is necessary to understand clearly that there is s=
piritual as well as natural insanity, bearing relation to each other as cau=
se and effect. Spiritual insanity "is a delirium of the mind arising from f=
alsities; and a preminent delirium is the delirium of the mind arising from=
 truths falsified to such a degree that these (falsifications) are believed=
 to be wisdom." (C. L. 312.)  </p><p></p><div align=3D"Right">68</div><hr><=

 Such insanity prevails especially in the deeper hells.</p><p>The Definitio=
ns of Conjugial Love.</p><p>Conjugial love is variously defined in the Writ=
ings, but the definitions all look to one idea, that it is the love of one =
of the sex. "Conjugial love is not the love of the sex, but the love of one=
 of the sex." (C. L. 448.) For "the love of the sex is the love of many and=
 with many of the sex, but conjugial love is the love only to one and with =
one of the sex." (C. L. 48.) "It is the desire to live with one wife only."=
 (C. L. 80.) "By the Christian conjugial is meant the marriage of one man w=
ith one wife." (C. L. 142.) "Conjugial love is the fundamental love of all =
celestial and spiritual loves, and thence of all natural loves." (C. L. 65,=
 58. A. C. 5053. S. D. 4229. A. E. 993:2.) That is, it is the foundation on=
 which all celestial and spiritual loves rest, and from which all natural l=
oves spring. But the love of the sex is first in the order of time. "Natura=
l love, which is the love of the sex, precedes spiritual love, which is the=
 love of one of the sex." (C. L. 449.) But man is first introduced into the=
 love of the sex, in order that by it he may be introduced into a love of o=
ne of the sex. (C. L. 98, 150.) Conjugial love is clearly defined even in t=
he letter of the Word. "For this cause a man shall leave father and mother,=
 and shall cleave unto his wife; and they two shall be one flesh." (Matthew=
 19:5. Genesis 2:24.) Hence monogamic marriage has been established in the =
Christian world, by which love truly conjugial is made possible. In betroth=
al, and in the first of married life, there is some image of the conjugial =
(C. L. 58, 145), but it is afterward stored away in the interiors for prese=
rvation as remains to sustain in future combat and resistance to infernal f=
orces.</p><p>Wherefore, the love of the one that has been chosen should be =
cherished and cultivated as long as life in this world shall last, not perm=
itting the thought of another to enter and take possession of the mind and =
heart.  </p><p></p><div align=3D"Right">69</div><hr><p>

</p><p>XI</p><p>As It Were Our Own.</p><p>In a former Topic, the subject of=
 the "As of Himself," as taught in the Doctrines, was set forth with a view=
 to showing how essential it is to spiritual life. A further consideration =
of the subject may be of use, as illustrated in our natural plane of life. =
Nothing in this natural sphere is absolutely our own, but things are only r=
elatively so. What we have is but a temporary possession, to be relinquishe=
d at death. For instance, we are not only dependent upon the help of other =
men, and upon nature, for our sustenance and support, but our property and =
possessions belong by priority to the state, and we have the use of them as=
 if they were our own. For what we possess we pay rent to the state in the =
form of a tax, which is an acknowledgment of the priority of ownership. The=
 state may at any time apply it to its own purpose, as in the time of war, =
with or even without compensation. And the state may even ask us to yield u=
p life itself in its defense, to which the patriotic citizen responds, reco=
gnizing the prior right of the state, to which in all respects we owe obedi=
ent service, since the state is greater than the individual, and its preser=
vation a supreme duty. But even the state is not in the position of absolut=
e ownership. It possesses what it has as a steward under the Lord,--the one=
 and only absolute Possessor of all things,--the things which He has create=
d. Thus it is that not anything natural or spiritual, in heaven or on earth=
, is absolutely ours, but only as it were our own.</p><p>The Permission of =
Evil.</p><p>There are not many things of more importance than the acknowled=
gment of the Divine Providence in the permission of evil. The teaching is, =
that evil is permitted for the sake of good to mankind, and that the indivi=
dual may be saved (D. P. 16, 234, 275); in other words, evil is permitted t=
hat freedom may exist and be preserved.  </p><p></p><div align=3D"Right">70=

 For there is no salvation except man be free. This is wonderful! In order =
that freedom may exist, it is abridged or taken away! So it appears to huma=
n sight and ken. For evil and the falsity of evil, coming into activity, pl=
ace a limit on human action, and they sometimes bring despair, or impatienc=
e with the ways of Providence.</p><p>Let us clearly understand that evil is=
 not permitted merely for the sake of natural good to man, but for his spir=
itual good, especially for his good in the life after death. (D. P. 214-220=
.) In this we see the reason why the Divine Providence hides itself under a=
 cloud of appearances. This is because the Lord is not working for the esta=
blishment of the kingdoms of this world, except so far as they may be made =
instrumental for the establishment of His eternal kingdom. "The Lord leads =
man, and provides that whatsoever befalls him, whether sad or joyous, shall=
 yield good to him." (A. C. 6303.)</p><p>Decision by Lot.</p><p>All readers=
 of ancient history are aware of the common practice at that time of decisi=
on by lot. The Old Testament records the frequent use of lottery. And we re=
ad of an important decision by lot in the spiritual world. (T. C. R. 696.) =
In this manner, Matthias was chosen in the place of Judas by the eleven apo=
stles. (Acts 1:26.) The New Church as an organized body had its beginning i=
n the city of London by an act of lottery in the choice of a minister. It i=
s not uncommon now to decide matters by lot, but very largely in sport.</p>=
<p>We are told that Providence is in lotteries. (L. J. 19; S. D. 4008; T. C=
. R. 696.) That is, a decision by lot is decision by Providence. Are we aut=
horized by the above instances, and by the teaching just noted, to resort t=
o lottery? In answer, we must consider the other teaching, that now it is l=
awful for the understanding to enter into all things of the Word. (T. C. R.=
 508.) This clearly indicates that decisions are now to be made according t=
o reason in the light of Revelation.  </p><p></p><div align=3D"Right">71</d=

 Doctrine from the Word is the infallible guide in all things of life. But =
is there never to be any resort to lottery? Leaving out the playful casting=
 of lots, it is plain that any important question should be decided by reas=
on under Revelation; or, if it cannot be decided in this way, the next thin=
g is to wait, and the Lord will decide it in some unexpected way. But if we=
 cannot wait and, a decision must be made, then let a lot be cast, with a s=
erious determination to abide by the decision, since it is of the Lord and =
His Providence. It would thus seem that a resort to lottery in serious matt=
ers is justified only in cases of actual necessity, and that a frequent use=
 of it is to be avoided. </p><p>Judas Iscariot.</p><p>A correspondent asks =
if there is any evidence in the Writings that Judas was saved. There is no =
positive statement, but the inference is that he was saved, and numbered wi=
th the twelve in the spiritual world.* We are told (T. C. R. 4) that "the L=
ord called together His twelve disciples, now angels, and sent them forth i=
nto all the spiritual world ... to preach the Gospel anew." Further (T. C. =
R. 108) that "the twelve apostles were called together by the Lord, and sen=
t forth into all the spiritual world." Finally (T. C. R. 791), that "the Lo=
rd called together His twelve disciples who followed Him in the world," and=
 sent them forth as above. The statement is also made (T. C. R. 339) that "=
these things were written in the presence of the twelve apostles of the Lor=
d, who, while I was writing them, were sent to me by the Lord."</p><p>* The=
 nearest to a direct statement is in the Word Explained, II: 1479, where we=
 read, "There is said to be hope for Judas."</p><p>It is true that the apos=
tles chose Matthias by lot in the place of Judas (Acts 1:26), and it is sup=
posed that Matthias, and not Judas, is to be classed among the twelve who "=
followed the Lord in the world," and was among the twelve sent forth in the=
 spiritual world.  </p><p></p><div align=3D"Right">72</div><hr><p>

 It may be remarked here that Matthias is not mentioned anywhere in the Gos=
pels or in the Writings; but in both, Judas is frequently spoken of as "one=
 of the twelve" (Matthew 26:47, and elsewhere); and we read that "Jesus cal=
led unto Him His disciples, and of them He chose twelve, whom also He named=
 apostles." (Luke 6:13, Judas with the rest.) It is thus clear that Judas w=
as one of the twelve "who followed Him in the world." Although, according t=
o Peter (Acts 1:21), Matthias was among those who followed Him from the beg=
inning, he did not follow Him as one of the twelve, nor was he rated among =
them until he was chosen by lot to take the place of Judas. He was then num=
bered with the eleven apostles" (Acts 1:26), but not before.</p><p>The Repr=
esentation of Judas.</p><p>We are given to understand that Judas represente=
d the same as Judah, the name being the same. (See A. C. 4751.) Both repres=
ented the Jewish nation, sometimes in a good sense, and at other times in a=
n evil sense. But since the Lord was condemned and rejected by the Jews, it=
 was necessary that this also should be represented. The severe rebuke whic=
h the Lord administered several times to Judas was in reality said of the J=
ewish nation, and did not reflect upon the personal character of Judas. Nei=
ther does the betrayal by Judas, nor his repentance afterward, present any =
indication of his spiritual state, what it had been or was to be after deat=
h. It is the same with all the personages mentioned in the historical parts=
 of the Word. From what is there said of them, nothing is revealed of their=
 spiritual state, or of their life after death. And unless we are told in t=
he Writings that they have been saved in heaven or cast into hell, we are i=
n perfect ignorance of their final lot, no matter what the appearance may b=
e. For representation does not reflect upon the person, but upon the thing =
represented. (See below.)</p><p>As to the betrayal of the Lord, Peter also =
betrayed Him, denying Him thrice, even though he repented as Judas did.  </=

</p><p>XII</p><p>Obedience in the Marriage Service.</p><p>It is well-known =
that the marriage service of some denominations requires of the woman a pro=
mise of obedience to her husband. "Wilt thou obey him, and serve him, and k=
eep him in sickness and in health?" So says the Episcopal service. The Meth=
odist service uses the same words. In addressing the man, both services mer=
ely say, "Wilt thou love her, comfort her, honor, and keep her in sickness =
and in health?" But the requirement of obedience on the part of the woman h=
as not entered any marriage service of the New Church. Those who constructe=
d our services saw that consent was more in agreement with the spirit of fr=
eedom descending from the New Heaven; and so the same words are used in the=
 address to the woman as to the man.</p><p>The matter is made plain in the =
following teaching: "Joseph spake unto the house of Pharaoh, saying,... Spe=
ak, I pray you, in the ears of Pharaoh, saying,... signifies solicitation t=
o consent,... ears denoting obedience, in the present case consent, because=
 it is said to the king. Obedience also is consent, but is called obedience=
 when to those of a lower rank, but consent when to those of a higher rank.=
" (A. C. 6513.) In the case before us, the man is the one who solicits, and=
 the woman is the one who consents. It is the action and the reaction of eq=
uals in the contract, instead of the promise of an inferior to a superior, =
agreeing to obey as a servant her lord. In heaven, no thought of obedience =
as a servant ever enters the marriage relation. (See C. L. 20, 21.)</p><p>W=
hen they are engaged to each other, the woman consents. Why should it be di=
fferent in the marriage service?  </p><p></p><div align=3D"Right">75</div><=

</p><p>Distinction between Ruling and Leading.</p><p>"Hell rules violently;=
 the Lord does not rule (imperat), but leads." (A. C. 6390.) Imperare with =
the Romans was primarily a military term, signifying to command or give an =
order. In the Old Testament, the Divine Truth takes the form of command, be=
ing addressed to the simple and children. But in the New Testament, the rea=
l truth begins to appear, and more fully in the Writings, being addressed t=
o the intelligent and wise. The Lord said to His disciples: "The Shepherd g=
oeth before them, and the sheep follow Him.... My sheep hear my voice, and =
I know them, and they follow me." (John 10:4, 27.) It was the custom of she=
pherds to lead their flocks, and this was in view in the Lord's words. As t=
he sheep followed, and were not driven, so with man in his relations with t=
he Lord.</p><p>The truth does not command, but leads in freedom according t=
o reason. (D. P. 71-99.) The Lord by it preserves the freedom of man as the=
 apple of the eye. (See the use of this phrase in Deuteronomy 32:10 and Psa=
lm 17:8.) Every reader of the Writings has observed the frequent use of the=
 term "freedom." In this is shown the supreme importance of it to human lif=
e, since in it and by it the Lord leads man. The angels are like the Lord; =
they do not command but lead. (A. C. 5732. H. H. 218.) So it is to be in th=
e church. The priest is not to command, but to lead. (H. D. 315, 318, and e=
lsewhere.) And so every man with his neighbor.</p><p>The Lord did not come =
into the world to command. He said, "I am among you as He that serveth." (L=
uke 22:27.)</p><p>The Cause of the Phenomena in the Spiritual World.</p><p>=
The natural man believes that his thoughts are his own, and from no other s=
ource, and that his works are no other than from himself. The teachings of =
the Lord, that without Him we can do nothing (John 15:5), and that a man ca=
n do nothing except it be given from heaven (John 3:27), have no meaning to=
 him.  </p><p></p><div align=3D"Right">76</div><hr><p>

 It is similar in the spiritual world. The evil spirit has no other thought=
 than that the things within and around him are his own. On the other hand,=
 the angels acknowledge with delight of heart that the things within and ar=
ound are only as it were from themselves, and that all are from God. Hence =
they perceive that the law of their internal life is one and the same; that=
 the things they perceive within them and see around them, while altogether=
 real, are only as it were their own, but given them to be forever as their=
 own by the God of all created things (A. C. 4882); thus that "the things w=
hich are around them are allotted an appearance according to those which ar=
e within them" (H. H. 156); that is, since their thoughts are real and subs=
tantial, so are the appearances around them real and substantial. Now the a=
ppearance that an angel lives from himself is a real appearance. It is a re=
al appearance that his affections and thoughts are his own, and so it is wi=
th these same affections and thoughts when they appear in correspondent for=
ms outside of him. As the one is real, so is the other real. (A. C. 5605; D=
. L. W. 322.) Hence it is that the appearance that a man lives from himself=
 is the cause of all the phenomena of the spiritual world, and is what caus=
es them to be called real appearances, or forms composed of real substances=
; just as the things in the minds of the angels are real appearances compos=
ed of real substances. As is the one, so is the other. There is no differen=
ce, except as is the difference between what is interior and purer and what=
 is exterior and more gross.</p><p>The Angels Learn even from the Falsities=
 of Hell.</p><p>It seems strange at first sight that the angels can acquire=
 truths even from hell itself, but so it is, as we read: "All the good whic=
h flows down from heaven (into hell) is turned into evil;... in like manner=
, truth into falsity; on the other hand, evil and falsity are turned into g=
ood and truth in heaven." (A. C. 3607.)  </p><p></p><div align=3D"Right">77=

 This makes clear that a truth descending from heaven is immediately turned=
 into its opposite falsity in hell, and is received as such by the evil who=
 are there; and, by a reversal of the law, a falsity ascending towards heav=
en is turned into a truth as it enters the minds of the angels. As every ev=
il and falsity of hell is, in its origin, a good or a truth of heaven, turn=
ed into its opposite, its return to heaven is but a return to its proper fo=
rm and quality. It is under this law that every society of heaven has a soc=
iety opposite to it in hell. (H. H. 541, 542, 588, 594.) According to the s=
ame law, a man in the world who is in good, or in the love of truth for its=
 own Sake, may read a book teaching diabolical falsities, and learn many tr=
uths therefrom; for in a mind spiritually enlightened, there is an immediat=
e turning of evil into its opposite good, and of falsity into its opposite =
truth. There is indeed a hazard attending this; but, as we read, a spirit w=
hose mind is illumined by the light of heaven may pass through hell itself =
in safety, because under the Divine protection. (A. C. 968, 6370, 6769.)</p=

known in the Ancient Church, which is, that when the judgment takes place, =
the evil are deprived of truths, and thus of understanding, and become insa=
ne in spiritual things. A knowledge of this law, and of other spiritual law=
s, was handed down to the Greeks and Romans, and hence their philosophers h=
ad more of spiritual light than is common in the philosophy of the present =
day.  </p><p></p><div align=3D"Right">78</div><hr><p>

 They were able to elevate the understanding above the sensuals of the body=
, and see truths in abstract light,--a gift that has now well-nigh departed=
 from the minds of men. (A. C. 6201, 6313, 10099.) In that light, they coul=
d see something of the operation of the last judgment upon the evil in the =
spiritual world, and the mode by which they were judged and cast into hell.=
 When the judgment takes place, new truth is revealed to the good and to th=
e evil, who are together in the world of spirits. This new truth is receive=
d by the good and rejected by the evil, and it is the cause of the separati=
on of the one from the other, the good then being taken up into heaven, and=
 the evil cast into hell; that is, they cast themselves, in order to hide t=
hemselves from "the wrath of the Lamb." Not that there is any wrath in the =
Lord, who is love and mercy itself; but it is their own wrath, hatred, and =
rage against the new truth revealed, the sphere and presence of which they =
cannot endure. Their inward and slumbering hatred breaks forth. They can no=
 longer control themselves, and they become insane within and without. It i=
s their spiritual destruction, and this is what is meant by the saying of t=
he philosophers, "Whom the gods would destroy, they first make mad."</p><p>=
Something of the operation of this law is seen in the world, in the relatio=

</p><p>XIII</p><p>A Watery Atmosphere.</p><p>There is a complete atmosphere=
 called the watery atmosphere, concerning which we read in Conjugial Love (=
n. 188), as follows: "The lowest atmosphere is watery, a higher is aerial, =
a still higher is ethereal, above which there is a highest." This last or h=
ighest is the atmosphere or aura of the natural sun. The other three are at=
mospheres of the earth. The watery atmosphere is spoken of in several passa=
ges of the Writings, and it is stated that there is also a watery atmospher=
e in the spiritual world. (A. R. 238, 290, 878.) There are in universal cre=
ation five auras or atmospheres. The first is the aura, of the spiritual su=
n, coextensive with the universe, spiritual and natural; the second is the =
aura of the natural sun, embracing the solar system; and finally, the three=
 atmospheres of the earth,--the ether, the air, and the watery atmosphere. =
In some numbers, the watery atmosphere is omitted, and the natural atmosphe=
res are spoken of as three,--the aura, the ether, and the air. (T. C. R. 32=
 and elsewhere.)</p><p>The watery atmosphere, unacknowledged as such by mod=
ern science, is fully described by Swedenborg in the Principia. Like the pa=
rticles of ail the auras or elements, the particle of the watery atmosphere=
 has an active internal or centre of a higher degree, and an external or bo=
dy of a lower. Its active internal is composed of ether particles, and its =
body of particles of water. These fall to the earth when the ether particle=
s are withdrawn by the process that is called condensation. The watery atmo=
sphere, as it is in itself, is not visible to the eye. It exists even in th=
e dearest sky. But when the descent or condensation begins, it first appear=
s as clouds, and then as rain. This atmosphere is continually being formed =
by the power of the sun's rays, acting upon the surface of the earth throug=
h the agency of the ether.  </p><p></p><div align=3D"Right">80</div><hr><p>

</p><p>The Indefinite.</p><p>In the Doctrine, we are told of the finite, th=
e indefinite, and the infinite. These are also terms in common use, but the=
y receive from Revelation a fulness of meaning unknown before. The finite i=
s that which has a limit, a border or boundary, which can be seen by the ey=
e or grasped by the imagination. The indefinite is that which has a limit o=
r boundary, but such as cannot be compassed by the human mind. The Infinite=
 is wholly beyond the reach of all the thought and imagination of man. We c=
an know that it is, but not what it is. The finite and the indefinite are i=
n and of the created universe, but the Infinite is prior to the universe. I=
t is God Himself in Himself, the Uncreate.</p><p>We read in the Arcana: "Th=
at is called indefinite which cannot be defined and comprehended by number;=
 but still the indefinite is finite relatively to the Infinite, and so fini=
te that there is no ratio between them." (A. C. 6232.) Heaven is indefinite=
, and an image of the Infinite of the Lord (A. C. 1590); but neither human =
nor angelic thought can measure the extent of heaven or perceive its bounda=
ry. The material universe is indefinite, but human thought can never reach =
its boundary or describe its extent. The thought of men and angels will alw=
ays remain finite. Human thought is even as the sight of the eye, which, ex=
tended into the universe, is dissipated before it reaches the border of the=
 indefinite. (A. C. 6700.) In respect to the Infinite, man is as nothing. O=
ur attention is called to the indefinite, that we may realize how far away =
we are from comprehending the Infinite.</p><p>Indifference.</p><p>Indiffere=
nce means literally to be without care, but it is mostly used to express a =
state of unconcern, or to regard a thing as not important, not worthy of at=
tention. In matters of religion, it is involved in what is called agnostici=
sm. The agnostic says he does not know, which means that he is unconcerned,=
 is not interested, does not care whether there is a God or not, or a life =
after death.  </p><p></p><div align=3D"Right">81</div><hr><p>

 It is not important, so he turns away from it, and immerses his thought in=
 the things of the world. This is the state meant by the words in the Gospe=
l, "It were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and=
 he were drowned in the depth of the sea." (Matthew 18:6.) Profanation of t=
he truth of the Word is thereby prevented. A man will not profane that whic=
h does not occupy his thought. The term "indifference" is used in the Writi=
ngs in the sense indicated above, also the word "security," that is, carele=
ss security. "Security of life arises from the belief of an impious man tha=
t there is no life after death, or from the belief of him who separates lif=
e from salvation.... Every man who is in this security makes nothing of adu=
lteries, frauds, injustice, violence, blasphemy, revenge, but opens his fle=
sh and his spirit to them all; nor does he know what spiritual evil and the=
 lust of it are." (D. P. 340, Second.) Such is the state of the man who is =
indifferent to the spiritual truths of the Word.</p><p>In the New Church, i=
ndifference to spiritual things would be a positive danger, and its increas=
e would threaten the existence of the Church. For the Church grows by inter=
est in the spiritual things of doctrine, that is, by the growth of the spir=
itual affection of truth. But indifference in the Old Church is a help to t=
he New. In the unconcern of the outer world, there is safety. (See below.)<=

sities of evil working for its destruction, still there are many things tha=
t contribute to its upbuilding, such as civil law and order, political free=
dom, science, education, literature, the ritual of churches, scientifics of=
 every kind. The Lord is using all these, and many more, for the help of th=
e Church, though unknown to the doers and administrators of them.  </p><p><=

 evil and hell itself, though unwilling, is made to labor in the work of es=
tablishing the Lord's kingdom. The very indifference of the world to spirit=

his truth, however, must be with prudence and circumspection. (See A. C. 19=
7, 6398; A. R. 561.)</p><p>The Bones of Joseph.</p><p>The desire to be buri=
ed in one's own land is illustrated in the case of Jacob and Joseph. The re=
quest of Jacob, made before his death, was fulfilled by Joseph his son. (Ge=
nesis 50.) And Joseph made a similar request for himself: "And Joseph took =
an oath of the sons of Israel, saying, God will surely visit you, and ye sh=
all carry up my bones from hence." (Genesis 50:25.) This was done by Moses,=
 who "took the bones of Joseph with him." (Exodus 13:19.) "And the bones of=
 Joseph, which the children of Israel brought up out of Egypt, buried they =
in Shechem." (Joshua 24:32.) These historical circumstances are not of impo=
rtance, except as a part of a story for children, to interest them in the t=
hings of the Word; but they are of exceeding great value when viewed as to =

 Joseph represented the internal of the Ancient Church, and his bones signi=
fied all that was left of that internal with the Israelitish nation,--dead =
bones. "'Joseph died,' signified that this internal ceased to be." (A. C. 6=
593.) By his bones taken to the Land of Canaan "is signified that there sho=
uld be (with them in that land) the representative of a church, but not a c=
hurch,... for otherwise they would have profaned holy things." (A. C. 6592,=
 4289.) The state was similar with all the nations where the Ancient Church=
 had been, so that, at the time of the Lord's coming, there was left only a=
 remnant, signified by the bones of Joseph. Hence the church was transferre=
d to the gentiles. The state is similar at the end of every church, especia=
lly with the Christian Church now, at the time of the Lord's second coming.=
 Its ritual, its science and philosophy, its literature, and all things of =
its civil and moral life, are as the bones of Joseph; its internal gone, an=
d only a remnant of spiritual life remaining to constitute a basis for the =
upbuilding of a new Christian Church, which will be the salvation of the hu=
man race,--beginning with a few, and gradually increasing to many. (A. R. 5=
46, 547; A. E. 730, 732.) "For except the Lord of hosts had left unto us a =
very small remnant, we should have been as Sodom, and we should have been l=
ike unto Gomorrah." (Isaiah 1:9.)</p><p>Spiritual Good.</p><p>It is importa=
nt for the New Churchman to distinguish between spiritual good and natural =
good. In general, natural good is the good of this world, and spiritual goo=
d is the good of heaven, and is with those only who are preparing for heave=
n. There is no greater knowledge than the knowledge of spiritual good, exce=
pt the knowledge of celestial good, or the good of love to the Lord, which =
is the same thing as the knowledge of the Lord Himself, and which is called=
 the "pearl of great price." (Matthew 13: 46.)  </p><p></p><div align=3D"Ri=

</p><p>Natural good is concrete, objective, visible to the natural sight, a=
nd the natural man knows no other good; and the simple, children, and the y=
oung, and all who are uninstructed, or who are without illustration or spir=
itual enlightenment, are easily deceived by that appearance of good, called=
 "natural good" in the Doctrines. But spiritual good is abstract, internal,=
 invisible to the natural sight. It is that good which is signified by the =
"hidden manna" and the "white stone," and "on the stone a new name written,=
 which no man knoweth but he that receiveth it." (Revelation 2:17. A. R. 12=
0-123; A. E. 146-148.) Strictly speaking, the "hidden manna" is celestial g=
ood, and the "white stone" spiritual good; the former is within the latter,=
 and both are invisible, wholly unknown, to the natural man.</p><p>Spiritua=
l good is also called truth, the good of truth, the good of life, charity, =
love to the neighbor, the good of the spiritual church, and is signified by=
 "Israel" throughout the Word, while celestial good is signified by "Judah.=
"</p><p>Natural Good.</p><p>The following is some of the teaching concernin=

(A. C. 3469, 3518.)</p><p>"Natural good is from parents,... but spiritual g=
ood is from the Lord." (A. C. 3470.)</p><p>"Natural good from what is hered=
itary ... may be compared to the good with the gentle animals." (A. C. 4988=
.) That is, it is a mere amiability without religion.</p><p>"It is good wit=
hout truth, thus without the Lord." (A. C. 3963.)</p><p>"Spiritual good has=
 its quality from the truths of faith, ... but natural good is born with ma=
n.... Natural good saves no one, but spiritual good saves all." (A. C. 7761=

</p><p>"The good which has not its quality from the truths of faith is not =
Christian good, but is natural good, which does not give eternal life." (A.=
 C. 8772.)</p><p>"Those who do good from mere natural good, and not from re=
ligion, are not accepted after death, because there is only natural good, a=
nd not spiritual good, in their charity." (T. C. R. 537.)</p><p>"In the oth=

ty appears to them as truth.... For it is good from nature, and not from re=

, they cannot be protected by the angels." (A. C. 5032, 6208.)</p><p>"Natur=
al good, although it appears like good, still may not be good, but may inde=
ed be evil." (A. C. 3408.) That is, it may be evil covered over by the appe=
arance of good. In this case, it easily deceives and leads astray everyone =
who is not grounded in the spiritual truths of the Word.</p><p>XIV</p><p>Pu=
nishing the Innocent For the Guilty.</p><p>That the innocent may be punishe=
d for the guilty is an evil that was widespread in ancient times; and the p=
ractice is common even now. Men in their right mind know that it is wrong; =
yet it is done, because it is believed that God does it. Was He not willing=
 that His Son should become the innocent sufferer for the sins of mankind? =
The ancients, too, had a similar idea of their gods. And since all men act =
according to their idea of God, we find this principle permeating the condi=
tions of human life, entering even into the enactments of the civil law. Wh=
at wonder, then, that men should be persuaded that it is just and right tha=
t the innocent should suffer for the guilty, and should in many cases see n=
o other way to meet the requirements of justice?  </p><p></p><div align=3D"=

 But what is the teaching of the Writings? We read that, "among the gentile=
s, it was formerly a custom, when one sinned, to make his companions also s=
harers in his guilt, yea, even to punish a whole house for the sin of one i=
n it; but such a law is derived from hell, for in hell all companions consp=
ire together to do evil.... But to act in this manner in the world is altog=
ether contrary to Divine order.... The Divine law for men is, that every on=
e shall suffer punishment for his own iniquity." (A. C. 5764.) Thus every o=
ne should suffer for the crime he himself commits, and not for the crime an=
other commits. This is lawful in hell, for in hell no one is innocent; but =
on earth the innocent and the guilty are together. Hence the Divine law dis=
criminates, as we read: "The fathers shall not be put to death for the chil=
dren, nor the children for the fathers; but every man shall be put to death=
 for his own sin." (Deuteronomy 24:16; Ezekiel 18:20.) As the Divine law di=
scriminates, so should the laws of men; and New Churchmen, at least, should=
 know that there is always some other and better way.</p><p>Drunkenness.</p=
><p>The angels "abhor drunkenness." They said "that it is an enormous sin, =
because a man thereby becomes a brute, and is no longer a man." (S. D. 2422=
.) In heaven, therefore, drunkenness is regarded as a crime and as insanity=
, and it ought to be so regarded on earth. Hence drunkenness should be puni=
shed as a crime against society, or the drunkard should be treated as the i=
nsane are treated. It is contrary to Divine order to punish those who do no=
t commit this crime, for this is to punish the innocent for the guilty. "Th=
e soul that sinneth, it shall die," is the Divine mandate. He that commits =
the crime is the one to be punished, and not others who are innocent. It is=
 not a sin to make use of the gifts of God for the health of mind and body,=
 under the guidance of understanding and reason; but it is a sin to abuse t=
hose gifts, and he who abuses them should be dealt with according to his si=
n.  </p><p></p><div align=3D"Right">87</div><hr><p>

 He who uses, and does not abuse, should be protected in his use, and not b=
e treated as if he also were a criminal. Revelation teaches us to discrimin=
ate between use and abuse, to enjoy the one and shun the other; and he who =
would shun the use because of abuse is not wise. "Abuse does not take away =
use, as the falsification of truth does not take away truth, except only wi=
th those who do it." (D. L. W. 331.)</p><p>Excess.</p><p>Every one knows wh=
at excess is, but a fuller statement of what one knows is always of use. By=
 excess is meant going beyond a prescribed limit, or passing from order int=
o a state of disorder. An undue indulgence of the appetite for food and dri=
nk is a familiar example of excess. But the idea of excess reaches into a m=
uch wider field, including all bodily practice and habit, all the thoughts =
and desires of the mind that depart from the true order of life as given in=
 Revelation. Every act of excess is the violation of a law, is an act of in=
justice and injury to the neighbor. Every evil desire, every evil thought, =
and every evil deed, induces a state of excess, in which man passes beyond =
the boundaries set by the Divine Wisdom.</p><p>The condition of excess is w=
idespread, since it includes all undue indulgence of the senses, or of the =
appetites of mind and body. Revelation is as strong in its condemnation of =
excess in eating as in drinking. "The inhabitants of Jupiter do not prepare=
 food for the taste, but for its use to the body.... It is otherwise on our=
 earth, where the sense of taste rules, and thus the body sickens, and the =
mind becomes insane." (S. D. 596; A. C. 8378; E. U. 58.) The evils of glutt=
ony are not as apparent as the evils of drunkenness, but still they are gre=
at, even though insidious in character. The same law applies to all forms o=
f excess,--the law of self-control, wherein a man is to compel himself, rat=
her than making it his duty to compel others, especially when it goes so fa=
r as to punish the innocent for the guilty, wherein he also violates a Divi=
ne law.  </p><p></p><div align=3D"Right">88</div><hr><p>

 Let a man compel himself, even to the extent of a total abstinence when ne=
cessary. But temperance is better than abstinence.</p><p>The Writings on th=
e Use of Wine.</p><p>In the other world, the odor of wine was perceived, co=
ming from those who converse together from friendship and neighborly love. =
(A. C. 1517; S. D. 1047; T. C. R. 834.)</p><p>It is stated (A. C. 10040) th=
at bread without wine does not give nourishment to the body; that is, that =
the body is "better nourished" when there is wine. (See A. C. 8352, and com=
pare A. C. 5576, 6078.)</p><p>Wine is spoken of as being used in heaven, es=
pecially at marriage feasts. (C. L. 14, 20.) Conjugial love is compared to =
"noble wine." (C. L. 475.) So also is the genuine truth of the Word. (T. C.=
 R. 215.) The true worship of the Lord is compared to the "odor of the grap=
e and the taste of wine." (Coronis 51.)</p><p>Avarice is compared to "new u=
nfermented wine, which is sweet to the taste, but infests the stomach." (T.=
 C. R. 404.)</p><p>Catholics who in the other life receive the faith of hea=
ven, from having lived in charity in the world, "are invited to feasts, and=
 noble wine is given them to drink." (T. C. R. 820.)</p><p>The teaching is,=
 that whatever in nature corresponds to anything of heaven is, by virtue of=
 that fact, a good use. (H. H. 112, 113.) Wine corresponds to spiritual tru=
th, also to charity. (A. C. 3316, 3596, 6377; T. C. R. 215, 711.) Therefore=
, wine is a good use. It becomes an evil use when abused, and does not then=
 correspond to anything of heaven, but of hell. (See D. L. W. 336, etc.)</p=
><p>That wine is a good use is shown by the fact that it is spoken of as a =
food. (A. C. 5360, 9003; A. E. 329, 386.)</p><p>Wine was given by the Lord =
in the Last Supper, and ordained for use in the Christian Church, which is =
a sign that it is a form of use.  </p><p></p><div align=3D"Right">89</div><=

 The primitive Christians also used it at their love feasts.</p><p>It is pr=
oper to note here that Swedenborg, in a memorial on the liquor traffic to t=
he Swedish Diet in 1755, proposed strict rules for the limitation of the us=
e of whisky in Sweden; "that is," he said, "if the consumption of whiskey c=
annot be done away with altogether." (Documents I, 495.) Swedenborg himself=
, however, drank wine. (Documents II, 449.) And in Conjugial Love 145, he s=
ays that "wisdom purified may be compared to alcohol, which is spirit most =
highly rectified." Thus alcohol, or highly rectified spirit, is, in its pla=
ce, a good use, even though much abused in Sweden and in other countries.</=

 For the fashion of man's heart is evil from his childhood. (A. C. 928, 987=
.) By the "heart" here is meant the old will, which, if it be not overcome =
during life in the world, beginning in childhood, man cannot be saved.</p><=
p>In A. C. 987, we are told what man would become, if never restrained from=
 childhood. "Unless external bonds ... prevented him, he would rush into al=
l wickedness; nor would he rest until he had subjugated all in the universe=
, and acquired the wealth of all; nor would he spare any, except those who =
submitted themselves to him as vile slaves. Such is every man, although men=
 do not perceive it, on account of the impossibility and lack of power to a=
ccomplish their ends, and on account of the external bonds mentioned above.=
" The rest of the number should be read, in order to obtain a complete view=
 of the natural state of man, as being worse than that of the wild beast of=
 the forest, which state cannot be overcome except by the Lord alone. The t=
ruth thus set forth is illustrated in the history of most of the great conq=
uerors of the world, or those who had the lust of conquest.</p><p>Hence the=
 importance of obedience to law, both in early and in later life, until obe=
dience becomes a fixed habit of religion, a habit carried with us into the =
life after death, becoming there the basis of perpetual growth. </p><p>XV</=
p><p>The Oracles.</p><p>An oracle (orare--to speak, to pray) is "a response=
 delivered by a deity or supernatural being to a worshipper or inquirer; al=
so the place where the response was delivered," as at Delphi. In historic t=
imes the inquiry was mostly about some future event in the outer world, suc=
h as the success of a proposed enterprise or battle. Men wished to know of =
natural, not of spiritual things. The Scriptures, as delivered through the =
prophets and apostles, were also called the oracles of God, that is, the sp=
eech or word of God.  </p><p></p><div align=3D"Right">93</div><hr><p>

</p><p>Oracles were in use in all countries at the dawn of history. The cus=
tom had its origin in the Most Ancient Church, in which the father of the f=
amily was the oracle, through whom God spake, giving instruction about the =
things of heaven and eternal life. In the Ancient Church, regular oracles w=
ere established, or places where spiritual instruction could be given. When=
 the Ancient Church ceased, oracles continued, but instruction in spiritual=
 things was no longer sought or desired. In the Israelitish Church, the ora=
cle was in the Holy of Holies, where the Jews were told what to do or what =
not to do in some natural affair. But as with them there were false prophet=
s, or false oracles, through whom evil spirits spake, it was ordained that =
oracles with them, and in all nations, should cease, and the written Word w=
as to become the only oracle. Hence the command not "to seek unto them that=
 have familiar spirits, and unto wizards that peep and mutter; should not a=
 people seek unto their God? ... To the law and to the testimony; if they s=
peak not according to this word, it is because there is no light in them." =
(Isaiah 8:19, 20.)</p><p>The oracles everywhere gradually ceased to functio=
n after the Lord's coming and the establishment of the Christian Church. Th=
ere was, however, a kind of continuation in the form of witchcraft; and spi=
ritism is a modern revival. But the Word in its internal sense is now to be=
 the only oracle of God.</p><p>The Heroes of Mythology.</p><p>The stories o=
f mythology and folklore tell of the existence of heroes,-men of superhuman=
 strength, distinguished courage, great wisdom, and, in some cases, of extr=
aordinary size. These were called giants, some benevolent and others malign=
ant. In Greece of the heroic age, intermediate between that of the gods and=
 that of men, they were also called Titans and Cyclops; and in Scripture, N=
ephilim, Anakim, etc.  </p><p></p><div align=3D"Right">94</div><hr><p>

 The gods and heroes were themselves originally men (T. C. R. 292), kings, =
rulers, great generals, who were worshipped after their death, sometimes be=
fore it. We are told that Alexander wished to be worshipped as a god. See a=
lso the decree of Darius. (Daniel 6:7, etc.) Those whom they called gods we=
re in reality angels, all under one supreme God, called Zeus in Greece and =
Jupiter in Pome. The gods (elohim) of Scripture were also angels. (A. C. 72=
68, 7873.) The heroes were angels of a lower order, like the saints of the =
Christian Church. Samson may be classed among the heroes, having points in =
common with Hercules, both representing the power of the Lord in His Divine=
 Human.</p><p>In Hebrew, the word for "hero" means a strong one, a mighty m=
an. Spiritually, a celestial angel is meant, and in the supreme sense the D=
ivine Human, Jesus Christ, who is represented by all the heroes of the Word=
 and of mythology,--the one King of glory, strong and mighty in battle (Psa=
lm 24:8), who alone fought and overcame the bells (Isaiah 63:1-6), in order=
 that man might be redeemed and saved, without which there would have been =
no salvation for men or angels.</p><p>The Law of the First-born.</p><p>"Pri=
mogeniture is the rule of law under which the oldest son of the family succ=
eeds to the father's real estate, in preference to, and in absolute exclusi=
on of, the younger sons and all the sisters." (Chambers. See also "Entail."=
) This law had its origin in the representative customs of the Ancient Chur=
ch, handed down to us through Jewish and Gentile sources. "It was a statute=
 of the Ancient Church that the first-born were to be sanctified to God." (=
A. C. 8080.) Out of this arose all the later customs of primogeniture and e=
ntail. But as the rigid modern application of this law has been seen to be =
unjust, it has been modified or abolished in most countries. If the spiritu=
al significance of the primogeniture is not seen, there is a broader natura=
l view, such as that given in the Arcana Celestia no. 8042, where we are to=
ld that "the first or immediate generation or birth, which is of sons and d=
aughters, is what is signified by the first-born, however many there may be=
, but not the second and third, except in relation to their own parents."  =

&nbsp;</p><p>The need of seeing natural truths in a broad and wide sense, a=
nd not in one narrow and limited, is frequently set forth in the Writings. =
For instance, see the exposition of the Ten Commandments in the True Christ=
ian Religion, especially nos. 305, 309, 313, 317, 321, 326. Hence, as above=
, all the sons and daughters are meant, and not the first-born son alone; a=
nd hence the unwisdom of the narrow application of the law of primogeniture=
 or entail, out of which appearance in the literal sense of the Word arose =
the heresy of faith as the first-born of the church and the only essential =
of salvation, destroying all things of the church.</p><p>The Sense of Time =
Breeds Impatience.</p><p>"When man is in a state of love, he is, as it were=
, not in time, if there be no impatience; for impatience is a corporeal aff=
ection, and so far as man is in this, he is in time.... By the affection of=
 genuine love, a man is withdrawn from the things of time; for time appears=
 to be something on account of reflection upon those things which are not o=
f the affection or love, thus causing tedium." Tedium is weariness, restles=
sness, thus impatience with the present and a longing for imaginary conditi=
ons in the future. We read also that "haste involves time" (A. C. 5284) and=
 a consequent impatience with things present. In a former topic on "Impatie=
nce," it was noted that impatience arises from malicious spirits, who induc=
e torment of mind, especially when the body is weary. But with the angels t=
here is no sense of time, hence no tedium, no impatience, no anxious desire=
 for things to come. All their faculties are occupied with the present mome=
nt. And so their happiness is inconceivable to the natural mind.  </p><p></=

 Neither does man, in his interior thought, perceive time, being then assoc=
iated with the angels. (A. C. 4814.) It is in the exterior thought that the=
 sense of time takes possession, breeding impatience with the present, and =
a longing for a future that is unreal and illusory. Even the angels do not =
know the future, confessing that it is known to the Lord alone. (A. C. 2493=
; L. J. 14.) The attempt of the natural man to penetrate the future is resp=
onsible for many of the ills of this life.</p><p>Sincerity.</p><p>To be sin=
cere is to be what one wishes to appear to be, or, as we read, "The interna=
l and the external agree and make one with those who are sincere in heart. =
In the spiritual world it is not permitted to have a divided mind" (C. L. 4=
8a), that is, to think one thing and say another, which is deceit. (A. C. 9=
57; H. H. 508.) We are told further that "those who are sincere do not wish=
 to speak or even to think anything but what others, yea, all others, even =
the whole heaven, may know." (A. C. 1747; S. D. 3887.) This is the angelic =
state, which men may approximate. But in this world, where the good and the=
 evil are together, it is permitted that a man may not always speak just wh=
at he wills and thinks, however much he may desire to do so. For at times t=
here is need of prudence and circumspection for the sake of guard, protecti=
on and defense. That this is not deceit is plainly taught. (See A. C. 3993(=
12).)</p><p>There are some who believe that, in order to be honest and sinc=
ere, it is necessary to speak forth what one thinks, even if it be evil. Bu=
t this is a misconception; nor is it sincerity, rightly understood. In true=
 sincerity there is good will,--good will that leads one to withhold and sh=
un the evil thought, and not inflict it upon the neighbor. For "no one is a=
ble to live sincerely for the sake of God and the neighbor, except he who i=
s a Christian as to life." (S. D. 5541.) Christian good is spiritual good, =
which is charity and love to the Lord. (A. C. 5104, 5804, 7197.)  </p><p></=

 Let us remember, then, that it is not sincerity to speak and do the evil w=
hich one wills and thinks, for there is always lurking a desire to conceal =
and deceive, which speaks openly only when the fear of punishment is remove=
d.</p><p>Attributing Good to One's Self.</p><p>A danger to spiritual life i=
s in attributing good to one's self, and not to the Lord. If this becomes a=
 confirmed habit, no spiritual life is possible, for heaven is thereby clos=
ed. "The wiser anyone is, the more he believes that there is no wisdom from=
 himself" (A. C. 1936), nor any good. We are told that "they are in the str=
eam of Providence who attribute all things to the Lord." (A. C. 8478.) Henc=
e, "so far as man is being regenerated, he does not attribute anything of g=
ood and truth to himself, but to the Lord." (T. C. R. 610.) And we learn th=
at "the angels refuse all thanks on account of the good which they do, and =
are indignant when anyone attributes good to them." (H. H. 9.) Thus the eff=
ect of the angelic presence with man is to lead him to see that he is in ev=
il; on the other hand, the effect of the presence of evil spirits is to lea=
d him to think that he is in good, and not in evil. (A. C. 2380.) The angel=
s inspire him to attribute all good to the Lord; but evil spirits inspire h=
im to claim that there is nothing but good from himself, and that evil is f=
rom sources outside of himself, even from the Lord. In the one case, his fa=
ce is turned toward heaven, in the other toward hell.</p><p>The Terms Used =
in the Writings.</p><p>Nearly all the terms used in the Writings are taken =
from the theology of the Christian World, as derived by learned Christian w=
riters from the literal sense of the Word. Philosophy and science, as desce=
nding from the ancients, have contributed a portion. The language of the le=
arned,--the Latin language,--has also been used. The reason for all this is=
 because the New Church was to have its beginning in the Christian World. T=
herefore Christians are addressed, and also invited to the New Church. (A. =
E. 948:2).  </p><p></p><div align=3D"Right">98</div><hr><p>

 See also A. E. 331:5); Invitation IX; Coronis LV.) The invitation is addre=
ssed, indeed, to the whole world, but to Christians first, because they hav=
e the Word and a knowledge of the Lord; but even the gentiles must become C=
hristian, must receive the literal sense of the Word, and by it a knowledge=
 of the Lord, before they can become worthy recipients of the Lord in His S=
econd Coming. Hence the necessity of using terms that are familiar and in c=
ommon use. Otherwise the New Revelation would be clothed in darkness rather=
 than light, and no new understanding of the Word could be given. But altho=
ugh the terms in the Writings mean in general the same as they do in common=
 usage, yet they mean a great deal more, so much more that they lead and in=
troduce into the expanse of angelic thought; and hence the teaching is fulf=
illed, that man is led to new truth, and to new understanding of truth, by =
means of that which he already knows and understands. This, in general, is =
the reason why the terms of Christian theology, philosophy, and science are=
 used in the Writings throughout. We are also given a considerable degree o=
f liberty in the choice of terms.  </p><p></p><div align=3D"Right">99</div>=

</p><p>XVI</p><p>Our Father in the Heavens.</p><p>In A. C. 8328 are these w=
ords: "Frequent mention is made by the Lord of 'the Father in the heavens.'=
 In such cases, the Divine in heaven is meant, thus the good from which hea=
ven is. The Divine, regarded in Itself, is above the heavens; but the Divin=
e in the heavens is the Good which is in the Truth proceeding from the Divi=
ne." Then several passages in the Gospels are quoted in which the above exp=
ression occurs, including the opening sentence of the Lord's Prayer, "Our F=
ather who art in the heavens." It is then repeated that "the Divine in the =
heavens is the Good which is in the Divine Truth proceeding from the Lord,"=
 and it is added that "the Divine above the heavens is the Divine Good Itse=
lf." The Divine Good appearing in the heavens takes the form of Divine Trut=
h, and sometimes even of a Person, a Man, that the angels may be confirmed =
in the idea that God is a Man. (See H. H. 52, 55, 79, 121.)</p><p>It will t=
hus appear that our Father in the heavens is the visible Divine, that is, t=
he Divine Human, our Lord Jesus Christ. It is of great moment to remember t=
hat, when we repeat the Lord's Prayer in worship, We are not addressing the=
 invisible God, the Father of the old theology, but the very Lord God Himse=
lf, who came into the world and glorified the Human which He then assumed, =
in which He is ever present and visible to angels and men, their only objec=
t of worship.</p><p>Those who come to the New Church, having been in the wo=
rship of the Old, may still have in their minds some remains of the old ide=
a of an invisible Father; and even some of those who have grown up in the N=
ew Church may not fully realize that our Father in the heavens is the Lord =
Jesus Christ Himself. "He that hath seen me hath seen the Father." (John 14=
:2.)</p><p>The more our ideas are clarified on this subject, the nearer wil=
l be the Divine presence.  </p><p></p><div align=3D"Right">100</div><hr><p>

</p><p>The Term "Spiritual" in the Writings.</p><p>In the letter of the Wor=
d, spirit is placed in contrast with flesh. In a broad sense, by "spirit" i=
s there meant the spiritual world, and by "flesh" the natural world. More s=
pecifically, by "flesh" is meant the human race in the natural world, and b=
y "spirit" the human race in the spiritual world. In a universal sense, the=
 spiritual world includes heaven, hell, and the intermediate world of spiri=
ts. But strictly speaking the spiritual world is heaven, for nothing else i=
s truly spiritual. Those in hell are not spiritual. They are wholly natural=
. It is the natural in a confirmed state. What makes the natural are the lo=
ves of self and the world. These confirmed are hell. Regeneration consists =
in the subduing of these two loves of the natural man. It is the spiritual =
man subduing the natural. The spiritual is spiritual truth, and this is wha=
t "spirit," "breath," "wind," signify in the letter of the Word. This can b=
e predicated only of heaven, and of the state that is preparing for heaven.=
 Here, then, is the reason why the term "spiritual" carries the idea of hea=
ven, and of the Lord in heaven, or of the two universal loves which reign t=
here,--love to the Lord and love to the neighbor. When the Lord as the All =
in all is meant, the term "celestial" is used, in order to express what is =
more interiorly spiritual, or the idea of the Lord alone. But without the i=
dea of the Lord, even the spiritual is not spiritual. And so let us remembe=
r that when the term "spiritual" is used in the Writings, it has in it the =
idea of heaven and the Lord.</p><p>The Mystery of Regeneration.</p><p>A mys=
tery is predicated of something that is known to exist, but what it really =
is is not known. As applied to regeneration, it signifies that, while it is=
 known that man must be regenerated in order to be saved, the nature of the=
 Divine operation within him during regeneration is not known. This is even=
 true with one who is well instructed in the true doctrine of regeneration.=

 He does not know what the Lord is doing interiorly within him during the p=
rocess, even though he may know that he is in the endeavor to keep the Comm=
andments. This truth is expressed in the words of the Lord: "The wind blowe=
th where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell=
 whence it cometh, and whither it goeth; so is every one that is born of th=
e Spirit." (John 3:8. See explained in A. C. 10240; A. E. 419, 1153.) It is=
 expressed also by the oft-repeated phrase in the Writings, with various ap=
plication,--"Man knows that it is, but he does not know what it is." There =
is no better definition of a mystery. We are told in general what the condi=
tions of regeneration are. The individual man is instructed in the part he =
is to perform in the ultimates of his thought and life. When he obeys the t=
ruth which he knows and understands, then the Lord is able to do His Divine=
 work within him, which is unobserved by him, concealed from his view, a my=
stery to him. Back of it all is the mystery of the universal redemption acc=
omplished by the Lord when He was in the world, whereby He took unto Himsel=
f the power to regenerate and save. For now all things are possible to the =
Lord with man, according to His own Divine order, established by Him in His=
 coming.</p><p>There is now no evil without a remedy. All that is needed is=
 patience, faith, and obedience.</p><p>Purification.</p><p>The need of spir=
itual purification is taught in many passages of Scripture, such as the fol=
lowing, "Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean; wash me, and I shall b=
e whiter than snow." (Psalm 51:7.) "Wash you, make you clean; put away the =
evil of your doings from before mine eyes; cease to do evil, learn to do we=
ll." (Isaiah 1:16.) "Cleanse first the inside of the cup and the platter, t=
hat the outside also may be made clean." (Matthew 23:26.) Washing with wate=
r is representative of the cleansing of the spirit, or of the interiors of =
the natural mind,--the inside of the cup,--from its impurities.  </p><p></p=

 These impurities are real things, and are from hell,--things which man has=
 received and made his own. If they are not removed, he cannot be saved. Fo=
r hell is impurity itself, and the origin of all the impurities of nature a=
nd in the human body, of all the diseases to which the mind and body are su=
bject. Chief among the impurities of hell are all adulterous loves and thei=
r products, and it is common to speak of these things as unclean. This is i=
nstinctive, and arises from a perception, even though obscure, of the corre=
spondence of natural things with spiritual. All violation of spiritual and =
natural law gives rise to disorder, and thus to unclean conditions in both =
worlds. We are told in many passages of the Writings of the visible outward=
 appearance of the impure and filthy things in the minds of evil spirits, i=
n which they love to dwell as swine in the mire. To be rescued from all thi=
s is a great deliverance.</p><p>Purification is regeneration itself, but it=
 is not effected at once; it is gradual, continuing through life, attended =
with much trial and temptation. But to those who persevere, who are "faithf=
ul unto death" (Revelation 2:10), the goal is sure and the reward is great,=
--a "crown of life." </p><p>Purification by Truths.</p><p>The importance of=
 spiritual purification, and that it can be effected only by truths, is tau=
ght as follows:</p><p>"The reason that purification is effected by the trut=
hs of faith is because these truths teach what good is, and what evil is, a=
nd thus what ought to be done, and what ought not to be done; and when man =
knows those truths, and wills to act according to them, he is then led by t=
he Lord, and is purified by His Divine means." (A. C. 7044.)</p><p>"It is b=
y virtue of truth that man knows what is pure and impure, and what is holy =
and profane. Before he knows truth, there are no media into and through whi=
ch the celestial love, which continually flows in from the Lord, can operat=
e, and which cannot be received except in truths; wherefore, it is by means=
 of the knowledges of truth that man is reformed and regenerated." (A. C. 2=
046.)  </p><p></p><div align=3D"Right">103</div><hr><p>

. 121. Compare A. C. 2049.)</p><p>Purification by truths is represented in =
the Word by circumcision, by all the washings of the Jewish Church, and by =
baptism in the Christian Church.</p><p>The Use of Eating and Drinking Toget=
her.</p><p>The statement is made (A. C. 8352) that what we eat and drink "n=
ourishes the body better when man at his meals is in the delight of discour=
se with others concerning such things as he loves, than when he sits at tab=
le without company." The reason then given is, that when he eats alone ther=
e is a constriction of the vessels of the body which receive the food, but =
when he is with others the vessels are open and more receptive. This physio=
logical fact is introduced into the above passage to illustrate the subject=
 of the deficiency of truths in states of spiritual temptation; and the ind=
ication afforded is that, in eating alone, cares, natural temptations, easi=
ly take possession of the mind, drawing down the thoughts to the things of =
self and the world. But when in company with others, the mind is turned to =
things of a common interest and affection, and the thought is drawn away fr=
om habitual cares, from thinking about one's self and the furtherance of wo=
rldly ends.  </p><p></p><div align=3D"Right">104</div><hr><p>

 (A. C. 7996.)</p><p>"Feasts were formerly made for various reasons, and in=

 of charity; in like manner in the primitive Christian Church, in which the=
y encouraged one another to continue in the worship of the Lord from a sinc=

t truths which the regenerating man learns, and they serve to introduce to =
all the truths he is afterwards to learn. The teaching is (A. C. 8773) that=
 good must be formed by truths; that the first formation is by primary trut=
hs; that primary truths are also general truths; and that all particular tr=
uths are contained in these primary truths. Examples of such truths are the=
n given;-namely, that there is one God; that the Lord was born a man, in or=
der that He might save the human race; that there is a life after death, a =
heaven and a hell; that all come into heaven who have lived well, and into =
hell who have lived ill; that to love God and the neighbor are the fundamen=
tal precepts of the Word and of all religion; and that these two loves cann=
ot be given except by faith in the Lord. It is then added that these and si=
milar primary or general truths are the first truths insinuated by the Lord=
 into the good which is in the man who is to be regenerated; and that these=
 primary truths cannot be received except by those who are already in some =
degree of good,--the good that is called "simple good" in the Writings, a g=
ood not yet formed by truths. Finally, that when these primary truths are c=
onjoined with good, then particular truths are afterward added continually,=
 and man as to his internal becomes a heavenly form, and in his spirit is c=
onsociated with the angels and conjoined with God. (See also A. C. 1482, 20=

</p><p>More Concerning Primary Truths.</p><p>The importance of primary trut=
hs, and their place in the establishment of the church, and in the regenera=
tion of man, is shown by the distinguished position which they occupy among=
 the representatives of the Word; such as the seventy elders of Israel; the=
 twelve sons of Jacob, and the twelve tribes; the twelve apostles of the Lo=
rd; the twelve foundations of the wall of the New Jerusalem; the twelve gat=
es and the twelve pearls; and by princes whenever mentioned in Scripture. T=
hese, and many other representatives which appear in the letter of the Word=
, are significative of those primary truths which introduce to the interior=
 things of the Word and lead to heaven and to the Lord. They are also calle=
d the doctrine of genuine truth, which is spiritual truth appearing in the =
letter of Scripture.* It is essential that good should be formed by truths,=
 that there may be the conjunction of good and truth, which is the goal of =
regeneration, and is the angelic state. When primary truths are conjoined w=
ith good, then particulars are insinuated, and man becomes more and more a =
heavenly form, and is more and more conjoined with God. It is made plain, t=
herefore, that the beginnings of the church, and of regeneration, should be=
 right beginnings; that the truths which make those beginnings,--primary or=
 first truths,--should be pure, sound, and genuine, with no dress in them f=
rom the loves of self and the world, no falsities to obscure the understand=
ing. The responsibility for this rests largely with the priests and leaders=
 of the church; but first in time with parents and teachers of children.</p=

</p><p>At First Confined to a Few.</p><p>The New Church will at first be co=
nfined to a few, and its numbers will gradually increase from a few to many=
. The reasons for this slow increase of the church are given as follows: "T=
he falsities of the former church must first be removed, ... and the new he=
aven must first be formed." (A. R. 547.) The church "will tarry among those=
 who are not in truths because not in good; for at the end of the church th=
ere are but few who are in truths from good,... by reason that the former c=
hurch is become a desert.... When the church is such, evils and falsities r=
eign, which hinder the reception of its doctrine;... and when doctrine is n=
ot received, there is no church, for the church is a church from doctrine."=
 (A. E. 730, 731.) Several reasons are then added why the New Church will h=
ave its beginning with a few (A. E. 732): First, its doctrine ... can be ac=
knowledged, and thus received, only by those who are interiorly affected by=
 truths ... and have not destroyed their intellectual faculty by the loves =
of self and of the world; second, the doctrine of that Church can be acknow=
ledged, and thus received, only by those who have not confirmed themselves =
by doctrine, and at the same time by life, in faith alone;... third, that t=
he New Church on earth grows according to its increase in the world of spir=
its.... These were also the reasons why the Christian Church, after the Lor=
d had left the world, increased so slowly in Europe, and did not attain to =
its fulness until an age had elapsed." (A. E. 732.) Finally, the Church wil=
l be "as yet among a few, because it is among those who are not in a life o=
f charity; but in the meantime provision will be made for the Church among =
many." (A. E. 760, 761.) For these reasons, especially because of a deficie=
ncy of charity, the New Church will at first be natural or external. (A. E.=
 403(15).) That is, the church must, as it were, begin at the bottom, and g=
radually ascend to a state of spiritual intelligence and wisdom.  </p><p></=

</p><p>Danger from a Rapid Increase in Numbers.</p><p>As was shown above, a=
 rapid increase of the New Church is not to be expected. The Doctrines are =
so reasonable that the first feeling of a new convert is that they have onl=
y to be presented to be received. It needs but a little experience to show =
the fallacy of this expectation. The New Church had its beginning over one =
hundred years ago, and yet its numbers are few. Many generations will elaps=
e before she reaches her appointed station. Experience and revealed doctrin=
e point in the same direction. It cannot be otherwise. The reasons are on a=
ccount of conditions, mainly in the spiritual world. "These things are inde=
ed made manifest, but they will not be received until those who are meant b=
y the dragon, the beast, and the false prophet, are cast out of the world o=
f spirits, because there would be danger if they were to be received before=
." (A. R. 473.) By a rapid increase, the Church would be submerged in a flo=
od of falsities and evils. This happened to the first Christian Church, thr=
ough the conversion of the Emperor Constantine, from which that Church neve=
r recovered. It is not to be so with the New Church, which is to endure for=
ever. A rapid increase of the Church, or the rapid spiritual growth of a ma=
n, would not be according to that Divine order which works gradually and no=
t precipitately in its effects, which are to be permanent and enduring. In =
the regenerate man, as in the church, an internal must first be formed, and=
 then an external by means of the internal. (T. C. R. 591.) In the church, =
as in the regenerate man, there is a period of childhood, in which a beginn=
ing is made; but it is long before a full fruition is reached,--a lifetime =
with man, and longer with the church. Otherwise, an external would be forme=
d before the internal, which would be attended with disastrous results. For=
 the internal would then remain evil; and we are told that an external with=
out an internal is a condition like that of hell. Hence the gradual formati=
on of a spiritual internal, before the external is formed, is absolutely es=
sential to the permanent establishment of the church.  </p><p></p><div alig=

 The internal is indeed formed on the basis of reformation in the external,=
 but there is not as yet any regeneration there. This must come from within=
.</p><p>Regeneration is Preparation for a Use in Heaven.</p><p>The old idea=
 of preparation for heaven is preparation for eternal worship. This is true=
, if rightly understood and applied; that is, if internal worship is meant,=
 which is a perpetual life of use. The real truth is, that preparation for =
heaven is a preparation for use in heaven, for a function in some heavenly =
society. Regeneration is nothing else. Regeneration, continuing to the end =
of life in the world, is for no other purpose than that a man may be prepar=
ed to enter into the life of heaven, and perform his part in that life, tha=
t is, perform a use that is to be his use and function to eternity, and by =
which he is to have and receive eternal happiness. It parallels or correspo=
nds with the preparation of the child and youth for use in adult life,-some=
 use for which he is to be fitted; and he is fitted for it, not only by stu=
dies,--the acquisition of knowledge and understanding, but also by the layi=
ng aside of bad habits that would interfere with his future usefulness, thr=
ough obedience to parents and teachers. The correspondence is complete.</p>=
<p>In adult life, the Lord is the Parent and Teacher. We go to school to Hi=
m, and He teaches us from His Word, and by the leadings of His Providence H=
e is preparing us for some eternal use, when we, as His disciples,--His pup=
ils,--acquire a knowledge of the truths of His Word, obey His commandments,=
 shun evils as sins,-all the bad habits of thought and life. We are thus ma=
de ready to enter into some function in an angelic society; for every angel=
 has a use to perform, and life in the world is preparation for it. Salvati=
on is nothing else than being saved from the things that would destroy a po=
ssible use in heaven, and with it all eternal felicity.  </p><p></p><div al=

</p><p>Habit.</p><p>It is our habits, good or evil, that go with us into th=
e other life. The things that are in the memory alone, and have not passed =
into will and act, do not remain after death. Our habits of life alone stay=
 with us, and continue with us, unless a beginning of removal has been made=
 during the life of the body. A habit is literally what one has, what one h=
as and holds as his, or what he has made a part of himself by frequent repe=
tition. It is what a man has learned from teaching or reading, and has made=
 his own in thought, will, and act. "Unlike the brutes, man is not born int=
o any exercise of life, but has to learn all things; and what he learns bec=
omes by exercise a habit.... He cannot even speak or walk unless he is taug=
ht." (A. C. 1050.) He must be taught, and then act as of himself, until it =
becomes by practice a habit of life. "Every one acquires to himself a chara=
cter by frequent use or habit, and this from the things he is taught." (A. =
C. 3843.) And so, when a man enters the other world, the habit is the man; =
and he cannot get away from his habits,--from his evil habits, unless he ha=
s ceased to love them, has willed to resist them, while still in this world=
.</p><p>Another thing about habits, important to be known and remembered, e=
specially by parents, is that "every evil which parents have acquired by ac=
tual life, or by frequent use or habit,... is derived into their children, =
and becomes hereditary with them." (A. C. 4317, 8550.) Sometimes we realize=
 this, but too late for a remedy, and the responsibility is left to our chi=
ldren to fight against the tendency to the evil habits which their parents =
have acquired and transmitted to them. We can at least hope and pray that t=
hey mill not do as we have done, but will stem the tide of hereditary evil =
and transmit a milder inheritance to their children.</p><p>Nemesis.</p><p>I=
t appears that the term "Nemesis" occurs but once in the Writings. In Conju=
gial Love 504, speaking of certain violations of marriage, it is said "that=
 the Divine Nemesis pursues them."  </p><p></p><div align=3D"Right">111</di=

 The word is used in a sense similar to its use in Greek mythology. The Gre=
eks knew, as all men knew from ancient revelation, and by influx from heave=
n, that unjust and wicked deeds should be punished; or that "the evils whic=
h men do to others flow back or return upon themselves" (A. C. 8226); that =
"whatsoever anyone wills for another returns upon himself" (A. C. 391); tha=
t, especially "in the other life, evil returns upon him who does it, and be=
comes the evil of punishment" (A. C. 592); and in general that "good has in=
 itself its own reward, and evil its own punishment." (A. C. 9033, 9049, an=
d elsewhere.) This law, so frequently referred to in the Writings, being kn=
own to the ancients, was given a name, as of a person, according to the hab=
it of those times. The Greeks called it "Nemesis," who was regarded as the =
goddess of retributive justice, who, with righteous wrath, punished those w=
ho brought evil upon others, bringing upon them the evils which they visite=
d upon their fellow men.</p><p>The wiser Greeks knew that no persons, gods =
or goddesses, were meant by the many names in their mythology, but that qua=
lities or laws in their operation were personified, that is, represented, b=
y them. (See T. C. R. 9.) They knew that Nemesis was not a woman or a godde=
ss, but that the quality of Divine vengeance was meant, or the return of th=
e evil upon the doer. Every evil done is an assault upon the laws of Divine=
 order. Those laws resist, and in the reaction or rebound the doer is himse=
lf punished. This is inevitable. There is no escape from it. As in the case=
 of adulterers, "the Divine Nemesis pursues them." Or, as expressed in the =
Old Testament, "Then shall ye do unto him as he had thought to have done un=
to his brother.... Life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for ha=
nd, foot for foot, burning for burning, wound for wound, stripe for stripe.=
" (Deuteronomy 19:19-21. Exodus 21:23-25. But compare Matthew 5:38, etc.)  =

</p><p>XVIII</p><p>Total Abstinence.</p><p>There is no error or fallacy tha=
t is not a truth when rightly understood and applied. Nowhere in Revelation=
 is there found any teaching or command to abstain from alcoholic drink, ex=
cept its abuse. The whole second table of the Decalogue is a command to tot=
al abstinence. Thou shalt not commit murder, adultery, theft, or bear false=
 witness; neither shalt thou covet or lust after these things--a total abst=
inence in speech and act, in thought and will, from the evils forbidden. Th=
is total abstinence is fundamental to regeneration and spiritual life. Any =
total abstinence in things non-essential is a human invention, a human subs=
titute for what is Divine. The Heavenly Doctrine speaks of a genuine total =
abstinence as follows:</p><p>"No man can receive the good of heaven until h=
e abstains from evils." (A. C. 9346.)</p><p>Those who are in evil of life a=
re bent to good by the Lord when they "abstain from evil and intend good, a=
nd do it according to their understanding. (A. C. 2364.)</p><p>"Those who a=
bstain from evils are they who receive the Divine." (A. C. 8307.)</p><p>"Th=
e life of heaven cannot be implanted in anyone, unless he abstains from evi=
l.... The Lord then, out of pure mercy, leads him by His Divine means from =
infancy to the end of life in the world, and afterwards to eternity." (H. H=
. 522.)</p><p>"Everyone is regenerated by abstaining from the evils of sin.=
" (T. C. R. 510. See also 530, 532.)</p><p>A New Churchman does not need to=
 be told that by "evils" in the above passages are meant the evils forbidde=
n in the Decalogue as sins against God, and in a broad sense all violations=
 of the spiritual truths of the Word. All abuse, all excess, is sin; but a =
moderate and temperate use of the gifts of God is not a sin.  </p><p></p><d=

</p><p>Reasoning With Children.</p><p>There is a thought with some that chi=
ldren have reason that can be appealed to. But reason, or the rational facu=
lty, is opened only by degrees. It begins to be opened about the age of pub=
erty. All before this is but a preparation to begin, and the essential in t=
his preparation is obedience. Little children are indeed to be taught, but =
the first teaching is in the form of command, even as the Commandments of t=
he Decalogue are the first of the Word. This first of the Word is called th=
e Law, and law is not anything unless it be enforced when necessary, even b=
y resort to punishment, as Jehovah did with the Sons of Israel when they di=
d not obey. Punishment itself is teaching, and prepares the way for rationa=
l instruction later. The Hebrew word yasar, to instruct, means literally to=
 chastise. See how it was that Gideon "taught the men of Succoth." (Judges =
8:16.)</p><p>But let us not be extreme. When obedience, authority, law, are=
 once established, then children can be led; then teaching can be affirmati=
ve, and not negative. But the negative is first in time. "Thou shalt not" i=
s the beginning of all law, of all instruction.</p><p>We read of what man w=
ould become, if not restrained from childhood up. (A. C. 987.) And of the n=
eed of the corporal punishment of children. (A. C. 8223, 4730. T. C. R. 407=
, 459. Charity 163.) And that the rational begins to be opened when the fee=

 Before this, he did not think from himself, but from others outside of him=
self, that is, from his parents and teachers. It is from these causes that =
there is not a full play of the faculty of reason until adult age is reache=
d, and that regeneration is not possible before.</p><p>The teaching on this=
 subject is as follows:</p><p>"Regeneration is during adult age, for man be=
fore this does not think of the truths of faith from himself." (A. C. 5893.=
)</p><p>"No man can be regenerated except in adult age, because he then fir=
st has possession of reason and judgment, and thus can receive good and tru=
th from the Lord." (A. C. 2636.)</p><p>"Man is not regenerated until he arr=
ives at adult age, when he has understanding; before this the good of love =
and the truth of faith fall like seed into ground altogether barren." (A. C=
. 6125.)</p><p>As with regeneration, so it is with spiritual temptation; it=
 cannot take place until adult age with any man. It was otherwise with the =
Lord.</p><p>"Man does not come into temptations before he has arrived at ad=
ult age,...but the Lord in the age of childhood." (A. C. 1661, 4248.)</p><p=
>"No one is admitted into any spiritual temptation until he is in adult age=
; ... if before, he succumbs in the temptation." (A. C. 5044. See also H. D=
. 191.)</p><p>In the natural world, a man does not go to war until he is of=
 age. Not until he is able to enter into natural war is he ready for spirit=
ual war. The correspondence is complete. Correspondence in man,--the corres=
pondence of the natural with the spiritual,--is when a man is able to act a=
nd does act as of himself from the Lord, and not from his parents, as befor=
e.  </p><p></p><div align=3D"Right">115</div><hr><p>

</p><p>"As the Tree Falls."</p><p>It is a common saying, "As the tree falls=
, so shall it lie." The original statement is found in Ecclesiastes 11:3: "=
In the place where the tree falleth, there it shall be." Solomon derived hi=
s wisdom from the ancients (A. C. 5223), by whom truths were expressed in c=
orrespondences. By a "tree" they meant a man, and by a tree remaining where=
 it fell they understood that a man's life cannot be changed after death. T=
he general meaning of the saying has been handed down to the present time. =
But particulars are wanting, which are given in the Writings in the followi=
ng and similar passages:</p><p>"It is according to order that everyone carr=
ies along with him his life which he had lived in the world, and that his s=
tate in the other life is according to it. The Lord's mercy flows in with a=
ll,...but it is rejected by the evil; and since they have imbued evil in th=
e world, they retain it in the other life; nor is amendment possible there,=
 for the tree lies where it has fallen." (A. C. 7186.)</p><p>"Everyone's li=
fe remains with him after death; such as a man is when he dies, such he con=
tinues to be, according to the common saying, 'Where the tree falls there i=
t lies.'" (A. C. 8991.)</p><p>"He who is in evil in the world is in evil af=
ter his departure out of the world; wherefore, if evil is not removed in th=
e world, it cannot be removed afterward. Where the tree falls, there it lie=
s." (D. P. 277.)</p><p>A fuller explanation than elsewhere is given in the =
Spiritual Diary Minor, 4645, 4646, where it is shown that the common saying=
 does not mean that he who is in good cannot be perfected in the other life=
, for he grows continually, but upon the basis of the life that had been ac=
quired in the world. It is only with the evil that there is no progression =
after death. Thus the same law, but with a difference in result, applies to=
 both the evil and the good.  </p><p></p><div align=3D"Right">116</div><hr>=

</p><p>The First State After Death.</p><p>In many passages of the Writings =
we are told of the first state after death, as being a continuation of life=
 in the world, and that there is no essential change in the transfer from t=
he one world to the other. Man awakes on the third day from the sleep of de=
ath, and finds himself to be the same man as before, with the same thoughts=
 and feelings, and to all appearance in the same body that he had in the na=
tural world, with all its senses complete. The appearance is so real that h=
e at first thinks that he has merely awakened again in the natural world, u=
ntil he is instructed by the angels as to the real truth,--information whic=
h he receives with great surprise. He is told that this is so provided by t=
he Lord that he may realize in his actual experience that death is but the =
continuation of life.</p><p>There is one passage, however, in which some pa=
rticulars are given that are barely touched upon elsewhere, as follows: "Wh=
en any man after death comes into the spiritual world, which for the most p=
art takes place the third day after he has expired, he appears to himself i=
n a life similar to that in which he had been in the world, and in a simila=
r house, chamber, and bedchamber, in a similar coat and clothing, and in a =
similar companionship in the house. If he was a king or a prince, he appear=
s in a similar palace; if a peasant, in a similar cottage; rustic things su=
rround the latter, splendid things the former." Then the reason for this is=
 given as was stated above,--so "that the last of natural life may become t=
he first of spiritual life, and that from this first state a man may progre=
ss to his goal, which will be either in heaven or in hell." (5 M. II:4.)</p=
><p>It is thus of the Divine mercy that the transfer to the other world at =
death should not appear as a sudden and startling change, but easy and natu=
ral.</p><p>Games of Chance.</p><p>The teaching concerning chance, fortune, =
or so-called luck, is as follows:  </p><p></p><div align=3D"Right">117</div=

 a spiritual sphere, and is the ultimate of Providence." (A. C. 5179.)</p><=

the Lord, ... and there is no such thing as chance." (A. C. 6493.)</p><p>"O=

that what is fortunate was represented to them by a bright cloud, and what =
is unfortunate by a dusky cloud; and when a dusky cloud appeared to attend =
me it was impossible for me to win; and also from that sign they foretold m=

</p><p>XIX</p><p>Memory of Things Never Seen or Heard.</p><p>It is not unco=
mmon that a man will suddenly remember things which, as soon as he reflects=
, he knows never happened in his past experience. As with many problems of =
human life, otherwise unexplained, light is given upon this in the Writings=
. Not much is said. We are merely told that it is from the memory of spirit=
s who are present, and there is added a reference to the conclusions of the=
 ancients concerning it.</p><p>"There was with some of the ancients the opi=
nion that, after some thousands of years, they would return into their form=
er life, and into all its acts, and also that they had so returned; they co=
ncluded this, because sometimes there had occurred to them as it were a rec=
ollection of things which yet they had never seen or heard; which came to p=
ass because spirits flowed from their own memory into the ideas of their th=
ought." (H. H. 256.)</p><p>What is said in the above passage about the opin=
ion of the ancients has reference to the views of some of the Greek philoso=
phers concerning metempsychosis, or the transmigration of souls, as held by=
 Pythagoras, Socrates, Plato, and others. A belief in transmigration has ex=
isted in various parts of the world in ancient and in modern times; and the=
 experience referred to in the above number was to the Greek philosophers a=
 proof of the immortality of the soul. It was evidence to them that the sou=
l existed, not only after death, but that man lived as a sentient being bef=
ore his birth into the world; holding, also, that the soul could return to =
this life, and occupy the bodies of other men. What was needed was a revela=
tion from heaven, direct and immediate, which they had not, giving them a t=
rue knowledge of the life after death, and of the actual presence of the in=
habitants of the spiritual world with men. With this true knowledge, it wou=
ld have been made plain to them that man does not live in a previous state =
of existence, and that he will never return, or wish to return, to his form=
er life in the world.  </p><p></p><div align=3D"Right">119</div><hr><p>

</p><p>It should be added that the ancient philosophers referred to are spo=
ken of in the Writings as being wiser than the moderns, even though they we=
re without direct revelation, and that they are now angels of heaven. (T. C=
. R. 692.)</p><p>The Fear of Death.</p><p>Why do men fear death? That such =
fear exists, is a matter of universal knowledge. But there are exceptions. =
The inhabitants of Jupiter "do not fear death, except on account of leaving=
 the consort, their children, or parents; for they know that they will live=
 after death." (E. U. 84; A. C. 8850.) "Nor are they made sad at the though=
t of death." (S. D. 545a.) We may assume that the men of the Most Ancient C=
hurch did not have this fear. So it is possible to be without the fear of d=
eath. What is it that removes it? The men of Jupiter have not that fear, be=
cause "they know that they will live after death." Men fear death, therefor=
e, because they do not know that they will live after their decease; or if =
they know, they do not believe. Thy say that "no one has been there and com=
e back to tell us." But the Lord Himself has told us in the Gospel. The Jew=
s did not even know, but Christians know, because of what the Lord has said=
; yet they do not believe, except comparatively few.</p><p>A New Churchman =
knows and believes, because the Heavenly Doctrine testifies in letters of l=
ight concerning the life after death. But are there states when even one in=
 the New Church does not see clearly? He sees in states of illustration, wh=
en the thought is elevated into the light of heaven by means of the spiritu=
al affection of truth. In this state the fear of death is removed. He does =
not see clearly when the cares of the world oppress. A prayer for faith wou=
ld be in order,--a prayer that we may see and believe what we know.  </p><p=

 The Lord said, "All things are possible to him that believeth." The father=
 of the child answered, "Lord, I believe; help Thou mine unbelief." (Mark 9=
:23, 24.) Prayer, and a constant reading of the Writings, is the road to th=
at faith which is spiritual sight.</p><p>The dispersal of the black cloud w=
hich overshadows the life after death, covering it with dread and horror, i=
s a delightful experience which one has in coming out of the darkness of th=
e Old into the light of the New.</p><p>The End in Prayer.</p><p>There are d=
egrees of ends. In prayer there is the supreme end, the spiritual end, and =
the natural end. The supreme end in prayer is a looking with acknowledgment=
 and worship to the Divine Man, Jesus Christ, our only God and Lord. The sp=
iritual end in prayer is when we beseech the Lord for help to resist evil, =
accompanied with a desire and asking for spiritual light, for understanding=
 of truth, that we may see the way that leads to heaven and the Lord, and r=
eceive power to walk therein. The natural end in prayer is for protection a=
gainst calamity, misfortune, loss of health and possessions, for worldly su=
ccess, for removal of fear of natural dangers, accompanied by prayer for tr=
ust in Providence. And so prayer for natural blessings must be subordinated=
 to spiritual ends. This must always be in view; otherwise, prayers for nat=
ural ends are without life and soul.</p><p>Prayers with a spiritual end, fr=
om a profound acknowledgment of the Lord, and the confession of self as ign=
orant and unworthy, are answered. (See T. C. R. 570, 621.) Such prayers are=
 heard, and angels sent by the Lord are present, through whom there is enli=
ghtenment and strength, and inspiration to do. It is like the appearance of=
 "a friend in need," which seldom, if ever, fails. Spiritually, the angels =
are the friends who come, even as a mother to her child who is hurt and cri=
es for help.  </p><p></p><div align=3D"Right">121</div><hr><p>

&nbsp;</p><p>Children should be taught to pray for natural blessings, and f=
or natural and moral improvement, the spiritual end being in the mind of th=

t in order of time, and introduces to internal worship, which is first with=
 the regenerating adult. Children, being in the sensual, cannot as yet comp=
rehend spiritual ends, except in a most general manner. It is the sensual o=
bjective that appeals in the early stages of life, and prepares for what is=
 to follow.</p><p>Confession of Sin.</p><p>That a man should confess his si=
ns before the Lord is not only taught, but to a mind spiritually enlightene=
d it is a self-evident truth. But should one make confession of sin to the =
neighbor? It has been said that there is no need to confess to any other th=
an the Lord. But this is a proposition that cannot be considered as self-ev=
ident, or if it be applied without admitting exceptional conditions. The te=
aching that confession should be made to the Lord admits of no doubt, and i=
s expressed in actual statement in many passages of the Writings, such as t=
his: "Confession ought to be made before the Lord God the Savior, and then =
supplication for help and power to resist evils." (T. C. R. 538.) Then foll=
ow reasons why this should be done. But it cannot be said that confession t=
o the neighbor is made obligatory in the Writings. It is left to the judgme=
nt of the individual, to be exercised in freedom and in the light of reason=
. There are undoubtedly conditions that would seem to call for such action.=
 Sometimes the burden of sin is such that need of counsel is felt, and of t=
he judgment and enlightened experience of another in whom there is confiden=
ce. Then there is the case where one has done injury to the neighbor in wor=
d or deed. If there is sincere repentance, and confession has been made to =
the Lord, would it not be useful at times to make acknowledgment and confes=
sion to the one who has been injured? There are undoubtedly occasions when =
confession would not be complete without such a course.  </p><p></p><div al=

 There is a statement bearing on this question which, while it looks to the=
 custom of confession in the Catholic Church, is capable of a more general =
application. "It is not hurtful for anyone whose conscience is burdened to =
enumerate his sins before a minister of the church, for the sake of absolut=
ion and alleviation, because he is thus introduced into the habit of examin=
ing himself and reflecting upon his daily evils. But this confession is nat=
ural, while that described above (confession to the Lord) is spiritual." (T=
. C. R. 539.)</p><p>Heaping Coals of Fire on His Head.</p><p>"If thine enem=
y hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give him drink; for in so doing thou shal=
t heap coals of fire on his head." (Romans 12:20; Proverbs 25:21, 22.) We h=
ave here a phrase much used in common discourse, although it is frequently =
spoken in a negative spirit, meaning that, by good deeds or kind words to a=
n enemy, he is disarmed, placed on the defensive or under obligation; estab=
lishing thus an ascendancy over him, not having in view his real good, but =
rather the furtherance of some selfish design on the part of the speaker, a=
ssuming an appearance of charity that is not really felt. That such is not =
the spirit of these words, is evident from their context in both places whe=
re they occur.</p><p>The passage is found in the Epistle of Paul to the Rom=
ans, quoted by him from the Book of Proverbs. We are told that Solomon deri=
ved his wisdom from the Ancient Church (A. C. 5223), and that he had a know=
ledge of the correspondences and representatives of that Church. (A. C. 175=
6.) The context of both passages, noted above, shows that the words are spo=
ken in an affirmative spirit, or in the charity and good will which prevail=
ed in the Ancient Church; that what is said and done should be from the hea=
rt, and not merely for the sake of the outward appearance of charity, the r=
eal charitable spirit being absent. Not only does the context show that cha=
rity is treated of, but we learn the same from the signification of "coals =
of fire."  </p><p></p><div align=3D"Right">123</div><hr><p>

 "A live coal" (Ezekiel 1:27) signifies the "celestial of love" (A. C. 1042=
, 6832), and "a coal from the altar" (Isaiah 6:6) the Divine Love. (A. E. 5=
80.) "Fire," in Scripture, and in the ancient representatives, always signi=
fies love and charity, or their opposites. Hence to "heap coals of fire on =
the head" of another is to speak and act from love, so as to inspire love i=
n return. A similar thing is signified by "pouring oil upon the head." (A. =
C. 3728, 10011.)</p><p>The Signification of "Enemies" in the Word.</p><p>Th=
e term "enemy," in the passage quoted above as originally used by Solomon, =
was derived from the Ancient Church, and indicates what the men of that Chu=
rch meant by an enemy. A personal enemy, or an enemy in the natural sense, =
was not meant, but an enemy in the spiritual sense,--one who is hostile to =
the Church, and to its teachings concerning the Lord and eternal life. The =
Jews received this form of statement from the ancients, but it was applied =
naturally by them. The gentiles,--all other nations besides their own,--wer=
e their enemies, and therefore to be hated. The Apostles at first shared th=
e same view; but since the Christian Church was to be established with the =
gentiles, it was necessary that the thought of them as enemies, to be treat=
ed in a hostile spirit, should be removed from the apostolic mind. Hence ca=
me the Divine command to them: "Love your enemies." (Matthew 5:44. Luke 6:2=
7, 35.) We learn from the Doctrine that these words, "in the proximate sens=
e, signify to love the gentiles and do good to them, which is to be done by=
 teaching them truth and leading by truth to good; for the Jewish people ca=
lled their own (people) brethren and friends, but the gentiles they called =
foes and enemies." (A. E. 695.) We read further that "enemies are loved, an=
d good is done to them, when they are instructed and by suitable means amen=
ded." (A. C. 9174. See also 9255, 9256.)  </p><p></p><div align=3D"Right">1=

ndamental differences of doctrine exist, differences in practice will arise=
, resulting in a curtailment of freedom, if there be present anything of a =
spirit of domination, and a consequent lack of charity. In the history of s=
tates and nations, we find a resort to revolution often justified and excus=
ed, because it looks to the preservation of freedom of thought and action, =
which must be preserved, even if war be the result. It is similar in the hi=
story of churches. It is an essential truth that the law of charity cannot =
be enforced, and that separation is better than any attempt to establish ch=
arity by compulsion; in which case something is established, but not charit=
y. Leaving these points out of present consideration, one thing is to be re=
membered, that variety in organization provides for freedom of choice, with=
out which there is no way open to the future establishment of fraternal rel=
ations. And the freedom of choice provides for rationality. Without these t=
wo, there is no spiritual understanding of the Word, no spiritual life to m=
an. (D. P. 71, etc.)</p><p>In the spiritual world, there are innumerable so=
cieties, and everyone is led to his own place in full freedom according to =
his reason. In a heavenly society, he is in his own use of charity, and liv=
es there forever in charity with his neighbor, and in full delight of life.=
 It is, in fact, pointed out to us that in the New Church, as in the world,=
 there will be many societies, because of a great variety in reception. (A.=
 R. 66.) If all have charity, the New Church will be one in the harmony of =
many, and the freedom of the individual to choose his proper place and alig=
nment will be fully recognized and acted upon. (See A. C. 1285, 1799, 1834,=
 3241, 6628.)  </p><p></p><div align=3D"Right">125</div><hr><p>

 In itself, there is no reason why there should not be the union of various=
 bodies in most general uses, leaving the parts free to live their own life=
, unhampered by pressure from without, or anything that is alien to the spi=
rit of charity.</p><p>XX</p><p>Snow in Heaven.</p><p>Does snow appear in he=
aven? In the absence of direct statement, we may conclude that snow is seen=
 there, since it is used in a good sense in the letter of the Word. That wh=
ich corresponds to some spiritual truth is itself a good, and would appear =
in outward representative form in the spiritual world. Snow has a natural u=
se, and in this, its use, it corresponds to some spiritual truth or good. W=
e know from the Writings that snow has a good correspondence, based upon it=
s whiteness and beauty, and on account of its use in nature. There is also =
a more interior beauty, as seen under the microscope, consisting of clear a=
nd transparent crystals. Hence the conclusion is manifest that snow, and al=
l other things in the Word that have a good natural use, thus having a good=
 correspondence, would appear to the sight of angels and good spirits in th=
e ultimates of heaven.</p><p>Snow, as appearing in the natural heaven, seem=
s to explain why children are delighted with it; for that heaven is the hea=
ven of children. They are there as to their spirits; and to that heaven are=
 taken those who die in childhood. In that heaven, also, their first instru=
ction takes place, which is by means of representative appearances. (H. H. =
334-338.)</p><p>But snow is also used in the Word in an evil sense, signify=
ing truths in the memory without good, without love, cold and lifeless, soo=
n becoming like slush and mud in the streets, performing naught but an evil=
 use.  </p><p></p><div align=3D"Right">126</div><hr><p>

 And so we read of heaps of snow in the other world, covering the places of=
 worship where those are who believe in salvation by faith alone, that is, =
by truth alone, which truth with them has become the falsity of evil. (T.C.=
R. 185. See also A. C. 7626. H. H. 132, 482.) It follows that if snow appea=
rs where the evil are, it will also appear where the good are. (See Diary 5=
144.)</p><p>Snow Used in a Good Sense.</p><p>In the following passages of S=
cripture, snow is used in correspondence with some spiritual truth in heave=
n.</p><p>"Wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow." (Psalm 51:7.) "Snow is=
 here predicated of truth." (A. C. 7918.)</p><p>"As the rain cometh down an=
d the snow from heaven." (Isaiah 55:10.) "Snow here signifies natural truth=
, which becomes spiritual by love, as snow becomes rain-water by heat." (A.=
 E. 644.)</p><p>"'Waters of snow' (Job 24:19) signify genuine truths." (A. =
E. 481.)</p><p>It is shown (A. R. 47; A. E. 67, 372) that snow signifies tr=
uth in ultimates, such as is in the literal sense of the Word.</p><p>"He gi=
veth snow like wool." (Psalm 147: 6.) "Though your sins be as scarlet, they=
 shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be =
as wool." (Isaiah 1:18.) In these passages, "wool" signifies good in ultima=
tes, and "snow" truth in ultimates. (A. R. 47; A. E. 67.)</p><p>In the five=
 following passages, "snow is predicated of truth from its whiteness." (A. =
C. 8459.) "Her Nazarites were purer than snow. (Lamentations 4:7.) The garm=
ent of the Ancient of Days "was white as snow." (Daniel 7:9.) The garment o=
f the angel at the sepulchre "was white as snow." (Matthew 28:3.) The raime=

 Of the Son of Man in the midst of the golden candlesticks, it is said that=
 "His head and His hairs were white like wool, as white as snow." (Revelati=
on 1:14.) In these passages a comparison is made with snow; but all compari=
sons in the Word are correspondences. (A. R. 334, and elsewhere.)</p><p>Sin=
ce snow signifies truth in the memory, its beauty would represent first sta=
tes, when the mind is affected by the beauty of truth, and not as yet by it=
s use.</p><p>Origin of the Literal Sense from Appearances in the Spiritual =
World.</p><p>In further proof that snow and similar things are seen in the =
ultimates of heaven, we have the teaching that the literal sense of the Wor=
d is mostly from appearances in the spiritual world. (A. E. 503:2, and else=
where.) These appearances, as seen in the natural heaven, and also in the w=
orld of spirits, are representative of the thoughts and affections of the a=
ngels of the higher heavens. Those angels are, in fact, in the internal sen=
se of the Word, and when their thoughts are active in that sense, these tho=
ughts descend and take on representative forms below. (A. C. 5658, 6048, 94=
57.) The appearances so produced constitute materials out of which the exte=
rnal or literal sense of the Word was formed. By the opening of their spiri=
tual sight, Moses, the Prophets, and John saw those representative appearan=
ces, and were commanded to write what they saw; and under the Divine guidan=
ce they were led to write the Word in a series, as it exists with us in its=
 literal form. The thoughts and affections of evil spirits, for reasons of =
the Divine Providence, were also allowed expression, and permitted to appea=
r in the literal sense of the Word. These false and evil appearances were a=
lso seen by the prophets, and were written down by them, according to comma=
nd. </p><p>Now by reasoning backward, as it were, or from the letter to the=
 spiritual world, we are prepared to see that the things mentioned in the l=
iteral sense, having a good or evil correspondence, exist in outward form i=
n the spiritual world, in heaven, in hell, or in the world of spirits; for =
instance, that of which we have spoken, namely, snow.  </p><p></p><div alig=

</p><p>The Two Loves of the Natural Man.</p><p>The two loves of the natural=
 man are the loves of self and of the world. These loves are not in themsel=
ves evil, and hence are not to be, nor intended to be, destroyed in the pro=
cesses of regeneration, but brought into order. They are evil only when the=
y assume a place of rule instead of a place of service. The end to be accom=
plished by regeneration is to remove them from their place of dominion to t=
heir proper state of subordination. Even as we read: "The love of self and =
the love of the world are by creation heavenly; for they are the loves of t=
he natural man for the service of the spiritual loves, as foundations serve=
 for houses." (D. L. W. 396; A. E. 1144.) And so these loves are as necessa=
ry for the spiritual man as the foundation is for a house, or as the earth =
is for heaven. It is only when they endeavor to dominate that they are to b=
e resisted, fought against, and made to serve. For "as the world ought to s=
erve heaven, so the external man ought to serve the internal." (A. C. 9776.=
)</p><p>Let us note here that these two loves are first in time. They are t=
he dominant loves in childhood and early youth. By their activity the natur=
al mind is formed, preparatory to the formation of the spiritual mind in ad=
ult life, serving that end through life, and after death to eternity. For t=
he angels have a natural mind as men have, even the two loves of the natura=
l mind,--always serving, never ruling in heaven, as they do with men in the=
 world. In hell they are the only loves, and their confirmed activity there=
 causes that the evil can never rise out of hell into heaven.</p><p>By thes=
e two natural loves a man so provides for himself that he may have a sound =
mind in a sound body, and thus be rendered efficient for natural and spirit=
ual uses (A. C. 3951, 4459, 5949, 6936), not only for himself, but for thos=
e dependent on him, both for the present and for the future. (A. C. 6934; T=
. C. R. 406.)  </p><p></p><div align=3D"Right">129</div><hr><p>

</p><p>All natural loves are included in love of self and love of the world=
, and proceed from them; so that what is said of the two loves is true of a=
ll the loves derived from them in the natural man.</p><p>No Will and Unders=
tanding Before Birth.</p><p>It is not uncommon in the New Church to speak o=
f man as having will and understanding before birth; but this is said witho=
ut reflection, and without reference to the teaching. It is at least a misu=
se of terms, as if one should say that respiration exists before man is bor=
n. He indeed has lungs, but they do not yet function. Before birth he has t=
hat which is to become understanding, and that which is to become will, but=
 they do not exist as yet in actuality. The teaching is as follows:</p><p>"=
The rational is not born with man, but only the faculty of becoming rationa=
l." (A. C. 1893, 2557.) "Man is born into no science, still less into any i=
ntelligence and wisdom, but only into the faculty of receiving and imbibing=
 them." (A. C. 5081.) "Man is not born with science, ... but he is born fac=
ulty and inclination; faculty to know, and inclination to love." (C. L. 134=
, 202; T. C. R. 335, 480.) "A man has nothing of understanding at his birth=
, and also nothing of will.... For his understanding and his will are forme=
d by degrees from infancy." (A. C. 10298.) It is thus made plain that man h=
as neither understanding nor will before birth, but has faculty which becom=
es understanding, and inclination which becomes will; that is, after birth,=
 and not before, he is able to think, to reason, and to love.</p><p>It is w=
ell known that man has neither sensation or voluntary motion before birth. =
All motion is then from the cerebellum, thus involuntary. Conscious motion =
is from the cerebrum, but this organ is then passive. The cerebrum exists a=
s a structure, but does not exercise its function of thought and will; even=
 as the lungs exist, but without respiration.  </p><p></p><div align=3D"Rig=

 When the child is born, respiration begins, sensation and voluntary motion=
 follow, and finally understanding and will; but all these wait for the act=
 of respiration. </p><p>Sacrifices not Commanded.</p><p>In the Jewish Churc=
h, "the sacrifices and burnt offerings were not commanded but permitted." (=
A. C. 10079, also 2180.) Hence "they were not well-pleasing in the heavens.=
" (Ibid.) But the bread and wine used in the worship was "well-pleasing," f=
or they were true correspondences. (Ibid.) The sacrifices were, however, co=
vered over, so to speak, with a good signification by being called "bread."=
 (A. C. 10079, 2165.) Because the sacrifices were not commanded, not being =
according to Divine order, "they were abrogated by the Lord, but the bread =
and wine were retained." (Ibid.)</p><p>In the letter of Scripture, indeed, =
there is a certain appearance of command, but the displeasure of the Lord w=
as made manifest in certain passages. "Thou desirest not sacrifice that I s=
hould give it." (Psalm 51:16.) "I desired mercy, and not sacrifice; and the=
 knowledge of God more than burnt offerings." (Hosea 6:6.) "Hath the Lord d=
elight in burnt offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of the Lo=
rd? Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat o=
f rams. (I Samuel 15:22.) "Shall I come before Him with burnt offerings, wi=
th calves a year old? Will the Lord be pleased with thousands of rams?" (Mi=
cah 6:6-8.) And it is plainly said in Jeremiah (7:22-24) that sacrifices an=
d burnt offerings were not commanded. These passages contain the genuine tr=
uth, but it was not seen at that time. For the reason, see below.</p><p>In =
order still further to modify the effect of their sacrificial worship, and =
make it less displeasing in heaven, they were forbidden to use evil animals=
, or those having no correspondence with the spiritual things of the Word. =

</p><p>When the Lord came, He abolished sacrifices, but retained for the Ch=
ristian Church certain things of the former worship that could be made of u=
se by reason of a true correspondence with heaven, such as water, wine, and=
 bread, for Baptism and the Holy Supper. (Concerning the abrogation of sacr=
ificial worship, see A. C. 4489, 10637; T. C. R. 670.)</p><p>The abolishing=
 of sacrifices was foretold in Daniel (9:27): "In the midst of the week, He=
 shall cause the sacrifice and oblation to cease."</p><p>Why Permitted.</p>=
<p>Worship by sacrifices did not begin with the Israelitish nation, but had=
 its origin in the decline of the Ancient Church. It was inherited by Abrah=
am and his descendants from the second Ancient Church, called the Church Eb=
er, or the Hebrew Church. It is from this that the Israelitish and Jewish C=
hurch was also called Hebrew. From the same source, sacrificial worship spr=
ead over the whole world, in most places where there was religion. (A. C. 9=
21, 1083, 1343, 2177, 2180, 4449, 10603.) It is a law of the Divine Provide=
nce that the Lord never breaks the principles which a man receives from inf=
ancy, but only bends. (A. C. 1255, also in A. C. 25, 2053; A. E. 627(6).) T=
hat is, He permits man to remain in the things which he cherishes as holy, =
"if not contrary to Divine and natural order," never using violence for the=
ir removal. This is what is meant by the words, "A bruised reed shall He no=
t break, and the smoking flax shall He not quench." (Isaiah 42:3; Matthew 1=
2:20. See references just above.) We have also the further information that=
, wherever worship by sacrifices existed, it was permitted in order that "t=
hey might not sacrifice their sons and daughters." (A. C. 1241, 2818, 8080.=
) History, both sacred and profane, so-called, furnishes abundant evidence =
of the widespread tendency to this abomination. (Concerning Abraham himself=
 in this connection, see A. C. 2818.)  </p><p></p><div align=3D"Right">132<=

</p><p>Closely related to this general subject is the fact that the Jewish =
nation was to be made use of in preparation for the written Word, and for t=
he coming of the Lord.</p><p>XXI</p><p>Incense.</p><p>Incense (incendo--to =
kindle, burn) is a combination of certain spices, which, when burnt, exhale=
s a pleasant perfume. It has been in use from ancient times among the ritua=
ls of the church. The use of it in the Jewish Church was an essential part =
of the worship of that Church. The altar of incense, or the golden altar, w=
as situated in the holy place of the tabernacle, outside the veil which enc=
losed and concealed the sanctuary or holy of holies, wherein was the ark co=
ntaining the tables of the decalogue. Besides the altar of incense, the tab=
le for the shew bread (bread of faces) and the candlestick (candelabrum, la=
mp-stand) were in the holy place. In the open court was the altar of burnt =
offering. The altar of incense and the altar of burnt offering were the chi=
ef representatives of worship. (A. C. 10177; A. R. 277.) The altar of incen=
se represented worship from love to the neighbor, and the altar of burnt of=
fering worship from love to the Lord. (A. E. 324.) Incense was burnt upon t=
he golden altar twice daily. (A. C. 10177:6.)</p><p>The simple among the an=
cients thought that the smoke of the incense, with its sweet perfume, ascen=
ded to heaven, to the place where Jehovah was, above the sky, and that it w=
as acceptable and pleasing to Him. (See Psalm 141:2.) They thought the same=
 of the smoke ascending from the altar of burnt offering. But the wise in t=
he Ancient Church thought of what these things represented, namely, that th=
e sphere of love, active in worship, ascended to the Lord and was perceived=
 in heaven,--the sphere of love to the Lord and love to the neighbor,--that=
 this sphere was represented by the smoke and perfume, that it was received=
 by the Lord and was acceptable to Him. (A. C. 10175b, 10298.)  </p><p></p>=

 It was a sphere of love and charity, a sphere arising from the confession =
of sin, a sphere from a heart-acknowledgment of the Lord, a sphere of adora=
tion and prayer, all ascending to Him in heaven, and perceived with delight=
 by the angels. This is what is represented by the incense and its odor asc=
ending on high.</p><p>All this raises the question: Should incense be used =
in the worship of the New Church? The thing itself signified by incense sho=
uld be there, or it is not worship. Should we represent its presence by the=
 use of incense?</p><p>A Commencement and a Beginning.</p><p>"Every state b=
efore a man is instructed is a commencement (initium), and when he begins t=
o be instructed it is a beginning (principium). (A. C. 1560.) These two are=
 in every progressive movement,--a commencement and a beginning, an initium=
 and a principium; the initium, or entering into, always precedes, and the =
principium, or second step in the progress, follows. In other words, the in=
itium or commencement is the preparation to begin, but the principium is th=
e beginning itself. For example, the commencement of man's natural life is =
in his pre-natal existence, but the beginning takes place when he breathes =
the outer air at birth; or, childhood and youth mark the commencement or pr=
eparation for regeneration, but the real beginning of regeneration is in ad=
ult age, when man is instructed in spiritual things, and when the understan=
ding of the Word, or the spiritual rational, is opened, and the work of reg=
eneration actually begins; or again, the commencement of life is when man i=
s in this world, but the beginning of his real life is after death, when he=
 is in the spiritual world. </p><p>The subject is illustrated in the first =
chapter of Genesis, wherein the commencement is called the "evening," and t=
he beginning the "morning." "The evening and the morning were the first day=
." The evening is mentioned first, because every preceding state is called =
the "evening," and every following state the "morning."  </p><p></p><div al=

 Every evening is a state of ignorance, which precedes a state of light: or=
 knowledge and understanding, which is the morning. In the universal work o=
f creation, darkness existed before the light. (Genesis 1:2, 3.) The state =
of the world before the coming of the Lord is called the "evening," which w=
as the commencement of preparation for His Divine work of redemption; but t=
he state after His coming was redemption itself or salvation; this is calle=
d the "morning." This was the beginning of the spiritual church. </p><p>So =
it is in all progression, in all development, from first to last; the prepa=
ration to begin, and the beginning itself; the introduction to a work, and =
the work itself; and finally the entering into the presence of the Lord, an=
d then conjunction with Him. There is not anything done without these two s=
tages of progression.</p><p>The Lord Dwells in His Own with Men.</p><p>In o=
rder to understand the Word and the laws of heaven, the nature of regenerat=
ion, and in what manner the Lord is present with angels and men, it is esse=
ntial to know that the Lord is received and dwells in His own, or what is f=
rom Himself with them, and not in anything of man; as we read, "When the Lo=

" (A. C. 8269.)</p><p>"It is an arcanum that the Lord dwells with an angel =
only in His own with him; it is similar with man, for the Divine must be in=
 what is Divine, and not in the proprium of anyone." (A. C. 9338:6.)</p><p>=
"The Lord is present with the angels of heaven and the men of the church, n=

..for good from the Lord is the Lord with them, and what is from Him is Him=
self." (H. H. 12.)</p><p>The same doctrine is taught in many other passages=

 The whole of these should be read for a complete understanding of the subj=
ect.</p><p>The essential nature of this doctrine is seen in the fact that w=
hat is of man, or from himself, is from his natural, wherein the loves of s=
elf and of the world reign, constituting his proprium. This does not and ca=
nnot receive the Lord, but fights and resists with all its might and power =
against receiving anything from Him.</p><p>The Lord's own in man are the tr=
uths from Him, or from His Word, implanted in childhood and youth, called "=
remains." These are what receive the Lord in adult age, and constitute the =
groundwork of regeneration. But these truths from the Lord, remaining until=
 adult age, appear to be man's own, because he thinks from them as from him=
self. These are the Lord's own in man that receive the Lord.</p><p>The Pres=
ence of the Lord by Contiguity.</p><p>It is necessary in the outset to obta=
in a clear idea of the distinction between contiguity and continuity, in or=
der to understand the teaching that the Lord is present by contiguity, but =
not by continuity. Contiguity is coming together by contact, touching, yet =
remaining distinct, as two hands when brought together, or as the hand of o=
ne person laid upon the head of another. The abstract or philosophic idea o=
f contiguity, in descending to the ultimate, becomes touch, contact; yet re=
maining distinct. But continuity is uninterrupted succession, as in the cas=
e of the skin spreading itself continuously over the whole body, or as a pl=
ain stretched out before the sight, extended to a distance. The teaching is=
 as follows: "Everything created is such in its nature that it is a recipie=
nt of God, not by continuity, but by contiguity. It is by contiguity, and n=
ot by continuity, that there is conjunctivity." (D. L. W. 56.)</p><p>"What =
is living in man is from the Divine Proceeding conjoined to him by contigui=
ty, and appearing to him as his." (D. P. 57.)</p><p>"The presence of the Lo=
rd with man is adjunction, and thus conjunction by contiguity."  </p><p></p=

 (A. R. 55, explaining the words," And he laid His right hand upon me," Rev=
. 1:17, giving the spiritual sense of touch. See further, under "Adjunction=
," A. C. 10797; D. P. 285; D. L. W. 60; T. C. R. 718.)</p><p>The doctrine o=
f contiguity explains many things, as, for instance, the presence of the sp=
iritual world with the natural. For the one does not continue into the othe=
r; its presence is contiguous, the one acting and the other reacting, but a=
lways remaining distinct and discrete. It explains, at the same time, the l=
aw of correspondence,--the correspondence of natural things with spiritual.=
</p><p>If the Lord were to make Himself present by continuity, man and the =
created universe would be destroyed in an instant. Hence the Lord approache=
s and makes Himself present by successive planes or degrees, which are dist=
inct or discrete. It is thus He tempers the ardor of His Love, which otherw=
ise would be a consuming fire.</p><p>No One Thing is the Same as Another.</=
p><p>There is such a thing as similarity, but never identity of one thing w=
ith another, either in the spiritual world or in the natural. For this reas=
on, there is a continual increase of perfection in all created things (A. C=
. 10200), since there is no end to the combinations that may be made. In al=
l the simples or compounds thereof in the universe, no one thing is ever to=
 all eternity transformed or transmuted into another. (D. P. 190.) An atom =
of gold can never become an atom of silver. No cloud in the sky can ever be=
 the same as another cloud, nor tree of the forest the same as another tree=
. There is no drop of water in the ocean the same as another drop, even fro=
m the first day of creation. That there is ever an identity of two things i=
s an appearance, but not an actual fact. The appearance arises from similar=
ity, but similarity is not identity. It is well-known that no two human fac=
es are ever exactly the same. This is because their minds are not the same;=
 no affection, no perception, no thought is the same as another; and the fa=
ce is the type of the mind.  </p><p></p><div align=3D"Right">137</div><hr><=

 (D. P. 56, 57; D. L. W. 318; H. H. 486; C. L. 186.) "No two faces, no two =
minds, no two things anywhere can possibly be the same; hence is the variet=
y of all things, ... because in God Man infinite things are distinctly one.=
" (D. L. W. 155.)</p><p>"Human reason may see the infinity of God in this, =
that in the created universe there are no two things which are the same." (=
T. C. R. 32; D. Love X.)</p><p>In every heavenly society the angels are sim=
ilar to each other, having a similar ruling love, similar affections, perce=
ptions and thoughts, but no one angel is wholly the same as another; even e=
very angelic couple, though inmostly united, and appearing as one angel, ne=
ver become one identity. They are one, but distinct; conjoined by contiguit=
y, not by continuity. Similar is their conjunction with God. (A. R. 55.)</p=
><p>Meaning of the Word "Square."</p><p>In the literal sense, a square is "=
a form with four equal sides and four right angles"; but it is used "figura=
tively" to signify "strict honesty, equity, fairness, justice," as if one s=
hould say," I shall deal squarely with him, or do the square thing," meanin=
g that he will be just. In so speaking, no one consciously thinks of a spir=
itual sense, but he is expressing merely a well-known natural or moral trut=
h. This is what the word "figurative" usually means, hardly anyone knowing =
that figures, metaphors, etc., are the remains in human language of the cor=
respondence of natural things with spiritual, or with the things of heaven.=
 And so, when it is said that "square" signifies justice (A. C. 9717, 9861,=
 10180), the angelic idea of justice is what is meant, such as the Lord was=
 when He was in the world, namely, Justice Itself, signifying the Divine Lo=
ve for the human race, and with the angels love to the Lord, meaning immens=
ely more than a mere natural or moral truth, which is merely love to the ne=
ighbor without the idea of God and the love of God.  </p><p></p><div align=

</p><p>It is true that what is figurative in human language frequently poin=
ts the way to the spiritual sense. The reason for this is, that there is a =
kind of unconscious correspondence in many words of human speech,--a relic =
from the ancients, stirred by the presence of spirits; as we read: "Such wo=
rds have come into human discourse from correspondence; for the spirit of m=
an is actually in the spiritual world, although he is not conscious of it."=
 (A. E. 324, 14, 249, and elsewhere.) In some of the passages, examples are=
 given of such words.</p><p>The Term "Square," as used in the Word.</p><p>T=
hings that were square and foursquare figured largely in the representative=
s of the Israelitish Church. The altar of burnt offering was foursquare. (E=
xodus 27:1 and 38:1.) This altar "represented the Lord and the worship of H=
im." By its being foursquare "is signified justice in the Lord, and justice=
 from Him in worship." (A. C. 9717.) Justice from the Lord in worship is lo=
ve to Him, for the leading idea in all worship is a looking to the Lord fro=
m love to Him. If this is not in worship, it is an empty form. The altar of=
 incense was foursquare. (Exodus 30:1, 2.) By this altar "is signified the =
grateful hearing and reception by the Lord of all things of worship from lo=
ve and charity." (A. C. 10177.) It will be seen here that charity or love t=
o the neighbor is introduced as a leading element of worship, second only t=
o the former love, which is love to the Lord. These two loves, as being the=
 all of the Word, are also the all of worship. This is the worship that is =
pleasing to the Lord. It is pleasing to Him and to the angels of heaven, as=
 the odor of sweet incense.</p><p>The breastplate of judgment was also four=
square (Exodus 28:15, 16, and 39:9), signifying what is just and perfect. (=
A. C. 9861.) It also signifies what is perfect because it was doubled, like=
 the right and left side of the body, and "two" signifies the conjunction o=
f good and truth, being expressive of the perfection of the celestial state=
, or, in the supreme sense, of the union of the Divine and Human in the Lor=
d.  </p><p></p><div align=3D"Right">139</div><hr><p>

</p><p>John saw the Holy City in vision as foursquare or quadrangular, "sig=
nifying what is just, because it has four sides, and the four sides look to=
 the four quarters; and to look equally to the four quarters is to view all=
 things from justice." (A. R. 905.) It is as when a man looks to the Lord, =
and has regard to the neighbor, in all that he thinks and does. Such a man =
is square or just.</p><p>XXII</p><p>Invention.</p><p>To invent (invenio) is=
 to discover, to find out, to come upon or light upon. The inventor discove=
rs or happens upon some fact or law which has been hitherto unknown, or its=
 particular application unrecognized. He is often spoken of as a "creator."=
 But he is no more a creator than the man who finds a nugget of gold is the=
 creator of gold. If he is the first one to find or discover, it is a gift =
from Him who alone is the Creator, a gift to use as his own, but for the be=
nefit of his fellow creatures. The Lord gives nothing to man for himself al=
one. What He gives to one He gives to all. The first receiver of the gift i=
s also to receive a reward for his labor. But governments wisely place a li=
mit, for it is seen that the gift is intended for all.</p><p>The inventor r=
eceives the gift first because his mind, more than others, has been attuned=
 to influx by virtue of his seeking (Matthew 6:7, 8); and illustration foll=
ows influx. The secret was first given in the spiritual world. And a knowle=
dge of it, existing there in the form of a spiritual use, has in it an ende=
avor to descend into the world of nature; and it does descend when the time=
 arrives, or a state ready to receive.</p><p>To find signifies to be given =
gratis. (A. C. 5756.) It is a free gift of the Lord to the seeker. We read =
of this law as having a wonderful fulfilment in heaven (H. H. 190, 393; D. =
L. W. 334; A. E. 1226:2; D. Love xii:2), where all things are given gratis =
to the angels according to their love of use.  </p><p></p><div align=3D"Rig=

</p><p>Endeavor, Force, and Motion.</p><p>Endeavor is conatus in the Latin.=
 "Conatus" is also used as an English word. It is variously translated "eff=
ort," "attempt," or "tendency." "Endeavor" is the nearest in English. Somet=
imes "energy" is used. Force (vis) is from endeavor, and becomes visible in=
 motion. The atmospheres are the forces of nature. (D. L. W. 200, 311.) End=
eavor, force, and motion are three things from the Lord in both worlds, by =
which all effects are produced. (D. L. W. 218.). Universally, endeavor or c=
onatus is in the spiritual sun, force is in the spiritual world, and motion=
, with its effects, in the natural world. All three, in an image, are in na=
ture and in man. Hence the endeavor to produce uses is everywhere in nature=
. (D. L. W. 62, 310; A. C. 3610:3, 5116:2.) With man, endeavor is in his wi=
ll, called living endeavor. (D. L. W. 219.) But all love is endeavor, evil =
or good. On the plane of nature, endeavor or conatus is in the sun, force i=
s in the atmospheres, and motion appears in all nature's operations. In the=
 body, endeavor is from the will in the brain, force is in the animal spiri=
t and the blood, and motion is in the body.</p><p>The Divine Love is the en=
deavor of all endeavors, perpetually operating to regenerate and save. (T. =
C. R. 73(2).) Nothing exists that has not in it this Divinely operative end=
eavor, that the Divine Love may have its full fruition in the uses of men a=
nd angels, and in happiness as the reward of use.</p><p>The Importance of R=
ight Thinking.</p><p>Regeneration advances on the basis of right thinking o=
n all subjects, most especially right thinking about God. But one cannot th=
ink what he does not know, nor will what he does not think, nor do what he =
does not will.  </p><p></p><div align=3D"Right">141</div><hr><p>

 It is possible while in this world to do what one does not think and will,=
 but this is a temporary state that does not endure after death. In the spi=
ritual world, no one can act against the inclination of his will. To know, =
to think, to will, and to do, are all essential, each in its place. Knowled=
ge is given by revelation. If the thought of the understanding favors the t=
ruth so given, man makes it his own; or if the thought of the understanding=
 favors falsity instead of truth, or evil instead of good, then falsity and=
 evil become his own. In what is favored in the thought there is consent, a=
nd consent opens the door to the will. It is thus clear how vital is right =
thinking on all subjects, and that in the understanding is the battle-groun=
d of regeneration; for there the inflowing tide of evil is met and resisted=
, or met with consent and favor. It is the thought when we are alone that i=
s the determining factor, not the thought that is put on as a garment in th=
e presence of others. In the thought of the understanding the way is opened=
 to hell and the devil, or to heaven and the Lord.</p><p>Extracts on Right =
Thinking.</p><p>Many things are said in the Writings under the general subj=
ect of right thinking in the processes of regeneration, as will be seen fro=
m the following examples:</p><p>"Those who are being regenerated think much=
 about doctrine and life, because they think much about eternal salvation."=
 (A. C. 2682:3.)</p><p>"He who is in any love is constantly thinking of the=
 things pertaining to that love." (A. C. 5130.) It is then shown that those=
 who are in spiritual love are constantly thinking about the Lord and the l=
ife after death.</p><p>"The internal man is regenerated by thinking the thi=
ngs of faith and willing them." (A. C. 8746.)</p><p>A spirit, newly arrived=
 from the world, was rewarded with instruction concerning heaven and hell, =
because from childhood he had meditated much about the life after death. (T=
. C. R. 570.)  </p><p></p><div align=3D"Right">142</div><hr><p>

f truth are as flowers, and the good of life, which is the good of wisdom, =
as fruit." (A. C. 9553, 10185, 5116.) Scientifics of truth are the simple t=
ruths of the literal sense of the Word. They are first truths, which are Di=
vinely adapted to the minds of children, and which prepare them to enter la=
ter into the spiritual things of the Word; and they are intended for still =
further adaptation by parents, teachers, and ministers. These simple truths=
 are the flowers of the Word, and by them is the beginning of the understan=
ding, preparatory to the fruitage of life; for the scientifics of truth pre=
cede the knowledge and understanding of the spiritual things of doctrine, a=

 These, with the scientifics of the world, bring about what is called educa=
tion, which is the formation of the natural mind, to be followed in adult a=
ge by a spiritual understanding of the Word. In the Writings, the natural u=
nderstanding of truth is called "science," the spiritual understanding of t=
ruth is called "intelligence," and the celestial understanding of truth is =
called "wisdom." Children and the young are thus in the flower of their age=
, preparing, but not yet prepared, for the fruits of intelligence and wisdo=
m.</p><p>Flowers in heaven. (A. C. 1629, 2296, 4528, 4529; H. H. 176; C. L.=
 137; S. D. 5663, 5665.)</p><p>John on the Isle of Patmos.</p><p>It is a tr=
adition that John was banished to the Isle of Patmos for his zeal in preach=
ing the Gospel. John says that he "was in the island called Patmos, for the=
 Word of God, and for the testimony of Jesus Christ." (Revelation 1:9.) Thi=
s is thought to indicate the reason for his exile. But another reason is gi=
ven us. "John was commanded to betake himself to the Isle of Patmos, that t=
he things which were to take place at the end of the Church might be reveal=
ed there, because an island signifies a nation about to receive the truths =
of doctrine." (A. E. 50.) It is added that the Isle of Patmos signifies rev=
elation to the gentiles, because it is in the sea between Asia and Europe. =
It is also stated that those by whom the Word was written were led to place=
s significative of the thing which they represented. When John says, "Becau=
se of the Word of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ," the prime meaning=
 is that he might receive on that island the revelation concerning the Word=
 of God and concerning Jesus Christ. This is the essential reason, even if =
John was banished there by the persecutors of the Church.</p><p>In the inte=
rnal historical sense, John was on the island of Patmos that he might repre=
sent the revelation given for the establishment of the Christian Church in =
Europe; but spiritually it was to represent the new revelation to be given =
when the first Christian Church should reach its end. (A. R. 34, 35; A. E. =
51, 52.)  </p><p></p><div align=3D"Right">144</div><hr><p>

ph would be with him, and close his eyes. "This was done when persons died,=

, he does not die, but only lays aside the body which had served him for us=
e in the world, and he passes into the other life in a body which serves hi=
m for use there." (A. C. 6008.) Closing the eyes at death was thus a repres=
entative act with the ancients, signifying that one's use in the world was =
finished, and that he was now to be introduced to the uses of the other lif=
e.</p><p>Commentators have taken note of the words spoken to Jacob. "Joseph=
 shall stand by thy bedside in the hour of thy dissolution, and perform the=
 last office of filial piety in closing thine eyes." (Bush.) "Ancient write=
rs of other nations frequently make pathetic allusion to this last ministra=
tion of affection." (Whedon, who gives references to Homer and Ovid. Clarke=
 speaks to the same effect.) The custom has come down to us, having the sam=
e signification as in the Ancient Church; but this signification is now unk=
nown.</p><p>It is made clear in the number quoted above (A. C. 6008) that l=
ove to the Lord, represented by Joseph, would again be made living by the L=
ord in His Second Coming, and spiritual enlightenment result.  </p><p></p><=

</p><p>XXIII</p><p>Capital Punishment.</p><p>There is a sentiment abroad th=
at capital punishment should be abolished; but the New Churchman in this, a=
s in all other things, will look to Divine Revelation, "to the law and the =
testimony" (Isaiah 8:20), for instruction and guidance. Let us see what the=
 teaching of Revelation is. In the letter of the Word, the following is giv=
en:</p><p>"Whoso sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed." (Ge=
nesis 9:6.)</p><p>"He that smiteth a man, so that he die, shall be surely p=
ut to death." (Exodus 21:12.)</p><p>"He that killeth any man shall be surel=
y put to death." (Leviticus 24:17.)</p><p>"Whoso killeth any person, the mu=
rderer shall be put to death." (Numbers 35:30, 31.)</p><p>"All they that ta=
ke the sword shall perish with the sword." (Matthew 26:52; Revelation 13:10=
.)</p><p>There are other passages which bear in the same direction, and non=
e to the contrary. Love and mercy is indeed taught throughout, but it is lo=
ve and mercy qualified by justice and truth. But what says the Heavenly Doc=
trine, in whose light all things of the letter are to be judged and determi=
ned?</p><p>In the explanation of Genesis 9:6, the teaching is that "the she=
dder of blood, or the murderer, is to be punished with death.... It is a la=
w of retaliation well known to the ancients, according to which they judged=
 crimes and misdemeanors (scelera)." (A. C. 1011.) Among the laws still "to=
 be observed and done" (A. C. 9349) are such as command the capital punishm=
ent of the offender, as given in Exodus 21:12, and elsewhere. It is further=
 stated that the law of retaliation was not repealed by the Lord, but expla=
ined. (A. C. 8223, 9049.) This ancient law was, that a similar evil was to =
be returned upon him who did evil to another. The Lord explained that this =
was not to be done in the Christian Church from revenge, but from justice. =
Hence the execution of this law was to be taken out of the hands of the ind=
ividual, and given over to the State. (See also A. R. 762.)  </p><p></p><di=

</p><p>Capital Punishment by the State Only.</p><p>Capital punishment, unde=
r the law of retaliation, was not to be abolished, but was to be denied the=
 individual sufferer, who would not be guided by justice, but by revenge. H=
ence the fulfilling of this law was to be turned over to the State, which w=
ould act, not from cruelty and revenge, but from reason and law, from equit=
y and justice. And the State, in order to deter men from the commission of =
diabolical crime, should have unquestioned the power of life and death. Thi=
s is made evident in passages of the Writings, as in the following:</p><p>"=
Unless men were restrained by civil laws, and by fears of the loss of honor=
, of gain, of reputation, and of life, they would kill without any percepti=
on of conscience." (A. C. 3175.)</p><p>"He who hates continually desires to=
 kill, and also actually would kill, unless prevented by the fear of punish=
ment, the fear of the loss of life, of reputation," etc. (A. C. 8902.)</p><=
p>"Unless men were held in bonds by the law,... and by punishments opposed =
to their loves, which are the loss of honors, of possessions, and of life,.=
.. the human race would perish." (A. C. 10791. See also A. C. 1010, 7810, 8=
227; H. H. 531; T. C. R. 309.) Hence it is made clear what disaster to mank=
ind would attend the abolishing of capital punishment by the nations of the=
 earth.</p><p>The desire to abolish capital punishment is apparently on the=
 increase, and if analyzed it will be seen to arise from an absence of beli=
ef in a life after death, so that death is looked upon as the total extinct=
ion of life, and thus the greatest of all calamities.  </p><p></p><div alig=

</p><p>Hereditary Evil.</p><p>The view has prevailed that there is no hered=
itary evil except that which arose from the disobedience of Adam. "In Adam'=
s fall we sinned all," from which sin, we are told, man is saved by faith i=
n the merits of Christ, who suffered on the cross for the sins of man. But =
this "is a most false opinion.... Everyone, by his own actual sins, makes e=
vil to be hereditary, and adds to that which he receives from his parents; =
and thus it accumulates, and remains in all his posterity; nor is it modera=
ted except in those who are regenerated by the Lord." (A. C. 494.) And furt=
her: "Hereditary evil is from no other source than from parents; not, indee=
d, the evil which a man actually commits, but the inclination to it." (T. C=
. R. 521.) If a man inherited the actual evils of his parents, he would be =
born a sinner, and could not be saved. But no man is a sinner by birth. He =
becomes a sinner when he makes his own the evil to which he has the inherit=
ed inclination. (See also A. C. 8806, 3469.)</p><p>We are further taught th=
at every church "decreases and degenerates, and its former integrity perish=
es, chiefly by reason of the increase of hereditary evil." (A. C. 494; T. C=
. R. 521.) Thus increasing by additions in each generation, it finally brin=
gs the church to its consummation and end. But the same law may operate aff=
irmatively. This is the hope of the New Church,--the gradual increase of th=
e inclination to good. Hence we read "that offspring born of two who are in=
 love truly conjugial draw from their parents the conjugial of good and tru=
th, from which they have an inclination and a faculty, if a son, for percei=
ving the things of wisdom, if a daughter for loving the things which wisdom=
 teaches." (C. L. 202-205. See also A. C. 3469.)</p><p>No One Punished in t=
he Other Life for Hereditary Evils.</p><p>"No one is punished on account of=
 hereditary evils, but on account of his own evils." (A. C. 9069.)  </p><p>=

 Again, "No one suffers any punishment or torment in the other life on acco=
unt of his hereditary evil, but on account of the actual evils which he him=
self commits." (A. C. 966.) For "it is not allowed evil spirits and genii t=
o operate, except into those things which a man has actually procured to hi=
mself, not into those which he receives hereditarily." (A. C. 1667.)</p><p>=
Man is not punished on account of hereditary evils, nor even on account of =
any evil done in the world, but on account of the evils which he does after=
 he is in the spiritual world. Evil done in the world goes with him into th=
e spiritual world, and he does the same evils there, for which he is punish=
ed; but not for hereditary evils, nor evils previously done.</p><p>The tend=
ency of hereditary evil is to come forth and take possession of the mind an=
d life. It is then adopted as man's own, and shapes all his actions. It is =
necessary that hereditary evil should enter his understanding and thought, =
in order that its quality may become known, and that opportunity may be giv=
en him to accept it or reject it. If it is rejected, and continues to be re=
jected, it does not become his, and no punishment can follow,--punishment f=
or what he has never done. Hence the need of instant resistance when evil e=
nters the thought. This is what is meant by the words, "Agree with thine ad=
versary quickly, whilst thou art in the way with him." (Matthew 5:25.) By t=
he "way" is meant the thought. If hereditary evil is in this manner met and=
 conquered, there is no punishment resulting from it, either in this world =
or the other.</p><p>On the above subject, in general, see A. C. 313, 1608, =
2307, 2308, 9069; A. E. 989.</p><p>Submission.</p><p>Submission signifies l=
iterally that which is placed under or below; in general, to yield, resign,=
 or surrender to power or authority, to the control or government of author=
ity. Transferring the thought to the Lord, we learn what is meant by submis=
sion in its religious or spiritual sense.  </p><p></p><div align=3D"Right">=

</p><p>Much is said in our Doctrine on the subject of submission. This is b=
ecause it is fundamental to spiritual life. We have spoken of this subject =
before, in the article on "Rebellion," pp. 57, 58, where it was shown that =
the only road to the removal of the life of hell is "in submission to the w=
ill of the Lord, to the rule of the Divine Law,... a submission that involv=
es combat and resistance to the forces that rise up from below and excite a=
 spirit of rebellion." We can hardly say more now. But see the teaching in =
the passages quoted in the next article.</p><p>Our present purpose is to pr=
esent a more complete idea of submission, by the addition of the subject of=
 prayer,--prayer before combat, prayer during combat, and prayer in acknowl=
edgment and praise after combat, and that such prayer is heard in heaven, a=
nd by the Lord Himself. Let us quote here one passage: "But the worship of =
those who live a moral life from a spiritual origin is altogether different=
, for it is truly the worship of God. Their prayers are elevated to heaven =
and there heard, for the Lord draws their prayers through heaven to Himself=
." (A. E. 182. See also A. C. 9202; S. D. 4821, 4822; T. C. R. 108.) Prayer=
 in church, prayer at home, prayer upon the knees before God, is thus intro=
duced as an essential element in submission to the Divine will. But prayer =
may and should take place at any time, in any attitude of the body,--prayer=
 for submission to the Providence of the Lord, and for help from Him in com=
bat.</p><p>The Teaching Concerning Submission.</p><p>"The things of a lower=
 place, because they ought to serve what is higher, must be in submission; =
without their submission, there is no conjunction possible." (A. C. 3091.) =
That is, man, being in a lower place, cannot be conjoined with the Lord, ca=
nnot be saved, without submission to the laws of Divine order.</p><p>In A. =
C. 4341, it is taught that conjunction is effected in no other way than by =
humiliation and submission, signified by the submission of Jacob to Esau, a=
nd that these two as one are brought about through temptations.  </p><p></p=

</p><p>"There must be humiliation and submission in the presence of the Div=
ine, when man is in worship.... The Lord wills humiliation and submission, =
not for His own sake, but for man's sake. For when man is in humiliation, h=
e then has aversion to the evil and falsity in him, and thus removes them."=
 (A. C. 4347.)</p><p>"The conjunction of the external man with the internal=
 is not effected without temptation and spontaneous submission." (A. C. 572=
9.)</p><p>"In order that the Lord may render man blessed and happy, He will=
s a total submission." (A. C. 6138.)</p><p>"Humiliation and submission are =
the essentials of worship, for worship without these is not worship, but ge=
stures in imitation of those who are in true worship, in which gestures the=
re is nothing of life; for life from the Lord inflows only into the humble =
and submissive heart. (A. C. 8873.)</p><p>It is thus made dear that the hab=
it of complaint at the ways of Providence is a condition of disorder in whi=
ch the Lord is not present.</p><p>The spirit of submission will bring a rea=
lization that the laws of nature, even to its ultimates, as well as the doi=
ngs of others outside of one's self, are all laws of Providence to the indi=

</p><p>Without the permission of evil, man cannot be led from evil to good,=
 and so cannot be reformed and saved. (A. C. 6489, 6663; D. P. 234, 251, 27=
5, 281, 2967, 333; S. D. 398.)</p><p>It is supposed that, because the Lord =
permits evil, He is the cause of evil. (A. C. 1832, 8227.) But all evil is =
from diabolical spirits. (A. C. 1874, 2768.)</p><p>The laws of permission a=
re also laws of Providence. (D. P. 234, Chapter; A. E. 1159.)</p><p>The abo=
ve teaching involves, in a summary view, that evils are permitted to the en=
d that all things may be brought into order in heaven, in hell, and in the =
world. In heaven, by the breaking forth of evils in the imaginary heavens, =
causing the last judgment and its continuation, leading to the formation of=
 the new heaven and the upbuilding of the new church. In hell, by evil spir=
its being permitted to do evil to one another, by which the external is rep=
ressed and brought into order, and is then compelled to perform uses. In th=
e world, similar causes bring about external order, by which uses exist, an=
d the necessity and compulsion for every man to do his daily work, under a =
law which operates with inexorable force--punishment in some form following=
 when it is not obeyed.</p><p>Any evil that cannot be overruled for good is=
 not permitted to come forth in either world. Hence, when an evil does occu=
r or become active, the conclusion is safe and sure that it is for the good=
 of mankind, looking especially to the spiritual increase of the church, to=
 the regeneration of man, and the formation of heaven.  </p><p></p><div ali=

</p><p>XXIV</p><p>"They Rest Not Day and Night."</p><p>It is said of the fo=
ur animals or cherubims (Revelation 4:8), that "they rest not day and night=
, saying, Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, who was, and is, and is to c=
ome." These words, in their inmost sense, treat of the Divine Providence of=
 the Lord, which never rests or ceases to eternity." (A. E. 285.) This trut=
h, like all universal truths, appears in the literal sense of the Word, as =
also in the human body, and in nature generally. In the Word, in many passa=
ges such as this: "Behold, Be that keepeth Israel shall neither slumber nor=
 sleep." (Psalm 121:4.) In the human body, in all its operations, as in the=
 case of the cerebellum. When the body is at rest at night the cerebrum sle=
eps, but never the cerebellum (A. C. 19772; S. D. 3183), restoring, refresh=
ing, and invigorating. In this we see even a physical fulfilment of the wor=
ds, "He giveth His beloved in sleep." (Psalm 127:2.) The heart, under the r=
eign of the cerebellum, performs a similar office, never suspending its wor=
k until the body yields up its life. In nature, the same perpetual activity=
 appears, as in the atmospheres and in the sun itself. It may be said of th=
e sun, as representing the Lord, that it "neither slumbers nor sleeps." It =
does not always so appear, even as with the Divine operation of the Lord. T=
he sun does not always shine; yet it does shine nevertheless, even if not s=
een by the eye of man or beast. The air and the ether are ever active, rest=
ing neither day nor night. We are not conscious of the labors of the cerebe=
llum, but it never halts in its work. We are not always aware of the beatin=
g of the heart, but it beats, and continues to beat, even to the end.</p><p=
>All these works of nature are distinguished representatives of that perpet=
ual Providence of the Lord in its unceasing guard, protection, and presence=
, never absent, and which "never rests or ceases to eternity."  </p><p></p>=

</p><p>The Fate of Man if the Lord Had Not Come.</p><p>Revelation teaches t=
he supreme necessity for the coming of the Lord; also for the giving of the=
 Word, and for the establishment of the church. If these three things had n=
ot taken place, especially if the Lord had not come, all mankind would have=
 perished, and no man would now be living on the earth; even heaven itself =
would have been destroyed. In order, therefore, that heaven might exist, an=
d men continue to live on earth, the Lord came into the world, and provided=
 the Word, in which there is Divine Truth for angels and men, to be ever pr=
esent with them in its mighty saving power. Without this, no human life, ei=
ther in heaven or on earth, could have been preserved. (A. C. 10452.) For i=
f the Lord does not effect His coming, the church perishes, and likewise al=
l mankind, fulfilling the words of the prophet, "I beheld the earth, and lo=
, it was without form and void; and the heavens, and they had no light. I b=
eheld the mountains, and, lo, they were commoved, and the hills were overtu=
rned. I beheld, and, lo, there was no man, and all the birds of the heavens=
 were fled." (Jeremiah 4:23-25.) We have in these words of Jeremiah a proph=
etic picture of what would happen to men in both worlds, if the Lord had no=
t come to rescue and to save, by subduing the bells, by revealing His Word,=
 and by establishing His church. Nothing else could have prevented the tota=

And when it is said that the Lord rose with His whole body, it means that H=

 And that which teaches concerning the last or ultimate act of glorificatio=
n, taking place in the sepulchre, may be called the most holy of all the do=
ctrines which Revelation has given. This may be seen in the fact that holin=
ess especially resides in what is ultimate, lowest, or last; and that a gua=
rd has been thrown, as it were, around this last act of the Lord's life in =
the world, both in the variety of teaching, and in the apparent opposition =
of statement concerning it; this, together with another fact, which is, tha=
t the discussion of more than a hundred years in the New Church has failed =
to bring unity of thought as to the meaning of the words of Revelation. It =
would seem that, in this manner, the truth, which is most holy, has been gu=
arded from injury. It may be said, also, that this subject is to be approac=
hed in the spirit of the words spoken to Moses at the burning bush; otherwi=
se a veil may be cast over it which cannot be lifted for a long time to com=
e.&nbsp;</p><p>It may be said further, that what took place on the cross st=
ands parallel with that which took place in the sepulchre, the one as the l=
ast temptation, and the other as the last act of glorification; and it woul=
d appear that any exhaustive study must take the two together. But the comp=
ass of such a subject is too great to be attempted in the present series of=
 notes. Let us continue, then, with our brief consideration of the general =
subject of the Glorification of the Human of the Lord.</p><p>The Human Made=
 Divine.</p><p>In a previous article on the subject of the Lord's Body, it =
was admitted that there is an appearance in certain passages of the Writing=

d, or transmuted into what is Divine, although it is not actually said in t=
hose numbers that this took place, which gives room for interpretation in t=
he light of other teachings. That we have other teaching was shown in the q=
uotations from the Doctrine of the Lord (no. 35) and from the treatise on t=
he Athanasian Creed (nos. 161, 162), wherein it is shown that there was no =
transmutation into the Divine Essence of anything received from the mother,=
 nor was it mingled with it, but that all was dissipated in the sepulchre, =
and that a Divine Human or Divine Body from the Father was taken on in the =
place of all that was natural and material.  </p><p></p><div align=3D"Right=

&nbsp;</p><p>Now, if the two passages just referred to be taken as decisive=
 and truly interpretative, then when it is said that "the Lord rose again, =
not only as to the soul, but also as to the body, ... differently from any =
man" (A. C. 10738), the meaning is that He rose again with a body which had=
 taken the place of the body from the mother,--a body from the Divine of th=
e Father. Or, when it is said that "He rose again on the third day with the=
 whole body" (L. 35), the meaning is, that He rose again with a body whole =
and entire, that is, Divine, descending from the Divine of the Father withi=
n Him, taking the place of that body from the mother and from nature which =
had prepared the way--parallel with the work of John the Baptist--and which=
, having performed this use, was removed or altogether put away, in the sen=
se that all that was hereditary from Mary the mother, and through her from =
the Jewish nation and Jewish Church, together with all that was from nature=
 and from the world, that is, all that was from hell, was totally removed b=

 the mother,...and put on a Body from the Father." This transposition is in=
deed made in the same number (L. 35), where it is said that the Lord, after=
 He had risen, "showed Himself in His Human Body before His disciples" (L. =
35), that is, He showed Himself in His glorified Body, the Body taken on fr=

 The same thing appears in other passages, some of which we have quoted, as=
 in the following: "The Lord alone rose from the dead as to the body." (A. =
C. 2083.) "He glorified His body, or made it Divine, while He was in the wo=
rld." (A. C. 5078.) "The Lord took up into heaven all His Human glorified,.=
.. and left nothing of it in the sepulchre.... He glorified the body itself=
, even to its ultimates, .. . which are the bones and flesh." (A. C. 10125.=
) "He took from the sepulchre, when He arose, His whole Human Body." (T. C.=
 R. 170.) "He left nothing of His body in the sepulchre." (A. E. 41.) That =
is, the substances of His material body were dispersed from the sepulchre i=
nto the atmospheres, and were there dissipated, each particle returning to =
its place in nature; and He rose in the Divine Body taken on from the Fathe=
r; and in that Divine Body He showed Himself to His disciples after His res=
urrection.</p><p>What a Man Inherits from His Mother.</p><p>We are familiar=
 with the teaching that a man's soul is from his father, and his body from =
his mother. (T. C. R. 103, and elsewhere.) Let us here note the fact that a=
 man inherits more from his mother than the mere physical body of flesh and=
 bones. But it is not essential to this series to discuss this phase of the=
 subject at large. We merely wish to call attention to the well-known teach=
ing that the Lord had no soul from any human origin, but that the soul in H=
im was the Divine Itself,--the Divine which is called the Father. "I am in =
the Father, and the Father in me; ... the Father that dwelleth in me, He do=
eth the works." (John 14:10.) "Who does not know that the child has the sou=
l and life from its father, and that the body is from the soul?  </p><p></p=

 What, therefore, is said more plainly than that the Lord had His soul and =
life from Jehovah God? and because the Divine cannot be divided, that the D=
ivine Itself was His soul and life?" (T. C. R. 82.) The body of man, by reg=
eneration, is formed into an image of his soul. All that is in the body tha=
t is not in agreement with the soul is gradually removed, put away, so that=
 there is finally established a complete correspondence of the body with th=
e soul, so that the body becomes the son or offspring of the soul. The doct=
rine reveals a corresponding operation in the glorification of the Lord. Hi=
s body, after the three days in the sepulchre, was no longer in any sense t=
he son of Mary, but the Son of God.</p><p>The second point we wish briefly =
to present is, that the Lord took on from Mary, by natural inheritance, not=
 only a body of flesh and blood, but also her mental states, which included=
 not only the natural good in her, but the evil tendencies of the Jewish na=
tion, and of the whole human race. This body from Mary the Lord wholly remo=
ved by acts of glorification, and took on in its place a Body from the Fath=
er, Divine, Omnipresent, Infinite--present in all the world of creation, an=
d not anything in it from the human of the mother.</p><p>The Lord Now Has A=
ll the Planes of a Man in the World.</p><p>The material body of the Lord, i=
nherited from Mary, could not have been transmuted into the Divine Essence,=
 any more than the substances of the natural world could be so transmuted, =
transformed, changed into the substances of the spiritual world. That this =
is impossible, the Writings teach everywhere. And as man casts aside his ma=
terial body at death, and takes on a new body,--entire, distinct, and compl=
ete, a spiritual body,--which is not now material but substantial, no mater=
ial particle remaining in it, so the Lord completely cast aside and rejecte=
d all that was material from the world, and took on a new Body from the Div=
ine Itself, which is called Divine Substantial. (L. 35.)  </p><p></p><div a=

 It is clear, however, that this parallel cannot be carried too far. There =
is a difference exceeding great between man and the Lord. This difference i=
s, that man at death does not take on another body on the same plane as his=
 material body, and in the place of it. He ceases to exist on that plane. N=
ot so with the Lord, as shown in what has been said before in these notes.<=
/p><p>This prepares us to understand in a measure the teaching that the Lor=
d, previous to His coming, had in Himself only the planes which an angel ha=
s, but that now, through incarnation and glorification, He has all the plan=
es a man in the world has, but Divinely complete and perfect. (See H. H. 57=
, 304; D. L. W. 233; A. E. 1112(2).) He and none other is now the Divinely =
perfect Man.</p><p>The Descent of the Divine by Glorification.</p><p>In thi=
s connection, it is important to understand that the glorification is both =
a descent and an ascent. The descent is primary and essential. The ascent i=
s the appearance, but the descent gives expression to the thing as it reall=
y is. The ascent is by truth to good; the descent is by good to truth. The =
descent is the Divine Love coming down to be with men, even as the voice fr=
om heaven said to John, "Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and He =
will dwell with them, and they shall be His people, and God Himself shall b=
e with them, their God." (Revelation 21:3.) This descent of the Divine by g=
lorification is the essential coming of the Lord. By it the Lord caused Him=
self to be present with men as He was never present before; and it is to be=
 an eternal presence for the sake of His New Jerusalem. This descent was su=
ccessive, gradual, beginning with the first man created; forming, first, th=
e celestial heaven, then the spiritual heaven, then the natural, and finall=
y the church on earth. He did bow the heavens and come down, beginning with=
 His First or Highest, and concluding with His Last or Lowest, even as He s=
aid to John, "Fear not; I am the First and the Last. I am He that liveth, a=
nd was dead; and, behold, I am alive for evermore." (Revelation 1:17, 18.) =

</p><p>There is a fallacy abroad in the Church, that the Lord by glorificat=
ion returned to the Divine and became invisible as He was before His coming=
. There can be no greater lapse, no greater error of the human understandin=
g. By his glorification and descent to men, He became more visible than eve=
r before, having now in Divine perfection and visibility all the planes of =
a man in the world, and even all the planes of nature itself. He is no long=
er an angel, but He is a Man,--the one and only God Man,--the First and the=
 Last, embracing man and the created universe in between His First and His =
Last--in the hollow of His hand, as it were.</p><p>The Divine of the Lord i=
s in Three Degrees.</p><p>It was said in what precedes that the Lord, by in=
carnation and glorification, has taken upon Himself all the planes of a man=
 in the world. He had before only what an angel has,--a Divine Celestial an=
d a Divine Spiritual; but now He has in addition a Divine Natural. A man ha=
s these three planes temporarily, or during his life in the world, but the =
Lord now has them to eternity. Hence the teaching is "that there are three =
infinite and uncreated degrees of altitude in the Lord, and three finite an=
d created degrees in man." (D. L. W. 230-235.) "Wherefore, these three degr=
ees (infinite and uncreate) are inscribed on man, because they are in God M=
an, that is, in the Lord"; but "in man they are finite and created"; and th=
us "concerning the Lord," the Divine Human, the savior of the world, "nothi=
ng but what is Infinite can be predicated, and concerning man nothing but w=

&nbsp;</p><p>And we learn still further that "the reason why the Lord from =
eternity, or Jehovah, superinduced this third degree by the assumption of t=
he Human in the world, was because He could not enter into the world except=
 by a nature similar to a human nature, thus not except by conception from =
His Divine, and by birth from a virgin; for thus He could put off nature, w=
hich in itself is dead, and still a receptacle of the Divine, and put on th=
e Divine." (D. L. W. 234.) That the Lord is not infinite and uncreate in th=
ese degrees of the Divine, is but an appearance for the sake of accommodati=
on to the reception of angels and men.</p><p>XXVI</p><p>The Uses of Baptism=
.</p><p>To baptize signifies to dip, to immerse, to cleanse or purify by wa=
shing. At first, baptism was by immersion of the whole body (A. C. 10239), =
but afterwards by applying water to the head, as representing the same as w=
hen applied to the whole body. (A. C. 10011.) The word "baptize" does not o=
ccur in the Old Testament, but the thing is there in the term "wash" and ot=
her terms signifying purification, especially in the term "circumcision, wh=
ich signifies the same as baptism, namely, purification from evils, or rege=
neration. The Most Ancient Church knew nothing of circumcision. Its origin =
was in the Ancient Church, and the custom spread to many nations. It was en=
joined upon Abraham and his descendants, not as anything new, but as a rite=
 to be restored on account of its representation, as was the case with all =
the rites of the Israelitish Church.  </p><p></p><div align=3D"Right">166</=

 They were not new, but adopted by the Lord, in order to continue the repre=
sentatives of the Ancient Church. (A. C. 4462.)</p><p>But these representat=
ives were abolished by the Lord when He came, and in their place He establi=
shed Baptism and the Holy Supper (T. C. R. 670), to represent and include i=
n one compass all the rites of the Ancient and Israelitish Churches. The hi=
storical, and at the same time the spiritual, reason why baptism was substi=
tuted for circumcision and all the washings of the Jewish Church was that t=
he Christian Church might be distinguished from the Jewish (T. C. R. 674), =
having in view the establishment of an internal church in place of the exte=
rnal church which preceded. For the Israelitish Church was a wholly externa=
l church, and the Christian Church was established and began as an internal=
 or spiritual church, but ceased to be so after the Council of Nice. The fo=
rm remained, but the spirit was gone.</p><p>The Use of Baptism in General.<=
/p><p>Baptism is in itself a spiritual use. As a form, it is representative=
 of that spiritual use. It is represented in the ultimates of nature by wat=
er as a cleansing and purifying agent,--the purification of the soul by spi=
ritual truth; even as the Holy Supper is representative of the nourishment =
of the soul in the uses of the bread and wine as nourishment for the body.<=
/p><p>In the chapters on Baptism and the Holy Supper in the True Christian =
Religion, the teaching is that the uses of these two sacraments cannot be k=
nown without a knowledge of the spiritual sense of the Word. (T. C. R. 667,=
 698, also in 674.) This knowledge has now been given, in order that the Ne=
w Church may know the real uses of the two great Sacraments. The reason why=
 these real uses of the Sacraments cannot be known without the spiritual se=
nse is because that sense reveals the true idea of God and a knowledge of t=
he spiritual world, revealing at the same time the Divine presence, and the=
 presence of the spiritual world, when Baptism is performed and the Holy Su=
pper administered.  </p><p></p><div align=3D"Right">167</div><hr><p>

 Thus, without a knowledge of the spiritual sense, the spiritual world and =
heaven itself is closed, or not yet opened, and we do not know the true God=
 and eternal life; and the arcana of regeneration are as a book that is sea=
led. And so, without a knowledge of the spiritual sense, the Christian is l=
ike a man who travels alone in a dense forest at night without a torch or l=
antern, without the lamp of life, without the light to guide him on the way=
 to heaven. Such is the ignorance of all men without a knowledge of the spi=
ritual sense of the Word.</p><p>The First Use of Baptism.</p><p>There are t=
hree uses of Baptism. The first use is introduction into the Christian Chur=
ch, and at the same time insertion among Christians in the spiritual world.=
 (T. C. R. 677.) In order to understand this first use, it is important to =
know what is meant by the Christian Church, into which man is introduced by=
 Baptism.</p><p>Broadly considered, the term "Christian Church" includes ev=
ery religious body that bears the name of Christian, and into which a perso=
n is introduced by Baptism. They who are so introduced on earth are inserte=
d among those in the spiritual world who are of the same religious belief; =
even as we read, "In the spiritual world, everyone is inserted into societi=
es and congregations there according to the quality of the Christianity in =
him or outside of him." (T. C. R. 680.) It will thus be seen that anyone wh=
o bears the name of Christian, of whatever sect or denomination, is inserte=
d by Baptism into a society of his own faith in the spiritual world, and in=
to no other. He cannot go elsewhere than among his own. If he is baptized i=
nto a body of the Christian Church that holds a belief in a trinity of Divi=
ne Persons, he is inserted among those of the same faith in the spiritual w=
orld, and it cannot insert him into any other society; for instance, it can=
not insert him into a society of those who believe in and worship one Divin=
e Person, the Lord Jesus Christ.  </p><p></p><div align=3D"Right">168</div>=

 For "everyone is inserted into societies and congregations according to th=
e quality of the Christianity within him or outside of him." Outside of him=
 (extra illum) means round about him,--the Christian consociation in the mi=
dst of which he is in this world. At the time of his Baptism, he is introdu=
ced into a similar consociation in the other world; and he cannot possibly =
be inserted elsewhere. We have before us, then, the first use of Baptism, w=
hich, as we have seen, is twofold, taking place at the same time in both wo=
rlds.</p><p>What is meant by the "Christian Church"</p><p>We are not left i=
n doubt as to the meaning of the term "Christian Church." There are three p=
assages which make the matter clear, as follows: 1. "The spiritual sense of=
 the Word is revealed at this day because the Christian Church, such as it =
is in itself, is now first beginning; the former Church was Christian only =
in name, but not in reality and essence." (T. C. R. 668.) 2. "The Christian=
 Church which the Lord founded when He was in the world is now first being =
built up by Him." (T. C. R. 674.) 3. "The spiritual sense is now disclosed,=
 because hitherto Christianity has existed only in name, and with some a ki=
nd of shadow of it; for up to this time men have not approached and worship=
ped the Savior Himself, as the only God, in whom is the Divine Trinity.... =
But because Christianity itself is now first arising, and a New Church ... =
is now being instituted by the Lord, in which God the Father, the Son, and =
the Holy Spirit are acknowledged as one, because they are in one Person, it=
 has pleased the Lord to reveal the spiritual sense of the Word, that this =
Church may come into the very use itself of Baptism and the Holy Supper." (=
T. C. R. 700.)</p><p>This teaching makes clear, leaving no doubt, that the =
New Church is now the Christian Church.  </p><p></p><div align=3D"Right">16=

 And when we are told that the first use of Baptism is introduction into th=
e Christian Church, the Doctrine is speaking interiorly and essentially of =
a true Christian Baptism, a Baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, a=
nd of introduction by Baptism into the new Christian Church. For it is said=
 later that the second use of Baptism is that Christians may know and ackno=
wledge the Lord Jesus Christ, and follow Him. This makes clear that Christi=
an Baptism is Baptism into the true Christian Church, wherein the Lord our =
Savior is worshipped as the only God; and that other Baptism is Christian o=
nly in name, but not in reality and essence.</p><p>Insertion Among Christia=
ns in the Spiritual World.</p><p>Baptism is not only introduction into the =
Church on earth, but it is insertion at the same time (simul tunc) among Ch=
ristians in the spiritual world. What is done in this world is done at the =
same time in the other, for we are there as to our spirits. What a man does=
 in his body, he also does in his spirit, and his spirit is in the spiritua=
l world. He is, by the act of Baptism, inserted as to his spirit among spir=
its in the spiritual world who are of his religious faith, whatever that fa=
ith may be. If his faith be a faith in the true God, Jesus Christ our Savio=
r, and his life has been a life of obedience to Him, he is inserted among t=
hose Christian spirits who are in the same faith, and who are being instruc=
ted and prepared for the New Christian Heaven,--performing the same use tha=
t the New Church on earth is performing, namely, preparing men for heaven. =
These societies are the Christian Church, are the New Church, in the spirit=
ual world.</p><p>It will be observed that the term "spiritual world" is use=
d in a universal sense, even as the term "Christian" is so used; and, like =
the term "Christian," it is also used in a specific sense, meaning, not the=
 whole spiritual world, but that state or region in the world of spirits wh=
ere true Christians are, and are being prepared for the New Heaven.  </p><p=

</p><p>The word insertion signifies to sow, implant, ingraft,-a more comple=
te word than introduction; it is a more interior introduction; for their en=
trance into a heavenly society is imminent, the final work of introduction =
is being performed, and they are about to enter upon their reward. The word=
 ingraft is expressive. It signifies to insert a branch of a tree or shrub =
into another tree or shrub for the sake of propagation; and the dictionary =
gives it a figurative sense,-"to insert or introduce in such a way as to ma=
ke it a part of something," thus establishing an organic, a living, connect=
ion. The truth is, that by baptism at the beginning of regeneration a man i=
s implanted, ingrafted, as to his inmost life in a heavenly society, and hi=
s insertion among Christians in the spiritual world is but a necessary step=
 towards this goal of his life.</p><p>Instruction to Follow Baptism.</p><p>=
The indication given in the chapter on Baptism (T. C. R. 677) is that instr=
uction in the doctrine of the church should be given after Baptism. This in=
dication is given as follows: "That not only infants are baptized, but also=
 foreign proselytes,... and this before they have been instructed, merely f=
rom the confession that they wish to embrace Christianity." (T. C. R. 677.)=
 Infants re not instructed before baptism, and the passage quoted establish=
es it as a general rule of order for the church. All that is needed is a sp=
irit of affirmation, a general confession of belief in the Lord Jesus Chris=
t as God, and that evils are to be shunned as sins against Him, according t=
o the requirement in our Baptismal Service.</p><p>This general affirmation =
is what is represented by the tribe of Dan, namely, "the affirmative of tru=
th and good, which is the first of all things when faith and charity begin =
with man." (A. C. 3923.) The tribe of Dan was situated at the northern entr=
ance into the Land of Canaan, which Land represented the Church, and Dan si=
gnified entrance into it by "the affirmative of truth and good." This "firs=
t of all things when faith and charity begin "is when Baptism takes place. =

 Instruction in doctrine then begins, to follow through life in the world, =
with a never ending increase after death,--entering through the gate of bap=
tism in a state of ignorance, having ever in view the goal of knowledge, in=
telligence, and wisdom. It is as if one should say, "I do not know, but the=
 Lord knows, and His Word is truth. Give me understanding that I may see! "=
Man, indeed, is always ignorant. At every step in life he is ignorant; for =
an infinity of knowledge is always ahead of him. We are told that the celes=
tial angels, the wisest of all, acknowledge their ignorance more than other=
s. Something of this spirit should be in every act of Baptism.</p><p>The Ba=
ptism of Infants.</p><p>The importance of the Baptism of infants, or of lit=
tle children before the age of seven years, is made plain to us. Baptism ma=
y take place later, even in adult life. (H. D. 206.) But its use in the per=
iod of infancy is taught as follows: "Without the Christian sign, which is =
Baptism, some Mahometan spirit, or some one of the idolaters, may apply him=
self to Christian infants newly born, and also to children, and infuse into=
 them an inclination for his religion, and thus draw away their minds and a=
lienate them from Christianity, which would be to distort and destroy spiri=
tual order." (T. C. R. 678.) This is a danger which is seen when it is unde=
rstood that children are in a state similar to that of gentiles, and hence =
have a tendency to go off in spirit and live among them by doing the things=
 the gentiles do, and even to stay among them, and become as pagans in adul=
t life,--a state in which a large part of the Christian World now is, and o=
ne that is on the increase. (A. R. 750.) It is well known that children lov=
e the things the gentiles love, such as camping in the woods or by the sea,=
 fishing and hunting, and other things of a similar nature, These things ar=
e useful and safe enough, if the children, by an early Baptism, have been i=
ntroduced among true Christian spirits.  </p><p></p><div align=3D"Right">17=

 Then, even if they wander away, the tendency will be to return to the true=
 Christian fold. As they advance in years, a, similar danger will arise fro=
m the spirits of a false Christianity, but which also will be guarded again=
st by a New Church Baptism, followed by instruction in home and school. For=
 the whole of New Church education is involved in New Church Baptism.</p><p=
>The Instrumentality of the Priest.</p><p>Baptism is not fully understood u=
ntil it be known what is the instrumentality of the priest who performs the=
 office; that is, until it be known that the spirits who are with the pries=
t when he functionates come into communication with the person baptized, wh=
o is, in fact, transferred into the midst of them, inserted among them, by =
the act of Baptism. Before Baptism, he is in the midst of one class of spir=
its, but by Baptism he is placed among the spirits who are associated with =
the priest in his office as priest. This transfer and change is effected wh=
en the person baptized, in answer to the inquiry of the priest, declares hi=
s faith, and when the priest touches his forehead in applying the water, an=
d by the laying on of hands when the blessing is administered. Touch is com=
munication. It is transfer. It is introduction. It is insertion. And in the=
 case of the true Church it is insertion among Christians in the spiritual =
world,--all effected through the office of the priest, and on the confessio=
n of the applicant for Baptism.</p><p>But if the priest is a priest of a fa=
lse religion, the introduction is not into a true Church on earth, nor is t=
here any insertion among true Christians in the spiritual world. It is inse=
rtion among those spirits who are represented by the priest of a false reli=
gion on earth; for the candidate has just affirmed his belief in the false =
God of a false religion. For what the priest is, and what he represents, pa=
sses over to the novitiate, and it cannot be otherwise. And no future chang=
e or transfer can be made, except on the basis of a sincere confession and =
a sincere repentance,--a sincere turning to the true God, our Lord Jesus Ch=
rist.  </p><p></p><div align=3D"Right">173</div><hr><p>

 For, as the Lord Himself said, "Whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall be=
 bound in heaven; and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in=
 heaven." (Matthew 18:18.)</p><p>XXVII</p><p>The Second and Third Uses of B=
aptism.</p><p>It has been shown that there are three uses of Baptism. The f=
irst use has been explained, and much that was said casts a light upon the =
second and third uses. Hence it is not necessary to enter at large upon the=
 two uses that follow. It was also shown that a plenary ignorance exists in=
 the Christian World concerning the spiritual uses of Baptism. This is beca=
use the spiritual world is not known; nor is the Lord God our Savior acknow=
ledged. Without this knowledge and acknowledgment, and without obedience, n=
o Baptism is true Baptism, no Baptism is Christian Baptism; and he who know=
s, and does not acknowledge, does not really know; and he who does not obey=
 by following the Lord ceases to acknowledge, and after death will not even=
 know.</p><p>The second use of Baptism, therefore, is the instruction which=
 follows Baptism, by which the spiritual world becomes known, and by which =
the God who has all power in heaven and on earth,--God in His Human, our Lo=
rd Jesus Christ,--is obeyed by keeping His commandments. This introduces to=
 the third use, which is regeneration itself,--the final use, the end in vi=
ew from the beginning, the one idea in all the uses, for which all that pre=
cedes is a preparation, and in which Baptism is made complete,--complete in=
 the knowledge, acknowledgment of, and obedience to, the Lord; in the love =
of Him and conjunction with Him, which is salvation and eternal life. By th=
e second use, the spiritual mind or heaven is opened. By the third use, thi=
s opening is established and confirmed, and the angels are present with man=
.  </p><p></p><div align=3D"Right">174</div><hr><p>

 Hence Baptism is regeneration; for regeneration is concealed in it, and is=
 gradually unfolded from it by a process of spiritual evolution, by a succe=
ssive ascent from earth to heaven, and a descent from heaven to earth,--as =
revealed in the vision of the ladder of Jacob,--occupying the whole period =
of life on earth, and continuing after death. The spiritual use of Baptism =
is a use that has a beginning but no end.</p><p>The Baptism of John.</p><p>=
The uses of Baptism are not fully understood until it is known what is invo=
lved in the Baptism of John, and in the Baptism of the Lord by John; and wh=
en at the same time the distinction between the Baptism of John and Christi=
an Baptism has been brought into view.</p><p>Elijah the prophet was to come=
 and prepare the way for the Lord, and the Lord taught the multitudes that =
John was the Elijah who was to come. (Matthew 11:14.) John and Elijah both =
represented the Lord as to the Word, especially the Word of the Old Testame=
nt, and in particular the prophecies of the Old Testament concerning the Lo=
rd and His coming into the world. And since, in its broad aspect, the entir=
e Old Testament is such a prophecy, all looking to the advent of the Lord, =
it can be seen why John and Elijah are coupled together, when the represent=
ation of the Lord in His coming as the Word is under consideration,--the tw=
o prophets representing the same thing.</p><p>John, appearing in the wilder=
ness of Judea, proclaimed the advent of the Messiah, and preached the bapti=
sm of repentance, calling upon the Jews to repent of their sins. It was nec=
essary that they should repent, because they had made the commandments of G=
od of none effect through their traditions. (Matthew 15:6.) They had perver=
ted and profaned the Law, as given to Moses on Mount Sinai, and for that re=
ason the communication with heaven by the externals of their worship was ab=
out to be severed; the breaking of which meant the ruin and destruction of =
that nation and of all mankind. Hence a reformation must take place.  </p><=

 A restoration of their representative worship, even though temporary, must=

lee from the wrath to come?" (Matthew 3:7.) It was by the Pharisees and Sad=
ducees that the communication with heaven was about to be severed. This the=
y did not know, but they knew from the Prophets that the coming of the Mess=
iah was to be a time of great wrath. They knew not the nature of this wrath=
, or its spiritual cause, but a prophet was proclaiming in the wilderness t=
hat the great day of wrath was at hand, and He was calling upon the Jews to=
 come and be baptized, repenting of their sins, and in this manner to prepa=
re for the great day of Jehovah. And they believed that, if they heeded the=
 voice of the prophet, the Messiah would come and deliver them from a forei=
gn yoke, and make them the greatest nation in the world, subjecting all peo=
ple to their dominion. They were to be led by their fears, and at the same =
time by their ruling love, to prepare for the Messiah. And so there "went o=
ut to John, Jerusalem, and all Judea, and all the region round about Jordan=
, to be baptized of him in the Jordan, confessing their sins." (Matthew 3:5=
, 6.) Crowds came to him from the whole land, and so there was a reformatio=
n practically of the whole Jewish nation, in preparation for the coming of =
the Lord.</p><p>The repentance to which they were called was not the repent=

 Unless that nation had been prepared by a representative of purification f=
rom falsities and evils by baptism, it would have been destroyed.... The ba=
ptism of John could produce this effect, because the Jewish Church was a re=
presentative church, and with them all conjunction with heaven was effected=
 by representatives." (A. E. 724.) Thus the baptism of John was not the bap=
tism of a spiritual church, but a representative of it.</p><p>Smiting the E=
arth With a Curse.</p><p>"John prepared the way by baptism, and by proclaim=
ing the Lord's coming; without that preparation, all in the world would hav=
e been smitten with a curse, and would have perished." (T. C. R. 688.) This=
 is foretold in the closing words of the Old Testament: "Behold, I will sen=
d you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and terrible day of=
 the Lord; and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children, and =
the heart of the children to the fathers, lest I come and smite the earth w=
ith a curse." (Malachi 4:5, 6.) By the "fathers" in this passage (and in Lu=
ke 1:16, 17) are meant the angels of the ancient heavens, who, because of t=
he intervening imaginary heavens, had been separated from the children, tha=
t is, from the simple good in all the religions of the world. This communic=
ation must be restored; the "fathers" and the "children" must be reconciled=
, or a mighty curse would follow. This reconciliation was represented in th=
e baptism performed by John, on the basis of which the Lord effected a last=
 judgment upon the imaginary heaven, casting the evil of that false heaven =
into hell, and receiving the simple good into the heaven which had been occ=
upied by the evil. This last judgment was the "great and dreadful day of th=
e Lord," the "day of great wrath," the "day of a mighty curse," unless the =
"fathers and the sons" could be reconciled. But the wrath predicted was not=
 the wrath of an angry God, nor was the curse the curse of God, but a wrath=
 and a curse that had its origin in hell.  </p><p></p><div align=3D"Right">=

 For it was to effect the rescue of men from the impending wrath and curse =
of hell that the God of infinite love and mercy came into the world. Hence =
the first effect of the baptism of John was the closing of the hells, that =
the way might be prepared for the descent of Jehovah God into the world, in=
 order that the good might be saved, and the race of men preserved from des=
truction. A God of infinite love could do no other.</p><p>The Baptism of th=
e Lord.</p><p>The baptism of the Lord was similar in the outward form, and =
in its general effect, to the baptism of others by John. But with the Lord =
Himself, in Himself, the effect had no finite limitation, as with men. Thes=
e effects were infinitely more far-reaching and universal, extending throug=
h all time into eternity itself. Let us remember that Baptism is introducti=
on and insertion, as has been explained. With the Lord it was introduction =
on earth into the Jewish Church, now reformed and brought into its former o=
rder externally and temporarily by the baptism of John; and it was thus pre=
pared to receive Him; and the Lord Himself was made ready actively to begin=
 His work of salvation, for which all His previous life with men had been a=
 commencement and a preparation.</p><p>By the baptism of John, the Lord als=
o inserted Himself among those in the spiritual world who were looking for =
the Messiah. In all the ancient religions, there was some kind of expectati=
on of a Messiah, who was to come into the world to be the Savior of men. (S=
ee what is said of the Wise Men from the East. A. C. 3249, 3762, 9293.) All=
 these,--the simple good of all nations,--continued this looking after deat=
h, and were gathered together in the spiritual world. The Lord must place H=
imself among them, to lead and teach them, to form a new heaven of them, fr=
om which a new church could descend,-"the future church of the Lord." He at=
 the same time closed the hells, that the good might be led safely into hea=
ven, which He entered more interiorly, making His presence felt by the ange=
ls more than ever before.  </p><p></p><div align=3D"Right">178</div><hr><p>

 And, infinitely more than all, He was introduced into a more complete unio=
n with the Father, which being finished by the work called glorification an=
d the bringing of the hells into order, He would be placed in a position to=
 preserve this order, and regenerate men to eternity, and thus ever to fulf=
ill the justice of God.</p><p>The Baptism of John and Christian Baptism.</p=
><p>In what manner does the baptism of John differ from the Christian Bapti=
sm which followed? The fact that the Apostles re-baptized those who were co=
nverted to Christianity, and who had been baptized by John, indicates clear=
ly that they saw a distinction. Concerning this we learn from the Book of t=
he Acts (19:1-6) that the action of the Apostles was based upon the teachin=
g of the Lord, that what is meant by the Holy Spirit was not in existence w=
hen John baptized. (See John 7:39 and T. C. R. 158.) Hence there was a dist=
inction in the representation of the two baptisms. "The baptism of John rep=
resented the cleansing of the external man, but the baptism which is at thi=
s day among Christians represents the cleansing of the internal man, which =
is regeneration. (T. C. R. 690.) For, as has been shown, John's baptism had=
 in view a reformation of the Jewish Church, and a restoration of its repre=
sentative character, having as its basis a representative repentance. But t=
he purpose in Christian Baptism was a true spiritual reformation, a spiritu=
al restoration of the internal order of the Ancient Church; for the interna=
l of the Ancient Church was similar to that of the Christian Church (A. C. =
1083, 1141), but not to that of the Jewish Church. And so the Baptism of th=
e Christian Church was representative of a true spiritual repentance from s=
in. This distinction was also indicated in what was said by John to the Pha=
risees and Sadducees who came to him. "I indeed baptize you with water unto=
 repentance; but He that cometh after me ... shall baptize you with the Hol=
y Spirit, and with fire" (Matthew 3:11); and in what John said to the Lord,=
 "I have need to be baptized of Thee, and comest Thou to me?" (Matthew 3:14=
.)  </p><p></p><div align=3D"Right">179</div><hr><p>

 Also in what Jesus said to Nicodemus, "Except a man be born of water, and =

 Teaching Concerning the Baptism of John.</p><p>"By the baptism of John a w=

lest that nation should then perish." (P. P. Malachi 4:3, 4.)</p><p>"Withou=
t this sign in heaven before the angels, the Jews could not have subsisted =
and lived at the coming of Jehovah, that is, of the Lord, in the flesh." (A=
. R. 776.)</p><p>"John was the prophet sent to prepare a way for Jehovah, t=
hat He might come down into the world and accomplish the work of redemption=
; and he prepared the way by baptism, and at the same time by proclaiming t=
he Lord's coming; and without such a preparation, all therein would have be=
en smitten with a curse, and would have perished." (T. C. R. 688.)</p><p>"A=
 way was prepared by the baptism of John, because by it they were introduce=
d into the future church of the Lord, and were inserted in heaven among tho=
se who waited for and desired the Messiah; and thus they were guarded by an=
gels, that the devils might not break forth from hell and destroy them." (T=
. C. R. 689.) The future church of the Lord was as yet in the new heaven, w=
hich was then being formed by the Lord; it afterwards descended on earth th=
rough the work of the Apostles. It is similar now.</p><p>"All would have pe=
rished,... unless a way had been prepared for Jehovah by means of baptism, =
which caused a closing of the hells, and a guarding of the Jews from total =
destruction." (T. C. R. 689.)  </p><p></p><div align=3D"Right">180</div><hr=

ed by diseases of every kind at the presence of the Divine. This is what is=
 meant by the words, 'Lest I come and smite the earth with a curse.'" (A. E=
. 724(7).) The remnant escaped spiritual death, and all were rescued from n=
atural death "by diseases of every kind." In this we have an intimation of =
what the word escapes now by the new Christian Baptism.</p><p>"The Baptism =
of the lord Himself signified the glorification of His Human.... Therefore,=
 when He permitted John to baptize Him, He said, 'Thus it becometh us to fu=

ate the hells, and to bring the hells and the heavens into order, and to gl=
orify His Human." (A. C. 10239; T. C. R. 144.) Thus it will be seen that th=

</p><p>XXVIII</p><p>The Three Great Evils.</p><p>The three great evils to w=
hich mankind is subject are war, pestilence, and famine; and there are thre=
e great spiritual evils to which these three correspond. (A. C. 1327, 2799,=
 10219; A. E. 386:10.) So long as the spiritual evils exist and are active,=
 their corresponding natural evils are permitted; nor can the latter be pre=
vented, so long as evil passions have control of the human mind and spirit.=
 With the descent of the New Jerusalem, and the consequent increase of spir=
itual enlightenment with some, and in the wider spread of natural enlighten=
ment, or of enlightened self-interest, as it is called, a diminishing of th=
e three great evils mentioned may be expected; but a total wiping out or re=
moval of them may not be looked for until many ages elapse. Human hopes hav=
e been aroused, especially during the past century, looking to a diminution=
 or removal of these great evils; but the experience of the late World War =
did not exhibit many phases of encouragement looking to that end. In the op=
inion of some, no greater savageness and ferocity has been exhibited in the=
 wars of the past. In addition to the horrors of war, a pestilence spread r=
apidly over the world, causing the death of thousands; famine in many place=
s showed its ugly head; and a cry was heard, doubtless in both worlds, "O L=
ord, how long! "Surely the time has come for a looking to the Divine Source=
 of remedy and healing for the woes of man. It will not come from human hel=
p, except a palliative healing, but only from the Source indicated in the c=
ry of the Psalmist, "Lord, help us, for vain is the help of man." (Psalm 60=
:11.)</p><p>The Evil of War.</p><p>War as a great evil is depicted in the W=
ritings; yet the permission of war is pointed out as inevitable; and it is =
even shown that there is such a thing as a righteous war.  </p><p></p><div =

 The subject is unfolded at length in Divine Providence (no. 251), where we=
 read "that it is not of the Divine Providence that wars should exist, beca=
use they are united with homicide, plundering, violence, cruelty, and other=
 enormous evils, which are diametrically contrary to Christian charity; but=
 still they cannot but be permitted." And the reasons are given why they ar=
e permitted, all looking to this, that every man must be allowed to act in =
freedom according to his reason, and that without permissions man cannot be=
 led out of evil by the Lord, and be saved; also, that unless evils were pe=
rmitted, no one could see them, nor acknowledge them, and so could not be l=
ed to resist them; and further to the same effect. Other reasons are given =
why wars are not repressed by the Lord, "neither in the beginning, nor in t=
heir progress, but only at the end, when the power of the one or the other =
(of the combatants) has become so reduced that he is in danger of destructi=
on." When this is the case, the Lord in His mercy intervenes. The spiritual=
ly enlightened mind, scanning the pages of history, sees all this confirmed=
.</p><p>That war is not according to Divine order, is shown in the fact tha=
t there is none in heaven, that there was none in the Most Ancient Church o=
n this earth (A. C. 8118), and that there is none on the planet Jupiter. "W=
hen I was about to tell them that on this earth there are wars, they turned=
 away, and were unwilling to hear." (A. C. 8117.)</p><p>Righteous Wars.</p>=
<p>Those who go to the extreme of "pacifism" see no righteous war. But such=
 minds do not look to Divine Revelation for the guidance of their thought; =
or, if they do, they quote the words of the Lord where He said, "Resist not=
 evil, but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the o=
ther also." (Matthew 5:39.) The New Churchman needs only to be told that in=
 these words the genuine truth is concealed, and that it is not possible fo=
r them to be literally carried out. They were spoken in this form by the Lo=
rd for the sake of the spiritual sense.  </p><p></p><div align=3D"Right">18=

 And so we read: "That these words are not to be understood according to th=
e letter, is evident to everyone. For who is bound by Christian love to tur=
n the left cheek to him who smites the right? ... In a word, who is not all=
owed to resist evil? "The spiritual sense of the words then follows. (See A=
. E. 556:8 and A. C. 9049.)</p><p>That there is such a thing as a righteous=
 war in the present condition of the world, the Doctrine makes plain. "Wars=
 which have for an end the defense of one's country and the church are not =
contrary to charity. (T. C. R. 407; S. D. 4346.) It is taught further that =
a war for defense is justified, but rarely .war for invasion; and even the =
angels of heaven defend themselves, but evil spirits attack. (D. P. 252.) A=
nd a commander who is in charity "does not go to war except for the protect=
ion of his country, and he becomes the aggressor only when aggression is de=
fense." (Charity 164.) There are some examples in history where aggression =
or invasion of another country was defense. But more often it is the other =
way. The Spiritual Diary (no. 1397) speaks of those "who in war love nothin=
g but carnage and plunder, and have especial delight therein." Then, on the=
 other hand, the passage speaks of soldiers seen in the other life who are =
among the blessed.</p><p>Wars in the Future.</p><p>Wars cannot be abolished=
, but they may be diminished, and their horrors mitigated; and labors to th=
is end call for sympathy and encouragement. We are informed that the state =
of the outer world will be similar after the Last Judgment to what it was b=
efore, and among the things that are to continue are mentioned wars; but th=
e state of the church will be dissimilar hereafter. (L. J. 73.) Hence those=
 who labor for the wiping out of all war are attempting the impossible. Thi=
s is not a work of wisdom. But it is wise to endeavor to reduce wars to a m=
inimum, and especially to lessen the horrors that have usually attended the=
m.  </p><p></p><div align=3D"Right">184</div><hr><p>

 This is a work of Christian charity. We may look for a gradual increase of=
 charity in the degree that the New Jerusalem comes down from God out of he=
aven. Genuine charity with a few will have some effect on the many. The sel=
f-interest of men will help. "The earth helps the woman." A real spiritual =
charity, having its spring in the spiritual affection of truth, in a love o=
f the heavenly things that have been revealed, is rare; but if this love in=
creases slowly, we may at least hope for the growth of an enlightened self-=
interest that will diminish war and bring an increase of external peace, lo=
oking to the preservation of natural and civil order among men. In this way=
 the modern utilitarian philosophy will have its place in preparing the way=
 for the establishment of the Lord's kingdom on earth.</p><p>The Love of th=
e Human Race.</p><p>From the Doctrine of Charity (no. 85), we learn that "t=
o love another kingdom more, by promoting its use more, would be contrary t=
o the good of the kingdom in which one is; for which reason one's country s=
hould be loved in a higher degree." The importance and use of patriotism, o=
r love of country, is shown here and in many passages of the Writings. But =
a distinction is made between the love of another country than one's own an=
d the love of the human race as a whole. Hence we read that "the object of =
charity is a man, a society, one's own country, and the human race; and all=
 are the neighbor in a strict and in a wide sense" (Charity 72), and that "=
the human race is the neighbor in the widest sense." (Charity 87.) Thus we =
are to love our country, and love her more than we love another country; bu=
t a love of the good of the human race as a whole is a wider love than the =
love of one's country. (See also A. E. 1226; D. Love VI.)</p><p>Like every =
love, the love of country may be perverted, and become a selfish love, a lo=
ve of rule, a love of conquest, a will and purpose to dominate over other c=
ountries; and thus the love of country, inspired by the Lord for the sake o=
f salvation, may be turned into its opposite.  </p><p></p><div align=3D"Rig=

 History gives many examples of such a perversion of the love of country. T=
ake, for instance, ancient Rome. It began by fighting wars of defense, but =
in the course of time, as success attended their arms, their wars became wa=
rs of aggression and conquest; and what was at first a spirit of patriotism=
 was perverted into its opposite. Wars were fought for the purpose of domin=
ion over the world, depriving other nations of that liberty which is Divine=
ly given and Divinely provided for the good of mankind.</p><p>On the import=
ance and use of patriotism or love of country, see A. C. 6821; H. H. 64, 51=
7; T. C. R. 412, 414. On the selfish love of country, see T. C. R. 441; S. =
D. 5399. On the love of the human race, see as above. But there are still h=
igher loves,--the church, the Lord's kingdom, and the Lord Himself. (See A.=
 C. 2425, 6023, 6818-6824.)</p><p>Who is My Neighbor?</p><p>In answer to a =
certain lawyer who tempted Him, saying, "What shall I do to inherit eternal=
 life?" The Lord expounded the doctrine of charity as contained in the Two =
Great Commandments. "But he, willing to justify himself, said unto Jesus, A=
nd who is my neighbor?" Then followed the story of the good Samaritan, clos=
ing with the question, "Which now of these, thinkest thou, was neighbor unt=
o him that fell among thieves?" The lawyer answered, "He that showed mercy =
on him. Then said Jesus unto him, Go, and do thou likewise." (Luke 10:25-37=
.) "The Samaritan who showed mercy signifies the gentiles who are in the go=
od of charity" (A. E. 444(14)), for "to have compassion signifies to exerci=

 Hence "those who are in good are the neighbor" (A. C. 6708), and "everyone=
 is the neighbor according to the quality of his good." (A. R. 32.) The evi=
l are also the neighbor, but good is to be done to them in a different mann=
er. (A. C. 708.) It is the same with nations as with individuals.  </p><p><=

 If they be in good, they are to be treated according to the quality of the=
ir good; but if they be in evil, they are to be treated in a different mann=
er, looking always to the good of mankind in its degrees, widening and asce=
nding to the Lord Himself.</p><p>Combat.</p><p>There are three spiritual ac=
tivities that cannot be separated, namely, temptation, combat, and prayer. =
Temptation is the anxiety attendant on combat. To combat is to fight, to re=
sist an enemy. Prayer is an essential element of combat,--prayer for help, =
for light to see and strength to resist. Without prayer, a looking to the L=
ord (Charity 2), without supplication for help, without acknowledgment of t=
he source of help, the combat is from self; self is the end in view, and th=
e combat is of no avail. Prayer is the acknowledgment of the need of help i=
n resisting evil. Man is to fight as if the fighting depended upon himself =
and his own unaided powers, but at the same time acknowledging that all pow=
er is from the Lord alone.</p><p>The end in all combat is to protect or pre=
serve something that is in danger of loss or injury; and the need of help a=
ppears when the opposition or attack is too strong to be overcome by indivi=
dual effort. Then comes in the need of the appeal for help to the only Sour=
ce of help. "I will lift up mine eyes to the mountains, from whence cometh =
my help. My help is from the Lord, who made the heavens and the earth." (Ps=
alm 121:1, 2.) The Lord brings help when there is resistance to evil on the=
 part of man. The Lord then enters, fights for man, and removes the evil.</=
p><p>Let us see clearly these three essentials of all spiritual growth,--te=
mptation, combat, and prayer; and that unless these three are together, tem=
ptation is not temptation, combat is not combat, and prayer is not prayer. =
And seeing clearly, acknowledging in heart, we shall realize that "if a man=
 by combat against evils as sins has procured for himself in the world some=
thing spiritual, even though but little, he is saved, and his uses afterwar=
ds grow, as a grain of mustard seed grows into a tree, according to the wor=
ds of the Lord in Matthew." (13:32. D. Love XVIIe.)  </p><p></p><div align=

</p><p>XXIX</p><p>A Special Providence.</p><p>What is called a "special Pro=
vidence" is a special Divine interposition for the benefit of an individual=
 or group, in which others are not included. This special intervention of P=
rovidence will often come, it is supposed, in answer to prayer. The fallacy=
 of this belief will appear where it is known that what the Lord gives to o=
ne He gives to all. But all do not receive alike. The difference is not in =
the Lord, but in the man who receives. The Lord cannot possibly refuse to o=
ne what he gives to another even as wise parent is the same to all his chil=
dren. Prayer is good when it opens the way to the action which prepares the=
 mind to receive what the Lord is giving to all who can receive.</p><p>The =
Divine Wisdom is omnipresent,-everywhere and with everyone. And influx is a=
ccording to form. It is man that refuses to receive. That the Lord is prese=
nt with every man, and wills to be received, and that man may receive or re=
ject, is shown in the words: "Behold, I stand at the door and knock; if any=
 man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup =
with him, and he with me." (Revelation 3:20.) The Lord is present with all,=
 urging to be received; but man is free to receive and free to reject. He m=
ay open the door, and he may not. This Divine gift of freedom is ever prese=
rved, even with the most depraved. If a man thinks that what is granted to =
him is for himself alone, and not for all, the way is opened for a conceit =
of his own good, since he believes that he is a special object of Divine fa=
vor.</p><p>It indeed appears as if there were a special Providence, both in=
 the Word and in human experience.  </p><p></p><div align=3D"Right">188</di=

 But this appearance is in itself a fallacy, and if confirmed becomes a fal=
sity. But it is better to believe in a special Providence than not to belie=
ve at all.</p><p>Do the Writings Teach a Special Providence?</p><p>The foll=
owing passages present the appearance, and also the real truth:</p><p>We re=
ad of "a peculiar (or special) Divine Providence of the Lord." (A. C. 6025.=
) The Israelites are spoken of as "a peculium* above all people, signifying=
 that in such case the Divine Truth will be with them more than with others=
." (A. C. 8768.) "The Lord's mercy is universal, that is, towards all, and =
is also special towards those who abstain from evils." (A. C. 8307.) Becaus=
e of abstaining from evils, they are receptive more than others.</p><p>* Tr=
anslated "peculiar treasure" in the Common Version. (Exodus 19:5.)</p><p>Th=
e genuine truth is given in many passages, as follows:</p><p>"There is not =
a special mercy for one more than for another." (H. H. 364.)</p><p>"The Lor=
d in no wise acts upon any one particular without acting simultaneously upo=
n all." (D. P. 124, 125.)</p><p>"The influx of life from the Lord is varied=
 according to the forms receiving.... But it is to be known that life itsel=
f is not changed and varied." (A. E. 349:3.)</p><p>"The Divine is not diffe=
rent in different subjects, but one created subject is different from anoth=
er." (D. L. W. 54.)</p><p>"Many think that the Divine of the Lord is divide=
d, ...because when the influx descends, it falls into forms not corresponde=
nt; but the form itself varies it." (T. C. R. 8.)</p><p>In several passages=
 it is stated that "the Lord appears to everyone according to his quality, =
because according to reception." (A. C. 6832:2, 8819 and elsewhere.) And th=
e subject is illustrated by examples from nature in many places.  </p><p></=

 (See A. C. 3001; D. P. 160; D. L. W. 348; T. C. R. 584. See also Matthew 5=
:45.) From all of which it may be seen that to favor a single individual by=
 a special Divine interposition in his behalf is contrary to Divine order, =
but that still it is permitted so to appear for the sake of the simple or u=
ninstructed mind, and for children.</p><p>Further Concerning a Special Prov=
idence.</p><p>It was shown above that by "standing at the door" (Revelation=
 3:20) is meant the omnipresence of the Lord; and that since He is present =
with every man, asking for admission, there is no such thing as a special P=
rovidence for one man more than for another; and that the appearance of a s=
pecial Providence arises from the fact that one man "opens the door" (by re=
pentance) and another does not, making it possible for the Lord to enter in=
 and bless the one and not the other.</p><p>A change of scene reveals to us=
 the devil standing at the door, knocking for admittance; and the freedom o=
f man, Divinely given, is shown in the fact that he may admit the Lord or h=
e may admit the devil; and it can be seen from this that the devil or hell =
also has a kind of omnipresence, like that of heaven. Heaven and also hell =
are, as it were, omnipresent; that is, within the bounds of the created uni=
verse. Beyond is the Infinite.</p><p>Now there is no law of heaven that is =
not turned into its opposite in hell; and it is not a passive opposition. H=
ence the ever-present danger to mankind. But, through the omnipresent mercy=
 of the Lord, man is placed in the midst between the two opposing forces, a=
nd it is given him, as it were, to hold the balance of power, and to turn t=
he scale, admitting the one or the other, thus deciding his final lot. And =
so we reach the conclusion that there is no special Providence, except in t=
he outward appearance. The Lord interposes with His Divine power when the i=
ndividual himself opens the way according to the laws of order granted him =
to exercise.  </p><p></p><div align=3D"Right">190</div><hr><p>

</p><p>Every man will finally open his door to that which comes from above,=
 or to that which comes from below; and as his lot is thus decided, so it r=
emains.</p><p>Names and Their Significance.</p><p>A name is that by which a=
nyone is known, and by which one is distinguished from another. (A. C. 2009=
:9.) Inanimate objects also have names, as mountains, lakes, rivers, etc.; =
and many of them have received names from certain notable characteristics. =
In ancient times, this rule was followed in giving names to persons. (A. C.=
 1946.) "And thou shalt call his name Ishmael, because the Lord hath heard =
thine affliction." (See also the naming of Jacob's sons in Genesis 29 and 3=
0.)</p><p>The names of this world do not pass into heaven (A. C. 10216; T. =
C. R. 300), but a new name is given to every one according to the quality o=
f his life. And the Lord Himself speaks of His "new name" (Revelation 3:12)=
, by which is signified that "those who will be in the New Jerusalem will a=
cknowledge the Divine Human of the Lord, ... which was not before acknowled=
ged in the church." (A. E. 224.) And as the angels acknowledge and worship =
the Divine Human of the Lord, it is said that the name of the Lord in heave=
n is not the same as on the earth with men. (A. E. 1022.) It is also said t=
hat every angel has a name, but not the name he had in the world. (A. E. 67=
6; A. C. 10216; T. C. R. 300.) It is indeed stated that "no angel in heaven=
 has any name" (A. C. 1705); but the context shows a full agreement with th=
e teaching elsewhere, which is, that "there are no names in the spiritual w=
orld as in the natural world; for in the spiritual world all are named acco=
rding to the quality of their life." (A. E. 676, 735:3, 892; A. R. 8.) Thus=
 every angel, on entering heaven, receives a new name; and no name in the w=
orld, or in the literal sense of the Word, whether of the Lord or of man pa=
sses over into heaven. (A. C. 10216.) The name of the Lord in heaven is His=
 Divine Human, signifying that in His Human He is God Himself; for it is th=
e Divine Human by which God is known, and there is no other name in heaven =
or under heaven by which man can be saved. (Acts 4:12.)  </p><p></p><div al=

</p><p>The Book of Job.</p><p>The Book of Job, like other ancient books, wa=
s written "by pure correspondences"; but the spiritual sense in that book "=
does not treat of the holy things of heaven and the church, like the spirit=
ual sense in the prophets; therefore, that book is not amongst the books of=
 the Word." (A. E. 543:18.) In the story of the Trojan Horse (A. C. 2762) a=
 natural or historical event is described in the language of correspondence=
s, for by that time they had lost a knowledge of the spiritual sense "like =
that in the prophets." Writing by correspondences, however, still existed, =
but they described in that language the doings of men and the phenomena of =
nature, etc. Further information on this subject is given in the Arcana Cel=
estia (1756, 9942) where we are informed that the ancient profane writers c=
ontinued to write in the ancient style, though they no longer described the=
 things of heaven and the church in that manner, but instead thereof things=
 historical, civil and moral. And it is added that the Boob of Job and Solo=
mon's Song were written in this way; therefore, neither are they books of t=
he Word. (See also A. C. 3901, 3540:4; S. S. 20, 21; A. E. 740:14.)</p><p>A=
ll the planes of truth exist in the Word. Besides the celestial and spiritu=
al senses, which treat of the Lord, of heaven, and of the church, there is =
an internal natural sense or internal historical sense, treating of "things=
 historical, civil, and moral," even down to the things of nature. There is=
 no truth that is not originally in the Word. But in ancient times a knowle=
dge of its spiritual truths was gradually lost; the science of corresponden=
ces remained, but men did not receive by it a knowledge of things spiritual=
.  </p><p></p><div align=3D"Right">192</div><hr><p>

 Remains of this science continued to later times in the traditions of myth=
ology, in the hieroglyphics of Egypt, in fables, and in the form of poetry =
(S. S. 20); but it finally disappeared, making it necessary for the Lord to=
 restore it to men by a new revelation.</p><p>Spiritism.</p><p>When the mov=
ement called "spiritualism" began, it was proposed in the New Church to cal=
l it "spiritism,"* since there was in it nothing spiritual, but merely the =
gross materialism of the other world. The spirits who speak through the med=
iums make plain that they know nothing of the Lord, nothing of the spiritua=
l truths of the Word, nor anything of a truly spiritual heaven. The truth i=
s, the Lord alone speaks with man--to every man. (A. C. 904.) The angels do=
 not desire it, knowing that it is contrary to order. It is not permitted t=
o evil spirits. If it occurs, it is because man invites it, and opens the w=
ay, violating the order and commandment of God (Isaiah 8:19, 20); just as o=
ther evils are forbidden, and yet are permitted for reasons of Divine Wisdo=
m, looking to the freedom of man, and thus to his salvation. (D. P. 134, 27=
5.)</p><p>* The suggestion is said to have been made by Mr. Sampson Reed, o=
f Boston.</p><p>The New Church was disturbed for a time by the claim of cer=
tain ones that they had been called to complete the work of Swedenborg by r=
evealing the celestial sense of the Word, since, as was asserted, Swedenbor=
g revealed only the spiritual sense. They were ignorant, or unwilling to be=
lieve, that the revelations of Swedenborg were made by the Lord Himself, an=
d that the celestial sense appears in the Writings everywhere, shining on e=
very page. For the celestial sense treats of the Lord alone, and of His Div=
ine work for the salvation of men. (A. C. 8943, 9389; S. S. 80; A. E. 435:4=
.)</p><p>A germ of spiritism does exist with some, however, in the belief t=
hat open communication will be restored to the New Church as it existed wit=
h the most ancient people.  </p><p></p><div align=3D"Right">193</div><hr><p=

 But the danger threatening in such a view will be removed when it is reali=
zed that open communication is not to return, because it will not be needed=
. In those most ancient times, there was no written Word. But now all commu=
nication with heaven is to be by the Word. This is now the true way, and th=
e only way, that heaven is opened to the mind of man. Any other way is cont=
rary to order, and is attended with danger to spiritual life. "To the law a=
nd to the testimony; if they speak not according to this Word, it is becaus=
e there is no light in them." (Isaiah 8:20.)</p><p>The Danger of Intercours=
e with Spirits.</p><p>The danger of modern spiritism was foreseen (Isaiah 8=
:20, and in the Writings throughout), and provision made that the church sh=
ould be protected from the threatened loss of spiritual life, as shown in t=
he numbers which follow. </p><p>"If spirits were allowed to use the exterio=
r memory [of man], the human race would perish.... Man would not then be ab=
le to think from his own memory, but only from that of the spirit." (A. C. =
2477, 2478.) He would no longer be free, but a slave.</p><p>"No one is refo=
rmed by visions and by discourse with the dead, because they compel." (D. P=
. 134.) In this number the words of Abraham to the rich man in hell are quo=
ted, in which it is plainly shown that communication with heaven is by the =
Word only, and not by speech with spirits (Luke 16:27-31), the Word being t=
he sole medium of communication and of salvation.</p><p>In D. P. 321, the t=
eaching is, that if man were instructed by spirits what to believe and do, =
human rationality and liberty would perish.</p><p>"It is believed by many t=
hat man can be taught by the Lord by means of spirits speaking with him. Bu=
t those who believe this, and desire it, do not know that it is associated =
with danger to their souls." (A. E. 1182.) It is then stated that neither m=
en nor spirits know that they are with each other, and the indication is gi=
ven that in this is the safety of man. (See also A. E. 1183; S. D. 1622, 19=
02.)  </p><p></p><div align=3D"Right">194</div><hr><p>

</p><p>Swedenborg was not a spiritistic medium. Spirits did not speak throu=
gh him, nor any angel, but the Lord alone.</p><p>"No angel wished, nor spir=
it dared, to speak anything to me, still less to instruct me, concerning an=
ything in the Word or any doctrine from the Word; but the Lord alone has ta=

y of that call I have not received anything which pertains to the doctrines=
 of that Church from any angel, but from the Lord alone while I read the Wo=

t of the Lord (Isaiah 52:7; 61:1), and the proclamation is made by printing=
 (T. C. R. 779; A. C. 9353) and by preaching (A. C. 3488:8.) Evangelization=
 is external and internal. External evangelization is, in part, what is usu=
ally called missionary work. In its broad aspect, it is addressed to all wh=
o have hitherto been in the darkness of ignorance. (Matthew 4:16.) There ar=
e three classes of them,--the simple good in the Christian world, children =
and the gentiles. The good tidings are to be conveyed to all of these, but =
with variety according to their state. (A. R. 66, 73.)</p><p>Evangelization=
 is instruction. External evangelization is instruction in the genuine trut=
hs of the literal sense of the Word, and internal evangelization is instruc=
tion in the truths of the internal sense. Thus there are two states of the =
church; the first is the beginning, the calling, the invitation, the prepar=
ation; the second is the upbuilding by instruction in the particulars of tr=
uth.  </p><p></p><div align=3D"Right">195</div><hr><p>

 This subject is referred to in the parable of the good Samaritan. "'To bri=
ng him to an inn and take care of him,' signifies (to bring him) to those w=
ho are better instructed in the knowledges of good and truth." (A. E. 444:1=
4, 375:42.) The two kinds of evangelization are also involved in the explan=
ation of the words, "and His wife hath made herself ready," (Revelation 19:=
7), by which is signified "that those who are to be of this church ... are =
to be collected, initiated, and instructed." (A. R. 813.) And in general in=
 what is said of the "angel flying in the midst of heaven, having the everl=
asting gospel to evangelize to them that dwell on the earth." (A. R. 626, 6=
27.) Evangelization is also a call to repentance. (Matthew 3:2, 8; 4:16, 17=
.)</p><p>The "better instructed" are those who teach the internal sense of =
the Word. The first instruction is by those who teach the literal sense of =
the Word or the genuine truths therein.</p><p>The Field of Evangelization.<=
/p><p>"The field is the world." (Matthew 13:37, 38.) By the "field is the w=
orld" is meant the whole human race, but in particular those of mankind who=
, after the Last Judgment, can be formed into a church, on account of their=
 being affirmative to the truths of revelation, and who are signified by th=
e "remnant." (Isaiah 1:9.) The spirit of affirmation exists with them, beca=
use they are in the good of charity. (A. C. 9295.) This is the field of eva=
ngelization in general, or of external evangelization. It is with the child=
ren and youth of the church; it is with all in the Christian world whose mi=
nds are open to receive; and it is with the gentiles. This form of evangeli=
zation is first in time, preparatory, and introductory. But internal evange=

 This work of internal evangelization is parallel with the work of those so=
cieties in the world of spirits that are preparing good spirits for introdu=
ction into heaven.</p><p>Evangelization is not a single but a perpetual ann=
ouncement of the Lord and of His coming, and a perpetual call to repentance=
. "The people that sat in darkness have seen a great light.... From that ti=
me Jesus began to preach, and to say, Repent; for the kingdom of heaven is =
at hand." (Matthew 4:16, 17.)</p><p>The Mode of Evangelization.</p><p>Evang=
elization is effected by means of the printed and the spoken Word. The art =
of writing and printing "was provided by the Lord for the sake of the Word"=
 (A. C. 9353), that it might be made known to all men. After the fall, the =
written Word became a necessity for the salvation of the human race. It was=
 not needed in the Golden Age, for men at that time had immediate communica=
tion with heaven.</p><p>There have been several written Words in succession=
. First, the Ancient Word for the Ancient Church; then the Israelitish Word=
, as embodied in the Old Testament; then the Christian Word, or the Gospels=
 and the Book of Revelation; and finally, the Word for the Church of the Ne=
w Jerusalem, being the internal sense of the Word as given in the letter of=
 the previous Revelation. In all and each of these, the Word was and is to =
be made living by evangelization and worship. (A. C. 9925.)</p><p>As with a=
ll previous written and printed Revelations, the Doctrine of the New Jerusa=
lem was to be written, printed, and published to the whole world. (T. C. R.=
 779.) But the printed Word and doctrine was not intended to exclude the sp=
oken Word.*  </p><p></p><div align=3D"Right">197</div><hr><p>

 There is to be evangelization or teaching and preaching, first by individu=
als, then by speakers trained and prepared for this use, or else all that i=
s said in the Writings about teaching and preaching will go for naught. The=
 whole world knows the importance of expert work in every line of human end=
eavor. Is the New Church to be an exception to this rule? The question answ=
ers itself to a thinking and reasoning mind. And the work of the evangelist=
 should not be temporary and flitting, but constant and continuous, that th=
e work may take on the form of a permanent endeavor and establishment.</p><=
p>* It has been held by some that the indication given in T. C. R. 719 look=
s to printing and publication societies only, and that no other form of org=
anization is needed.</p><p>The Dragon.</p><p>It is important to take a comp=
rehensive view of what is meant by the dragon in the Apocalypse. When it is=
 mentioned, we usually think of justification by faith alone, but it covers=
 a larger field. It includes all forms: the pride of self-intelligence; the=
 belief that man lives from himself, and not from God; all the activities o=
f the love of the world from the love of self. He is called "the prince of =
this world" (John 12:31; 16:11); he is "that ancient serpent, the Devil and=
 Satan" (Revelation 12:9); he is the serpent in the Garden of Eden; he is L=
ucifer, son of the morning (Isaiah 14:12); and he is called by other names =
and titles in the Word throughout, especially where the imaginary heaven, a=
nd the judgment upon it, is treated of; for he is that heaven. And since th=
ere is an imaginary heaven at the end of every church, which is then judged=
 by the Lord, we can see how universal is the falsity of evil represented b=
y the dragon; for he is the author of all the falsifications and perversion=
s of the Word. And the dragon still exists. He is still the prince of this =
world "that deceiveth the whole world" and "them that dwell on the earth" (=
Revelation 12:9; 13:14), from whom there is no deliverance except by the Lo=
rd through His Divine work of redemption, and through the regeneration of t=
he individual man by Him.  </p><p></p><div align=3D"Right">198</div><hr><p>

</p><p>Since the dragon is also called a "flying serpent," and appears as s=
uch in the spiritual world, it may be interesting to note the tradition of =
a flying serpent in ancient times. Herodotus says that they existed in Egyp=
t. But modern historians find themselves unable or unwilling to confirm the=
 statement of Herodotus.*</p><p>* The seraph is translated "flying serpent"=
 twice in Isaiah (14:29; 30:6); and the Israelites were bitten by the serap=
h in the desert. (Numbers 21:6.) Gesenius, after saying there was no such t=
hing as a flying serpent, remarks that it was probably a flying lizard, whi=
ch is not venomous. (See seraphim.)</p><p>It is well to remember that the d=
ragon's influence may invade the New Church itself.</p><p>The Dragon as Rev=
ealed in the Writings.</p><p>The dragon is the same as the serpent in the G=
arden of Eden, signifying the sensual. (A. C. 6952.)</p><p>The dragon is a =
serpent "which not only creeps on the ground but also flies." (A. E. 714:3.=
)</p><p>By the dragon is meant those who made God three and the Lord two. (=
A. R. 537, 565.)</p><p>All who are sensual, that is, who reason from appear=
ances in the Word, and at the same time from appearances in nature, are mea=
nt by the dragon. (A. R. 550, 563, 841.)</p><p>The state of those meant by =
the dragon shown in a Memorable Relation. (A. R. 655.)</p><p>For a long tim=
e the spiritual sense of the Word will not be acknowledged, because of the =
persecutions of the dragon. (T. C. R. 207.)</p><p>By the dragon is not mean=
t those who deny God and the Lord, and who reject the Word and the doctrine=
 of the church; for these never appear in heaven, but are cast into hell im=
mediately after death. (A. E. 737.) By the dragon is meant those who acknow=
ledge these truths, but are inwardly in evil.</p><p>The interior falsificat=
ions of the Word, signified by the dragon, "exist only with the learned lea=
ders," but not with the common people. By these latter the church is helped=
. (Revelation 12:16. A. E. 764.)  </p><p></p><div align=3D"Right">199</div>=

</p><p>It was the dragon who persecuted the Lord when He was in the world, =

p>Certain evils may be active in the natural or external man, and appear to=
 others, and yet the regenerative process may be going on within. Evils are=
 active in the natural of every man during regeneration, but they do not al=
ways appear outwardly. By introspection everyone can illustrate this by wha=
t he sees in himself. Some are more skillful than others in concealing thei=

 external.... The internal man is regenerated by thinking and willing the t=
hings of faith, but the external by a life according to them." (A. C. 8746.=

rder." (T. C. R. 593; see also 591, 596, 600.)  </p><p></p><div align=3D"Ri=

 And closely allied is the doctrine that regeneration is a long process, "f=
rom the beginning to the end of life in the world; and after this it is con=
tinued and perfected. (T. C. R. 610, 611. See also Exodus 23: 30, explained=
 in A. C. 9333-9338.)</p><p>This teaching is a help to the attitude of char=
ity, when the evils of others outwardly appear. A sign that the internal is=
 being regenerated is when there is a love of the spiritual truths of the W=
ord; for where genuine love is, there is a will and an endeavor to do. The =
spiritual law here set forth is also a law of nature. The human body requir=
es a number of years for its growth; a tree does not reach its full growth =
in a year; etc. Hence the fallacy of instantaneous regeneration by faith al=
one.</p><p>In the attitude of charity there is mercy. To exercise mercy is =
to receive mercy.</p><p>Given Gratis.</p><p>"All things come to the angels =
gratis from the Lord. Clothing, food, and habitations are all given them gr=
atis." (H. H. 266.) By gratis is meant that which is given out of good will=
, without thought of recompense, as parents in giving to their children. Th=
e Lord gives all things gratis to all in both worlds, but the law has its f=
ullest operation with the angels of heaven; for they are more fully prepare=
d to receive what the Lord has to give. So fully are they attuned to the Di=
vine will to give, that they have but to desire a thing, and it is given th=
em at once. This is but the outward effect of their internal state of love =
and wisdom from the Lord. They have no care or anxiety in the acquisition; =
and so they are contented with their lot, with happiness inexpressible. The=
y ask of the Lord only for what they need, wishing for nothing more. With t=
hem the petition is fulfilled, "Give us this day our daily bread."</p><p>Th=
e Lord requires no return for what He gives, except the acknowledgment that=
 it is all from Him; but even this is not for the sake of Himself, but for =
the sake of man.  </p><p></p><div align=3D"Right">201</div><hr><p>

 For He is in need of nothing from man, but man is in need of all things fr=
om Him. (A. C. 6482, 8719.) Filled with the Divine spirit of giving, and in=
 the image of the Lord, the angels do good to one another, wishing for noth=
ing in return.</p><p>Now every law of the spiritual world is illustrated in=
 the natural, which the discerning eye may see; for even here all things ar=
e given gratis by the Lord. For example, the heat and light of the sun, the=
 ether by which we see, the air which we breathe, the water we drink, and o=
ther things innumerable. Thus the same law operates in both worlds. The dif=
ference is, that in the spiritual world it operates more quickly, more comp=
letely, and more manifestly, even to sight and sense.</p><p>XXXI</p><p>The =
Responsibility of Knowing.</p><p>"What good is it to know, unless what one =
knows another knows also?" (Influx 18.) Knowledge not applied to use is the=
n compared to "riches stored in a casket, and only looked at occasionally,"=
 and again laid away. Wonders innumerable, truths never before known, had b=
een revealed to Swedenborg. What must he do with it all? He answers the que=
stion. "I am obliged by conscience to make these things known." (Ibid.) He =
faithfully performed the work. And he desired no reward, nor rank, nor titl=
e, save that of Servant of the Lord Jesus Christ.</p><p>To withhold from ma=

is with us unthinkable. At times we hear of someone drawing truths from the=
 Writings and presenting them as his own, little realizing the iniquity of =
such action. Spiritual theft, it is called. (S. S. 67; Life 80; A. E. 1083.=

 A complete answer to this question would cover the whole range of the worl=
d's uses; but the spiritual aspect of the question is the one before us. Th=
e truth contained in the question was intended, not only for Swedenborg, bu=
t for every man of the New Church. What are we to do with the spiritual ric=
hes that have been given us in such abundance?</p><p>The answer calls, firs=
t, for the proclamation of the truth to the world by all the agencies organ=
ized for the purpose, and the telling of the glad tidings by each individua=
l to his fellow; second, living according to the truth we know. This evange=
lizes more than we realize, for, like the food we eat, it passes out of the=
 range of our conscious knowledge. But it goes on living, acting, informing=
, in this world and the other, out of the reach of our vision, as far as th=
e stars; that is, to the angelic societies. For the Lord, by means of what =
we know and do, and on the basis of it, Himself evangelizes in both worlds.=
 "The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, bu=
t canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth." (John 3:8. See A.=
 C. 10240; A. E. 419:6, 1153.)</p><p>Preaching the Internal Sense of the Wo=
rd.</p><p>Shall sermons in the New Church expound the internal sense of the=
 Word? The answer is easily in the affirmative when it is realized that the=
 internal sense has been revealed by the Lord in His Second Coming. That it=
 has been so revealed, is shown in hundreds of passages in the Writings. (S=
ee, for instance, A. C. 3398:4; H. H. 1; L. J. 28; A. R. 24, 820; S. S. 112=
; T. C. R. 668, 669; A. E. 641:3.) If it has been revealed, then the readin=
g of the books which contain it should be one of the chief religious duties=
 of a New Churchman; and it should be the chief topic of a sermon in the Ne=
w Church. The literal sense should also be explained, but it is not to occu=
py a primary place in the sermon. The use of the literal sense in all teach=
ing is to confirm and illustrate the doctrine of the internal sense.  </p><=

 And while it is said that the internal sense is primarily for the angels, =
it is quickly added that it is also for men, as in these words: "The spirit=
ual sense of the Word is for angels, and also for those men who are spiritu=
al." (A. E. 697.) We read also that "the Apocalypse is now opened and expla=
ined as to its spiritual sense, where Divine Truths are revealed in abundan=
ce by the Lord for those who will be of His New Church, which is the New Je=
rusalem." (A. R. 932, etc. See also A. C. 2242:3, 2551, 3016e.) There are m=
any passages such as these, plainly teaching that the internal sense has be=
en revealed, and that it is intended for the men of the New Church.</p><p>I=
f those who constitute the membership of the New Church do not practice a r=
egular reading of the Writings, and are not taught the internal sense,--or,=
 what is the same, the truth of the Writings,--from the pulpit, in the doct=
rinal class, and in other ways, spiritual starvation is at hand, and the ch=
urch will be planted elsewhere.</p><p>Girding on the Armor of War.</p><p>"L=
et not him that girdeth on his armor boast himself as he that putteth it of=
f." (I Kings 20:11.) So said Ahab, King of Israel, in a message to Ben-Hada=
d, King of Syria. The words were doubtless a common saying in ancient times=
, expressing a natural truth, and involving at the same time a spiritual la=
w. He that girdeth himself and goeth forth to battle may not boast himself =
as he that returneth with victory. As a spiritual law, we have in this a pi=
cture of the regenerate life. On the one hand, it is the spiritual man who =
in the beginning is disposed to exalt himself, confident of victory in a ba=
ttle not yet fought. On the other hand, it is the celestial man who, with v=
ictory won, exalts, not himself, but the Lord. The first state is meant by =
"him that girdeth on his armor," the second by "him that putteth it off." I=
n the first state, it is the thought of one's own merit; in the second, it =
is the merit of the Lord.  </p><p></p><div align=3D"Right">204</div><hr><p>

</p><p>The subject is illustrated by the following relation concerning the =
education of infants in heaven: "When they become adult, they are let back =
into a state of their hereditary evil, not that they may suffer punishment,=
 but that they may know that, of themselves, they are nothing but evil, and=
 that it is from the mercy of the Lord that they are taken out of the hell =
which is with them into heaven; and that they are in heaven, not from any m=
erit of their own, but from the Lord; and thus that they may not boast befo=
re others of the good which is with them, for this is contrary to the good =
of mutual love, as it is contrary to the truth of faith." (H. H. 342.) We h=

 man.</p><p>The Worship of an Invisible God.</p><p>The worship of an invisi=
ble God, called the Father, prevails in the Christian World; and some in th=

e, and that when He appears it is through an angel, as before His coming. B=
ut let us see what the teaching is.</p><p>"The idea of an invisible God is =
nothing but an idea of nature in its first principles." (A. C. 10736; H. H.=
 3; A. E. 52.) "What is invisible does not fall into any idea of thought." =
(A. C. 10737.) The angels wonder that there are men "who think of what is i=
nvisible ...when they think of God." (H. H. 86.) "Faith in an invisible God=
 is actually a blind faith, because the human mind does not see its God." (=
T. C. R. 339.) "There can be no conjunction with an invisible God." (T. C. =
R. 786.) "Conjunction with an invisible God is like the conjunction of the =
sight of the eye with the expanse of the universe, of which it sees no end.=
" (T. C. R. 787.)</p><p>That the Lord Jesus Christ is the one visible God i=

 "The one God, who is invisible, came into the world and assumed the Human,=
 not only to redeem men, but also to become visible, and thus conjoinable."=
 (T. C. R. 786.)</p><p>"The Lord appears in a Divine angelic form to those =
who acknowledge and believe in a visible Divine, but not to those who belie=
ve in an invisible Divine." (H. H. 79.) "The New Church is the crown of all=
 the churches,... because it will worship one visible God, in whom is the i=
nvisible God, as the soul is in the body." (T. C. R. 787.)</p><p>The Lord w=
as indeed invisible before His advent. But the idea of a visible God was ev=
en then preserved in the fact that He appeared through an angel, whom He fi=
lled with His Spirit, and who spake from Him. (H. H. 254.) But now He appea=
rs in His own Divine Human, "in a Divine angelic form."</p><p>The Lord in H=

s treat "first of those who lived like wild beasts (fera) and at length bec=
ame spiritual men; then of those who became celestial men, and constituted =
the Most Ancient Church." (A. C. 286.) The first period is described in cha=
pter 1: 2; the second in the rest of chapter 1; the third in chapter 2. Of =
those in the first period it is said "that there was at first no church, be=
cause they were without good and truth, signified by the earth being 'void =
and empty'; and that they were then in dense ignorance, and in falsities si=
gnified by 'darkness on the face of the deep'; the first enlightenment is s=
ignified by the 'Spirit of God moving upon the face of the waters,' and by =

 Also "that the 'wild beast of the earth' signifies those not of the church=
" (A. C. 1030),--the gentiles; for those earliest men were in states simila=

first men were animals with a living soul, differing from the other animals=
 of the forest in this, that they were capable of mental development. A lit=
tle child, or an infant at birth, is also an animal with a living soul, but=
 capable of mental growth, as it was with the first men, who in their state=
 were like little children.</p><p>Revelation in Africa.</p><p>The Africans =
are mentioned many times in the Writings. Some of the numbers treat of the =
Africans after death. In some it is uncertain whether what is said is about=
 the Africans in this world or the other. The following numbers relate to t=

 the heavenly doctrines are orally dictated to them by angelic spirits. (C.=
 L. J. 76.)</p><p>"This is done by the Lord alone by means of revelations, =
and not by missionaries from Christians." (S. D. 4777.)</p><p>It is stated =
that the Africans in our world are in illustration more than Europeans. (S.=
 D. 5518.)</p><p>A map is given of the region where the revelations are bei=

there is now a revelation there." (S. D. 5946; L. J. Post. 116.)  </p><p></=

 affords no evidence in the matter. We are told the reasons why the spread =
is slow in the Christian World. In Africa, a probable reason is that most o=

hat revelation could not have been made in Africa until it had taken place =
in the Christian World, where the Word is, and the Lord is known by the Wor=
d, It is also clear that neither of the two revelations could have been mad=
e until after the Last Judgment. (See also A. E. 260a.)</p><p>Within the la=
st fifty years new conditions have arisen in Africa. The white man has come=
 upon the scene-shut out before from various causes. The new conditions are=
 the communication of the Africans with the outer world,--trade, commerce, =

 All this seems to mean, in the Providence of the Lord, that the Africans a=
re now to be taught the literal sense of the Word and its genuine truths, t=
hat a plane may be formed in their natural minds for the further and fuller=
 reception of the truths of Revelation, both from within and from without. =
But to pursue this question further presents difficulties; for it is a law =
of Providence that we know more after the event than before it. We only kno=
w that a great change is coming over Africa, as over the whole world,--to e=
ach race in a different way. But what the Lord has in view for Africa, and =
for us all, is wrapped in the womb of the future. One thing at least we kno=
w, namely, that the New Church is to be established. We know this because i=
t has been so revealed; but as to the how, the where, and the when, we are =
to know but little in advance.</p><p>XXXII</p><p>No One Saved by a Moral Li=
fe Alone.</p><p>The Church in Sardis (Revelation 3:1-6) represents those wh=
o live a moral but not a spiritual life. Many believe that moral life is a =
spiritual life. How far from the truth this is, is shown in the Writings th=
roughout. (See A. E. 188, 189, 190.) A man must be moral, however, before h=
e can be spiritual. But a spiritual life must ever be the end in view,--tha=
t is, the spiritual world, heaven, and the Lord; for the term "spiritual" i=
ncludes all of those. It is a life of acknowledgment, faith, and worship,--=
worship of the Lord Jesus Christ in thought and will, in speech and act; it=
 is a life of resistance to evil because it is sin against God. But a moral=
 life alone is to live for the world, to be seen of men. A merely moral man=
 worships himself and the things of the world and the flesh. While he is ou=
twardly moral, and has persuaded himself that he is a moral man, in his inw=
ard thought there is no morality, but a cherishing and inclining to evil of=
 every kind.  </p><p></p><div align=3D"Right">209</div><hr><p>

 He may even be outwardly religious, but it is because of the profit it wil=

 the Divinity of the Lord." (No. 13.)</p><p>A spiritual life within a moral=
 life was what the young man needed who came to the Lord. "All these (comma=

 And in the Doctrine we read that they "who are prone to suspicion are impa=
tient and restless." (A. C. 4050.)</p><p>Where suspicion is, there is also =
impatience, and an unhappy state of unrest. A sincere self-examination will=
 doubtless lead to the discovery that charity is deficient; and where chari=
ty is lacking, the mind becomes a prey to a false imagination and a disposi=
tion to form hasty judgments. Such a state of mind, prone to form unjust ju=
dgments, and carried away by the appearance, forgets the teaching of the Lo=
rd, "Judge not according to the appearance, but judge a just judgment" (Joh=
n 7:24), and that "the Lord seeth not as man seeth, for man looketh on the =
outward appearance, but the Lord looketh on the heart." (1 Samuel 16:7.)</p=
><p>A cruel state of suspicion is all-pervading in hell, and it is also a g=
eneral condition in the world. Frequently, in suspicion, its origin is in t=
he wish that it be so. The wish is the father to the thought. They who are =
in charity will fight suspicion as an enemy to spiritual life, suspending j=
udgment until the facts are known, remembering even then that it is the tru=
th that judges. (John 12:48.)</p><p>From the Writings we learn that suspici=
on is closely allied to jealousy, especially in married life; that although=
 there is a just jealousy, too often it is inspired by those evil spirits w=
ho are implacable enemies of conjugial love. (C. L. 357, 374.)</p><p>Sponta=

 Nothing is produced of itself, or by the impulse of unaided nature; for na=
ture is not by itself alive, but all motion, all activities observed by the=
 bodily senses, are but the effects of influx from the spiritual world, of =
what is living acting upon what is inert and dead. The life of the spiritua=
l world from the spiritual sun inflows and acts upon dead nature, producing=
 all the forms of motion in multitudinous detail, and, where favorable cond=
itions exist, causes what is called "spontaneous generation." For influx ad=
apts itself to the form receiving, producing as it were a marriage, giving =
birth to what was not there before, whether it be by a seed planted or wher=
e there was no seed in the ground.</p><p>From ancient times to the present =
there have been men of science who have believed in spontaneous generation;=
 but the vast majority of scientific teachers in our day have satisfied the=
mselves that no such thing exists, and reject it as a fallacy. In the Doctr=
ine, the phrase "spontaneous generation" does not occur, but the thing itse=
lf is there. Spontaneous generation, so-called, was everywhere in the begin=
ning, but it was provided that generation should continue by means of seeds=
. (T. C. R. 78; A. C. 1632; A. E. 1209:3, 1212:5.) But it also exists now. =

places. Experience and observation does not support the opinion that such n=
oxious animacules and insects are hatched from eggs carried thither, or hid=
den everywhere in the earth from its creation." (D. L. W. 342. The subject =
is further developed in the number. See also 341, 347, and T. C. R. 470.)</=

 When this is known, there is no difficulty in believing that spontaneous g=
eneration not only existed universally in the beginning, but frequently exi=
sts now, as may be seen from the fact that clearing the forest of trees and=
 shrubbery, plowing the ground, and similar changes, immediately brings abo=
ut a new growth,--a growth that was not there before; which is not sufficie=
ntly accounted for by seeds lying dormant in the ground for ages, or brough=
t there by birds, or blown by the winds, or other means of transfer. But th=
e world of causes, always present and active, does account for visible effe=
cts otherwise not explained or understood. For the law is that influx is ac=
cording to form, adapting itself to the conditions it finds, even as the su=
n, with its heat and light, produces effects with great variety. It is the =
same heat and light, but the forms receiving differ.</p><p>Nature the Same =
in Greatest and Least Things.</p><p>In his early studies, Swedenborg saw th=
e need of new doctrines, in order to interpret the phenomena of nature. (Fi=
ve Senses 489, and elsewhere.) It was afterward revealed to him that the Wo=
rd also could not be understood without true doctrine, nor the spiritual wo=
rld. The law is universal. No field of work can be entered and explored wit=
hout the aid of guiding principles or doctrines. Without this, a man is at =
sea.</p><p>A fundamental doctrine of natural truth, formulated by Swedenbor=
g, he expresses as follows: "Such as nature is in the greatest things, and =
in those obvious to the senses, such also it is in the lesser, yea, in the =
least." (E. A. K. III: 215; Principia x. 8; Generation 128. Five Senses 277=
.) That is, the least and invisible things of nature are similar to the gre=
atest or visible forms; for nature is always like herself. The microcosm is=
 in the image of the macrocosm. We find this law afterwards stated in the f=
orm of revealed truth; but instead of nature it is now "the Divine in the g=
reatest and least things is the same" (D. L. W. 77), which is illustrated b=
y this, that "the Divine in the whole heaven and the Divine in an angel is =
the same." (Ibid. 79.)  </p><p></p><div align=3D"Right">213</div><hr><p>

 And then the law, expressed as a natural truth in his early philosophy, is=
 confirmed, and a window opened in it: "The Divine is also the same in the =
greatest and the least of all those things that are created and do not live=
" (Ibid. 80); "the Divine in the greatest and least things of space is the =
same." (Ibid. 81, 155, 169.)</p><p>Swedenborg formulated other doctrines of=
 natural truth, such as the doctrine of forms, the doctrine of order, the d=
octrine of series and degrees, and the doctrine of correspondences. He was =
afterwards to learn that these and other doctrines or laws of nature were a=
lso spiritual laws characteristic of the Word of God, revealing at the same=
 time the nature of the spiritual world. The remarkable agreements, even in=
 the terms used, will strike any New Church reader of Swedenborg's philosop=
hical works. It but illustrates the fact that in his early studies he was b=
eing guided and prepared by the Lord for the great work which was to come.<=

Thou art of purer eyes than to behold evil, and canst not look on iniquity.=
" The writer says that these words are commonly thought to mean that the Lo=

a stronger meaning, namely, that "the Lord does not see anything at all of =

me to be contrary to the teachings of the Word and the doctrines of the Chu=
rch." He then quotes T. C. R. 62, as teaching that the Lord sees and knows =
the evils and falses of those who are in hell which is confirmed by a plain=
 statement in Psalm 139. The writer then says: "If the Lord did not see the=
 evil in us, He would not know us, neither could He provide for us or bring=
 us into heaven.... We should in no way limit the knowledge of the Most Hig=

 Hudson Howard, of Brockton, Mass. "W. G., Jr." was the Rev. Warren Goddard=
, Jr., Pastor of the Providence Society, Rhode Island.</p><p>While the vers=
e quoted from Habakkuk does appear in a general way to teach that the Lord =
does not see and know evil, an examination of its internal sense reveals th=
e fact that the verse, and the entire chapter, treats of the last judgment =
upon the imaginary heavens, when the evil were cast out from the presence o=
f the Lord in heaven. Hence it is said (in P. P.) that the subject of the c=
hapter is "the total devastation of the church, and its rejection," that is=
, the rejection of the church in both worlds by the Lord, which rejection w=
as the judgment. This, then, is what is meant by the words, "Thou art of pu=

 The slight appearance of limitation in the letter of Scripture is easily a=
ccounted for in the light of the internal sense.</p><p>The Lord is omniscie=
nt in heaven, in hell, and in the world with men. Ignorance cannot possibly=
 be predicated of the Divine all-knowledge. And yet omniscience is not the =
same in hell as it is in heaven. The universal prevalence of evil instead o=
f good qualifies, but does not banish, the idea of omniscience, neither of =
omnipresence, nor of omnipotence. All of this will doubtless plainly appear=
 in the light of the doctrine which is herein to follow.</p><p>Every reader=
 of the Writings knows, every reader of the Sacred Scripture knows, every m=
an in any religion knows, that the evil he sees in himself has been reveale=
d to him as evil by the Lord alone. Those only who are entirely outside of =
the sphere of light from the spiritual sun do not know this, being in ignor=
ance of evil as evil. A temporary obscuration of thought may occur in the m=
idst of grievous temptation, or from other cause, but soon the light will s=
hine again in the mind of the regenerating man. The importance cannot be to=
o strongly emphasized,--the importance of believing, acknowledging, confess=
ing, that the Lord knows and sees every least thing we think and do, and is=
 present, guiding, directing or permitting it. The practical bearing of thi=
s principle,--the principle that because the Lord sees and knows evil, we a=
lso can see and know it, and be given power to depart from it,--is a truth =
beyond price. Let us repeat: How do we see and know evil, how do we discove=
r evil within us, except from Him who knows all things, except from Him, in=
 whose Divine vision nothing escapes, nothing is able to hide itself? For e=
ven "if I make my bed in hell, behold Thou are there!" Not even the rocks a=
nd the mountains of hell can hide the evil from the Divine omniscience. The=
 evil would hide if they could.  </p><p></p><div align=3D"Right">216</div><=

n, Thou art there; if I make my bed in hell, behold, Thou art there.' (Psal=
m 139:8.) And in another passage: 'If they dig through into hell, thence sh=
all my hand take them.' (Amos 9:2, 3.)" (T. C. R. 62.) And we are told that=
 the Lord grants even to "the angels in heaven to see what is done in hell.=
" (T. C. R. 61.)</p><p>We read further that "those who are in the bells ...=
 appear to those in heaven as often as the Lord pleases; ... for to the ang=
els is given the ability, from the place where they are, of seeing all thin=
gs that exist in hell." (A. C. 8237.) It is added that the privilege is als=
o granted at times to good spirits.</p><p>Again, it is said that "the angel=
s can see each and all things in the hells, but not the reverse." (A. C. 54=
27.)</p><p>Their sight into the hells is not from themselves, but from the =
Lord. They see because the Lord sees, just as we see our individual evils b=
ecause the Lord sees them, and reveals them to us. "For the Lord perceives =
and knows all things in general and in particular from eternity." (A. C. 68=
51.)</p><p>"From the omniscience of the Lord all things are made manifest t=
o Him," that is, all things in heaven and in hell, as shown in the context =
of the number. (A. E. 298:11.)</p><p>Again, concerning the judgment we read=
 that "He who is to judge must see all the states of the man who is to be j=
udged, from infancy to the end of life in the world, and afterwards to eter=

so conjoined is impossible for anyone but the Lord alone.... For the Lord a=
lone knows what is the quality of man, and what his evils are, and in what =

that the Lord foreknows or foresees the state of the heavens, the state of =

Lord never repents, because He foresees all things, in general and in parti=
cular, from eternity." (A. C. 587.) The purpose of this number is to show t=

 The Lord foresees the states of all after death, and also foresees the pla=

ber to the same effect.</p><p>The Divine foreknowledge is plainly indicated=
 in these words of Matthew: "Your Father knoweth what things ye have need o=

still in such a manner that no angel knows anything of it." (Ibid.) In orde=
r to accomplish this Divine work, and at the same time to preserve the inte=
grity of the heavens and the existence of the church on earth, the Lord is =
not only omnipresent in hell, but He is also omnipotent and omniscient ther=
e.  </p><p></p><div align=3D"Right">219</div><hr><p>

 And His Divine Providence is also there, restraining evils, and at times p=
ermitting them; also in the provision of uses for the evil after they have =
been brought into obedience to the laws of order through fear of punishment=
. Were these things not true, no man could be saved, and heaven would cease=
 to exist; for hell would destroy heaven.</p><p>But how the Lord is present=
 in hell is of interest to know, since it has been revealed. It goes withou=
t saying that the Lord is not interiorly present in evil, and that in this =
sense He is not present in hell; but to say that He is not present in hell =
in any sense would be most unwise, since it would negative direct teaching.=
 It is, therefore, incumbent upon us to find out from the Doctrine as revea=
led how the Lord is present in hell, since it is so asserted most positivel=
y in many passages. He is present in hell in the same sense that He is pres=
ent with the evil man on earth, but not in his evils. And so the teaching i=
s that the Lard is not present in hell, but around hell. He is not present =
in an evil spirit, but around him, on the outside of him. He is not present=
 in evil, but around it, on the outside of it, pressing upon it to restrain=
 and hinder, that order may be established and preserved; and order is esse=
ntial in hell, that uses may be performed there, just as it is with men in =
this world. Order is for the sake of use in both worlds, whether in heaven,=
 in hell, or with men on earth; and the Lord is present where order is; He =
is present where use is; as we read, "The Lord's kingdom is over heaven and=
 over hell, and His kingdom is a kingdom of uses." (D. P. 26.)</p><p>The Di=
vine Presence in Hell--the Teaching.</p><p>That the Lord is universally pre=
sent in hell--not within, but around it--we are informed in the following p=
assages:</p><p>"The life pertaining to those who are in hell is in their ab=
ility to think and will, to speak and act,--a faculty derived from that lif=
e which is God acting upon them from without,... continually impelling them=
 to order." (A. E. 1143.)  </p><p></p><div align=3D"Right">220</div><hr><p>

</p><p>"A man-angel is led by the Lord both from within and from without; b=
ut a man-devil is led by himself from within, and by the Lord from without;=
 ... also, a man-devil is led by the Lord to order from without, but by him=
self against order from within." (A. E. 1145.)</p><p>Infernal order is defi=
ned to be when "evil is in the midst and good is rejected to the circumfere=
nce" (A. C. 3993:12), the very opposite of heavenly order. Hence, with the =
evil "order is inverted, for good with them is without, and evil is within.=
" (H. H. 499.)</p><p>Finally, we read that "the Lord is present with everyo=
ne, for life is from no other source." ... With the evil in hell "the Lord =
is present and directs their ends as far as possible to what is good; but H=
is presence with them is called absence." (A. C. 2706.) It is called "absen=
ce," because He is not in them, as with the angels, but outside and around =
them.</p><p>The Lord is not only present with the evil in hell, outside and=
 around them, but He is present in their inmost; for we read that "with eve=
ry angel and every man there is an inmost or supreme degree." (H. H. 39.) I=
t is because of this inmost degree of life in every man that even the evil =
live to eternity. (L. J. 25.) It is above all human or angelic consciousnes=
s,--the very abode itself of the Lord in every man. It is thus that the who=
le of hell is in His grasp. (See also A. C. 1999; T. C. R. 70.)</p><p>The D=

God is in every man, in the evil as well as in the good, but that man is no=

 the universe, and in all and single things of it.... The absence of God fr=
om man is no more possible than the absence of the sun by its heat and ligh=

 It is plain that the sun is present even in the disorders of nature. From =
this teaching it is also clear that God is in every angel, and that every a=
ngel is in God. But, on the other hand, while God is in every devil of hell=
, no devil is in God. For "man is not in God unless he lives according to o=
rder." (Ibid.)</p><p>Again, "The Lord is present both with the worthy and t=
he unworthy [who come to the Holy Supper] because He is omnipresent, in hea=
ven, in hell, and in the world, consequently with the evil as well as with =
the good." (T. C. R. 719.) The distinction between the Lord's presence with=
 the evil and with the good is then shown. His presence with the evil is me=
rely His external presence, but with the good His presence is also internal=
.</p><p>Then, after saying that the Lord knows the entire state of the ange=
ls of heaven and the men of the church, it is added that "the Lord is also =
present with those who are outside of heaven and the church, who are in hel=
l, or will come into hell, and knows their whole state." (A. E. 1223, 1224.=
)</p><p>"The Lord is everywhere present with light, even in the bells; ... =
otherwise the infernals would have no ability to think and speak." (A. C. 4=
531.) That is, unless the Lord were present with the evil in hell, they cou=
ld neither see, think, nor act. They would be annihilated.</p><p>Again, "Go=
d is omnipresent from the firsts to the lasts of His order; that He is also=
 omnipresent in hell, was shown in the preceding article." (T. C. R. 64.) H=
ence there is order in hell, and God is present in that order.</p><p>Finall=
y, "God is not in space, although He is omnipresent, and with every man in =
the world, and with every angel in heaven, and with every spirit under heav=
en." (D. L. W. 7.)</p><p>"Am I a God at hand, saith the Lord, and not a God=
 afar off? Can any hide himself in secret places that I shall not see him, =
saith the Lord?  </p><p></p><div align=3D"Right">222</div><hr><p>

 Do not I fill heaven and earth? saith the Lord." (Jeremiah 23:23, 24.)</p>=
<p>XXXIV</p><p>The Divine Invitation.</p><p>The Lord invites all men to com=
e to Him. The word "invitation" is derived from a root signifying to speak,=
 hence to ask, invite, call. The Lord speaks in His Word. He asks, invites,=
 man to come to Him, calls upon him to come; and with the invitation is a p=
romise to give, and the gift is life eternal. The invitation and the promis=
e appear to the seeing eye in every verse of Scripture, and on every page o=
f the Writings. But no one is compelled to come. He may come, or he may tur=
n his face away and depart. There is no shadow of compulsion. Men compel, b=
ut the Lord invites. "Come unto me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden, =
and I will give you rest." (Matthew 11:28.) "And whosoever will, let him co=
me and take the water of life freely." (Revelation 22:17.) "Come, and gathe=
r yourselves together to the supper of the great God." (Revelation 19:17.) =
These last words "signify the Lord, from Divine Love,... calling and inviti=
ng to the New Church, and to conjunction with Him, thus to life eternal, al=
l who are in the spiritual affection of truth, and who think of heaven." (A=
. R. 831.) This is the burden of all the forms of invitation.</p><p>From th=
e Writings we learn that "the reason why the Word is (now) revealed ... as =
to its spiritual sense, before the Church is fully devastated, is because t=
he New Church will then be established, into which all who are of the forme=
r Church are invited." (A. E. 948.) And further, that "an invitation (is gi=
ven) to the whole Christian world to enter this Church, and to receive the =
Lord worthily." (Coronis LV.) "The invitation or calling is universal." (T.=
 C. R. 358.)  </p><p></p><div align=3D"Right">223</div><hr><p>

 Men on this earth, and on all earths, are invited to receive the Lord in H=
is Second Coming. And they accept the call when the Lord Jesus Christ is ac=
knowledged as the only God and Savior, and when the Commandments are obeyed=
 as laws of spiritual life; for when they are merely obeyed as moral laws, =
there is in them no conjunction with God.</p><p>Invitation on the Part of M=
an.</p><p>That man should open the door, and invite the Lord to enter, but =
that he is in full freedom to invite or reject, Revelation teaches from beg=
inning to end; and the same principle is illustrated in the laws of nature;=
 for every universal law of heaven makes its appearance in some form in nat=
ure. Let us consider an example in the human body. In the chapter on the "P=
leura" in the Animal Kingdom (II, 425, note x), it is stated that "the bloo=
d is not intruded into the viscera or the muscles by the power of the aorta=
; but it is invited from the bed of the aorta, according to the need of eac=
h particular viscus." That is, the aorta or great artery, through which the=
 heart sends its blood to all parts of the body, does not force its blood u=
pon a viscus or muscle, but leaves the latter free to invite or select the =
kind or quality of blood it needs. "For each member demands more or less, a=
ccording to the intensity of its action, and one quality or another accordi=
ng to the nature and mode of its operation, or according to the character o=
f its function." (Ibid.)</p><p>In order to provide for a principle of free =
choice or invitation, avoiding compulsion, the arterial branches to the var=
ious organs depart from the aorta at right angles. Observing the operation =
of the same law in all nature, as in the human body, Swedenborg used the wo=
rd "invitation" to embody it. It was afterwards revealed to him as a law of=
 the spiritual world, and of the spiritual life of man. God acts or inflows=
, and man, as of himself, having the eternal gift of freedom, invites and r=
eceives, or rejects.  </p><p></p><div align=3D"Right">224</div><hr><p>

 It is a reacting with or reacting against. Hence we read that "the good cl=
ear the way and open the door, and also invite God to enter" (T. C. R. 366)=
; even as is said in the Book of Revelation: "If any man hear my voice, and=
 open the door, I will come in to him, and sup with him, and he with me. (3=
:20.) And the preceding verse points out that man invites and opens the doo=
r by repentance. (See A. R. 216-219 and A. E. 247-252.)</p><p>God compels n=
o man. Man may invite God, if he will, and this even in hell itself.</p><p>=
Suicide.</p><p>The relative frequency of the suicidal act suggests inquiry =
into its cause, and at the same time into the lot of suicides after death. =
It is from the evil in the other world who wish to destroy man, inspired by=
 a spirit of hatred and murder. They are such as formerly destroyed whole a=
rmies. (Isaiah 37:36. A. C. 5717; S. D. 1783.) These are now under restrain=
t, but they are still able to drive individuals to self-slaughter, such as =
indulge much in anxieties with but little effort at self-control. These mur=
derous spirits "flow into the chambers of the brain, inducing melancholy ev=
en to despair," impelling a man to destroy himself. (S. D. 1336, 1783.) It =
is revealed that the endeavor of Providence is to deter man from entering i=
nto the extreme state of despair, since that state, caused by evil spirits =
(A. C. 5246), is attended with a loss of freedom and rationality; and if th=
is became general, the human race would perish. But it cannot be prevented =
with some, and we are told why it is then allowed. It is because "it is bet=
ter that he should be permitted to perish as to his body than as to his sou=
l; ... for unless such a one perished bodily in this manner, by insanity an=
d suicide, he could not well be prevented from perishing to eternity. (S. D=
. 1783.) But it is of Divine order that man should live, and continue his a=
ppointed work in the world.  </p><p></p><div align=3D"Right">225</div><hr><=

 Hence when evil spirits infuse despair, driving to self-destruction, the L=
ord through angels inspires hope and consolation (A. C. 2338, 8165, 8567) l=
eading to the desired end, which is that man may live out the period allott=
ed to preparation for the life after death.</p><p>The Lot of Suicides after=
 Death.</p><p>We are told of "a certain one who in the life of the body had=
 been reduced by melancholy to despair, until, being instigated by diabolic=
al spirits, he destroyed himself by thrusting a knife into his body. This s=
pirit came to me complaining that he was miserably treated by evil spirits,=
 saying that he was amongst furies, who continually harassed him.... He was=
 seen by me, holding a knife in his hand, as though he would plunge it into=
 his breast, with which knife he labored very hard, wishing to cast it from=
 him, but in vain." (S. D. 1336.) It is then added that "whatever happens i=
n the last hour of death remains a long time before vanishing away." (S. D.=
 1337.) It is thus made plain that one's condition is not improved by such =
a sudden and violent transfer from the one world to the other; and if impro=
vement should come, it will only be after much tribulation and delay, even =
as it is in corresponding conditions of this world.</p><p>The state which l=
eads to suicide may be met partly by medicines or other natural agencies, b=
ut only in part. As in all chronic conditions, the cooperation and voluntar=
y effort of the individual himself is needed--voluntary effort from a moral=
 and spiritual ground, and this continuing for a considerable length of tim=
e. A chronic or a more or less confirmed condition of body or mind is not r=
emoved in a moment. There is no such thing as instantaneous regeneration, o=
n either the physical or spiritual plane of life. The true and sure remedy =
is in a continuous battle, day after day, and year after year, in doing con=
tinuously what we are so frequently taught to do in the Heavenly Doctrine, =
namely, shunning evils as sins against God.  </p><p></p><div align=3D"Right=

is meant, and not an ark or chest. </p><p>In history and in Scripture the i=
ndications afforded above are fully confirmed. Among the Romans the sacrari=
um was a place for prayer, an oratory, a private chapel. The adytum was the=
 inmost part of a temple, the sanctuary into which none but priests could e=
nter; a secret place or chamber; a private chamber, a sanctum. The sanctuar=
y was the inmost of the tabernacle and temple, called the holy of holies, i=
n which was kept the ark of the covenant. It is well known that the holy of=
 holies was a sacred enclosure, into which the high priest alone could ente=
r. But since the internal sense has been revealed, the Word is no longer to=
 be kept in a secret chamber, but exposed to view. It is so in heaven. "The=
 Word in the adyta of the temples in the spiritual world shines before the =
eyes of the angels as a great star." (T. C. R. 209.) In this and other numb=
ers a single copy of the Word is indicated.  </p><p></p><div align=3D"Right=

</p><p>Hence, instead of an ark or chest, a church with us should contain, =
where practicable, a sacrarium or sanctuary for the Word. An altar could oc=
cupy in it a central position, and upon it the Word would be lying in full =
view of the people. To complete the form of an enclosure, something like a =
rood screen (with a gate) could be used, through which the altar with the W=

/p><p>Angels present with man defend him from the assaults of evil spirits.=
 "They even defend his falsities and evils." (A. C. 761.) This teaching is =
predicated of a man in spiritual temptations, in whom there is some good of=
 life from the Lord; and justice requires that even his falsities and evils=
 should be defended against the malignant assaults of evil spirits, who acc=
use and condemn.</p><p>It is also said that the angels defend the evils of =
man because they love him and desire his salvation. In this they are inspir=
ed by the Lord, whose love is infinite. For even falsities and evils are ma=
de of use in His work of salvation.</p><p>Not only in the spiritual world, =
but also in the natural, the tendency exists to punish men beyond their des=
erts; and it is also known that a love of justice and fair play will be aro=
used, causing a man to defend even the evils of another, when it is seen th=

is then, in the mercy of the Lord, some one provided to help and defend. Fo=

ded, defend even the falsities and evils of man, "he would succumb." This l=

 There is much of punishment in the world beyond the limits and bounds of j=
ustice. We see it in politics, business, in social and family life--everywh=
ere. Were it not for the Divine protection, men would destroy one another u=
ntil none would be left.</p><p>Evil of Sin and Evil Not of Sin.</p><p>There=
 is evil which is at the same time sin, and there is evil which has not yet=
 become sin. Evil which is not sin is evil in the will which has not been c=
onfirmed in the understanding. That which is so confirmed is sin, even if i=
t has not descended into act; for spiritually the intention is the act. The=
 evil which is not sin is evil in the will, hereditary in its origin, or th=
at which has gone forth from hereditary evil unconsciously into act, as wit=
h children and all who are in the innocence of ignorance. The Lord spake of=
 these two kinds of evil to the Pharisees, who said, "Are we blind also? Je=
sus said, If ye were blind, ye should have no sin; but now ye say, We see; =
therefore your sin remaineth." (John 9:40, 41. See A. C. 9069.) If they had=
 been ignorant like children, or like many among the gentiles, they would h=
ave no sin; but since they were in evils confirmed by falsities in the unde=
rstanding, and had acted accordingly, they were sinners against God, as sho=
wn in their confirmed denial of the Messiah who had come from heaven. The L=
ord Himself was in evil without sin. (See NEW CHURCH LIFE for December, 192=
2, p. 673.) It was the inclination to evil inherited from the mother, and t=
hrough her from the Jewish nation, but which was never ultimated by Him in =
thought or dead. It appeared in His thought, that He might see it, fight ag=
ainst it, and overcome it. Without this there could have been no redemption=
. No man could have been saved.</p><p>The conclusion is manifest. Evil shou=
ld not be permitted to enter the thought and abide there. It should be resi=
sted as soon as it appears.  </p><p></p><div align=3D"Right">229</div><hr><=

</p><p>Further Concerning the Two Kinds of Evil.</p><p>The following extrac=
ts, and their context not copied here, together with the other references g=
iven, will exhibit to the reader a clearer view of what is meant by the evi=
ls of sin and the evils not of sin.</p><p>"The evils which proceed solely f=
rom the will, thus not from previous thought, are such as man is inclined t=
o hereditarily, or from some former action thence; these are not imputed to=
 him unless he has confirmed them in his intellectual part." (A. C. 9009.)<=
/p><p>"Evil from the voluntary, and not at the same time from the intellect=
ual part, does not condemn, for the man does not see it, and so does not co=
nsider whether it be evil; ... but to see and understand that a thing is ev=
il, and still to do it, makes a man guilty." (A. C. 9069, 9075, 9132.)</p><=
p>"It appears as if evils themselves destroy man's spiritual life, but they=
 do not of themselves destroy it, but by means of falsities. The reason is,=
 that evils without falsities do not enter into the thought, for they are o=
f the will only, and not at the same time of the thought, and those things =
which are of the will, and not at the same time of the thought, cannot dest=
roy.... But when he confirms evils in his thought, then they destroy." (A. =
E. 1109. See in full D. P. 318, 319.)</p><p>Hence it is clear that not evil=
 alone, nor falsity alone, causes sin to be sin, but the two together,--the=
 conjunction of evil and falsity. This is what condemns man, and makes hell=
. It is similar with good and truth. Good alone does not save, nor truth al=
one, but the two together, that is, the marriage of good and truth. Good wi=
thout truth will save man eventually if he persists in it, as we see in the=
 case of those who are in the lower earth, and those in a corresponding sta=
te in this world. When truth is received and conjoined with good, man then =
becomes an angel of heaven. But truth alone can never save.  </p><p></p><di=

</p><p>No Predestination to Hell.</p><p>There is such a thing as predestina=
tion when rightly understood, and a right understanding is now attainable. =
For the new Revelation teaches that "no one is ever predestined to hell, bu=
t all to eternal life." (A. C. 6488; D. P. 322.) And "any predestination ex=
cept to heaven is contrary to the Divine Love ... and to the Divine Wisdom.=
" (D. P. 330.) And so it is not surprising that strong language should be u=
sed respecting it in the Writings. It is called "a cruel heresy." (D. P. 33=
2.) It is "an enormous birth." (B. E. 64.) It is "damnable and cruel,... an=
d the faith of the New Church abhors it as a monster." (B. E. 66.) "Those a=
re delirious ... who teach it." (T. C. R. 56.) It is "detestable." (T. C. R=
. 485.) "It is not only an insane heresy, but also a cruel heresy. (T. C. R=
. 487.) It is "a monstrous faith, that God predestines men to hell." (T. C.=
 R. 488.) "By it religion is abolished." (Coronis XLVI.) On the other hand,=
 we are given the doctrine of Love and Mercy, that "it is of the Divine Pro=
vidence that every man can be saved, and they are saved who acknowledge God=
 and live well; and man himself is in fault if he is not saved." (D. P. 322=
.) For "the Lord wills the salvation of all, and the damnation of no one." =
(H. H. 524; A. C. 1735; D. L. W. 37; and elsewhere.)</p><p>The will of the =
Lord, and the Divine endeavor to save all, is seen in the fact that all are=
 drawn to heaven, and no one is ever shut out or forbidden to enter. It fre=
quently happens that evil spirits are elevated out of hell even into heaven=
. For the Lord has said, "I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw al=
l men unto me." (John 12:32.) This drawing of the Divine Love is felt every=
where, even in hell, causing at times a desire of evil spirits to depart fr=
om hell and enter into heaven. This is permitted them, but as the sphere of=
 heaven is so opposed, so hostile, to their life's love, they quickly depar=
t, desiring nothing so much as to get away from heaven.  </p><p></p><div al=

 Every man is left in freedom to choose his own lot, his own society, after=
 death. In this is confirmed the truth that all are predestined to heaven, =
and no one to hell.</p><p>Predestination and Doubt.</p><p>To be in doubt is=
 to hesitate, to be uncertain as to the truth or falsity of any given propo=
sition, to be undecided what to believe or accept. It is an unhappy state o=
f mind, and is frequently attended with much mental suffering and torment. =
It is, in fact an accompaniment of what the Doctrines call spiritual tempta=
tion. The subject of predestination provides a striking example of the seri=
ous nature of doubt. This heresy is so insidious and persuasive that some i=
n the New Church, even among the young people, are troubled and infested by=
 it, and are disposed to entertain doubts as to the Providence of the Lord =
in the salvation of man. It is a form of mental disease, coming from the sp=
iritual world, from evil spirits, to torment and sicken the hearts of men. =
But, in the mercy of the Lord, there is a remedy at hand, even though the c=
urative process is slow, and gradual in its effects. Let anyone disturbed a=
ccept the truth of Revelation literally when it is said that there is no pr=
edestination except to heaven; then do not admit or dwell upon a doubt. Fig=
ht it on its approach with prayer for help.</p><p>Let us see what the teach=
ing is concerning the danger attendant on doubt. "Once, when I was thinking=
 about the influx of life from the Lord, and was revolving on some doubts, =
it flowed in from heaven that no attention should be paid to a thousand obj=
ections and reasonings from fallacies." (A. C. 6469.) For "the mind cannot =
be admitted into wisdom until it is free from doubt." (A. C. 2718; S. D. 25=
46, 3667.) It is thus made clear that spiritual advancement is hindered in =
states of doubt, for the power of hell is operating to cause a turning of t=
he face away from heaven and the Lord.  </p><p></p><div align=3D"Right">232=

</p><p>Resuscitation at Death.</p><p>Concerning resuscitation when the body=
 dies, we learn that "it appears as if a man were dead when respiration cea=
ses; still he is not dead until the motion of the heart ceases, which usual=
ly takes place afterwards.... This is evident from the life of infants in t=
he womb, also from the state of adults in swoons and suffocations, in which=
 the heart performs its systolic and diastolic motions while the lungs are =
at rest; yet the man lives, although without sensation or motion.... The se=
paration of the spirit from the body generally takes place on the second da=
y after the last agony." (D. Wis. VII(4). See also A. C. 168-189, 314-319; =
H. H. 445-448.)</p><p>In several of the numbers we are told of a tacit or s=
ilent beating of the heart after respiration ceases. Something of this has =
been observed in certain of the lower animals, as in the case of frogs. Per=
haps there is an approximation to it in all animals, including man; that is=
, a silent beating of the heart continuing after apparent death.</p><p>We a=
re informed also of "an aromatic odor, like that of an embalmed corpse, bei=
ng perceived ... when celestial angels are present" with the dying. (A. C. =
175, 1518; H. H. 449; D. Min. 4702.) What has been called the "odor of sanc=
tity" deserves investigation in this connection.</p><p>Another important el=
ement appears. Swedenborg says: "I have heard from heaven that some who die=
, when they lie upon the bier, before they are resuscitated, think even in =
their cold body, nor do they know otherwise than that they still live, but =
with the difference that they cannot move any material particle which is pr=
oper to the body." (H. H. 433.) In this, as well as in other numbers, the q=
uestion is raised as to the proper treatment of the body for at least two d=
ays after apparent death. Should the body suffer any violence at this time?=

</p><p>XXXVI</p><p>Superstition.</p><p>Historically, superstition was the p=
ractice of observing and interpreting signs and wonders by the ancient nati=
ons, even down to the present time, and taking various forms. This habit ap=
pears absurd to the modern student, but to nations like the Greek and Roman=
 it was serious and sincere; for to them it involved obedience to the will =
of the gods, as made manifest by the flight of birds, the appearance of the=
 entrails of a slaughtered animal, or by other omens or portents which call=
ed for faith and obedience.</p><p>Superstition is now defined to be "an exc=
essive reverence for that which is unknown or mysterious." As stated in the=
 Writings, it is with those who are in externals without an internal, "whos=
e religion is not a religion, but a superstition, and whose worship is idol=
atrous." (Coronis 51; T. C. R. 821.) Being idolatrous, it is a worship of t=
he external, in which there is dense ignorance of spiritual things, no know=
ledge of the true God, and a closing of the internal to heaven; but which m=
ay be opened by the truths of revelation and repentance of life.</p><p>In t=
he Ancient Church, representatives were multiplied. At first there was in t=
hem a true knowledge of God and a true worship of Him, together with a life=
 of charity. But this state came to an end, and men began to worship the re=
presentatives themselves, with no thought or knowledge of any internal. The=
 Jewish Church was in this state of religious superstition,--the blind wors=
hip of the external; and a similar condition spread far and wide over the a=
ncient world, and finally took possession of the Christian Church itself in=
 its worship of images; and a more interior form of idolatry or superstitio=
n followed in the worship of a false God, an invisible God, which is a most=
 interior form of idolatry, the worst kind of a blind superstition.  </p><p=

</p><p>Hence, in the decline of the church, superstition takes the place of=
 faith, charity departs, and a malignant god is worshipped in the form of s=
ome evil spirit from hell. (A. C. 4444:4; S. D. 5460 1/2.)</p><p>Separation=
 From the World.</p><p>The church is the Lord's kingdom on earth. It is in =
the world, but not of the world; even as the Lord said, "My kingdom is not =
of this world." (John 18:36.) The men of the church were to live a life, wh=
ile in the world, that was to be distinct and separate from the world. What=
 was it in the world from which the church should separate itself? The Lord=
 made this clear in His prayer to the Father: "I pray not that Thou shoulde=
st take them out of the world, but that Thou shouldest keep them from evil.=
" (John 17:15.) It was not the world, but the evil of the world, from which=
 the men of the church should separate themselves. The words had applicatio=
n to the apostles, and to the early Christian Church, and in a broad sense =
to the church in all time.</p><p>The principle of asceticism was already ac=
tive in the Eastern countries, and the early Church was in danger of an ext=
reme application of the teaching concerning the necessity of a separation f=
rom the world. The danger was foreseen, and the Church was warned. But the =
final surrender came, and a complete separation from the life of the world =
is a fact in the history of the Christian Church which has continued to exi=
st in some form even to the present time. And in the Heavenly Doctrine the =
New Church itself is warned of the danger.</p><p>We are told that Lot sitti=
ng at the gate of Sodom "signifies to be indeed among the evil, but still t=
o be separate from them,... not as to civil society, but as to spiritual li=
fe." (A. C. 2324.) Civil life is the life of the state, but spiritual life =
is the life of the church. The men of the church are to live a life separat=
e and distinct from the evils and falsities of a perverted church, but are =
to join with other men in the active uses of the world.  </p><p></p><div al=

 "I pray not that Thou shouldest take them out of the world, but that Thou =
shouldest keep them from evil."</p><p>No Spiritual Birth Without Temptation=
.</p><p>As there is no natural birth without trial, pain, distress, so ther=
e is no spiritual birth without the bitterness of temptation, continuous wi=
th brief intervals from infancy to the end of life, and for a period after =
death. And even a mind spiritually gifted may not always realize the early =
beginning and late ending of that which in the new Revelation is called "te=
mptation,"--a period having its inception in childhood, and not terminating=
 until after a sojourn in the world of spirits. It is true that children do=
 not experience what is properly called temptation; but without some beginn=
ings of it in childhood there will be none in later life; and without some =
continuance of it for a period after death there will be no passage onward =
into heaven.</p><p>Those who are ignorant of what temptation is, and what i=
t accomplishes, suppose that a man can be regenerated without temptation, o=
r that one temptation is sufficient for spiritual life. This ignorance prev=
ails where the Heavenly Doctrine is unknown, where it is unknown that regen=
eration is not only a new birth, but also a new growth,--a new life followi=
ng a new growth, as the growth of the natural body follows birth into the n=
atural world.</p><p>The old life must die, that man may live a new life as =
a spiritual man in a spiritual world. But the natural man resists the entra=
nce of the new life, and the result is conflict, or what is called in the W=
ritings "temptation combat." It is a battle for life,--a battle between the=
 spiritual and the natural man,--and it does not cease until one or the oth=
er is subdued. But the Divine promise is spoken, "Be thou faithful unto dea=
th, and I will give thee a crown of life." (Revelation 2:10.)  </p><p></p><=

</p><p>Conscience.</p><p>It is generally known that there is a conscience, =
but it is hardly known what it is. It remained for the new Revelation to te=
ll us what conscience is. It is thought to be a kind of mental disturbance =
or pain, joined with regret for something that has been done, causing the l=
oss or decline of one's reputation before the world. Evil spirits have a li=
ke disturbance from a like cause, but they have no conscience. There is no =
conscience in hell. That which appears like conscience there arises from fe=
ar of punishment. For we read that fear alone restrains the infernals. (A. =
C. 7280, 7788.) Their fear looks like conscience, but it is good-will to se=
lf and not to the neighbor, which is the opposite of a conscience. For with=
 the evil in hell, and in large part with men in the world, there is no rep=
entance, no sorrow and regret for evil willed or done to another. It is mer=
ely sorrow and regret for the punishment which follows the doing of evil. W=
here this kind of repentance is wanting, there is no conscience.</p><p>A tr=
ue conscience is formed in man by the truths of doctrine from the Word, rec=
eived into the understanding and loved for their own sake. When so loved, a=
 man lives according to them, and such a life is a life of true religion; b=
ut those who are in truths alone, and not in a life according to them, have=
 no conscience.</p><p>A prayer for a true conscience is a prayer for a new =
will and a new understanding, as expressed in the words of the Psalm (51:10=
): "Create in me a clean heart, O God; and make new a firm spirit within me=

 The Lord God, Infinite and Uncreate, accommodates Himself by coming into t=
he world and teaching men the way to Himself. The way to Himself is the tru=
th of His Word, and there is no other way to Him. This is the Divine purpos=
e in the Divine accommodation. That this may be effected, the Lord appears =
to man, and talks to him as a parent to his children in language which they=
 can understand and apply, and thus may walk in the way to heaven. This wor=
k could not be accomplished unless the Lord should appear as a Divine Man i=
n heaven and on earth. This does not mean that the Infinite Itself becomes =
finite, but that it accommodates Itself to what is finite, and appears as i=
f it were finite. If this Divine Man were not so, God would forever remain =
invisible. could never know God, and God could never draw near to him. Ther=
e could be no redemption, no salvation, no eternal life: Creation itself wo=
uld be but an empty word.</p><p>In order that heaven may be formed as the e=
ternal abode of men, it is necessary that the Lord should make Himself pres=
ent with angels in heaven, and with men in the world, as the Creator and Pr=
eserver; and this He becomes when His Human is made Divine. Such is the Div=
ine accommodation. (See A. C. 5337, 8920-8922; T. C. R. 370.)</p><p>This do=
ctrine is also presented in another form as follows: "The presence of the L=
ord with man is adjunction, and thus conjunction by contiguity, and this co=
ntiguity is nearer and fuller as man loves the Lord, that is, keeps His com=
mandments." (A. R. 55.) Conjunction by contiguity is the Lord accommodating=
 Himself, rendering conjunction possible with finite man.</p><p>The Discipl=
e Whom Jesus Loved.</p><p>It is said of John that he was the disciple whom =
Jesus loved. (John 13:23; 19:26; 21:7, 20.) This is not said of any other d=
isciple, and it gives John a distinguished and leading place.  </p><p></p><=

 It is commonly thought that Peter was the first of the Apostles, and there=
 are some passages that seem to justify such a belief, as where the Lord sa=
id, "Thou art Peter; and upon this rock I will build my church; and the gat=
es of hell shall not prevail against it." (Matthew 16:18.) But we are told =
that Peter was not the first, because he represented faith, "whereas John w=
as the first because he represented the good of charity." (A. E. 229:3. See=
 also A. C. 6073:3, 9824:4, 10087:4.)</p><p>Now because John represented th=
e good of charity, or the good of use (A. C. 7038:3), he also represented t=
he New Church, in which charity or use was to be the first of the church. H=
ence we are told that the Lord loves the New Church more than the preceding=
 Churches (A. R. 879); and this is given as the reason why John is called t=
he beloved disciple, the first of the twelve apostles.</p><p>John is variou=
sly represented, but the representations are essentially one. He is the goo=
d of charity, good works, uses, the good of life, good in act, the good of =
love to the Lord. Finally, he is doctrine concerning the Lord, or the Lord =
Himself as to doctrine; this he is called when he speaks to the seven churc=
hes. "John to the seven churches which are in Asia." (Revelation 1:4.) Doct=
rine concerning the Lord is the Divine Doctrine as given in the Writings of=
 the New Church, given to be read, to be heard, and to be kept by all who a=
re to be of that Church. For it is said, "Blessed is he that readeth, and t=
hey that hear the words of this prophecy, and keep the things that are writ=
ten therein; for the time is at hand." (Revelation 1:3.) The time is the ti=
me of the Second Coming, and John is the prophet of that coming. "Blessed i=
s he that readeth." Amen.  </p><p></p><div align=3D"Right">239</div><hr><p>
