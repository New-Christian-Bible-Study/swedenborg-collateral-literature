PREFACE.

The Author's first intention was merely to collect together in a convenient form the scattered passages 
referring to Deuteronomy in the theological works of Emanuel Swedenborg; but it has been found 
necessary, for the sake of unity and completeness, to add much that is original. In this the Author has 
endeavoured, on the principles laid down by Swedenborg, to translate the text concisely from the 
language of historical narrative into that of the inner sense dealing with man's regeneration, and the 
translation is of course open to criticism and correction by all who are acquainted with the 
correspondence between the things in the natural material world and those in the inner or mental and 
spiritual world as unfolded in the New Church. The Indexes of Swedenborg's two great theological 
works—the "Arcana Coelestia" and the "Apocalypse Explained"—have been used as a glossary in 
making the translation, and frequent references are given to these works under their initial letters, A. C.
and A.E.

It is well known from the New Church writings that besides the inner sense, dealing with the 
regeneration of the individual soul, there is in the inspired Word another sense which treats of the 
regeneration of the human race as a whole, and an inmost sense describing the conflict between Divine 
perfection and human frailty in the Humanity of the Lord. In the following pages the endeavour is 
made to gain some insight into the first alone.

Those readers who are unacquainted with the doctrines of the New Church and desire the fullest 
information are referred to Swedenborg's work entitled the "True Christian Religion." It may be useful 
here to mention, however, that the cardinal doctrine of the New Church is—That there is but One God 
in one Divine Person, whose character is revealed in the Lord Jesus Christ; and only one road to eternal
happiness, namely, the reformation of the character according to His pattern and commandments.

Deuteronomy Chapter 1

Verses 1-8. A General Summary.
Verses 9-18. The selection of right principles in the mind.
Verses 19-21. Invitation to enter upon the heavenly life.
Verses 22-25. A search into what constitutes the heavenly life.
Verses 26-40. The unwillingness of the unregenerate heart to enter upon it.
Verses 41-46. The attempt to do so from selfhood and defeat in temptation. 

1. These be the words which Moses 

1. THESE are the instructions given by Divine truth 

spoke to all Israel on this side Jordan
in the wilderness, in the plain over 
against the Red sea, between Paran, 
and Tophel, and Laban, and 
Hazeroth, and Dizahab. 

2.

(There are eleven days' journey from
Horeb by the way of mount Seir to 
Kadeshbarnea.) 

for all those who are regenerating before they have
entered into the heavenly state, and while the soul 
still suffers from a defect of true spiritual life, and 
is in externals, though in sound doctrine after it 
has been delivered from the falses of evil (Red 
Sea) by the power of the Lord, and entered into the
first state of spiritual love (or the love of genuine 
truth) after victory in temptation (Paran), and is in 
a state midway between worldly and heavenly 
affections and thoughts. (See AC 1676.) [Note.—
The meaning of some of the proper names in this 
verse is obscure as they do not occur elsewhere; it 
must be gathered from the context. The person 
Laban indicates the good in which man is held 
while worldly and heavenly affections are both 
entertained by him (AC 4063, 4145).]

2. This state, in which the soul is in truth from the 

Divine law, is the one immediately preceding the 
complete state of the affection of interior or 
rational truth, which is approached by the exercise 
of truth from love. [Note.—The number eleven 
signifies a condition just preceding the complete 
state denoted by the number twelve.]

3. And it came to pass in the fortieth 
year, in the eleventh month, on the 
first day of the month, that Moses 
spoke to the children of Israel, 
according to all that the LORD had 
given him in commandment to them;

3.

It comes to pass in this state, when the period of 
temptations which precedes the commencement of
the regenerate life is nearly completed [Note.—
The number forty signifies temptations. (See AC 
index, "Numbers.")], and when a new order of 
things is being planted in the soul, that the minds 
of those regenerating receive these instructions by 
means of Divine truth from the Lord out of 
heaven.

4. After he had slain Sihon the king of 
the Amorites, which dwelt in 
Heshbon, and Og the king of 
Bashan, which dwelt at Astaroth in 
Edrei: 

5. On this side Jordan, in the land of 
Moab, began Moses to declare this 
law, saying, 

6. The LORD our God spoke to us in 
Horeb, saying, You have dwelt long 
enough in this mount: 

7. Turn you, and take your journey, and
go to the mount of the Amorites, and
to all the places near thereunto, in 
the plain, in the hills, and in the vale,
and in the south, and by the sea side, 
to the land of the Canaanites, and to 
Lebanon, to the great river, the river 
Euphrates. 

4. After that the Lord has destroyed the love of self, 
the chief of evils which dwell in the natural 
affections, as far as it opposes the commencement 
of the regenerate life, and the love of the world 
which bears rule in the unregenerate mind and has 
its seat in the fallacies and pleasures of the senses.

5. Before the soul has entered upon the truly spiritual

life, while it is yet in external things, it begins to 
receive this mandate by perception derived from 
the Word, namely:—

6. That the Divine goodness and truth of the Lord 

teach, when the soul receives the true doctrine of 
the Church from heaven, that it must not remain in
a state in which the acquisition of knowledges has 
been accounted the chief thing in the spiritual life.

7. And that the state of the mind must now be 

inverted, and progression made in the heavenly 
life, it is necessary to explore the evils existing in 
the mind from self-love, and its kindred evils, and 
that the new regenerate principles received from 
the Lord must pervade all things of doctrine, and 
all things of life, the conduct of external business, 
and the way in which truth is to be received, and 
the acquisition of knowledges, and the whole 
extension of the Church in things rational and in 
all that pertains to contemplation and thought. 
[Note.—"The reason why the river is twice 
mentioned, namely, the great river, the river 
Euphrates, is, because by the great river is 
signified the influx of things spiritual into things 
rational, and by the river Euphrates the influx of 
things rational into things natural, thus by both is 
signified the influx of things spiritual by the 
rational principle into things natural" (AE 569).]

5

8. Behold, I have set the land before 
you: go in and possess the land 
which the LORD swore to your 
fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, 
to give to them and to their seed after
them. 

8.

It is perceived that the Lord has placed the 
blessings of the heavenly life within reach of the 
soul that is regenerating. It is for man himself to 
work out his salvation, and to appropriate in his 
measure what has been provided by the Lord when
He glorified His Divine Humanity (the Lord Jesus 
Christ) both as to the celestial, spiritual, and 
natural principles, and which is promised to those 
who follow Him in the regeneration (AE 768). 
[Note.—For those who are unacquainted with the 
writings of Swedenborg it may be mentioned that 
the internal or spiritual meaning of the histories of 
Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob as referring to the 
glorification of the Lord when incarnate on earth is
elaborately unfolded in the "Arcana Coelestia.''] 

9. And I spoke to you at that time, 
saying, I am not able to bear you 
myself alone: 

10. The LORD your God has multiplied 
you, and, behold, you are this day as 
the stars of heaven for multitude. 

9. And it is also perceived in that state that it is not 

sufficient for the regenerating soul to be under the 
guidance of the Divine truths proceeding 
immediately from the Word alone.

10. The goodness and truth of the Lord have filled the 
mind with new perceptions and thoughts, and 
already in this state there is a plenitude of truths in 
the soul.

11. (The LORD God of your fathers 

11. And the Lord, who is Father of all the regenerate, 

make you a thousand times so many 
more as you are, and bless you, as he
has promised you!) 

will increase these truths more and more 
indefinitely, and bless the spiritual life therewith as
promised in the Word (AC 2575).

12. How can I myself alone bear your 
cumbrance, and your burden, and 
your strife? 

13. Take you wise men, and 

understanding, and known among 
your tribes, and I will make them 
rulers over you. 

14. And you answered me, and said, The
thing which you have spoken is good
for us to do. 

12. All the difficulties and doubts as to the right 

course of action in external things and disputes as 
to truth which now arise in the soul cannot be 
always determined by the direct application of the 
Divine Word.

13. The soul must select from the faculties of the mind
such as conduce to wisdom and intelligence in 
both the rational and natural faculties, and the 
external life must be governed by them under 
Divine truth. [N.B.— "Knowing or known among 
your tribes"—wisdom and intelligence brought 
down to the natural principle (AC 5287).]

14. And it is perceived throughout the whole mind that

this is a wise course.

6

15. So I took the chief of your tribes, 
wise men, and known, and made 
them heads over you, captains over 
thousands, and captains over 
hundreds, and captains over fifties, 
and captains over tens, and officers 
among your tribes. 

16. And I charged your judges at that 
time, saying, Hear the causes 
between your brethren, and judge 
righteously between every man and 
his brother, and the stranger that is 
with him. 

15. Thus by influx from Divine truth the best 

principles are selected to conduce to true wisdom 
and rationality and made rulers over the mind, 
primary truths in successive order from the truth 
proceeding immediately from the Divine to those 
communicating with the most external things. 
[Note.— This subject will be found more 
particularly explained in the explanation of 
Exodus 18:17-23 in the "Arcana Coelestia," and 
particularly in Nos. AC 8712-8717, etc.]

16. And in this state these primary truths receive 
illustration from the Divine truth of the Word, 
which gives them a just understanding of the 
subordinate goods in the mind, and enables them 
to determine rightly what is really good and true 
and what is in accordance with those principles in 
natural things.

17. You shall not respect persons in 

17. No worldly end is to be had in view in deciding on

judgement; but you shall hear the 
small as well as the great; you shall 
not be afraid of the face of man; for 
the judgement is God's: and the 
cause that is too hard for you, bring 
it to me, and I will hear it. 

18. And I commanded you at that time 
all the things which you should do. 

the best course. Those which would be 
disadvantageous from a worldly point of view 
must be considered equally with those which 
would be advantageous, nor must the mind be 
careful about the result in this world, for all things 
are overruled by the Lord's Divine Providence; and
if the thing is too hard to be decided by a man's 
own rationality, it must be brought to the truth 
flowing immediately from the Divine principle, 
and wisdom will be given.

18. Thus was a state induced in which all things in the 
mind were under the influence and government of 
Divine truth from the Word.
[Note (verses 9-18).—If a man had simply to 
follow certain dictates given him from the Word, 
and found them ready applied to every difficulty 
arising in life, he would be as far as spiritual 
thought is concerned a mere machine. It is by 
having apparently to decide for himself and to 
work out difficulties by his own reasoning powers,
with the Divine truths of the Word as an ultimate 
Court of Appeal, that he attains true understanding 
in spiritual things.]

7

19. And when we departed from Horeb, 

19. And when the soul left the state in which it had 

we went through all that great and 
terrible wilderness, which you saw 
by the way of the mountain of the 
Amorites, as the LORD our God 
commanded us; and we came to 
Kadeshbarnea. 

20. And I said to you, You are come to 

the mountain of the Amorites, which 
the LORD our God does give to us. 

21. Behold, the LORD your God has set 
the land before you: go up and 
possess it, as the LORD God of your
fathers has said to you; fear not, 
neither be discouraged. 

been instructed in truths from the Word, it passed 
through temptations in which, the mind appeared 
deprived of all joy and happiness, and was 
oppressed by evils and falses. These are perceived 
to be in the soul when it is in a state of self-love, 
and for this reason it is remitted into this state by 
the Lord, after which the regenerating soul comes 
into the affection of interior or rational truth 
(Kadesh-barnea).

20. And the soul is instructed by Divine truth that it is 
of itself in a state of self-love, and that it is able to 
overcome it by means of good and truth from the 
Lord.

21. It is perceived that the Divine Love and Wisdom 

(the God of those regenerating) provide 
opportunities for them to enter into the heavenly 
state. The soul must make use of them and strive 
to obtain it, according to the perception given to 
those who are in good from the Divine Love and 
Wisdom; it must not doubt the possibility of 
overcoming evil or be discouraged by it. [Note.—
It is the doctrine of the New Church that the Lord 
Jesus Christ is the embodiment of the Divine Love
and Wisdom; so that whether we say the Lord 
Jesus Christ is the God of those regenerating or the
Divine Love and Wisdom, it is the same thing.]

22. And you came near to me every one 
of you, and said, We will send men 
before us, and they shall search us 
out the land, and bring us word again
by what way we must go up, and 
into what cities we shall come. 

22. And the whole soul in such a state earnestly 

consults the Divine truths of the Word, and desires 
to direct all its powers to inquire into what 
constitutes the heavenly life, that the soul may 
know how to attain it and what doctrines are 
conducive thereto.

23. And the saying pleased me well: and

23. And this desire is approved by the conscience 

I took twelve men of you, one of a 
tribe: 

24. And they turned and went up into the
mountain, and came to the valley of 
Eshcol, and searched it out. 

instructed by Divine truth; and it selects from the 
faculties of the mind every thought and volition 
which is suitable for the purpose.

24. And they direct the thoughts within towards the 

interiors of the mind and its motives, and all things
derived from them and towards the doctrines of 
the Church which produce good and search them 
out.

8

25. And they took of the fruit of the land
in their hands, and brought it down 
to us, and brought us word again, 
and said, It is a good land which the 
LORD our God does give us. 

25. And they examine into the results of those 

principles in the life, and by their means the soul is
illustrated as to these things, and perceives that it 
is being conducted by the goodness and wisdom of
the Lord to such states as produce real happiness.

26. Notwithstanding you would not go 

26. But the evil will of the proprium does not relish or 

up, but rebelled against the 
commandment of the LORD your 
God: 

desire to be elevated to these heavenly states, but 
rebels against the perception given through the 
understanding by the goodness and wisdom of the 
Lord.

27. And you murmured in your tents, 

27. And produces discontent in the inmost recesses of 

and said, Because the LORD hated 
us, he has brought us forth out of the 
land of Egypt, to deliver us into the 
hand of the Amorites, to destroy us. 

28. Whither shall we go up? our brethren

have discouraged our heart, saying, 
The people is greater and taller than 
we; the cities are great and walled up
to heaven; and moreover we have 
seen the sons of the Anakims there. 

29. Then I said to you, Dread not, 
neither be afraid of them. 

30. The LORD your God which goes 
before you, he shall fight for you, 
according to all that he did for you in
Egypt before your eyes; 

the heart, and suggests the thought that it was an 
evil thing that the Lord had permitted the mind to 
have a clear light of heavenly things, and delivered
it from the thraldom of old fallacies to show to the 
soul the evils of the will which would now destroy
it.

28. And doubted to what state the soul was being led. 
The inclination towards evil discouraged all the 
faculties of the mind and turned its affections away
from heaven, suggesting that the falses which 
favour hereditary evil are more powerful and 
influential than the truths of the Church, and that 
the doctrinals or principles of action in their favour
are strong, and will prevent the soul from entering 
into heavenly things; and, moreover, in them the 
soul had some perception of the gigantic power of 
the persuasions lying rooted in the hidden springs 
of action, and ever favouring some selfish end.

29. Then the perception of Divine truth given to the 
soul from heaven replies that it is not to dread 
these things or succumb to them.

30. The goodness and wisdom of the Lord's 

providence which lead the soul will contend for it 
against them, according to all that has been already
done upon the falses by which the natural mind 
was bound, as has been manifestly perceived.

9

31. And in the wilderness, where you 

have seen how that the LORD your 
God bare you, as a man does bear his
son, in all the way that you went, 
until you came into this place. 

32. Yet in this thing you did not believe 

the LORD your God, 

33. Who went in the way before you, to 
search you out a place to pitch your 
tents in, in fire by night, to show you
by what way you should go, and in a 
cloud by day. 

34. And the LORD heard the voice of 
your words, and was angry, and 
swore, saying, 

35. Surely there shall not one of these 
men of this evil generation see that 
good land, which I swore to give to 
your fathers. 

36. Save Caleb the son of Jephunneh; he
shall see it, and to him will I give the
land that he has trodden upon, and to
his children, because he has wholly 
followed the LORD. 

31. And in states of defect of truth and temptation, 
when it has been manifestly perceived how the 
soul has been supported by the Divine goodness 
and wisdom as a man does bear his son (or as the 
genuine desire after good ever upholds truth in the 
mind) [N.B.—The love of what is good begets and 
educates truth in the soul, which is as it were its 
son] in all the changes it has gone through in its 
progression to its present state.

32. But in this the unregenerate heart is unwilling to 
rest in the assurance given it by the Divine 
Goodness and Wisdom,

33. Who Himself when incarnate trod the path of 

regeneration before each soul to prepare for each a
suitable state of heaven and peace (John 14:2), and
is present with His Divine love in states of 
obscurity and trial to show the regenerating soul 
the path it should tread, and tempers also states of 
illustration according to the reception of each. 

34. Thus the unregenerate heart rejects the guidance of
the Lord, and hence it is a law of Divine order 
proceeding from the Providence of the Lord which
foresees and arranges all things.

35. That it is impossible for any of the thoughts and 

affections of the unregenerate natural heart to enter
into those heavenly states which are promised by 
the Lord in the Word to those who will receive real
goodness from Himself.

36. Only those who are in good derived from such 
truths as they possess, these shall have a clear 
perception of good, and shall possess permanently 
all those holy states which they have patiently 
practised, and all things derived from such 
principles, because they bring out into the life the 
truths learned in the mind. [Note.—Caleb 
afterwards dwelt in Hebron (see Numbers xiv. xv.),
which signifies the spiritual Church. (See AC 
2909.)]

37. Also the LORD was angry with me 
for your sakes, saying, You also shall
not go in thither. 

37. Divine truths themselves are dissipated from the 

mind unless they are carried out into the life, and it
is a law of heaven that truth alone cannot save.

10

38. But Joshua the son of Nun, which 

38. But truth which combats without ceasing against 

stands before you, he shall go in 
thither: encourage him: for he shall 
cause Israel to inherit it. 

39. Moreover your little ones, which you
said should be a prey, and your 
children, which in that day had no 
knowledge between good and evil, 
they shall go in thither, and to them 
will I give it, and they shall possess 
it. 

evils and has Divine truth present with it, this shall
lead the soul to heaven. Let this principle have full
play, for it will cause the whole man to become 
spiritual and possess heavenly happiness.

39. And, moreover, all those innocent principles which
the mind had persuaded itself would succumb to 
evil, and whatever thoughts and affections in the 
soul in former states had nothing in them of self-
wisdom derived from the proprium, these shall be 
with the soul in heaven, and to them will the Lord 
give those blessed states that they may possess 
them. [Note.—As to the knowledge of good and 
evil derived from self-wisdom or science, see AC 
122-130.]

40. But as for you, turn you, and take 

40. But it is necessary, in order that the evil cravings 

your journey into the wilderness by 
the way of the Red sea. 

41. Then you answered and said to me, 
We have sinned against the LORD, 
we will go up and fight, according to
all that the LORD our God 
commanded us. And when you had 
girded on every man his weapons of 
war, you were ready to go up into the
hill. 

of the unregenerate heart may be removed, that the
soul should be brought back into a state of 
temptation and trial, and where evil spirits will 
infest it and draw those evils forth.

41. And when this is perceived the soul comes into a 
state of external humiliation and confession of sin 
from fear of punishment, and desires to enter into 
the heavenly state and combat with its evils, and to
carry out in its own strength all the dictates of 
Divine Love and Wisdom. It calls to mind all the 
maxims of virtue and doctrinals which have been 
learned, and thinks itself quite prepared with these 
to enter at once into an interior and spiritual state.

42. And the LORD said to me, Say to 

42. But the Lord says to the soul through the Word 

them. Go not up, neither fight; for I 
am not among you; lest you be 
smitten before your enemies. 

43. So I spoke to you; and you would 
not hear, but rebelled against the 
commandment of the LORD, and 
went presumptuously up into the hill.

that it should not attempt to attain heaven or fight 
against evil in its own strength; for the Lord would
not be with it in such case, and it would succumb 
to evil in temptations.

43. And though this is declared to it, the unregenerate 

will will not hear, but rebels against the warning 
given from heaven, and exposes the soul to 
temptation, and endeavours presumptuously in its 
own strength to enter into states for which it is not 
prepared.

11

44. And the Amorites, which dwelt in 

that mountain, came out against you,
and chased you, as bees do, and 
destroyed you in Seir, even to 
Hormah. 

44. And the evils of self-love which lie latent in such a
state rush out upon and overflow the soul with 
falses derived from evil, destroying all that was 
celestial and spiritual in the natural good in which 
it had trusted, so that the soul is reduced to despair.

[Note.—There is an allusion here in the simile to 
wasps, which endeavour to take the honey from 
the hive and are chased and driven away by bees. 
So the natural unregenerate heart would desire the 
joys of heaven without the labours necessary to 
attain them, and finds that joy on such terms 
brings a sting with it.]

45. And you returned and wept before 

the LORD; but the LORD would not
hearken to your voice, nor give ear 
to you. 

45. And the soul is brought back to its former state, 
and, being full of grief, cries to the Lord, and it 
seems as though the Lord would not hear nor 
regard.

46. So you abode in Kadesh many days, 
according to the days that you abode 
there. 

46. And the mind was then remitted into a state of 

acquiring rational truths to the full from genuine 
affection, as far as it was able to receive them.

12

 
Deuteronomy Chapter 2
Verses 1-7. Hereditary good nature will not avail for regeneration.
Verses 8-15. The character is not made spiritual by external worship.
Verses 14, 15. The loss of self-confidence.

spoke to me: and we compassed

regeneration is continued in states of desolation 
and of assaults from evil spirits, as the soul had 
been warned by Divine truth; and it is led through 
a series of experiences under the influence of the 
apparent good in the will part of the natural mind.

2. And the LORD spoke to me, saying, 

2. And the soul has a fresh perception from the Lord 

3. You have compassed this mountain 

long enough: turn you northward. 

4. And command you the people, 

saying, You are to pass through the 
coast of your brethren the children of
Esau, which dwell in Seir; and they 
shall be afraid of you: take you good
heed to yourselves therefore: 

5. Meddle not with them; for I will not 
give you of their land, no, not so 
much as a foot breadth; because I 
have given mount Seir to Esau for a 
possession. 

6. You shall buy meat of them for 

money, that you may eat; and you 
shall also buy water of them for 
money, that you may drink. 

through Divine truth.

3. That these states under the influence of the natural 
will are advanced to the full, and that it is time for 
the soul to advance to knowledges of truth from a 
celestial origin (AE 405); that is, to truths derived 
from the genuine love of what is good.

4. And the soul perceives from the Lord through the 
Word that it is to pass by and leave on one side the
external states of charity derived from the apparent
natural good which is in the will before 
regeneration, which also reverences and fears to 
offend against the holy truths of faith. Great care 
must be taken, therefore, by the regenerating soul,

5. Not to confound this good with spiritual good, for 

the Church will not be formed in such states, not 
even as to its lowest natural things; for the Lord 
has so ordered it that this voluntary part of the 
natural mind receives influx from Him without the 
intervention of truths by an internal way.

6. The regenerating soul shall draw forth good from 
this principle by means of its knowledges of good 
derived from the Word to nourish it, and it shall 
acquire truths from it by means of its knowledges 
of truth derived from the Word that the 
understanding may be replenished therewith.

7. For the LORD your God has blessed 
you in all the works of your hand: he
knows your walking through this 
great wilderness: these forty years 
the LORD your God has been with 
you; you have lacked nothing. 

7. For the goodness and wisdom of the Lord have 
been with the soul, blessing it with the means of 
obtaining these things. All its progress through 
states of apparent loss of goodness and truth have 
been under the Lord's providence. His love and 
wisdom have been with it in all its temptations, 
and it has lost no really good thing. 
[Note (verses 1-7).—This somewhat obscure 
passage seems to describe how the soul in the 
earlier stages of regeneration is brought into 
contact with the apparent integrity and 
benevolence which exist in the world from such 
motives as the fear of the law, love of approbation,
etc. The soul cannot be regenerated in such states 
which are not spiritual; but the goods and maxims 
practised from such states may be added to the 
spiritual character, and may finally become 
celestial by being practised from the genuine love 
of goodness infused into the soul by the Lord.]

8. And when we passed by from our 

8. And after the mind has passed from under the 

brethren the children of Esau, which 
dwelt in Seir, through the way of the 
plain from Elath, and from 
Eziongaber, we turned and passed by
the way of the wilderness of Moab. 

influence of the apparent love of good and charity, 
which is in the natural mind from motives which 
are not spiritual, and from the influence of the 
doctrines and maxims belonging thereto which are 
really worldly [N.B.—Elath and Ezion-gaber were 
places by the Red Sea where Solomon had a navy 
of ships. (See 1 Kings ix. 26.)], a new state is 
reached in the soul, and it is brought into the 
defect of good and truth, such as exists with those 
who are in mere external worship, by which the 
genuine good of worship is adulterated. [Note.—
The genuine good of worship is the sincere love of
the Lord (that is, of His character as revealed in 
the Lord Jesus Christ) above all things and the 
earnest desire to carry out His will in every 
thought and action of life. When worship is made 
to consist in anything else as its chief 
characteristic, such as in ceremonial or in 
doctrinals, or when external worship is the result 
of other motives, as from custom, habit, or for the 
sake of respectability, it is adulterated with evil.] 

14

9. And the LORD said to me, Distress 
not the Moabites, neither contend 
with them in battle: for I will not 
give you of their land for a 
possession; because I have given Ar 
to the children of Lot for a 
possession. 

10. The Emims dwelt therein in times 
past, a people great, and many, and 
tall, as the Anakims; 

11. Which also were accounted giants, 

as the Anakims; but the Moabites 
called them Emims. 

9. And the soul is commanded by the Lord through 
the Word not to be hostile to what proceeds from 
imperfect external worship, nor to contend with it 
by fighting against it from spiritual truths; for 
genuine spiritual truth will not be formed in the 
soul by dispossessing the states derived from 
external worship, for the Lord has provided the 
love of external worship for the benefit of those 
faculties in the soul which can only receive a 
religious principle derived from external things.

10. This region of the mind was occupied in former 

states by false persuasions derived from hereditary
evil, of a character that perverted all the goods and
truths in the soul, and deeply rooted in the mind, 
like all the ideas derived from self-love.

11. Which also filled the mind with the idea of its own
super-eminence, as all principles derived from 
love of self, and are very powerful on account of 
their proceeding from hereditary evil in the will; 
but those who are in external worship consider 
only the outward results of these things.
[Note (verses 10, 11).—Some idea may be formed 
of the power of persuasions derived from 
hereditary evil and the desires of the natural mind 
by reflecting how self-interest twists and 
imperceptibly warps one's thoughts, and how 
difficult it is to form a clear and impartial 
judgement in any matter in which one's interests 
are involved; also how any passion or desire of the
natural mind when it obtains any power over the 
soul obliterates all the rational considerations that 
would check it.]

12. The Horims also dwelt in Seir 

12. The persuasions of falsity arising from self-love 

beforetime; but the children of Esau 
succeeded them, when they had 
destroyed them from before them, 
and dwelt in their stead; as Israel did
to the land of his possession, which 
the LORD gave to them. 

and other unbridled passions also occupied the will
part of the mind originally, but were succeeded by 
the natural good proceeding from external motives
when it had destroyed those evils and taken their 
place in the mind, as spiritual influences from 
heaven are finally enabled to drive out evils from 
the interiors of the soul, in which the Lord has 
ordained they should have dominion, if the 
regenerating soul will open the mind to receive 
them.

15

13. Now rise up, said I, and get you over
the brook Zered. And we went over 
the brook Zered. 

14. And the space in which we came 

from Kadeshbarnea, until we were 
come over the brook Zered, was 
thirty and eight years; until all the 
generation of the men of war were 
wasted out from among the host, as 
the LORD swore to them. 

13. The soul can now be raised from its state of 

desolations into one of external goodness and 
order, and, led by Divine truth, it passes the 
boundary which introduces it into the life of good.
[Note (verses 10-13).—In this passage is described
how the regenerating soul is led through imperfect 
to better states. Any motive that will assist in 
driving out sin is at first adopted till the soul is 
fully prepared to receive truly spiritual life from 
heaven.]

14. And the state in which the soul comes from the 
affection of interior or rational truth into the 
commencement of the life of good is one in which 
truths are in fullness, and a new state is 
commencing in which the self-will of the evil 
proprium is becoming subdued, and the soul is 
convinced of its insufficiency to contend in its own
strength against evil as declared by the Lord.

15. For indeed the hand of the LORD 
was against them, to destroy them 
from among the host, until they were
consumed. 

15. For indeed the providence of the Lord had been 
directed to destroy these thoughts and affections 
derived from the evil proprium throughout the soul
till they were consumed.

16. So it came to pass, when all the men 
of war were consumed and dead 
from among the people, 

16. So it came to pass that when all self-derived power
and confidence were consumed and destroyed 
from among the new spiritual principles received 
into the soul,

17. That the LORD spoke to me, saying,

17. That the soul perceived by Divine truth 

18. You are to pass over through Ar, the 

coast of Moab, this day: 

19. And when you comest near over 
against the children of Ammon, 
distress them not, nor meddle with 
them: for I will not give you of the 
land of the children of Ammon any 
possession; because I have given it 
to the children of Lot for a 
possession. 

18. That it was now prepared to pass over through the 
good of external and imperfect worship and the 
things derived from it.

19. And the soul comes into contact with those 

principles in the mind which are derived from 
falsified truth; these are not to be attacked or 
meddled with, for the Lord will not found the 
Church in the regenerating soul upon doctrines 
derived from falsified truths; for these can only 
exist with those who are of the perverted external 
Church (or form a state of falsified external 
religion in the soul).

16

20. (That also was accounted a land of 

giants: giants dwelt therein in old 
time; and the Ammonites call them 
Zamzummims; 

21. A people great, and many, and tall, 
as the Anakims; but the LORD 
destroyed them before them; and 
they succeeded them, and dwelt in 
their stead: 

20. This region of the mind was also full of ideas of 
conceit derived from self-love; and falsities 
derived from the love of pre-eminence dwelt there 
in previous states of the soul, and their outward 
results are perceived to be evil by those who are in
external truth. 

21. These false persuasions are derived from 

hereditary evil and pervert all the goods and truths 
of the soul, and are deeply rooted, as all those 
derived from self-love; but the Lord destroyed 
them by means of the doctrines of external truth, 
and they succeeded them and dwelt in that region 
of the mind:

22. As he did to the children of Esau, 
which dwelt in Seir, when he 
destroyed the Horims from before 
them; and they succeeded them, and 
dwelt in their stead even to this day: 

22. As He did to the external affections of good which 

dwelt in the will part of the mind when He 
destroyed the persuasions of self-love from before 
them, and they succeeded them and dwelt in their 
stead even to the present condition of the soul.

23. And the Avims which dwelt in 
Hazerim, even to Azzah, the 
Caphtorims, which came forth out of
Caphtor, destroyed them, and dwelt 
in their stead.) 

23. And the falsities which were in the intellect to its 
utmost boundaries, the truths which were by the 
science of truth from the Word, destroyed them, 
and dwelt in their stead.
[Note (verses 16-23).—This passage appears to 
describe the progress of regeneration in the truths 
believed, as verses 1-15 had described the 
regeneration of motives in the will, and shows how
merely apparent truths, and even falsities, are 
turned to good account. Thus, for example, the 
falsity may exist in the mind from the letter of the 
Divine Word misunderstood, or from the doctrines 
of old and perverted Churches, that the Lord is a 
severe and arbitrary God of vengeance, who must 
by all means avenge sin even if the innocent suffer
in the place of the guilty; and this false idea may 
be useful at first to hold sin in check by sheer 
terror, till the soul is prepared to receive the 
perception that nothing can exist with the Lord 
inconsistent with pure love and mercy towards 
both the good and the evil, which is the only 
conclusion the soul can arrive at when it grasps the
fact that the Lord Jesus Christ is the revelation of 
the character of God.]

17

24. Rise you up, take your journey, and 
pass over the river Arnon: behold, I 
have given into your hand Sihon the 
Amorite, king of Heshbon, and his 
land: begin to possess it, and contend
with him in battle. 

24. The regenerating soul must rise above these 

external motives and fallacies, and continue its 
heavenward journey, and pass into a state which 
will bring it into conflict with its more interior 
evils; and it perceives that the Lord will give it 
power to overcome the evils of self-love, the chief 
evil of the soul that opposes regeneration, and that 
the regenerate will will be supreme in the external 
mind now occupied by the love of self, and that it 
is the duty of those regenerating to drive out these 
evils and strive against them strenuously.

25. This day will I begin to put the dread
of you and the fear of you upon the 
nations that are under the whole 
heaven, who shall hear report of you,
and shall tremble, and be in anguish 
because of you. 

25. And in this state the Lord begins to put the dread 
of committing sin and the fear of resisting good 
impulses from heaven upon all the principles of 
action in the whole mind, and they hear the Divine
will as given in the conscience, and are in great 
fear and anxiety lest it should be transgressed.

26. And I sent messengers out of the 
wilderness of Kedemoth to Sihon 
king of Heshbon with words of 
peace, saying, 

27. Let me pass through your land: I will
go along by the high way, I will 
neither turn to the right hand nor to 
the left. 

28. You shall sell me meat for money, 

that I may eat; and give me water for
money, that I may drink: only I will 
pass through on my feet; 

26. And the soul explores by means of Divine truth 

from the state of defect of good in which it is into 
those principles of the mind which are under the 
dominion of selfish loves, to see if there is any 
agreement to be made with them by the 
regenerating soul. 

27. The regenerate will is desirous to continue its 

progress through these motives of action derived 
from self-respect and esteem. Using them only so 
far as is necessary, it would go straight forward 
towards higher things, being guided by the clear 
truths of the Word, and would not swerve either 
into evil or falsity.

28. It is willing to acquire from those principles and 
motives such conformity with custom as is 
necessary for life in the world by means of its 
perception of what is good from the Word that it 
may be sustained; and such worldly maxims as are
essential, by means of its knowledge of truth, that 
the mind may be well stored with worldly 
information, only these things will only be used by
the regenerate as transitory and comparatively 
inferior things.

18

29. (As the children of Esau which dwell
in Seir, and the Moabites which 
dwell in Ar, did to me;) until I shall 
pass over Jordan into the land which 
the LORD our God gives us. 

30. But Sihon king of Heshbon would 

not let us pass by him: for the LORD
your God hardened his spirit, and 
made his heart obstinate, that he 
might deliver him into your hand, as 
appears this day. 

31. And the LORD said to me, Behold, I
have begun to give Sihon and his 
land before you: begin to possess, 
that you may inherit his land. 

32. Then Sihon came out against us, he 
and all his people, to fight at Jahaz. 

33. And the LORD our God delivered 
him before us; and we smote him, 
and his sons, and all his people. 

34. And we took all his cities at that 

time, and utterly destroyed the men, 
and the women, and the little ones, 
of every city, we left none to remain:

35. Only the cattle we took for a prey to 
ourselves, and the spoil of the cities 
which we took. 

29. (As the principles of good which were in the soul 
before regeneration, and the external goods which 
were in the inferior things of worship, were used 
by the soul), until it shall become fully regenerated
and enter into those holy states which the Divine 
Love and Wisdom are preparing for it.

30. But self-love, which reigns supreme in the natural 
mind before regeneration, will not suffer the 
regenerate thus to proceed unmolested on their 
heavenly journey; for it is diametrically opposed 
both in will and opinion to all good and truth from 
the Lord, and refuses all agreement with spiritual 
things, and must therefore be entirely overcome 
and conquered in the state to which the soul has 
now arrived.

31. And it is perceived by the Divine truth of the Word
that the soul now has power from the Lord to 
obtain victory over self-love and all things derived 
from it; and that it should begin to practise from 
spiritual principles the goods formerly done from 
this motive that they may be conjoined to the soul 
as genuine good.

32. Then self-love comes out to oppose the religious 

progress of the soul, together with all the 
arguments that are derived from it in the state to 
which the soul has now progressed.

33. And the goodness and wisdom of the Lord deliver 

the regenerate from the domination of this 
principle, and enable them to overcome it with all 
the apparent truths and opinions which are derived 
from it.

34. And all the doctrines hitherto subservient to this 
motive come now under the influence of the 
regenerate will; and all the falses, affections of 
evil, and evil intentions in such doctrines are 
entirely rooted out, and none suffered to remain:

35. But such natural subservient affections of this old 
principle as are innocent in themselves are adopted
by the regenerate will, and whatever is of use in its
principles is appropriated to the regenerate.

19

36. From Aroer, which is by the brink of 
the river of Arnon, and from the city 
that is by the river, even to Gilead, 
there was not one city too strong for 
us: the LORD our God delivered all 
to us: 

37. Only to the land of the children of 
Ammon you came not, nor to any 
place of the river Jabbok, nor to the 
cities in the mountains, nor to 
whatever the LORD our God forbad 
us. 

36. From its tenets, which are proximate to truths, but 
falsified, and from those derived from the fallacies
of the senses even to natural good, which is closely
allied to genuine good received from the Word, 
there is no principle of action derived from the 
love of self which is not to be under the dominion 
of the regenerate will: the goodness and wisdom of
the Lord will place them all under its control:

37. Only the soul must not adopt the principles of 

external worship derived from falses, nor any of 
their falsified truths, nor any of its doctrines which
were joined with evils, nor anything that it 
perceives to be inimical to the Divine goodness 
and wisdom of the Lord.
[Note (verses 24-37) — This passage appears to 
describe how the Lord reduces the selfishness of 
the heart in the external mind, and how the 
external morality arising from the love of 
reputation in the world cannot be adjoined to the 
Christian character without temptation-combats 
against the selfish motives which induce it in the 
unregenerate state, and how it is finally made 
spiritual by adoption from higher motives. The 
love of self reigns in man when he only regards 
himself and his own in what he thinks and does, 
and places this before the public good. (See AC 
7366-7377.)]

Deuteronomy Chapter 3

Verses 1-17. The subjugation of the love of the world in the external mind.
Verses 18-20. The principles acquired in the regeneration of the external mind must assist in the 
perfecting of the internal domain of motives and thoughts.
Verses 21-29. After the conquest of evil in externals the soul desires at once to attain heavenly 
happiness; but this is not yet possible. 

1. Then we turned, and went up the 

way to Bashan: and Og the king of 
Bashan came out against us, he and 
all his people, to battle at Edrei. 

2. And the LORD said to me, Fear him 
not: for I will deliver him, and all his
people, and his land, into your hand; 
and you shall do to him as you did to
Sihon king of the Amorites, which 
dwelt at Heshbon. 

3. So the LORD our God delivered into
our hands Og also, the king of 
Bashan, and all his people: and we 
smote him until none was left to him
remaining. 

4. And we took all his cities at that 

time, there was not a city which we 
took not from them, threescore 
cities, all the region of Argob, the 
kingdom of Og in Bashan. 

1. THEN the state of the soul is again changed, and it 
progresses to a state in which it may be endowed 
with natural good in externals (see AE 405); and 
the love of the world, which reigns in the natural 
mind, comes out to oppose the soul with all the 
allurements and pleasures of the senses, and all its 
confirmatory arguments to combat the soul in the 
state to which it has now arrived.

2. And it is perceived by means of Divine truth that 
this principle is not to be feared; for the Lord will 
reduce it, and all the arguments and persuasions by
which it is supported, and all the region of the 
mind heretofore occupied by it under the power of 
the regenerate will; and the soul will be enabled to 
do the same with them as was done in former 
temptations to self-love, the chief of the evils of 
the soul which dwelt hereditarily in the natural 
mind. 

3. So the goodness and wisdom of the Lord delivered
into the power of the regenerate will also the love 
of the world and sensual things which dominated 
in the natural mind, with all the theories and 
persuasions supporting it, which will be destroyed 
in the mind as far as they oppose the regenerate 
life until none of them are left.

4. And all the doctrines and fallacies favouring a life 
lived for this world only will be taken possession 
of in that state by the regenerate will, there will not
be one left to support it; for it is perceived that 
they are completely deceptive and false, even the 
whole of the theories and arguments which 
promised happiness from a worldly life and 
pleasure, which the love of this world had hitherto 
caused to dominate in the natural mind.

21

 
5. All these cities were fenced with 

5. All these doctrines and opinions had barred up the 

high walls, gates, and bars; beside 
unwalled towns a great many. 

6. And we utterly destroyed them, as 
we did to Sihon king of Heshbon, 
utterly destroying the men, women, 
and children, of every city. 

mind against spiritual truths by plausible 
arguments drawn from the fallacies of the senses 
with specious proofs and confirmations; and were 
supported by many other considerations drawn 
from the natural inclination of man's heart.

6. All these are to be utterly destroyed as far as they 
oppose the regenerate life, as was done to the false
principles arising from the love of self in the 
natural mind. The absolute fallacy of such 
arguments and opinions is made manifest, and all 
affection for them and ideas derived

7. But all the cattle, and the spoil of the

7. But all affections which are harmless, and 

cities, we took for a prey to 
ourselves. 

8. And we took at that time out of the 
hand of the two kings of the 
Amorites the land that was on this 
side Jordan, from the river of Arnon 
to mount Hermon; 

everything of real spiritual use in these false 
conceptions, is appropriated by the new regenerate
will.

8. Thus in that state the externals of the mind are no 
longer occupied by falses derived from the loves 
of self and the world, but are occupied by real 
truths from a spiritual origin, from the first 
endeavours to lead a truly spiritual life even to the 
complete knowledge of good.

9.

(Which Hermon the Sidonians call 
Sirion; and the Amorites call it 
Shenir;) 

9.

(Knowledges of what constitutes the genuine good
of love and charity are considered real good with 
those who are in the love of genuine truths from 
the Lord; but those who are in evils consider what 
favours the loves of self and the world with them 
to be real good.)

10. All the cities of the plain, and all 

10. All the doctrines accepted in the mind about 

Gilead, and all Bashan, to Salchah 
and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of 
Og in Bashan. 

external things, and the delights of them, and all 
the natural mind to its utmost boundaries, and the 
things derived from the pleasures of the senses 
formerly under the dominion of the love of the 
world and pleasure dominating in the natural mind,
were now possessed by the regenerate principle.

22

11. For only Og king of Bashan 

11. For the love of the world and its pleasures 

remained of the remnant of giants; 
behold his bedstead was a bedstead 
of iron; is it not in Rabbath of the 
children of Ammon? nine cubits was
the length thereof, and four cubits 
the breadth of it, after the cubit of a 
man. 

12. And this land, which we possessed at
that time, from Aroer, which is by 
the river Arnon, and half mount 
Gilead, and the cities thereof, gave I 
to the Reubenites and to the Gadites.

dominating over the whole natural mind to the 
exclusion of things spiritual is a gigantic power of 
falsity in the human soul derived from hereditary 
evil, resting in a state of torpor as to spiritual 
things on the study of natural sciences to the 
exclusion of all else, and supported by perverted 
truths drawn from the letter of the Word, by which 
truth is utterly falsified both as to knowledges of 
good and evil and knowledges of what is true or 
false when measured by the real standard of 
Divine truth drawn from the Lord's Divine 
Humanity, which is the real man.

12. And in the new state to which the soul has now 

progressed, all these faculties and all the exteriors 
of the natural mind, from the first conceptions of 
truth derived from a rational study of the Word to 
the state in which spiritual things are received in 
the mind with delight, and the doctrines of truth 
with which the soul is stored from this source, are 
occupied by true faith in the Lord (Reuben) and 
good works thence resulting (Gad).

13. And the rest of Gilead, and all 

13. And all the rest of the external mind, with its 

Bashan, being the kingdom of Og, 
gave I to the half tribe of Manasseh; 
all the region of Argob, with all 
Bashan, which was called the land of
giants. 

pleasures formerly dominated by the love of this 
world, is now conjoined to the new regenerate will
received from the Lord, with all the natural life in 
the world and the externals of the soul in which the
lusts and desires of the unregenerate soul had 
hitherto been all-powerful.

14. Jair the son of Manasseh took all the 
country of Argob to the coasts of 
Geshuri and Maachathi; and called 
them after his own name, 
Bashanhavothjair, to this day. 

14. Thus the new principle derived from the 

regenerate will possesses all the faculties of the 
natural mind even to external sensual things, and 
stamps upon them its new regenerate character in 
this state.

15. And I gave Gilead to Machir. 

15. And the Lord gives to the soul a feeling of 

pleasure in doing good from the union of good 
motives with sound doctrines.

23

16. And to the Reubenites and to the 

16. And the natural mind from the pleasure in doing 

Gadites I gave from Gilead even to 
the river Arnon half the valley, and 
the border even to the river Jabbok, 
which is the border of the children of
Ammon; 

17. The plain also, and Jordan, and the 
coast thereof, from Chinnereth even 
to the sea of the plain, even the salt 
sea, under Ashdothpisgah eastward. 

18. And I commanded you at that time, 
saying, The LORD your God has 
given you this land to possess it: you
shall pass over armed before your 
brethren the children of Israel, all 
that are meet for the war. 

good, into which man is first initiated when he 
becomes regenerate (Gilead), to the first 
perceptions of spiritual truth conjoined thereto in 
external things, comes under the dominion of true 
faith in the Lord and works thence derived, even to
the first insinuation of spiritual truth into good 
(Jabbok), which is the boundary between external 
and internal religion.

17. The external mind also as to doctrine and truth to 
its utmost boundaries, from the sources and origins
whence they flow (Chinnereth or Gennesaret) even
to where they are stored in the memory of the 
sensual man and conjoined to its desires, now 
comes under the control of things derived from the
spiritual man (Ashdoth-pisgah or the springs of the
hill).
[Note (verses 1-17)—By the conquest of Og seems
to be described the change which comes over the 
soul when the immense importance of the future 
life is fully realized and acted upon as compared 
with this. When his kingdom is fully conquered 
and occupied by Reuben, Gad, and Manasseh (true
faith, life thence resulting, and the regenerate will),
the primary object in life is no more worldly 
success and prosperity, but security from 
temptation, avoidance of sin, and everything that 
would imperil eternal life. In the present day 
(emphatically the iron age) it behoves each 
member of the Church to consider whether his 
primary thoughts and endeavours in life are 
directed to ensure his eternal welfare, or whether 
he is tainted by the spirit of the age, and passes the
greater part of his time on his iron bed of worldly 
pursuits and science, with the spiritual aspirations 
of his mind fast asleep.]

18. And the soul has a clear perception from Divine 
truth in that state, that the Divine goodness and 
wisdom have gifted it with power to attain spiritual
life in the natural mind, and that these newly-
acquired powers should advance to combat with 
evil with all their might as far as they are enabled, 
and so go before the other faculties of the mind 
and prepare the soul for the reception of true love 
and charity in the internal mind.

24

19. But your wives, and your little ones, 
and your cattle, (for I know that you 
have much cattle,) shall abide in 
your cities which I have given you; 

20. Until the LORD have given rest to 

your brethren, as well as to you, and 
until they also possess the land 
which the LORD your God has 
given them beyond Jordan: and then 
shall you return every man to his 
possession, which I have given you. 

21. And I commanded Joshua at that 

time, saying, Yours eyes have seen 
all that the LORD your God has 
done to these two kings: so shall the 
LORD do to all the kingdoms 
whither you passest. 

19. And the affections of truth with the good 

principles derived from the enlightened 
understanding, and all the knowledges of good and
truth in the natural mind (for the Lord has gifted 
the soul with abundant knowledges in the natural 
mind), shall repose secure in the doctrines and 
principles with which the soul is endowed by the 
conquest of the loves of self and of the world in 
the natural mind.

20. Until the Lord shall have reduced all the principles
within man to order as well as those things which 
are in the external mind; and when the soul shall 
possess those interior states of love and charity 
which the Lord has prepared for it in the inner 
mind, then shall the external mind and all things 
derived from it also have rest and repose in the 
soul.
[Note (verses 18-20).—In these verses would seem
to be described how the soul perceives that it must 
work out its own salvation by combating the evils 
of the outer life; and by warring against these 
exterior evils the way is prepared for the Lord to 
gift the soul with real charity in interiors, after 
which right principles will be carried out in 
externals as from habit without struggle. (See AC 
4353.)]

21. And the soul, being in a state of truth warring 
against evil, and zealous for good, has a fresh 
perception from the Divine truth of the Word; it is 
made evident to the understanding what the Lord 
by His Divine goodness and truth has done to the 
false principles derived from the love of self and 
the love of the world in the externals of the soul; 
and confidence is now given that the Lord will 
reduce under the power of the regenerate will all 
opposition from evil and falses in the more interior
states towards which the regenerate are 
progressing.

22. You shall not fear them: for the 

22. The soul must not fear them, for the Divine 

LORD your God he shall fight for 
you. 

goodness and omnipotent wisdom of the Lord are 
co-operating with the regenerate.

23. And I besought the LORD at that 

time, saying, 

23. And the mind while under the dominion of truth 
has an earnest desire in that state, and beseeches 
the Lord—

25

24. O Lord GOD, you have begun to 
show your servant your greatness, 
and your mighty hand: for what God 
is there in heaven or in earth, that 
can do according to your works, and 
according to your might? 

24. That now the real character of the Lord is 

manifest, and the regenerating soul has gained a 
perception of His goodness, wisdom, and power, 
and that everything in spiritual and natural things 
is under the governance of His Providence—

25. I pray you, let me go over, and see 

25. That it may at once advance to a more interior 

the good land that is beyond Jordan, 
that goodly mountain, and Lebanon. 

state, and enjoy the blessings of internal religion, 
celestial peace, and a life of good.

26. But the LORD was angry with me 
for your sakes, and would not hear 
me: and the LORD said to me, Let it 
suffice you; speak no more to me of 
this matter. 

26. But this cannot be owing to the forwardness of the 
other principles of the mind not yet regenerated; 
and it is perceived that the soul is asking for what 
is impossible while it is merely in a state of 
knowledge of truth.

27. Get you up into the top of Pisgah, 

27. It is given, however, to the mind in that state to 

and lift up your eyes westward, and 
northward, and southward, and 
eastward, and behold it with your 
eyes: for you shall not go over this 
Jordan. 

28. But charge Joshua, and encourage 

him, and strengthen him: for he shall
go over before this people, and he 
shall cause them to inherit the land 
which you shall see. 

elevate itself by the intellect, and to perceive the 
states to which the soul will afterwards come, from
its imperfect affections and its obscure perceptions
of truth to a full and clear light, and a perfect state 
of love; this is perceived with the understanding, 
but the soul cannot at present enter into these more
interior states.

28. But it must first war against evils, and all the 
energies and strength of the mind must be 
employed in the combat; for this warring against 
evil will prepare the mind for the reception of 
good and truth, and will cause it to inherit all these
holy states which are perceived in the intellect by 
illustration from Divine truth.

29. So we abode in the valley over 

29. And the soul remains in an external state till the 

against Bethpeor. 

truths received in the first stage of regeneration are
fully implanted.

Deuteronomy Chapter 4

Verses 1-13. The absolute necessity of obeying the Divine commands.
Verses 14-24. That nothing from selfhood is to be put in the place of Divine truth, and that truth alone, 
unless worked out in the life, cannot save.
Verses 25-31. If the soul acts from itself it must perish, but if it seeks Divine Wisdom it will be saved.
Verses 32-40. That Providence continually assists regeneration, as may be manifest from the past; that 
the soul should therefore trust in the Lord and none else, and their sole duty is to carry out His laws.
Verses 41-43. Evils committed through ignorance or errors of doctrine do not condemn.
Verses 44-49. Reiteration of the Divine Law in the state to which the soul has arrived. 

1. Now therefore hearken, O Israel, to 
the statutes and to the judgements, 
which I teach you, for to do them, 
that you may live, and go in and 
possess the land which the LORD 
God of your fathers gives you. 

1. THE principal duty, therefore, of those regenerating

is to obey and implicitly carry out all the 
commands which they receive through the Divine 
Word, both as to general principles and as to the 
perception given about each particular case, that 
they may acquire spiritual life, and enter into and 
enjoy those more interior states to which the 
Divine Goodness and Wisdom of the Lord (which 
have led the regenerate by Divine Providence in all
ages) are seeking to guide them.

2. You shall not add to the word which

2. Nothing shall be added to the perception from 

I command you, neither shall you 
diminish ought from it, that you 
may keep the commandments of the
LORD your God which I command 
you. 

Divine truth within the soul as to what is right to 
do, neither shall any part of it be disregarded, that 
the whole may be carried out in the life as directed 
by the Divine Goodness and Wisdom revealed in 
the Word.

3. Your eyes have seen what the 

3.

LORD did because of Baalpeor: for 
all the men that followed Baalpeor, 
the LORD your God has destroyed 
them from among you. 

It has been evident to the understanding what are 
the pernicious results of false worship conjoined 
with a life of evil. For all the false opinions which 
favour a life of evil in one who pretends to religion
are destroyed in the soul by the truths that are 
perceived by those regenerating from the Divine 
Goodness and Wisdom.

4.

But you that did cleave to the 
LORD your God are alive every one
of you this day. 

4. But all those thoughts and affections that uphold a 
life of good derived from the Divine Goodness and
Wisdom as revealed in the Word and in the Lord 
Jesus Christ are preserved every one and 
confirmed in the soul.

27

 
5.

Behold, I have taught you statutes 
and judgements, even as the LORD 
my God commanded me, that you 
should do so in the land whither you
go to possess it. 

5.

It is now evident to the regenerating soul that the 
Word illustrated by influx from Divine Goodness 
and Wisdom instructs the soul in all things, both in
general principles and in particular cases, and 
points out the things which are necessary to be 
done in order to attain to heavenly life.

6. Keep therefore and do them; for this

6. Attend to these, therefore, and work them out 

is your wisdom and your 
understanding in the sight of the 
nations, which shall hear all these 
statutes, and say, Surely this great 
nation is a wise and understanding 
people. 

patiently in the life; for this is the true wisdom and 
intelligence of the regenerate, and will be 
perceived to be such by all things in the soul that 
desire genuine good, which will receive these 
principles, and will acknowledge that a life in 
accordance with them is real wisdom and 
intelligence.

7.

For what nation is there so great, 
who has God so near to them, as the
LORD our God is in all things that 
we call upon him for? 

7. For what affections so tend towards good, and 

bring the soul to so Divine a state as those derived 
from the Lord as perfect Divine Love and Wisdom 
(as displayed in the Lord Jesus Christ)?

8. And what nation is there so great, 

that has statutes and judgements so 
righteous as all this law, which I set 
before you this day? 

8. And what affections so lead towards good, or are 
in accordance with such just directions for the 
general conduct of life and for each particular case,
as the new perceptions of the Divine Word which 
are given to the soul in this state?

9. Only take heed to yourself, and 

keep your soul diligently, lest you 
forget the things which your eyes 
have seen, and lest they depart from
your heart all the days of your life: 
but teach them your sons, and your 
sons' sons; 

9. Only let the regenerating watch and keep their 
souls diligently, lest they forget the directions 
which have been given them in their states of 
illustration, and lest the will should not act from 
them in any state they may be passing through, but
let them impress them upon all their thoughts and 
principles of action.

10. Specially the day that you stood 

10. Specially that state in which they manifestly 

before the LORD your God in 
Horeb, when the LORD said to me, 
Gather me the people together, and I
will make them hear my words, that
they may learn to fear me all the 
days that they shall live upon the 
earth, and that they may teach their 
children. 

perceived the absolute necessity of obeying the 
commands proceeding from the Divine Goodness 
and Wisdom, and when by the Lord's Providence 
the whole attention of the soul was brought to bear
upon eternal things, and made to perceive the 
Divine instructions given in the Word, that it might
learn to regard the Lord's will in every state of 
natural life, and that all their thoughts and actions 
might bear the impress of it. 

28

11. And you came near and stood under
the mountain; and the mountain 
burned with fire to the midst of 
heaven, with darkness, clouds, and 
thick darkness. 

12. And the LORD spoke to you out of 
the midst of the fire: you heard the 
voice of the words, but saw no 
similitude; only you heard a voice. 

11. These are the states in which the soul approaches 
the state of love to the Lord and comes under its 
influence, and perceives the Divine Love, and the 
defilement of the love of self burning within the 
soul even to the centre, and all the darkness in 
spiritual things, and obscurity and dense evils 
thence resulting.

12. Then it is that the soul has a perception from the 

Divine Love, and of its own evils; it perceives the 
Lord's will revealed in the truths of the Word, and 
it perceives that no external or simulated goodness 
in natural things will avail for salvation, but that 
the perception given of the Lord's will must be 
carried out in the life.

13. And he declared to you his 

13. And understands the definite conditions of 

covenant, which he commanded 
you to perform, even ten 
commandments; and he wrote them 
upon two tables of stone. 

14. And the LORD commanded me at 
that time to teach you statutes and 
judgements, that you might do them
in the land whither you go over to 
possess it. 

15. Take you therefore good heed to 

yourselves; for you saw no manner 
of similitude on the day that the 
LORD spoke to you in Horeb out of
the midst of the fire: 

salvation, which it is absolutely necessary for 
those who would be saved to carry out, namely, to 
work out the whole law of the Lord as far as they 
are able in the life; and the Word of the Lord is 
thus to be impressed upon the memory and upon 
the life.

14. And the soul receives illustration from the Lord 

through the Word in that state of the things relating
to the general principles of action which form the 
true worship of Him, and to conduct of life in the 
world, that are to be carried out in the regenerate 
state upon which the soul is now entering, and the 
quality of which it must acquire.

15. It is necessary, therefore, to watch what passes in 
the soul with jealous care, for it was perceived that
nothing from self which simulates good in 
externals is to be worshiped in the place of the 
pure goodness and truth which proceeds from the 
Lord's Humanity in that state in which the soul 
received illustration from the Lord, proceeding 
from the Divine Love, as to what is necessary for 
salvation. 

29

16. Lest you corrupt yourselves, and 

make you a graven image, the 
similitude of any figure, the likeness
of male or female, 

17. The likeness of any beast that is on 
the earth, the likeness of any 
winged bird that flies in the air, 

18. The likeness of any thing that 

creeps on the ground, the likeness 
of any fish that is in the waters 
beneath the earth: 

16. Lest the soul should turn away from the Divine 
and worship what proceeds from its own evil 
proprium, and make a god of it, and imagine the 
desires and thoughts that proceed therefrom, and 
which are from the loves of self and the world, and
merely put on a semblance of good in externals, to 
be genuine good and truth.

17. The affections proceeding from the evils of the 

proprium, which put on the appearance of good in 
the natural mind, and the false intelligence, which 
seems to be rational externally, and to lift the mind
to real truth, but really proceeds from the loves of 
self and the world, and is infatuation.

18. Or worship as the chief good the mere pleasures of
the senses separate from spiritual life, and believe 
as the only truths the appearances which are 
derived from the fallacies of the senses apart from 
revelation.

19. And lest you lift up your eyes to 

19. And lest the understanding be lifted up with pride, 

heaven, and when you see the sun, 
and the moon, and the stars, even all
the host of heaven, should be driven
to worship them, and serve them, 
which the LORD your God has 
divided to all nations under the 
whole heaven. 

20. But the LORD has taken you, and 

brought you forth out of the iron 
furnace, even out of Egypt, to be to 
him a people of inheritance, as you 
are this day. 

21. Furthermore the LORD was angry 
with me for your sakes, and swore 
that I should not go over Jordan, 
and that I should not go in to that 
good land, which the LORD your 
God gives you for an inheritance: 

and when the delights are perceived of self-love, 
the love of the world, and all the falses derived 
from them which surround self-love, the soul 
should be compelled by the natural evil inclination
of the heart to worship and love them supremely, 
though these things were intended by the goodness
and wisdom of the Lord to be subservient to all the
good thoughts and affections implanted by Him in 
the soul.

20. But the Lord has taken the regenerate and brought 
them forth out of the evil loves of the natural man, 
a state in which religion is made to consist in mere 
knowledges, and the mind is under the dominion 
of the evil proprium, to receive the life derived 
from Divine truth operating on the soul as is being 
developed in the present state.

21. Furthermore, the soul has turned away and 

perverted even the Divine truth of the Word itself 
to the service of evil by the perversity of the 
natural man, so that it is not possible for truths 
alone to conduct the soul to interior religion, or for
the soul, when in a state of believing truths only, to
possess those heavenly states which the Divine 
Goodness and Wisdom desire to give it.

30

22. But I must die in this land, I must 

not go over Jordan: but you shall go
over, and possess that good land. 

23. Take heed to yourselves, lest you 
forget the covenant of the LORD 
your God, which he made with you,
and make you a graven image, or 
the likeness of any thing, which the 
LORD your God has forbidden you.

24. For the LORD your God is a 

consuming fire, even a jealous God.

22. But truth must be stored in the memory while the 
soul is in an external state, and cannot, while it is 
regarded as the chief thing, conduct the soul to the 
internal life of goodness; but when truths are 
carried out into the life, the soul shall enter into it 
and possess it.
[Note (verse 21, etc.).—Even truths themselves are
productive of evil if a man begins to imagine 
himself superior to others on account of them. The 
possession of truths, which are spiritual riches, is a
serious responsibility, and the more truths a man 
thinks he has, the more is it necessary for him to 
examine if they are made use of in the life; for 
truths, like Moses, will die on this side of Jordan, 
and will not accompany the soul in the next world 
except so far as they have been worked but in the 
life (Matt 7:21-27).]

23. Let the regenerate take great heed, therefore, of 
what passes in the soul, lest they forget the 
conditions on which alone it is possible for the 
Divine Goodness and Wisdom to conduct them to 
heaven, namely, by carrying out the Divine will in 
the life; and lest they worship as the supreme good
the false imaginations proceeding from their own 
evil heart, or any appearance of good or truth in 
externals, which is contrary to the perception given
them of the Divine Goodness and Wisdom.

24. For thus all the influx from the Divine Love and 
Wisdom within the soul will be consumed by the 
lusts arising from the loves of self and the world, 
and become hatred against Divine good.

25. When you shall beget children, and 

25. As the mind develops fresh truths and principles 

children's children, and you shall 
have remained long in the land, and 
shall corrupt yourselves, and make a
graven image, or the likeness of any
thing, and shall do evil in the sight 
of the LORD your God, to provoke 
him to anger: 

derived from them in series, and after the soul has 
become fully initiated into the goods and truths of 
the Church, when it turns away from the Divine, 
and worships what proceeds from self-derived 
intelligence, and calls the evil desires of the 
proprium good, and shall thus sin against the 
perception given by the Divine Love and Wisdom 
so as to avert them from the soul.

31

26.

I call heaven and earth to witness 
against you this day, that you shall 
soon utterly perish from off the land
whereunto you go over Jordan to 
possess it; you shall not prolong 
your days upon it, but shall utterly 
be destroyed. 

26. The Divine Word shows clearly now to the soul, 

both in its internal and external senses, that in such
case all that is of the Church with man and the 
internal good and truth now possessed by the soul 
will utterly perish, heavenly states will no more be 
experienced, and spiritual life will utterly die out.

27. And the LORD shall scatter you 

27. And goods and truths will be lost amongst the 

among the nations, and you shall be 
left few in number among the 
heathen, whither the LORD shall 
lead you. 

28. And there you shall serve gods, the 
work of men's hands, wood and 
stone, which neither see, nor hear, 
nor eat, nor smell. 

hereditary evils of the soul, and will be obscured 
by the falses into which the Divine influx of truth 
into the soul will be turned.

28. And in that state the soul will be under the 

dominion of the worship of what is false 
proceeding from its own corrupt hereditary nature, 
evil in its motive, untrue in its principles, without 
perception of real truth or desire to carry it out, 
without the power of appropriating spiritual 
nourishment from heaven, or true perception of 
things as they really are.

29. But if from there you shall seek the 
LORD your God, you shall find 
him, if you seek him with all your 
heart and with all your soul. 

29. But if even in that deplorable state the soul shall 
sincerely seek Divine Goodness and Wisdom, it 
shall find them if it really search for them with all 
the power of the will and understanding.

30. When you are in tribulation, and all 
these things are come upon you, 
even in the latter days, if you turn to
the LORD your God, and shall be 
obedient to his voice; 

31.

(For the LORD your God is a 
merciful God;) he will not forsake 
you, neither destroy you, nor forget 
the covenant of your fathers which 
he swore to them. 

30. When it is in temptations, and all these things 
come upon the soul, when the state comes in 
which nothing of good and truth seems left, if it 
then looks to Divine Goodness and Wisdom, and 
endeavours to carry out the dictates received 
therefrom

31. (For the Lord arranges or permits all things by 
Divine Love and Wisdom in Providence out of 
pure love and mercy), He will not cease to help the
soul in every possible way, nor will He permit it (if
it desires good) to be destroyed by evil; nor will 
He be absent in its struggles, in which He Himself 
will take part, and thereby conjoin the soul with 
Himself, as He has declared in the Word that He 
becomes conjoined with those who strive after 
good.

32

32. For ask now of the days that are 

past, which were before you, since 
the day that God created man upon 
the earth, and ask from the one side 
of heaven to the other, whether 
there has been any such thing as this
great thing is, or has been heard like
it? 

33. Did ever people hear the voice of 
God speaking out of the midst of 
the fire, as you have heard, and 
live? 

34. Or has God assayed to go and take 
him a nation from the midst of 
another nation, by temptations, by 
signs, and by wonders, and by war, 
and by a mighty hand, and by a 
stretched out arm, and by great 
terrors, according to all that the 
LORD your God did for you in 
Egypt before your eyes? 

35. Unto you it was showed, that you 
might know that the LORD he is 
God; there is none else beside him. 

36. Out of heaven he made you to hear 
his voice, that he might instruct 
you: and upon earth he showed you 
his great fire; and you heard his 
words out of the midst of the fire. 

32. For let the soul examine and ask now of the states 
that are past in its former experiences since the 
Lord first caused spiritual good and truth to appear
in the natural mind by regeneration, and into all 
the perceptions which it has of spiritual and 
internal things, and see if there has ever been such 
a revelation of Divine goodness as what the Lord 
has done by assuming Humanity to effect man's 
regeneration, or if man could have conceived of 
anything greater.

33. Or could there be any other principles in which is 
revealed so clearly the will of the Lord proceeding 
from Divine Love as those (proceeding from that 
Humanity) which have been revealed to the soul, 
and which it is also enabled to live out?

34. Or are there other truths which have been able to 
draw forth what is good and separate it from the 
evil in the soul by temptations, by clear revelations
of truth, by the manifest operation of Divine 
Providence, by contest against evil, by the power 
of internal truth, and by Divine Omnipotence, and 
by protection from evils and falses, according to 
all that has been done by the Divine Goodness and 
Wisdom upon all the falsities which favoured evil 
in the natural mind, as has been evident to the 
perception of the understanding?

35. It has been given to the soul to perceive these 
things in order that it might know that the 
revelation of goodness and truth as manifested in 
the Lord Jesus Christ is the only true revelation of 
the Divine Being and His attributes. Besides this 
there is no just conception of what is good and 
true.

36. By illustration in the interiors of the mind He 

causes the regenerate to understand His will, that 
He may teach them to follow Him; and in their 
natural life He shows them the operation of His 
Divine Love, and it is perceived that all His 
commands proceed from that Love.

33

37. And because he loved your fathers, 

37. It is because the Lord loves the desires of the 

therefore he chose their seed after 
them, and brought you out in his 
sight with his mighty power out of 
Egypt; 

regenerating soul to attain to genuine good from 
Himself that He endows it with abundance of 
truths, and brings it by means of His omnipotent 
power to a clear perception of truth, and from the 
dominion of the falsities which favour evil in the 
natural unregenerate heart.

38. To drive out nations from before 

you greater and mightier than you 
are, to bring you in, to give you 
their land for an inheritance, as it is 
this day. 

38. To enable it to overcome evils in the soul, which 
are far greater and more powerful than the soul's 
desires for good would be without continual help 
from heaven, and to bring the soul to heaven and 
plant therein goods and truths in the place of evil, 
as can be seen even in this present state.

39. Know therefore this day, and 

39. Let the mind, therefore, clearly perceive in this 

consider it in your heart, that the 
LORD he is God in heaven above, 
and upon the earth beneath: there is 
none else. 

40. You shall keep therefore his 

statutes, and his commandments, 
which I command you this day, that 
it may go well with you, and with 
your children after you, and that 
you may prolong your days upon 
the earth, which the LORD your 
God gives you, for ever. 

state and accept it in the will that the goodness and
truth proceeding from the Lord as revealed in His 
Humanity are all-powerful, and alone to be 
worshiped both in the internal domain of motives 
and thoughts and the external domain of life and 
actions; there is nothing else of real power for 
good.

40. The whole duty of those who are regenerating, 
therefore, consists in regulating the life by His 
laws, and in everything obeying His will, as far as 
it is given to the soul to perceive it, in the state to 
which it has arrived, that it may go well with the 
man who is regenerating, and with all the desires 
and thoughts with which the soul shall be 
endowed, and that the fullness of his states of good
and truth in the external mind may be amplified in 
the existence with which he will be endowed by 
the Divine Goodness and Wisdom in heaven for 
ever.

41. Then Moses severed three cities on 

this side Jordan toward the 
sunrising; 

41. Then the soul is provided by means of Divine truth
from the Word with complete doctrines in the 
external mind derived from love to the Lord.

42. That the slayer might flee thither, 

which should kill his neighbour 
unawares, and hated him not in 
times past; and that fleeing to one of
these cities he might live: 

42. That when the soul through error has destroyed 
anything of spiritual life, it may take refuge in 
them and be blameless if the destruction of what is
spiritual takes place from ignorance and not from 
premeditated evil in the heart; and that by 
embracing these doctrines his spiritual life might 
be preserved.

43. Namely, Bezer in the wilderness, in 
the plain country, of the Reubenites;
and Ramoth in Gilead, of the 
Gadites; and Golan in Bashan, of 
the Manassites. 

43. There are doctrines adapted for those states in 

which goodness and truth are vastated in the mind 
in which the soul depends upon truths and faith as 
all-important, and for those in which the soul is 
endeavouring to carry out what it knows in the 
natural life, in which works are considered all-
important. And for the more perfect states in the 
natural principle when the soul endeavours to act 
from spiritual motives and from the new 
regenerate will.
[Note (verses 41-43).—These verses seem to 
indicate that doctrines are provided from the Word 
suited to the states and capacities of all, and even if
a soul should act against and destroy what is of 
true charity, still if this is done from error and from
mistaken religious tenets conscientiously believed,
no guilt will be imputed to him. And if the soul is 
in doubt as to what are good and truth, let him take
refuge in the doctrines of truth as far as they have 
been revealed to him in the Word, and abide 
therein, and his spiritual life will be preserved.]

44. And this is the law which Moses set
before the children of Israel: 

44. And these are the rules of action which those who 
are regenerating receive from the Divine Word.

45. These are the testimonies, and the 

statutes, and the judgements, which 
Moses spoke to the children of 
Israel, after they came forth out of 
Egypt. 

45. These are the things clearly perceived to be true by
the illustration given from heaven, the instructions 
relating to general principles, and the laws for 
guiding the life in individual cases which those 
who are regenerating receive through the Word, 
after they have rejected the fallacies belonging to 
the natural man.

46. On this side Jordan, in the valley

over against Bethpeor, in the land of
Sihon king of the Amorites, who 
dwelt at Heshbon, whom Moses and
the children of Israel smote, after 
they were come forth out of Egypt: 

whilst still in external principles and in the first 
stage of regeneration in that region of the mind 
formerly occupied by the love of self, the chief 
evil of the soul, which dominated over the natural 
mind, but which was conquered by Divine truth 
from the Word and the new regenerate principles 
of the mind derived therefrom after the soul was 
delivered from the bondage of its old fallacies,

35

47. And they possessed his land, and 

the land of Og king of Bashan, two 
kings of the Amorites, which were 
on this side Jordan toward the 
sunrising;

the river Arnon, even to mount 
Sion, which is Hermon, 

49. And all the plain on this side Jordan
eastward, even to the sea of the 
plain, under the springs of Pisgah. 

47. And the natural mind became occupied by the new
desires and truths given from heaven, where the 
love of self and the love of the world formerly 
reigned, the two chief ruling evils which were in 
the natural mind before regeneration, and obscured
the influx of good from heaven;

soul began to draw real truth from the Word, even 
to its inmost state, which is a rational perception of
spiritual things,

things now under the control of things derived 
from the spiritual man.

Deuteronomy Chapter 5

Verses 1-5. The keeping the commandments and obeying the Divine will as given in the Word is the 
covenant to conjoin the soul with heaven.
Verses 6-21. The Ten Commandments, which are a summary of the Divine Law
(For the full explanation of the Ten Commandments see AC 8863-8912. It is perhaps scarcely 
necessary to state here that the fact of the moral commands containing a spiritual sense does not mean 
any weakening of the literal sense.)
Verses 22-29. The perception of the perfections of the Divine Being; and the utter discordance of its 
desires and thoughts therewith, alarms the soul.
Verses 30-33. Instruction that if the soul leads a good life as far as it can, it receives a perception of 
truth accommodated to its state which leads it on by degrees. 

1. And Moses called all Israel, and said
to them, Hear, O Israel, the statutes 
and judgements which I speak in 
your ears this day, that you may 
learn them, and keep, and do them. 

2. The LORD our God made a 
covenant with us in Horeb. 

1. AND the Lord instructs the regenerating through 
the Word, and enforces upon them that it is 
essential they should be careful to obey the laws of
Divine order and the decisions of Divine Wisdom 
in every step of life which are perceived to be 
right, that the Divine will may be impressed upon 
the memory, imbue the understanding, and be 
carried out in the life.

2. For the Divine Goodness and Wisdom become 
conjoined to the regenerating soul by means of 
revelations through the Word.

3. The LORD made not this covenant 
with our fathers, but with us, even 
us, who are all of us here alive this 
day. 

3. These revelations are different to those which were

given to the soul in any former state, but they are 
now given to the regenerating who have been 
brought to receive true life from heaven.

4. The LORD talked with you face to 

face in the mount out of the midst of 
the fire, 

4. The Divine Wisdom is perceived in the interior 
sense of the Word shining forth from the Divine 
Love towards the human race

5.

(I stood between the LORD and you 
at that time, to show you the word of
the LORD: for you were afraid by 
reason of the fire, and went not up 
into the mount;) saying, 

5.

(The Word in the letter mediates between the Lord 
and those who are in external states, and shows 
them the will of the Lord as far as they are able to 
bear it, for the desires and thoughts of those who 
are in externals are not in conformity with the 
Divine Love, so that they cannot ascend into more 
interior states), and reveals as follows:— 

37

 
6.

I am the LORD your God, which 
brought you out of the land of Egypt,
from the house of bondage. 

6. That the Divine Love and Wisdom, as displayed in
the Lord Jesus Christ, should be the object of 
inmost adoration with the regenerate; it is this that 
has brought them out of their natural and 
unregenerate condition, and from the slavery of 
sin.

7. You shall have none other gods 

7. There is nothing to be worshiped as the supreme 

before me. 

good but this.

8. You shall not make you any graven 
image, or any likeness of any thing 
that is in heaven above, or that is in 
the earth beneath, or that is in the 
waters beneath the earth: 

8. That which proceeds from self-intelligence is not 

to be worshiped, nor any hypocritical resemblance 
of what is good, whether it be of religious or 
spiritual good, civil and moral good, or of those 
things which please the external senses.

9. You shall not bow down yourself to 
them, nor serve them: for I the 
LORD your God am a jealous God, 
visiting the iniquity of the fathers 
upon the children to the third and 
fourth generation of them that hate 
me, 

10. And showing mercy to thousands of 
them that love me and keep my 
commandments. 

11. You shall not take the name of the 

LORD your God in vain: for the 
LORD will not hold him guiltless 
that takes his name in vain. 

12. Keep the Sabbath day to sanctify it, 

as the LORD your God has 
commanded you. 

13. Six days you shall labour, and do all 

your work: 

9. You shall not debase the soul to those things nor 

serve them. For there is nothing good but what 
proceeds from the Lord Jesus Christ; the worship 
of aught else brings evil and falsity with all their 
evil progeny upon the soul in a long series, till all 
good and truth is obscured with those who reject 
the Divine influence that proceeds from the Lord.

10. Whereas good and truth flow in for ever into the 
souls of those who will receive the good of love 
and the truths of faith that flow from the Lord's 
Divine Humanity by endeavouring to conform 
their lives to them.

11. Good and truth must not be profaned (by believing
the truth and doing evil, or by doing good from a 
hypocritical or selfish motive), for thereby what is 
spiritual in the soul is hopelessly destroyed by 
being conjoined to its opposite, and a state induced
that cannot be healed.

12. Those regenerating should ever have before them 
as the main object of life the conjunction of all 
things in the soul to the Lord, whereby they will be
sanctified by conforming themselves to the pattern 
given in the Lord Jesus Christ.

13. It is necessary that the soul should pass through a 
complete period of temptation and combat against 
evils and falsities, and thus fully work out its 
salvation.

38

14. But the seventh day is the Sabbath of
the LORD your God: in it you shall 
not do any work, you, nor your son, 
nor your daughter, nor your 
manservant, nor your maidservant, 
nor your ox, nor your ass, nor any of
your cattle, nor your stranger that is 
within your gates; that your 
manservant and your maidservant 
may rest as well as you. 

14. But the holy state will then come in which the 

whole man is reduced to order by conjunction with
the Lord; there will then be no more occasion to 
struggle against sin and falsity, either for the man's
interior will or for his internal perception of what 
is good and true, or for his opinions of rectitude 
and wisdom in externals, or for his affection for 
these principles in natural things, or for his natural 
truths, or for any feeling or perception in the soul, 
or scientific in the understanding whereby the 
truths of the Church are introduced into the mind; 
that the subservient faculties of the soul may be at 
peace as well as the inner man himself. [Note.—
When the soul is brought to the state signified by 
the Sabbath, every faculty will be at peace because
all will work harmoniously in the Divine order.]

15. And remember that you were a

the soul was oppressed in the natural unregenerate 
state of the mind, and that it has been liberated by 
the Divine Love and Wisdom leading the mind in 
all the operations of Providence with Divine 
Omnipotence; and the object of all these 
operations of Divine Love and Wisdom should be 
ever present in the mind, namely, the sanctification
of the soul by conjunction with the Lord.

16. Honour your father and your mother,

16. Prefer the Lord and His kingdom before all things, 

as the LORD your God has 
commanded you; that your days may
be prolonged, and that it may go 
well with you, in the land which the 
LORD your God gives you. 

for the Divine Love and Wisdom have shown the 
soul that these are the fountains of life, that thus 
states of blessedness may be acquired in heaven, 
and that the soul may be led into the state of order 
and happiness which is designed for it by the 
Divine Love and Wisdom.

love and wisdom which proceeds from the Lord, 
either in yourself or others, for this is spiritual 
murder.

18. You shall flee from everything which destroys the 
sacred marriage of genuine good and truth, which 
is the union in the soul of the love of truth and the 
love of doing good, and you shall abominate the 
foul union of the love of what is evil with what is 
false.

39

19. Neither shall you steal. 

20. Neither shall you bear false witness 

against your neighbour. 

19. You shall not attribute anything of good and truth 
to yourself, which is spiritual theft, for all genuine 
good and truth is from the Lord.

good and true in the smallest degree to be 
perverted or disregarded.

understanding to use the truths of the Church for 
selfish ends, or lest they should induce the will to 
appropriate its goods to self, or to turn to selfish or
evil ends the doctrines of. the Church within the

your assembly in the mount out of 
the midst of the fire, of the cloud, 
and of the thick darkness, with a 
great voice: and he added no more. 
And he wrote them in two tables of 
stone, and delivered them to me. 

23. And it came to pass, when you heard
the voice out of the midst of the 
darkness, (for the mountain did burn 
with fire,) that you came near to me, 
even all the heads of your tribes, and
your elders; 

must be done was given to the whole soul in a state
of good from Divine Love, from the letter of the 
Word, and shining through the obscurity with 
which it had been veiled by false doctrines arising 
from evils; it was clear and unmistakable, 
separating what was good from what was evil in 
the soul; it showed that the duty of man was the 
keeping of the commandments from the Lord and 
nothing else. And that the Lord has given to man 
through the Word all those truths which are 
needful to conjoin him with Himself, and which 
make him receptive of Divine Love and Wisdom.

23. And when this clear revelation of Divine truth was 
perceived shining out of the midst of the obscurity 
in which the Word was before veiled (for it was 
then manifest that the good proceeding from the 
Divine Love was in it), the soul approached with 
reverence the Word in the letter with all the powers
of the understanding and with all its rational 
intelligence;

40

24. And you said, Behold, the LORD 

our God has showed us his glory and
his greatness, and we have heard his 
voice out of the midst of the fire: we 
have seen this day that God does talk
with man, and he lives. 

25. Now therefore why should we die? 

for this great fire will consume us: if 
we hear the voice of the LORD our 
God any more, then we shall die. 

26. For who is there of all flesh, that has 
heard the voice of the living God 
speaking out of the midst of the fire, 
as we have, and lived? 

24. And the soul confessed that the Divine goodness 
and truth of the Lord Jesus Christ as the only God 
had been manifestly revealed to it, and that His 
commandments proceed from His ardent love 
towards the whole human race; and it is seen in 
this state that hence is an influx into the soul of 
man, who receives all his life therefrom.
[Note.—The soul perceives the glory and greatness
of the Lord, and hears His voice out of the midst of
the fire, when it is realized that the Lord is 
absolutely nothing but pure Love and Wisdom; and
when it perceives that the Divine Humanity (that 
is, the unselfish life and character of the Lord 
Jesus Christ) is the only shape and form which 
Divine Love and Wisdom could possibly assume 
when brought to the perception of man, so that no 
God other than the Lord Jesus Christ can be justly 
conceived of (John 14:9)].

25. And the external principles of the soul fear that 
they will entirely lose their own proper life, and 
that the life of heaven will perish with them, for 
they are not able to receive the pure love of the 
Lord; and they fear that if they have to act on the 
dictates of the Divine Goodness and Wisdom 
proceeding from that love, their own proper life 
will perish, or all that is spiritual, with them. 
[Note.—As an illustration it may be mentioned 
that when it is first perceived in the soul that the 
Lord Jehovah is absolutely unselfish, that all His 
dealings are dictated by the desire to give all He 
has to others as far as they can receive it, the fear 
arises that if the soul were to endeavour to follow 
this example, and become perfect as the Father in 
heaven is perfect, it would lose all that is delightful
in life.]

26. For how can a man (says the soul), whose natural 
life is derived from the loves of self and of the 
world, carry out the dictates and follow the 
example of the Lord Jesus Christ, proceeding, as 
they did, from His ardent love to the human race as
now perceived by the mind, and live from them, 
and retain anything of the natural life of self-
enjoyment?

41

27. Go you near, and hear all that the 

27. And it feels its distance from Divine perfection, 

LORD our God shall say: and speak 
you to us all that the LORD our God
shall speak to you; and we will hear 
it, and do it. 

and desires that Divine truth may be presented in 
some form accommodated to the state of the soul, 
which shall act as a medium between the Divine 
Love and Wisdom as seen to exist in the Lord, and 
the soul's state; and that if the dictates proceeding 
from that Love and Wisdom were explained in 
some accommodated form, the soul would be able 
to receive them, and carry them out in the life.

28. And the LORD heard the voice of 

28. And the Lord attends to this desire of the soul 

your words, when you spoke to me; 
and the LORD said to me, I have 
heard the voice of the words of this 
people, which they have spoken to 
you: they have well said all that they
have spoken. 

29. O that there were such an heart in 
them, that they would fear me, and 
keep all my commandments always, 
that it might be well with them, and 
with their children for ever! 

30. Go say to them, Get you into your 

tents again. 

31. But as for you, stand you here by 
me, and I will speak to you all the 
commandments, and the statutes, 
and the judgements, which you shall 
teach them, that they may do them in
the land which I give them to 
possess it. 

when meditating over the Divine commands, and 
instructs the soul through the Word that its desires 
are heard; and that these thoughts are good as 
proceeding from humiliation of heart.

29. The Lord's earnest desire for the soul is that it may
have a heart receptive of Divine things from 
humility, and a holy dread of acting against the 
goodness of the Lord; and that it may at all times 
endeavour to carry out His will, that it may be 
blessed by Him at the present time, and in all its 
future developments to eternity.

30. And the Divine Word proclaims to the soul that it 
should remain abiding in the highest state of 
charity of which it is capable. 

31. And the soul's understanding of truth is brought 

nearer to truth Divine, and receives by it 
instruction in all things which are necessary both 
for life and for worship and for each difficulty that 
arises; whereby the whole mind is informed of 
those things which must be done in the new 
heavenly states with which the Lord is gifting the 
soul. [Note.—Thus the soul's understanding of 
truth is the medium which leads it on towards 
perfection by degrees, and is accommodated to its 
capacities of reception in every state.

42

32. You shall observe to do therefore as

commanded you: you shall not turn 
aside to the right hand or to the left. 

regenerating soul to attend to and carry out those 
things which are taught by Divine Love and 
Wisdom; nor must it go in any other way than that 
into which the Lord Himself leads it, and into 
which the good and truth of heaven and the Church
lead it (AE 600, end).

33. You shall walk in all the ways which

the LORD your God has 
commanded you, that you may live, 
and that it may be well with you, and
that you may prolong your days in 
the land which you shall possess. 

33. It is the duty of the regenerate to walk in the paths 
pointed out by Divine Love and Wisdom, that they
may attain to spiritual life; it will then be well with
them, and they will be gifted with blessed states in 
heaven, with which they will be endowed by the 
Lord.

43

Deuteronomy Chapter 6

Verses 1-3. The Law is given that the soul may keep it* and thereby attain eternal life.
* This looks like a self-evident proposition, but there are some modern theories, misnamed evangelical,
which would seem rather to indicate that the Law was given to prove to the soul that it could not be 
kept, in direct contradiction to the Lord's own words Matt 5:17-20; 19:17, and elsewhere.
Verses 4-15. The primary commandment of the Law is that there is but ONE LORD, who must be 
enthroned as the central object of love and worship in the soul (Mark 12:29, 30).
Verses 16-25. Divine Providence must not be murmured against, for all its dealings are constantly 
directed for the good of the soul to lead it to heaven: it only remains for the regenerate to carry out the 
Divine commands.

1. Now these are the commandments, 
the statutes, and the judgements, 
which the LORD your God 
commanded to teach you, that you 
might do them in the land whither 
you go to possess it: 

2. That you might fear the LORD your 
God, to keep all his statutes and his 
commandments, which I command 
you, you, and your son, and your 
son's son, all the days of your life; 
and that your days may be 
prolonged. 

3. Hear therefore, O Israel, and observe
to do it; that it may be well with you,
and that you may increase mightily, 
as the LORD God of your fathers 
has promised you, in the land that 
flows with milk and honey. 

1. AND the following are the instructions relating to 
life and to principles of action which the soul 
perceives from the Word to be in accordance with 
the Divine Love and Wisdom, and which 
perception is given in order that it may carry them 
out in those blessed states with which it is the 
Lord's desire to gift it:—

2. That it may have a dread of in any way obstructing
the Divine Love and Wisdom, and that it may walk
in the ways taught by them, both in general 
principles and in each difficulty that arises, and 
that the interior will, and all the thoughts and 
intentions of the soul, and all things springing 
therefrom, may be entirely conformed to the 
Divine will in every state of life; and that thus 
heavenly states may be stored in the soul for the 
future life.

3. Let the regenerate, therefore, take heed to 

understand the will of the Lord, and to carry it out 
in the life; that it may be well with them, and that 
good and truth in their interior soul may be 
multiplied exceedingly (as promised by the Divine 
Love and Wisdom, which have led them in times 
past), and that they may be thereby brought to 
states abounding with celestial and spiritual good, 
and of felicity and delight derived therefrom. 

44

 
 
4. Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God 

is one LORD: 

4. Understand, all you who are regenerating, that the 
Lord Jehovah is ONE in person and essence (and it
follows of necessity with a Christian that the Lord 
Jesus Christ it that Jehovah) (John 10:30). [Note.—
To say the Lord our God is one Lord, and to think 
of two or three distinct Divine persons, seems 
rather like saying one thing with the lips and 
thinking another in the heart.]

5. And you shall love the LORD your 
God with all your heart, and with all 
your soul, and with all your might. 

5. And you shall love Jehovah God with all your will,
with all your understanding, and with all your 
powers.

6. And these words, which I command 
you this day, shall be in your heart: 

6. And the perception of His will which is given you 
in this state, shall be the ruling principle of all your
affections:

7. And you shall teach them diligently 
to your children, and shall talk of 
them when you sit in your house, 
and when you walk by the way, and 
when you liest down, and when you 
risest up. 

8. And you shall bind them for a sign 

upon your hand, and they shall be as 
frontlets between your eyes. 

7. You shall diligently impress it upon all your 

thoughts and actions; you shall ruminate on it 
when you enterest into the inner chamber of your 
mind (the interior will), and when you are 
transacting the duties of life; and in your 
alternating states of obscurity and of elevation 
towards more interior good.

8. And you shall distinguish this commandment as 
chief above all others; it shall be manifest in all 
your works, and it shall be the centre of all your 
intelligence and wisdom.

9. And you shall write them upon the

posts of your house, and on your 
gates. 

with your inmost will, and upon all things 
introduced into the soul from the natural mind.

10. And it shall be, when the LORD 
your God shall have brought you 
into the land which he swore to your 
fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to 
Jacob, to give you great and goodly 
cities, which you buildedst not, 

10. And it shall be when you shall have been brought 
by the Divine Love and Wisdom to that state 
which is promised in the Word to those who are in 
good, whether celestial, spiritual, or natural, 
derived from the Lord (see note, chap. i. verse 8), 
and when the mind is richly stored with 
comprehensive doctrines of truth not formulated 
by its own intelligence,

11. And houses full of all good things, 
which you filledst not, and wells 
dug, which you diggedst not, 
vineyards and olive trees, which you
plantedst not; when you shall have 
eaten and be full; 

11. And when the will is replenished with good, which
is not from itself, and the understanding with wells
of truth not explored out by yourself; and goods 
and truths which spring from celestial and spiritual
states implanted in the soul by the Lord and not by 
yourself; when you have tasted all these things, 
and your soul is satisfied with good,

12. Then beware lest you forget the

mind was kept in bondage by evils and falses.

will of Jehovah God, to Him shall be rendered all 
your service, and you shall endeavour to stamp His
nature as revealed in the Lord Jesus Christ upon 
your life.

14. You shall not go after other gods, of 
the gods of the people which are 
round about you; 

14. You shall not go after anything that will lead away 
from Him, or any of the falses infused by the 
external principles of the mind;

15. (For the LORD your God is a 

jealous God among you) lest the 
anger of the LORD your God be 
kindled against you, and destroy you
from off the face of the earth. 

16. You shall not tempt the LORD your 
God, as you tempted him in Massah.

15. (For the Divine goodness and truth cannot exist 
within you in conjunction with evil and falsity), 
lest you shut out from yourself the influx of His 
goodness, and truth, and all that is of heaven 
within you perish from the interiors of your mind.
[Note (verses 14, 15).—The soul's conception of 
God forms the keystone of the religious character, 
and gives a colouring to all else, because it is the 
ideal after which the soul is itself consciously or 
unconsciously striving; hence the necessity of 
recognising the self-denying love, the desire to 
serve others at all costs, and the humility displayed
in the Lord Jesus Christ as the most Divine 
characteristics; otherwise the soul will wander far 
from heaven by aiming at a wrong standard of 
perfection, and following after a Deity which is 
only a creature of its own imagination.] 

16. You shall not murmur against the dealings of the 
Divine Love and Wisdom with the soul, as 
prompted to do by evil in temptations.

and good in the sight of the LORD: 
that it may be well with you, and 
that you may go in and possess the 
good land which the LORD swore to
your fathers. 

18. And you shall do that which is right and good in 

the sight of the Lord; that it may be well with you, 
and that you may be introduced into and have 
appropriated to you those heavenly states which 
are promised by the Lord in the Word to those who
are in good,

spoken.

testimonies, and the statutes, and the 
judgements, which the LORD our 
God has commanded you?

in future states what is the will of the Divine Love 
and Wisdom for the soul (in the things that happen

were Pharaoh's bondmen in Egypt; 
and the LORD brought us out of 
Egypt with a mighty hand: 

22. And the LORD showed signs and 

wonders, great and sore, upon Egypt,
upon Pharaoh, and upon all his 
household, before our eyes: 

21. Then shall the internal perception of the mind 

reply to the thought arising in externals, that all 
that was spiritual in the mind was in bondage to 
the natural principle in an unregenerate state; and 
the Lord has brought the soul out of an 
unregenerate state by the omnipotent power of His 
Providence:

22. And the Lord gave proofs and confirmations to the
soul in its unregenerate state of an unmistakable 
character, and accompanied by severe temptations 
in the natural mind and all the affections and 
thoughts belonging thereto, as was clearly 
perceived by the spiritual man:

all these statutes, to fear the LORD 
our God, for our good always, that 
he might preserve us alive, as it is at 
this day. 

24. And all the revelations of the Divine will which 
are given to the soul are to enable it to fear to act 
against the Divine Love and Wisdom, and are 
entirely for its own good, that it may be preserved 
in spiritual life; as experience may convince it.

Verses 1-5. The evils of the soul must be persistently and utterly destroyed or they will draw away the 
soul from heaven. 
Verses 6-11. The regenerate must only receive into their souls the truths that flow from the Lord's 
Divine Humanity, all else is of no avail (John 10:1-16).
Verses 12-15. The blessedness resulting from following the Divine instructions.
Verses 16-26. The necessity of utterly destroying evil out of the soul. 

1. When the LORD your God shall 

bring you into the land whither you 
go to possess it, and has cast out 
many nations before you, the 
Hittites, and the Girgashites, and the 
Amorites, and the Canaanites, and 
the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and 
the Jebusites, seven nations greater 
and mightier than you; 

1. WHEN the Lord your God shall bring you to those 
heavenly states to which His Providence is leading
you that you may be gifted with them, and has cast
out many evils from the interiors of your soul—the
false religious principles originally in your mind 
which beget evil, and those derived from 
hereditary evil; the loves of self and the world, and
all your other hereditary evils and the falsities 
derived from them; the love of external things 
without internal, and all the falses thence derived, 
even evil in all its complex, far stronger and more 
powerful than the soul would be in its unaided 
strength; [Note.—By the nations in Canaan before 
the advent of the Israelites are described, 
according to the New Church writings, those 
hidden evils which exist hereditarily in depraved 
human nature and must be driven out during 
regeneration. In these writings it is abundantly 
shown that it is natural to every man from 
hereditary evil to prefer himself to others, and 
desire to be served by, admired, and even 
worshiped by others; it is also natural to him to 
desire all the goods of others, and to take them by 
force or fraud if it could be done without being 
found out; and that these evils are deeply hidden 
under the apparent rectitude and probity which a 
man has from education, fear of the law, or of the 
loss of reputation; that still they exist, and if their 
existence is not known, it is simply an evidence of 
self-ignorance. (See AC Index.)]

2. And when the LORD your God shall

deliver them before you; you shall 
smite them, and utterly destroy 
them; you shall make no covenant 
with them, nor show mercy to them: 

goodness and wisdom of the Lord, you shall beat 
them down and deprive them of all life; you shall 
not make any compact with them, or give them 
any harbour in your soul:

3. Neither shall you make marriages 

3. You shall not form any conjunction with them; 

with them; your daughter you shall 
not give to his son, nor his daughter 
shall you take to your son. 

4. For they will turn away your son 
from following me, that they may 
serve other gods: so will the anger of
the LORD be kindled against you, 
and destroy you suddenly. 

5. But thus shall you deal with them; 
you shall destroy their altars, and 
break down their images, and cut 
down their groves, and burn their 
graven images with fire. 

6. For you are an holy people to the 
LORD your God: the LORD your 
God has chosen you to be a special 
people to himself, above all people 
that are upon the face of the earth. 

7. The LORD did not set his love upon 
you, nor choose you, because you 
were more in number than any 
people; for you were the fewest of 
all people: 

your affections shall be kept clear of the false 
principles derived from them; nor shall you take 
the affections which are derived from these evil 
principles and unite them to your truths.

4. For they will draw away the principles of action 

which you have acquired from the pure service of 
the Lord, that they may worship other things in the
first place; thus will you reject from yourself the 
influx of the Divine Love and Wisdom, and your 
spiritual life will utterly perish.

5. But thus shall you deal with them: you shall 

destroy everything that panders to evil within the 
soul, and all falses which put on the appearance of 
good in externals are to be utterly destroyed, and 
all the worldly wisdom and specious arguments 
which surround them are altogether to be cut off, 
and every appearance of good from self-derived 
intelligence must be destroyed by the genuine and 
Divine love of good derived from the Lord.

6. For the regenerate must only admit into the soul 
the pure truth proceeding from the Divine Love 
and Wisdom: the Lord desires that they should 
receive the pure and exalted truths proceeding 
from His Divine Humanity in the place of the 
falsified and perverted appearances of truths 
existing surface-deep only amongst those who are 
merely external.

7. The Lord has not set His love upon the regenerate 
nor chosen them because they are more grounded 
in these external truths and goods derived from 
education and habit, but because they perceive the 
utter valuelessness of all these seeming goods and 
truths derived from themselves:

50

8. But because the LORD loved you, 

8. And because their souls are thus open to receive 

and because he would keep the oath 
which he had sworn to your fathers, 
has the LORD brought you out with 
a mighty hand, and redeemed you 
out of the house of bondmen, from 
the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt. 

9. Know therefore that the LORD your 
God, he is God, the faithful God, 
which keeps covenant and mercy 
with them that love him and keep his
commandments to a thousand 
generations; 

10. And repayeth them that hate him to 
their face, to destroy them: he will 
not be slack to him that hates him, 
he will repay him to his face. 

the good and truth flowing from the Lord, and can 
receive the promises given in the Word to those 
who are in good, therefore the Lord has brought 
them out of their unregenerate state by Divine 
Omnipotence, and delivered them from a state of 
spiritual bondage and from the power of the 
falsities which dominate in the natural 
unregenerate heart,

9. And has given them a clear perception that the 

Lord Jesus Christ is the only God, the incarnation 
of the Divine Love, whose only desire is to conjoin
to Himself and to bless all those who will receive 
the spiritual good that flows from Him, and strive 
to conform their lives to His will, with the greatest 
blessings they can receive to eternity.

10. And those who reject Him close up the interiors of 
their mind and destroy their spiritual life: this 
destruction will most assuredly come to those who 
reject the Lord's Humanity, and the interiors of 
their minds will thereby be closed to all influx 
from heaven.

11. You shall therefore keep the

commandments, and the statutes, 
and the judgements, which I 
command you this day, to do them. 

the revelations of His will and all His 
requirements, and act on the principles laid down 
by Him, and according to the perception given in 
each difficulty as to life, which they receive 
through the Word in a state of illustration, and to 
govern their lives thereby.

12. Wherefore it shall come to pass, if 
you hearken to these judgements, 
and keep, and do them, that the 
LORD your God shall keep to you 
the covenant and the mercy which he
swore to your fathers: 

12. And it will certainly happen, if the soul strives to 
learn the will of the Lord, and to keep it and to 
carry it out in the life, that the Divine Goodness 
and Wisdom will flow in and conjoin you with 
Himself, and have mercy upon you according to 
His promises to those who are in good (John 
14:23).

51

13. And he will love you, and bless you, 
and multiply you: he will also bless 
the fruit of your womb, and the fruit 
of your land, your corn, and your 
wine, and your oil, the increase of 
your kine, and the flocks of your 
sheep, in the land which he swore to 
your fathers to give you. 

13. And He will love you, and bless you, and 

abundantly store your mind with wisdom; He will 
also bless you with aspirations after good, and the 
fruition thereof in your inmost heart, and in all the 
developments of your natural mind, and with 
goods and truths in external things, and with 
spiritual truth in your understanding, and with 
celestial love in Your will, and in the increase of 
all good affections both in external and spiritual 
things in those heavenly states which He has 
promised in the Word to give to those who seek 
after genuine good from Himself.

14. You shall be blessed above all 

14. There is nothing which can render man so happy 

people: there shall not be male or 
female barren among you, or among 
your cattle. 

eventually as these spiritual blessings: by them 
everything which is good and useful in the 
understanding or the will or in the external 
affections is fruitful and increases.

15. And the LORD will take away from 
you all sickness, and will put none of
the evil diseases of Egypt, which 
you know, upon you; but will lay 
them upon all them that hate you. 

16. And you shall consume all the 

people which the LORD your God 
shall deliver you; your eye shall 
have no pity upon them: neither shall
you serve their gods; for that will be 
a snare to you. 

15. And the Lord will take away from the soul all 

sickness, and will permit none of those spiritual 
diseases which come upon the mind which sets its 
affections upon merely external and natural things 
and which you have experienced in the 
unregenerate state, to fall upon you; but they will 
come upon those who oppose themselves to 
spiritual truth.

16. And you shall blot out of your mind all those 
thoughts and principles in the soul which the 
Divine Love and Wisdom shall show you to be 
false; your understanding shall not favour them, 
neither shall you suffer your affections to be drawn
away by the arguments in favour of the objects of 
their love and worship, for they will draw away the
soul from heaven.

17. If you shall say in your heart, These 

17. If the thought shall arise in the mind that the 

nations are more than I; how can I 
dispossess them? 

hereditary evils of the soul are more powerful than 
the new regenerate will, how can they possibly be 
driven out?

52

18. You shall not be afraid of them: but 
shall well remember what the LORD
your God did to Pharaoh, and to all 
Egypt; 

19. The great temptations which your 
eyes saw, and the signs, and the 
wonders, and the mighty hand, and 
the stretched out arm, whereby the 
LORD your God brought you out: so
shall the LORD your God do to all 
the people of whom you are afraid. 

18. You shall not be afraid of them, but shall well 
remember what the Divine Love and Wisdom 
within the soul have done upon the false theories 
arising from the domination of the natural 
principle over the spiritual which opposed truth in 
the soul, and upon all the cupidities and appetites 
originally in the mind in the unregenerate state,

19. The great temptations by which the falsities in 

them were displayed before the understanding, the 
confirmations of Divine truth, and the manifest 
operation of Providence and of Divine 
Omnipotence acting in the outer life and from 
interiors, whereby Divine Love and Wisdom 
brought the soul out from that state of spiritual 
bondage; so also will the Divine Love and Wisdom
do upon all those false principles; derived from 
hereditary evil which now seem so powerful to the 
spiritual man.

20. Moreover the LORD your God will 

send the hornet among them, until 
they that are left, and hide 
themselves from you, be destroyed. 

20. For the Love and Wisdom of the Lord will induce 
an abhorrence of these false principles, until those 
that remain and lurk within the soul are brought to 
light by truth and destroyed.

21. You shall not be frightened at them: 

for the LORD your God is among 
you, a mighty God and terrible. 

21. The soul should not be dismayed at them; for Love
itself and Wisdom itself are on the side of the 
regenerate, and these are omnipotent and strike 
terror into the evil and the false.

22. And the LORD your God will put 

out those nations before you by little
and little: you may not consume 
them at once, lest the beasts of the 
field increase upon you. 

22. And the Divine Love and Wisdom will drive out 
the hereditary evils of the unregenerate heart by 
degrees; they cannot be driven out at once, for 
thereby the lower evil lusts would multiply upon 
the soul.

23. But the LORD your God shall 
deliver them to you, and shall 
destroy them with a mighty 
destruction, until they be destroyed. 

23. But the Divine Love and Wisdom will reduce them
at length under the power of the regenerate will, 
and destroy their power entirely, so that they will 
no longer oppose good.

24. And he shall deliver their kings into 
your hand, and you shall destroy 
their name from under heaven: there 
shall no man be able to stand before 
you, until you have destroyed them. 

24. And he will also put all their false principles under
the power of the regenerate will, so that their 
influence will no longer remain in the interiors of 
the mind; there is no false doctrine which shall be 
able to withstand the clear perception of truth 
which will be given to the regenerate soul, and 
which will drive all falsity out of the mind.

53

25. The graven images of their gods 

shall you burn with fire: you shall 
not desire the silver or gold that is on
them, nor take it to you, lest you be 
snared therin: for it is an 
abomination to the LORD your God.

25. All the false theories which are formulated by the 
unregenerate heart shall be consumed by the influx
of Divine Love into the soul: you shall not be 
enticed by the appearances of good and truth with 
which their interior evil is concealed, nor accept 
those appearances (which are in reality from self-
love, AE 242, end), lest you be thereby drawn 
away from heaven; for the evil and false covered 
with appearances of what is good and true, more 
than all things draw away the soul from Divine 
Goodness and Wisdom.

26. Neither shall you bring an 

26. Neither shall you admit into your will anything 

abomination into your house, lest 
you be a cursed thing like it: but you
shall utterly detest it, and you shall 
utterly abhor it; for it is a cursed 
thing. 

which draws away the soul from the Lord, lest the 
whole man, like it, be alienated from heaven; you 
shall utterly detest it, and you shall utterly abhor it,
for nothing can be more cursed than what draws 
awav the soul from the Lord.

54

 
Deuteronomy Chapter 8
All the operations of Providence are directed to obtain eternal happiness for the soul, and it must be 
constantly borne in mind that all good things come from heaven and none from self. 

1. All the commandments which I 
command you this day shall you 
observe to do, that you may live, and
multiply, and go in and possess the 
land which the LORD swore to your 
fathers. 

2. And you shall remember all the way 
which the LORD your God led you 
these forty years in the wilderness, 
to humble you, and to prove you, to 
know what was in your heart, 
whether you would keep his 
commandments, or no. 

3. And he humbled you, and suffered 
you to hunger, and fed you with 
manna, which you knew not, neither 
did your fathers know; that he might 
make you know that man does not 
live by bread only, but by every 
word that proceeds out of the mouth 
of the LORD does man live. 

4. Your clothing waxed not old upon 

you, neither did your foot swell, 
these forty years. 

1. ALL that the regenerate perceive to be the Lord's 

will in every state must be most carefully observed
and carried out in the life, that they may acquire 
spiritual life, and that what is from heaven in them 
may be increased, and that they may advance 
towards interior things and possess those heavenly 
states which are promised in the Word to those 
who receive genuine good.

2. You shall ever bear in mind the dealings of the 

Divine Love and Wisdom in Providence whereby 
the Lord has led you through periods of temptation
and desolation to reduce the obstructions arising 
from self, and to give you confidence in Him, to 
show you the evils of your own heart, and to show 
you whether your will was in conformity with 
Divine order or not.

3. And He showed you your own nothingness, and 

suffered you to feel the want of spiritual good, and 
then supplied the hunger of the soul with good and
truth from Himself, which you perceive was not of
your own acquiring, and which you hadst not 
experienced in any previous state; that you might 
clearly perceive that your spiritual life is not fed by
the wisdom and good endeavours acquired by your
own exertions alone, but by the influx of the Love 
and Wisdom proceeding from the Divine 
Humanity is the soul fed.

4. Still the truths of the natural man acquired by your 
own exertions were not injured, nor was the 
natural mind itself impaired in all this period of 
temptation.

5. You shall also consider in your heart,
that, as a man chasteneth his son, so 
the LORD your God chasteneth you.

5. You shall therefore lay it well to heart, that as a 
man chasteneth his son for his good, so has the 
Lord with Divine Love and Wisdom corrected you.

55

 
6. Therefore you shall keep the 

commandments of the LORD your 
God, to walk in his ways, and to fear
him. 

6. You shall therefore above all things endeavour to 
know the will of Jehovah your God, for it is your 
best interest to follow His directions, and shall 
exceedingly fear to act against His will.

7. For the LORD your God brings you 
into a good land, a land of brooks of 
water, of fountains and depths that 
spring out of valleys and hills; 

7. For the Divine Love and Wisdom are leading you 
to a blessed state, a state abounding with pure 
truths, and where the truth concerning natural and 
spiritual things springs out from the Word into the 
natural mind and into the interior soul enlightened 
from heaven;

8. A land of wheat, and barley, and 

8. A state in which the natural mind will be well 

vines, and fig trees, and 
pomegranates; a land of oil olive, 
and honey; 

9. A land wherein you shall eat bread 

without scarceness, you shall not 
lack any thing in it; a land whose 
stones are iron, and out of whose 
hills you may dig brass. 

stored and endowed with good desires from 
heaven, both in interior and exterior things, and the
understanding be recruited with truths both as to 
spiritual and natural things, and with all useful 
knowledges for the regenerate life; a state 
abounding with pure and holy affections received 
from the Creator, and with all the delights that 
spring therefrom;

9. A state in which the soul will be plentifully 
recruited with good from heaven without 
scarceness, and in which all its spiritual wants will 
be supplied; a state in which sensual truths (i.e. 
truths based on the evidence of the senses) will 
agree with and confirm the truths of faith provided 
for the natural man, and out of the spiritual things 
of which you may procure good for your natural 
life.

10. When you have eaten and are full, 

10. When you are in the enjoyment of these things, 

then you shall bless the LORD your 
God for the good land which he has 
given you. 

and feel all your spiritual wants supplied, you shall
bless the goodness and wisdom of the Lord for the 
heavenly state of soul which you have received 
from Him.

11. Beware that you forget not the 

LORD your God, in not keeping his 
commandments, and his judgements,
and his statutes, which I command 
you this day: 

11. Beware lest you forget that all these good things 
are received from the Goodness and Wisdom of 
the Lord, and neglect to carry out His will in every
thought, word, and deed, as it is revealed to you 
from the Word,

12. Lest when you have eaten and are 
full, and have built goodly houses, 
and dwelt therein; 

12. Lest when you have received these good things, 

and feel all your wants supplied, and have thereby 
procured heavenly affections and enjoyed them, 

56

13. And when your herds and your 

flocks multiply, and your silver and 
your gold is multiplied, and all that 
you have is multiplied; 

14. Then your heart be lifted up, and you
forget the LORD your God, which 
brought you forth out of the land of 
Egypt, from the house of bondage; 

15. Who led you through that great and 
terrible wilderness, wherein were 
fiery serpents, and scorpions, and 
drought, where there was no water; 
who brought you forth water out of 
the rock of flint; 

16. Who fed you in the wilderness with 
manna, which your fathers knew not,
that he might humble you, and that 
he might prove you, to do you good 
at your latter end; 

13. And when all your powers for good in internal and
external things are increased, and when your 
intelligence and wisdom in spiritual things are 
increased, and all the things of heaven within you 
are multiplied,

14. Lest then your heart be lifted up with pride, and 

you forget to continually seek the inspiration of the
Divine Love and Wisdom, which brought you 
forth out of your unregenerate condition when 
your mind was enslaved by evil and falsity;

15. Who led you through those states of temptation in 
which there was a great and terrible void of all 
spiritual sustenance and hope, when the soul was 
oppressed by evil desires, evil deeds, and delusive 
errors and longings for a guidance, but where none
was to be found (wilderness of the serpent, the 
flying serpent and the scorpion; of thirst, where 
there were no waters, AC 8568); who brought forth
the living waters of truth out of the fundamental 
principle of belief and trust in the Lord Jesus 
Christ as the one only God;

16. Who sustained you in these states of temptation 
with good from Himself, which was foreign to 
your hereditary nature, that He might reduce the 
love of evil within you, and that the evil and good 
might be separated, and that He might gift you 
with heavenly affections at the end of your time of 
probation;

17. And you say in your heart, My 

17. And you cherish the thought in your interior soul 

power and the might of mine hand 
has gotten me this wealth. 

that your own powers and the exertions of your 
own strength have procured these spiritual riches.

18. But you shall remember the LORD 
your God: for it is he that gives you 
power to get wealth, that he may 
establish his covenant which he 
swore to your fathers, as it is this 
day. 

18. But you shall ever have present before you 

Jehovah God (the Lord Jesus Christ); it is He that 
gives you the power to acquire spiritual riches, that
He may carry out His gracious designs for those 
who will receive good from Himself, as you have 
already experienced in the state to which the soul 
has now advanced.

57

19. And it shall be, if you do at all forget
the LORD your God, and walk after 
other gods, and serve them, and 
worship them, I testify against you 
this day that you shall surely perish. 

20. As the nations which the LORD 

destroys before your face, so shall 
you perish; because you would not 
be obedient to the voice of the 
LORD your God. 

19. And it will certainly come to pass that if you forget
the precepts of Divine Love and Wisdom, and 
follow after falsities proceeding from your own 
evil heart, and obey them, and worship them as 
true, the Divine Word now plainly warns you that 
in this case your spiritual life will perish.

20. As those evils which the mercy of the Lord has 
driven out from the interiors of the soul, so will 
you yourselves be driven out from heaven, because
you would not attend to carry out in the life the 
laws of heavenly order proceeding from Divine 
Love and Wisdom (whereby alone you could be 
prepared for heaven).

Lord Jesus Christ has Himself gone before you 
through the regeneration; the love of good which 
proceeds from Him will destroy those principles of
evil, and drive them forth from the interiors of the 
soul; you shall, therefore, yourself be diligent to 
co-operate and to drive them out completely, and 
to destroy them, as you have received 
commandment from the Lord.

4. Speak not you in your heart, after 
that the LORD your God has cast 
them out from before you, saying, 
For my righteousness the LORD has 
brought me in to possess this land: 
but for the wickedness of these 
nations the LORD does drive them 
out from before you. 

4. Let not the thought be cherished in the mind after 
that these evils have been cast out from your soul 
by the Divine Goodness and Wisdom, that for any 
inherent righteousness in yourself the Lord has put
them under the regenerate will; but because the 
Lord knows the ruin these evils would work in the 
soul, therefore out of pure mercy He desires to 
drive them out from your soul.

59

5. Not for your righteousness, or for 

the uprightness of your heart, do you
go to possess their land: but for the 
wickedness of these nations the 
LORD your God does drive them 
out from before you, and that he may
perform the word which the LORD 
swore to your fathers, Abraham, 
Isaac, and Jacob. 

5. Not for any merit of your, nor for any integrity in 
your own heart, are you introduced into the 
heavenly states which come from their destruction;
but because of the horrible wickedness of these 
evils the Divine Love and Wisdom drive them out 
from the interiors of your soul that He may have 
compassion upon you, as promised in the Word to 
all who receive good from Him, whether in the 
celestial, spiritual, or natural degree of the mind. 
(See note, chap. i. verse 8.)

6. Understand therefore, that the 

6. Lay it well to heart, therefore, that the Divine 

LORD your God gives you not this 
good land to possess it for your 
righteousness; for you are a 
stiffnecked people. 

Goodness and Wisdom give you these heavenly 
states to possess them, not for any merit of your, 
for the heart of man is naturally averse to all good.

7. Remember, and forget not, how you 
provokedst the LORD your God to 
wrath in the wilderness: from the 
day that you did depart out of the 
land of Egypt, until you came to this 
place, you have been rebellious 
against the LORD. 

7. Remember and forget not how you have turned 
away from the precepts of Divine Love and 
Wisdom in temptations; from the day when you 
were first brought out of a natural unregenerate 
condition, even until the present condition of the 
mind, the soul has ever been averse to receive 
what proceeds from the Lord.

8. Also in Horeb you provoked the 

LORD to wrath, so that the LORD 
was angry with you to have 
destroyed you. 

8. Also when instructed in Divine truth it still turned 
away from its influence, so that the Divine influx 
was well-near rejected, and the spiritual life 
thereby destroyed.

9. When I was gone up into the mount 
to receive the tables of stone, even 
the tables of the covenant which the 
LORD made with you, then I abode 
in the mount forty days and forty 
nights, I neither did eat bread nor 
drink water: 

9. For when the interiors of the soul were elevated to 
a state of love to receive interior truths, truths the 
keeping of which would conjoin the soul more 
closely to the Lord, in that state the interiors of the 
soul were kept by the Lord under the influence of 
love to Him, whilst a full state of temptation, both 
as to the will and the understanding, was 
experienced, in which the soul seemed to be 
without any sustaining good and truth.

60

10. And the LORD delivered to me two 
tables of stone written with the 
finger of God; and on them was 
written according to all the words, 
which the LORD spoke with you in 
the mount out of the midst of the fire
in the day of the assembly. 

10. And the Lord then revealed to the interior 

perception of the soul that the Divine Word is 
essential Divine truth proceeding from Himself to 
conjoin mankind to heaven, and contains an 
internal sense relating to spiritual things agreeing 
with the external, being evidently the work of the 
Lord by Divine truth; and in them were seen all the
necessary instructions for the soul (and that they 
must be carried out in the life), according to the 
former perception of the necessity of carrying out 
the commandments of the Lord, which the soul 
had when raised to an interior state, and it was 
perceived by all its faculties that the 
commandments proceed from the Divine Love, 
and that the keeping of them is absolutely 
necessary for the welfare of the soul.

11. And it came to pass at the end of 

11. And thus it came to pass after a full state of 

forty days and forty nights, that the 
LORD gave me the two tables of 
stone, even the tables of the 
covenant. 

12. And the LORD said to me, Arise, get
you down quickly from here; for 
your people which you have brought
forth out of Egypt have corrupted 
themselves; they are quickly turned 
aside out of the way which I 
commanded them; they have made 
them a molten image. 

13. Furthermore the LORD spoke to me,
saying, I have seen this people, and, 
behold, it is a stiffnecked people: 

initiation and temptation, both as to the affections 
and thoughts, that the Lord delivered to the interior
perceptions of the soul a knowledge of the internal 
sense of the Word in the external relating to 
regeneration, and intended to unite the soul with 
heaven (AC 10451-53).

12. And it is then perceived from heaven that these 
interior perceptions must be exalted in the soul, 
and that it is imperative that they should reform the
outer practical life; for the natural principle which 
has been brought forth by the reception of truth 
from the Word out of its unregenerate condition 
corrupts the Divine truth, and perpetually turns 
aside from the path pointed out by the perception 
of the Divine will when in an interior state: it loves
what proceeds from its own evil heart.

13. And a clear perception is given to the higher 

faculties of the soul of the quality of its hereditary 
nature, and it is seen to be absolutely averse to all 
good and truth:

61

14. Let me alone, that I may destroy 

them, and blot out their name from 
under heaven: and I will make of 
you a nation mightier and greater 
than they. 

15. So I turned and came down from the 
mount, and the mount burned with 
fire: and the two tables of the 
covenant were in my two hands. 

16. And I looked, and, behold, you had 
sinned against the LORD your God, 
and had made you a molten calf: you
had turned aside quickly out of the 
way which the LORD had 
commanded you. 

17. And I took the two tables, and cast 

them out of my two hands, and break
them before your eyes. 

18. And I fell down before the LORD, 
as at the first, forty days and forty 
nights: I did neither eat bread, nor 
drink water, because of all your sins 
which you sinned, in doing wickedly
in the sight of the LORD, to provoke
him to anger. 

14. It is hopeless to intercede for the hereditary will, 
for it is absolutely against heaven; it is necessary 
that its old qualities should be blotted out from the 
interiors of the mind, and the Lord will make, in 
the higher perceptions of the soul given from 
Himself, a new regenerate will far more powerful 
for good and more enriched with truths than the 
old depraved will. 

15. And the state of the soul is then inverted and 

brought down to practical life from its elevated 
perceptions of Divine truth, in which it was 
imbued with the spirit of love to the Lord in its 
interiors; and the will of the Lord was made known
to it from the internal sense of the Word agreeing 
with the external now revealed to it, and 
containing instructions intended to bring the soul 
into conformity with the laws of heaven.

16. And from this state examination is made into the 
exterior principles of the mind, and behold, they 
are seen to be averse to all the goodness and 
wisdom which flows from heaven, and worship 
what favours their own depraved natural 
affections, and perpetually turn aside from the 
Lord's will as revealed to the soul.

17. Thus there is no agreement between the perception
of what is good and true given to the spiritual man,
and the things loved by the natural man; the 
perverted state of the latter deprives the spiritual 
mind of the power to will good and understand 
truth, and this rupture between heaven and the 
outer life is made evident even to the natural man 
himself.

18. And this brings deep sorrow and humiliation upon 
the higher faculties of the soul, which desire to 
receive the life of heaven, and, as in former 
temptations, a struggle for the mastery ensues 
between the spiritual and natural desires and 
perceptions: the spiritual mind can receive neither 
good affections nor truths from the Lord because 
of the evils committed by the natural man in 
turning away from the perception which is given 
of the Divine will, and thereby rejecting all the 
influence which proceeds from heaven.

62

19. For I was afraid of the anger and hot 

19. For a terrible fear comes upon the spiritual man 

displeasure, with which the LORD 
was angry against you to destroy 
you. But the LORD hearkened to me
at that time also. 

20. And the LORD was very angry with 
Aaron to have destroyed him: and I 
prayed for Aaron also the same time.

21. And I took your sin, the calf which 

you had made, and burnt it with fire, 
and stamped it, and ground it very 
small, even until it was as small as 
dust: and I cast the dust thereof into 
the brook that descended out of the 
mount. 

22. And at Taberah, and at Massah, and 
at Kibrothhattaavah, you provoked 
the LORD to wrath. 

23. Likewise when the LORD sent you 
from Kadeshbarnea, saying, Go up 
and possess the land which I have 
given you; then you rebelled against 
the commandment of the LORD 
your God, and you believed him not,
nor hearkened to his voice. 

24. You have been rebellious against the 
LORD from the day that I knew you.

lest by contempt and rejection by the natural mind 
of the things of heaven and the Church, the soul 
should be cut off from the Lord, and its spiritual 
life destroyed. But in these temptations the Lord 
helps and fights for the spiritual man.

20. And in that state the externals of the Church and of
worship (AC 10397), separate from the internal 
principle, are averse to the good and truth which 
comes from heaven; and the interior faculties 
strive to bring external religious principle into 
conformity with the order of heaven.

21. And the spiritual man searches out what is evil in 
the loves and worship of the external man which 
separates the soul from heaven, a resemblance of 
good in external form only, proceeding from man's
own evil heart, and finds it to be defiled with self-
love; and that its good and truths are profaned by 
being applied to evil loves till they are utterly 
destroyed; and that the falses which proceed from 
infernal delights are mixed with the truths which 
flow from heaven (AC 9391).

22. And by complaints arising from evil desires 

(Numb 11:1-3), and by distrust in the Lord, even to
despairing of His help, and thereby almost giving 
up in temptations, and by distaste for the simple 
perception of good flowing from heaven, and 
craving for external delights, the natural man ever 
rejects the good influences which flow in from the 
Lord.

23. And also when the Lord gives the soul a 

perception of heavenly blessedness and the way to 
attain it, and invites the man to acquire the 
happiness prepared for it, the natural man is 
unwilling to follow this dictate of the Divine Love 
and Wisdom, and does not believe in the 
blessedness in the heavenly life, and refuses to 
listen to the internal dictate by striving after it.

24. The natural man has ever turned away from and 
rejected the influences of Divine Love and 
Wisdom from the day that regeneration first 
commenced in the soul.

63

25. Thus I fell down before the LORD 
forty days and forty nights, as I fell 
down at the first; because the LORD
had said he would destroy you. 

25. Thus, again, the spiritual man was brought into a 
state of deep humiliation before the Lord by 
temptations both as to the affections and the 
understanding of truth, as on the former occasions;
because it feared that the soul would be cut off 
from all conjunction with heaven and spiritual life,

26. I prayed therefore to the LORD, and 
said, O Lord GOD, destroy not your 
people and your inheritance, which 
you have redeemed through your 
greatness, which you have brought 
forth out of Egypt with a mighty 
hand. 

26. And besought the Lord, saying, O Jehovah God, 

let not the perceptions of truth and the aspirations 
after good with which You have gifted the soul by 
Your great love for mankind perish, which You 
have brought from under the dominion of the 
natural unregenerate heart by the omnipotence of 
Your Providence.

27. Remember your servants, Abraham, 
Isaac, and Jacob; look not to the 
stubbornness of this people, nor to 
their wickedness, nor to their sin: 

28. Lest the land whence you broughtest
us out say, Because the LORD was 
not able to bring them into the land 
which he promised them, and 
because he hated them, he has 
brought them out to slay them in the 
wilderness. 

29. Yet they are your people and your 
inheritance, which you broughtest 
out by your mighty power and by 
your stretched out arm. 

27. Have mercy upon the regenerate principles of the 

soul that desires to serve You—its new desire to 
act from love to the Lord, its love of truth and 
desire to carry the same out in the life; look not to 
the stubbornness of the unregenerate heart, nor to 
its love of evil and absolute departure from the life
of heaven,

28. Lest the natural mind should despair and the 

thought should arise therein that the soul cannot be
brought to those blessed states which are promised
in the Word to those who are regenerate, and that 
the Lord is against or does not care for the 
regenerate; and that if the dictates of the Word to 
the spiritual man are followed, the happiness of the
whole man will be destroyed by his being brought 
to a miserable condition without any delight.

29. Yet these dictates to the spiritual man and desires 
of the new regenerate will are planted in the soul 
by the Divine Love and Wisdom, and have been 
brought forth and developed by the Lord out of a 
merely natural condition of the mind by His 
Divine power and by the omnipotent workings of 
His Providence.

64

 
Deuteronomy Chapter 10

Verses 1-5. That a new regenerate will is required in the natural mind.
Verses 6, 7. Progression in the religious opinions.
Verses 8-11. The faculty for receiving good in the new will entirely from heaven.
Verses 12, 13. The whole duty of man is to keep the commandments.
Verses 14-22. The desire of the Lord to save all as far as possible. 

1. At that time the LORD said to me, 

1. AND in that state perception is given to the 

Hew you two tables of stone like the 
first, and come up to me into the 
mount, and make you an ark of 
wood. 

2. And I will write on the tables the 
words that were in the first tables 
which you brakest, and you shall put
them in the ark. 

2.

spiritual faculties of the soul from the Lord, that 
the soul must, as it were from itself, prepare the 
heart to learn and carry out the truths of the Word 
which would conjoin it to the Lord, as perceived 
in the former state, and that the higher faculties 
must ascend into a state of love to the Lord, and 
seek help from Him, and thus acquire in the 
inmost soul a new regenerate will for good, 
receptive of genuine truth from the Lord.

The Lord will then co-operate with these 
endeavours to acquire the laws of order and of 
heaven, and write upon the heart all those truths 
of which the soul has had perception, but which 
have been dissipated by non-reception by the 
natural man, and they shall thus be stored up in 
the new regenerate will.

3. And I made an ark of shittim wood, 
and hewed two tables of stone like 
the first, and went up into the mount,
having the two tables in mine hand. 

3. And thus the soul acquires a new regenerate will 
from the good of the Lord's Divine Humanity 
(that is, from the character of God as revealed in 
the Lord Jesus Christ), and endeavours to prepare 
the heart to receive Divine truths which would 
conjoin the soul to the Lord, according to the 
former perception of His will, and the higher 
faculties rise into a state of love to the Lord, and 
seek His aid whilst endeavouring to carry out His 
laws in all the actions of life. [Note.—It is said the
new regenerate will is acquired from the good of 
the Lord's Divine Humanity; that is, from the 
Lord Jesus Christ, because, apart from Divine 
good as revealed in His character, the human 
mind is incapable of forming any true idea of 
what real good is, and of course of acquiring any 
new will derived from good.]

65

 
4. And he wrote on the tables, 

4. And the Lord impresses upon the heart thus 

according to the first writing, the ten 
commandments, which the LORD 
spoke to you in the mount out of the 
midst of the fire in the day of the 
assembly: and the LORD gave them 
to me. 

prepared to receive them the truths necessary to 
salvation from the Divine Word, according to the 
first perception, even all that it is necessary for the
soul to do, as far as it can receive it, which had 
been made manifest to the soul when raised to a 
state of good proceeding from the Divine Love, 
when the absolute necessity of carrying out the 
laws of Divine order in the whole life was 
revealed to every faculty of the mind; and the 
Lord so impressed the internal man with these 
truths that they seemed to be his own.

5. And I turned myself and came down 
from the mount, and put the tables in
the ark which I had made; and there 
they be, as the LORD commanded 
me. 

5. And the internal man then turned from this state 

of perception to regulate the external life, and 
stored up the truths received from heaven in the 
new regenerate will, where they remain to 
regulate the life, as commanded from the Lord.

6. And the children of Israel took their 
journey from Beeroth of the children
of Jaakan to Mosera: there Aaron 
died, and there he was buried; and 
Eleazar his son ministered in the 
priest's office in his stead. 

7. From thence they journeyed to 

Gudgodah; and from Gudgodah to 
Jotbath, a land of rivers of waters. 

6. And the soul proceeds in the work of regeneration
from this state to a new one derived from the 
Lord's Human Essence; in which its old religious 
doctrines and worship are changed, and become 
less external, and others more suitable to the new 
state, in which the life is considered of more 
importance than doctrine, are adopted in their 
stead.
[Note.—Aaron died on Mount Hor, on the borders
of the land of Edom (Num 20:22-29). Edom 
represents the Human Essence of the Lord. (See 
AC Index.)]

7. And thus the soul is brought by successive stages 
to a state in which it is abundantly supplied with 
wisdom and intelligence from the pure truths of 
the Word.

8. At that time the LORD separated the

8. And in that state it is revealed to the soul by the 

tribe of Levi, to bear the ark of the 
covenant of the LORD, to stand 
before the LORD to minister to him, 
and to bless in his name, to this day. 

Lord that all its salvation is from the love and 
mercy of the Lord and conjunction with Him 
(Levi); it is this alone which supports the new 
regenerate will by which the soul is united to 
heaven; it is this which leads the soul to seek the 
presence of the Lord and to carry out His will, and
gifts it with heavenly blessings by conforming it 
to the Divine Likeness (or the Lord Jesus Christ) 
in every state.

66

9. Wherefore Levi has no part nor

inheritance with his brethren; the 
LORD is his inheritance, according 
as the LORD your God promised 
him. 

man himself, or inherent in his faculties; but is 
from the Lord alone, and proceeds from His 
Divine Goodness and Wisdom as is written in the 
Word.

10. And I stayed in the mount, according
to the first time, forty days and forty 
nights; and the LORD hearkened to 
me at that time also, and the LORD 
would not destroy you. 

10. And the higher faculties of the soul are kept in an 
exalted state of love to the Lord as in former 
temptations till these things are fully impressed 
upon both the will and the understanding by 
struggles against the opposing evils and falsities; 
and thus communication is opened with the 
Divine principle again, so that the spiritual life of 
the soul is preserved from destruction.

11. And the LORD said to me, Arise, 

11. And the spiritual faculties of the soul perceive 

take your journey before the people, 
that they may go in and possess the 
land, which I swore to their fathers 
to give to them. 

from the Lord that they must strive after the 
highest good and virtue they can attain to, and 
lead after them all the faculties of the soul that 
they may become more interior (or perfect), and 
thus be gifted with those heavenly affections 
which are promised by the Lord to those who are 
in good from Himself.

12. And now, Israel, what does the 

LORD your God require of you, but 
to fear the LORD your God, to walk 
in all his ways, and to love him, and 
to serve the LORD your God with 
all your heart and with all your soul, 

12. And now, O regenerating soul, what does the Lord
your God require of you, but to fear to act against 
the Divine Love and Wisdom, and to regulate 
your life by these Divine principles, and to love 
them above all things, and to serve the Lord your 
God (the Lord Jesus Christ) with all your will and 
with all your understanding?

13. To keep the commandments of the 
LORD, and his statutes, which I 
command you this day for your 
good? 

13. To do everything which the soul perceives from 

the Lord to be right both in will and deed, for it is 
seen in this state that to follow this perception is 
the soul's truest good.

14. Behold, the heaven and the heaven 

14. Behold the spiritual man and all the holy 

of heavens is the LORD's your God, 
the earth also, with all that therein is.

affections of good and truth within you, and all 
the highest aspirations after real good and 
happiness you have ever conceived of, are derived
from the Love and Wisdom flowing from the 
Humanity of the Lord; and the natural mind also 
and all its faculties receptive of anything really 
good.

67

15. Only the LORD had a delight in 
your fathers to love them, and he 
chose their seed after them, even you
above all people, as it is this day. 

15. And out of pure mercy the Lord has a delight in 

what is receptive of good affections from Himself 
to enable Him to bless all, and selects those 
principles which are derived therefrom, even 
those which are received into the soul by 
regeneration to be His peculiar care, as in the 
present state.

16. Circumcise therefore the foreskin of 

16. Let those who are regenerating, therefore, purify 

your heart, and be no more 
stiffnecked. 

their wills from all evil, and no more reject the 
holy influences from heaven.

17. For the LORD your God is God of 

gods, and Lord of lords, a great God,
a mighty, and a terrible, which 
regards not persons, nor takes 
reward: 

17. For the Lord Jesus Christ, or Jehovah, whom you 
seek to follow, is the very spring and fountain of 
all truth (Elohe, Elohim), and the spring and 
fountain of all good; the Divine Omnipotent One, 
from whom is all power, before whose presence 
what is evil cannot stand, which looks not at 
externals nor to the outward actions of men, nor 
can you please Him with any external worship 
which is not of the heart:

18. He does execute the judgement of 

18.

the fatherless and widow, and loves 
the stranger, in giving him food and 
clothing. 

In His mercy He does lead those who are in good 
and desire truth to find it, and by truth leads those 
who earnestly seek them to good and holy 
affections; he loves those who are willing to be 
instructed in heavenly things, and recruits them 
with the spiritual nourishment of good affections, 
and clothes them with suitable truths.

19. Love you therefore the stranger: for 
you were strangers in the land of 
Egypt. 

20. You shall fear the LORD your God; 
him shall you serve, and to him shall
you cleave, and swear by his name. 

19. Cherish, therefore, all those faculties in the soul 

which sincerely desire instruction in heavenly 
things; for by means of these what is spiritual 
within you was brought out of the mental slavery 
of the unregenerate state.

20. You shall reverence and exceedingly fear to 
offend against the goodness and wisdom 
proceeding from the Lord's Humanity; these are to
be the chief object of your worship which you 
shall serve and adhere to in every thought, will, 
and deed, and regard as the test and criterion by 
which to judge of all things.

68

21. He is your praise, and he is your 
God, that has done for you these 
great and terrible things, which your 
eyes have seen. 

22. Your fathers went down into Egypt 

with threescore and ten persons; and 
now the LORD your God has made 
you as the stars of heaven for 
multitude. 

21. These are what give you true worth of character, 
these are worthy of reverence and worship, these 
have given you all that you have of good, and 
made you abominate your evil propensities, as has
been made evident to your understanding.

22. The goods of innocence and childhood with you 
were insinuated by the Lord amongst the 
knowledges and doctrinals existing in the mind in 
the unregenerate state as far as was possible; and 
now the Divine Goodness and Wisdom of the 
Lord have by them completely replenished the 
mind with internal truths and knowledges of faith.

Deuteronomy Chapter 11

Verses 1-9. A greater obligation is imposed upon those regenerating than upon others to obey the 
Divine commands; because they have been able more clearly to perceive the operations of Providence.
Verses 10-12. The difference between a persuasive and a rational faith.
Verses 13-17. The rational understanding given to those who carry out the Divine will.
Verses 18-21. The Divine will must therefore be stamped upon the whole life.
Verses 22-25. The regenerate will then be endowed with all things.
Verses 26-32. A blessing and a curse thus set before the soul according as the Divine commands are 
obeyed or rejected. 

1. Therefore you shall love the LORD 
your God, and keep his charge, and 
his statutes, and his judgements, and 
his commandments, always. 

2. And know you this day: for I speak 
not with your children which have 
not known, and which have not seen 
the chastisement of the LORD your 
God, his greatness, his mighty hand, 
and his stretched out arm, 

3. And his miracles, and his acts, which
he did in the midst of Egypt to 
Pharaoh the king of Egypt, and to all
his land;

Wisdom as revealed to you in the Lord Jesus 
Christ, and shall keep all those things which are 
ordained by Him in the Word, the principles of 
action laid down by Him, His decisions in every 
difficulty, and His commandments for the life at all
times and in all states.

2. And let the soul now clearly perceive and trust in 

the Divine will of the Lord; for a greater obligation
is imposed upon it than upon those who are in 
externals and have no perception of the Divine 
will, and are ignorant of the dealings of the Divine 
Love and Wisdom in correcting the soul, the 
omnipotent power of His goodness and the 
profound wisdom of His acts, and their influence 
in Providence over all things for the good of the 
soul,

truth to the soul, and His operations by temptations
upon the interiors of the natural unregenerate 
mind, upon the falsities arising from self-derived 
intelligence, and upon all the cupidities agreeing 
therewith,

chariots; how he made the water of

LORD has destroyed them to this 
day; 

unregenerate principle, which loves the life of the 
world more than the life of heaven in the soul, 
with the false reasonings and doctrines thence 
derived; how He permitted the waters of 
temptation and affliction to surround the soul, by 
which the emptiness of these things was made 
apparent, and by which they were overwhelmed as
they attempted to prevent the deliverance of 
spiritual faculties of the soul; and how the Divine 
goodness has destroyed them out of the soul, as in 
the present state;

5. And what he did to you in the 

wilderness, until you came into this 
place; 

5. And how He has led you through all the defects of 
good and truth that have arisen, till you have been 
brought to the present state;

6. And what he did to Dathan and 

6. And what He did upon the false doctrines which 

Abiram, the sons of Eliab, the son of
Reuben: how the earth opened her 
mouth, and swallowed them up, and 
their households, and their tents, and
all the substance that was in their 
possession, in the midst of all Israel: 

are derived in long series from perverted religious 
faith, which place doctrines or ceremonial in the 
place of a life of true charity and duty: how the 
common perception of truth, such as exists even 
with those who are out of the Church, helped the 
soul by showing the fallacy of these notions and 
swallowing up those false doctrines, with their 
appearances of truth and worship from good, 
together with all the apparent religious feelings 
and intelligence derived from them, out of the 
midst of the spiritual mind. (See AE 764, 765.) 
[Note.—The arguments even of those who reject 
revelation and who reason from nature only, assist 
the development of a real perception of truth in the
soul by clearing the mind from the falsities of a 
blind persuasive faith; that is to say, of a 
persuasion that any dogma is to be believed 
unaccompanied by any internal and rational 
perception of its truth, and that such blind belief in
any dogma can save without a well-spent life.]

7. But your eyes have seen all the great 
acts of the LORD which he did. 

7. But the marvelous operations of the Divine 

Providence in these things have been made clearly 
manifest to the perceptions of the soul.

71

8. Therefore shall you keep all the 

commandments which I command 
you this day, that you may be strong,
and go in and possess the land, 
whither you go to possess it; 

9. And that you may prolong your days
in the land, which the LORD swore 
to your fathers to give to them and to
their seed, a land that flows with 
milk and honey. 

10. For the land, whither you go in to 
possess it, is not as the land of 
Egypt, from whence you came out, 
where you sowedst your seed, and 
wateredst it with your foot, as a 
garden of herbs: 

8. Therefore shall you be extremely careful to follow 
the dictates of the Lord, which are now perceived 
to be His will, from the Word, that the soul may be
fortified by the Divine presence, and progress 
towards internal things, and possess those 
heavenly thoughts and affections, to possess which
should be the main object and aim of the 
regenerating soul;

9. And that the states through which the soul passes 
may be complete and filled with good, and thus it 
may inherit in the next world those heavenly 
blessings which the Lord has promised to those 
who are in good and in truths derived from good, 
states full of the good of spiritual truth and of the 
eternal felicity thence derived.

10. For the interior states of the mind with which the 
Lord will gift you, are not as those external states 
of religion existing in the natural mind and the 
memory only, from which you have been brought 
out; in which you were instructed in doctrinals 
formulated in the natural mind and supported by 
arguments derived from the natural principle, as 
the sciences of worldly knowledges are studied:

11. But the land, whither you go to 
possess it, is a land of hills and 
valleys, and drinks water of the rain 
of heaven: 

11. But the state to which the Lord is leading the soul 
to gift it with, is a state of mutual love and the 
truths agreeing therewith, and receives pure truths 
from the Lord direct by influx from heaven:

72

12. A land which the LORD your God 

cares for: the eyes of the LORD your
God are always upon it, from the 
beginning of the year even to the end
of the year. 

13. And it shall come to pass, if you 
shall hearken diligently to my 
commandments which I command 
you this day, to love the LORD your 
God, and to serve him with all your 
heart and with all your soul, 

14. That I will give you the rain of your 
land in his due season, the first rain 
and the latter rain, that you may 
gather in your corn, and your wine, 
and your oil. 

15. And I will send grass in your fields 
for your cattle, that you may eat and 
be full. 

12. A state which is more immediately receptive of the
Divine Love and Wisdom; and which has ever a 
clear perception of truth and genuine wisdom by 
influx from the Divine Love and Wisdom, in all 
the alternating states of spiritual life.
[Note (verses 10-12).—There is a great difference 
between hereditary faith, or faith derived from 
instruction in childhood, and that derived from a 
rational perception of truth. In the one case the 
mind simply receives what is taught in the 
memory, which may be true or may be false; in the
other it receives what is true and rejects what is 
false from an inward standard and perception of 
what is true or false. In the following verses this 
perception is promised to those who from the heart
endeavour to carry out the Lord's will. (See also 
John 7:17.)]

13. And it shall come to pass that if the soul will 
diligently hearken to and carry out all the 
perceptions of the Lord's will which it has in this 
state, to love the Divine Love and Wisdom 
revealed in the Lord Jesus Christ (the Lord's 
Divine Humanity is the God of the New Church), 
and to resign to Him the whole will and 
understanding,

14. That the Lord will replenish your soul with influx 
from heaven to supply all its needs, both for your 
spiritual states and for your natural states, that you 
may be abundantly furnished with every kind of 
good in the external man, and with spiritual truth 
and with celestial good.

15. And the Lord will provide spiritual nourishment 
for all the affections of the natural mind in your 
soul, that they may be incorporated in your new 
spiritual nature, and that you may be satisfied with 
good.

16. Take heed to yourselves, that your 
heart be not deceived, and you turn 
aside, and serve other gods, and 
worship them; 

16. Take heed to yourselves that your heart be not 
deceived, and you turn aside and serve falses, 
which favour the evil loves of the unregenerate 
heart, and love them supremely,

73

17. And then the LORD's wrath be 

17. And become averse to the good and truth 

kindled against you, and he shut up 
the heaven, that there be no rain, and
that the land yield not her fruit; and 
lest you perish quickly from off the 
good land which the LORD gives 
you. 

proceeding from the Lord's Divine Humanity (the 
Lord Jesus Christ); and thus the internal man or 
the entrance to heaven within you become closed, 
and there be no influx from there; and that thus the
soul will bring forth no good fruit, and you will 
quickly lose all the life of heaven within you, 
which proceeds solely from the Divine Humanity 
implanted in you. (John 15:5, 6.)

18. Therefore shall you lay up these my 
words in your heart and in your soul,
and bind them for a sign upon your 
hand, that they may be as frontlets 
between your eyes. 

18. Therefore shall you lay up the Divine words, the 
revelations of the Divine will, in your heart, and 
let them permeate your understanding; you shall 
stamp their impress upon every act of your new 
regenerate will, and they shall be the ruling centre 
of your understanding.

19. And you shall teach them your 

19. And you shall impress them upon all the derivative

children, speaking of them when you
sit in your house, and when you 
walk by the way, when you liest 
down, and when you risest up. 

20. And you shall write them upon the 
door posts of your house, and upon 
your gates: 

21. That your days may be multiplied, 

and the days of your children, in the 
land which the LORD swore to your 
fathers to give them, as the days of 
heaven upon the earth. 

principles of the mind, meditating on them when 
you are retired into the inmost recesses of your 
will, and when your intentions go forth into 
thoughts and deeds, and they shall be present with 
you when your mind is engaged in worldly 
business (and your soul is, as it were, asleep), and 
when you are elevated by the Lord towards more 
interior things.

20. And you shall write them upon the entrance to 

your inmost will, that they may regulate the things 
admitted into and proceeding from the mind, and 
all your communications with the outer world.

21. That all your varying states may be filled with the 
life that proceeds from obeying the truths of the 
Lord, and all your thoughts thence derived, in that 
perfected state of life which the Lord has promised
to those who will attain good by following Him in 
the regeneration, and that thus your life even upon 
earth may become like the life of heaven.

74

22. For if you shall diligently keep all 
these commandments which I 
command you, to do them, to love 
the LORD your God, to walk in all 
his ways, and to cleave to him; 

22. For if you will diligently attend to all the 

perceptions which are given you of the Lord's will 
by the Word to carry them out in the life, to love 
above all things the goodness and wisdom 
proceeding from the Lord's Divine Humanity, to 
form your life in all respects according to the 
pattern set by Him, and thus to become conjoined 
with Him,

23. Then will the LORD drive out all 

23. Then will the Lord drive out the evils of the soul 

these nations from before you, and 
you shall possess greater nations and
mightier than yourselves. 

now made manifest from the interiors of the heart, 
and you shall acquire faculties more receptive of 
good than those which the natural man imagines 
would be derived from self-intelligence.

24. Every place whereon the soles of 

24. Every state to which you shall be conducted in 

your feet shall tread shall be yours: 
from the wilderness and Lebanon, 
from the river, the river Euphrates, 
even to the uttermost sea shall your 
coast be. 

your natural life shall become subservient to the 
life of heaven within you; from those states of 
desolation in which a total want of all spiritual 
nourishment and comfort is felt, and those in 
which the truths of faith were implanted, from 
those states of wisdom formed by the influx of 
things spiritual into things rational, and things 
rational into things natural (AE 569), even to the 
whole of the knowledges and scientifics of the 
memory, shall be made use of in forming the new 
regenerate character.

25. There shall no man be able to stand 
before you: for the LORD your God 
shall lay the fear of you and the 
dread of you upon all the land that 
you shall tread upon, as he has said 
to you. 

25. No falsity shall be able to bar the progress of the 

mind towards intelligence for the Divine Love and 
Wisdom will inspire the goods and truths 
proceeding from Himself within you with 
convincing power in all the varying states to which
you shall be brought in this natural world, 
according to his promises in the Word.

26. Behold, I set before you this day a 

26. See clearly, then, that the Word in this state sets 

blessing and a curse; 

before the soul a blessing and a curse—

27. A blessing, if you obey the 

commandments of the LORD your 
God, which I command you this day:

27. A blessing if you obey and carry out the dictates of
the Divine Love and Wisdom which are now most 
clearly manifested to the soul,

75

28. And a curse, if you will not obey the 

commandments of the LORD your 
God, but turn aside out of the way 
which I command you this day, to go
after other gods, which you have not 
known. 

28. And a curse if you will not obey the dictates of the 
Divine Love and Wisdom, but turn aside from the 
course so plainly pointed out in this state from the 
Word to be the right one, and place other things 
than the Lord and His kingdom in the supreme 
place against the perception thus given you.

29. And it shall come to pass, when the 
LORD your God has brought you in 
to the land whither you go to possess
it, that you shall put the blessing 
upon mount Gerizim, and the curse 
upon mount Ebal. 

30. Are they not on the other side 

Jordan, by the way where the sun 
goes down, in the land of the 
Canaanites, which dwell in the 
champaign over against Gilgal, 
beside the plains of Moreh? 

31. For you shall pass over Jordan to go 
in to possess the land which the 
LORD your God gives you, and you 
shall possess it, and dwell therein. 

32. And you shall observe to do all the 
statutes and judgements which I set 
before you this day. 

29. And it shall come to pass when the Divine Love 

and Wisdom have brought you to the heavenly 
state which the Lord designs to give you as your 
own, that you shall plainly put before the mind and
keep in remembrance that happiness proceeds 
from love to the Lord and keeping His 
commandments, and that misery proceeds from the
love of self and rejection of the Lord.

30. These things are clearly perceived by those who 
are within the Lord's kingdom, when the love of 
self begins to be subdued and moderated in the 
soul, as is the case with those who begin to act 
from the spiritual motives which have place in the 
soul when it has entered the Lord's kingdom, and 
into the first states of perception thence derived. 

31. For you are now to be introduced into the heavenly
kingdom of the Lord, and to possess all those 
blessed states which proceed from carrying out the
dictates of the Divine Love and Wisdom, and they 
shall be yours as if from yourselves, and you shall 
be ever in them.

32. And you shall then observe and do all the things 
which are perceived to be necessary by internal 
dictate from the revelations given in every state 
from the Word, both in spiritual and in natural 
things.

76

Deuteronomy Chapter 12

Verses 1-16. On the rejection of evil and appropriation of good; the Lord's Divine Humanity is the test 
of all real good.
Verses 17-19. The genuine good from the Lord is not to be attributed to self.
Verses 20-28. Good may be acquired by self-effort, but must be kept distinct from that flowing from the 
Lord.
Verses 29-32. A caution against being again enticed by evil loves. 

1. These are the statutes and 

judgements, which you shall observe
to do in the land, which the LORD 
God of your fathers gives you to 
possess it, all the days that you live 
upon the earth. 

2. You shall utterly destroy all the 

places, wherein the nations which 
you shall possess served their gods, 
upon the high mountains, and upon 
the hills, and under every green tree: 

3. And you shall overthrow their altars,
and break their pillars, and burn their
groves with fire; and you shall hew 
down the graven images of their 
gods, and destroy the names of them 
out of that place. 

1. THESE are the rules by which you shall regulate 
your conduct both as to general principles and in 
particular cases when introduced into those 
heavenly states which the Lord by His Love and 
Wisdom (from whom proceeds all that is good in 
the soul) will cause to become your in every state 
through which you are conducted during your life 
in the natural world,

2. You shall utterly destroy every state of affection 
and thought in the soul, which has been a means 
for the evils of the unregenerate heart now 
dispossessed from the government of the soul, to 
cause the soul to love supremely what is evil and 
false, states in which self-love and worldly loves 
and the allurements of the senses predominated.

3. You shall overthrow the affections of these evil 
loves, and break down the falses which support 
them, and the intelligence derived from them 
which is defiled with self-love shall be consumed 
by zeal for heaven, and shall be rejected; and you 
shall extirpate the simulated appearances of good 
in externals derived from self, which formed the 
supreme worship of the soul in those states, and 
completely remove the quality of them from the 
mind.

4. You shall not do so to the LORD 

4. You shall be extremely careful lest anything 

your God. 

should be rejected from the soul which proceeds 
from the Divine Love and Wisdom.

77

 
5. But to the place which the LORD 

your God shall choose out of all 
your tribes to put his name there, 
even to his habitation shall you seek,
and thither you shall come: 

5. But you shall cherish those states which you shall 
perceive to be filled with the influence of the 
Divine Love and Wisdom operating upon the 
powers of the soul, namely, those proceeding from 
the Divine Humanity, which is the temple of the 
Lord: you shall seek these states, and bring the 
whole man into conformity with them.

6. And thither you shall bring your 

6. And to these states proceeding from the Lord's 

burnt offerings, and your sacrifices, 
and your tithes, and heave offerings 
of your hand, and your vows, and 
your freewill offerings, and the 
firstlings of your herds and of your 
flocks: 

Divine Humanity shall you ascribe all the goods of
love and the truths of faith thence derived within 
you, and all the remains of the holy states which 
you have acquired in temptations; and all your 
efforts which are vivified by the Divine influx, 
your sacred desires, and your worship from 
freedom or genuine love, and all the means of 
regeneration given from the Lord for the internal 
and external man. [Note.—For the signification of 
remains, see AC Index.]

7. And there you shall eat before the 
LORD your God, and you shall 
rejoice in all that you put your hand 
to, you and your households, 
wherein the LORD your God has 
blessed you. 

8. You shall not do after all the things 
that we do here this day, every man 
whatever is right in his own eyes. 

7. And then shall the Goodness and Wisdom 

proceeding from the Lord's Divine Humanity be 
appropriated to the soul, and all its powers shall be
exercised for good with joy, both the interior will 
and all the faculties with which the soul has been 
gifted by the Divine Love and Wisdom.

8. You shall not then think and act as heretofore in 
the external unregenerate state of the mind in 
which the understanding acted from natural light 
alone;

9. For you are not as yet come to the 

9. For the soul has not as yet come to the heavenly 

rest and to the inheritance, which the
LORD your God gives you. 

state, and to those interior faculties and 
perceptions with which it will be gifted by the 
Divine Love and Wisdom.

10. But when you go over Jordan, and 
dwell in the land which the LORD 
your God gives you to inherit, and 
when he gives you rest from all your
enemies round about, so that you 
dwell in safety; 

10. But when you enter into this interior state, and the 
soul is imbued with those heavenly feelings and 
faculties with which it will be endowed by the 
Divine Love and Wisdom, and the Lord gives you 
victory over the evils and falses which have 
formerly infested you, so that you are relieved 
from the inroads of evil spirits into the soul,

78

11. Then there shall be a place which the
LORD your God shall choose to 
cause his name to dwell there; 
thither shall you bring all that I 
command you; your burnt offerings, 
and your sacrifices, your tithes, and 
the heave offering of your hand, and 
all your choice vows which you vow
to the LORD: 

12. And you shall rejoice before the 
LORD your God, you, and your 
sons, and your daughters, and your 
menservants, and your maidservants,
and the Levite that is within your 
gates; for as much as he has no part 
nor inheritance with you. 

13. Take heed to yourself that you offer 
not your burnt offerings in every 
place that you see: 

14. But in the place which the LORD 
shall choose in one of your tribes, 
there you shall offer your burnt 
offerings, and there you shall do all 
that I command you. 

11. Then the Goodness and Wisdom of the Lord will 
plant the qualities that flow from His Divine 
Humanity in the interiors of the soul, and this shall
be the standard to which you shall endeavour to 
conform the whole soul as you shall receive 
perception from Him, your affections and the 
truths thence derived, the remains of good and 
truth preserved in the internal man after 
temptations, and all the efforts of the mind vivified
by influx from the Lord, and all the sacred desires 
and aspirations after holiness which you receive 
from heaven:

12. And the soul shall be filled with happiness from 
the influx of the Divine Love and Wisdom, both 
the interior will and the truths and affections 
thence derived, and the subservient goods and 
truths in the natural principle, and the desire after 
genuine good which is in the external mind, for as 
much as these are not derived in any way from the 
man himself.

13. Take heed to yourself in your worship that you 

ascribe not to the Lord the affections derived from 
any doctrines or principles which you shall 
perceive to be in the natural mind without 
discrimination.

14. But in that religious state, and from those doctrines
which the Lord Himself shall show you to be right 
amongst the faculties of the mind, and which are 
derived from Himself as revealed in the Lord Jesus
Christ, by these shall you worship the Lord, and 
ascribe to Him the affection derived from them, 
and in this shall you be able to know and carry out 
His will.

15. Notwithstanding you may kill and 

15. Notwithstanding, you may select, prepare, and 

eat flesh in all your gates, whatever 
your soul lusteth after, according to 
the blessing of the LORD your God 
which he has given you: the unclean 
and the clean may eat thereof, as of 
the roebuck, and as of the hart. 

appropriate any good thing from the memory and 
the natural mind, and adjoin it to your character, 
even whatever is agreeable to the natural desires, 
according to the abundant stores of natural good 
which the Divine Love and Wisdom have given 
you; both the faculties of the mind which are given
to the soul by regeneration, and those which are 
simply natural may appropriate good from this 
source, according to the natural affection of truth 
and good.

79

16. Only you shall not eat the blood; you
shall pour it upon the earth as water. 

17. You may not eat within your gates 

the tithe of your corn, or of your 
wine, or of your oil, or the firstlings 
of your herds or of your flock, nor 
any of your vows which you vowest,
nor your freewill offerings, or heave 
offering of your hand: 

18. But you must eat them before the 

LORD your God in the place which 
the LORD your God shall choose, 
you, and your son, and your 
daughter, and your manservant, and 
your maidservant, and the Levite 
that is within your gates: and you 
shall rejoice before the LORD your 
God in all that you put your hands 
to. 

16. Only you shall not confound these things with the 
truths derived from the Divine Humanity of the 
Lord, which you shall receive into the soul as 
coming direct by influx from heaven. 
[Note (verses 13-16).—A distinction seems to be 
made here between the essentials and those things 
which are not essential in worship. All that 
proceeds from the one only God as revealed in the 
person and character of the Lord Jesus Christ is to 
be sacred and inviolate, and all other things are to 
be considered as comparatively unessential.]

17. You may not appropriate from the memory as 
belonging to yourself the remains of good and 
truth stored in the soul by the Lord, either natural, 
spiritual, or celestial; nor consider that any of the 
truths of faith or goods thence derived, nor any 
genuine aspiration after holiness which you have, 
or worship from genuine affection, or any holy 
effort after good vivified by influx from heaven, 
comes from yourself:

18. But you shall acknowledge that they come from 
the Divine Love and Wisdom, and flow into the 
soul which will receive them into its interiors by 
influx from the Divine Humanity of the Lord, both
into the interior will and into the truths and goods 
formed by its means, and into the subservient 
natural goods and truths, and into the desires 
which you have after genuine good which conjoin 
the soul to heaven; and thus the whole soul will be 
filled with joy from the Divine Love and Wisdom 
in all its efforts and progress.

19. Take heed to yourself that you 

19. Take heed to yourself that you forsake not the 

forsake not the Levite as long as you
livest upon the earth. 

20. When the LORD your God shall 
enlarge your border, as he has 
promised you, and you shall say, I 
will eat flesh, because your soul 
longs to eat flesh; you may eat flesh,
whatever your soul lusteth after. 

desires after genuine good which you have, and 
which are from heaven, in all your states of life in 
the world.

20. When the Lord shall cause good and truth in the 

external man to increase, as He has promised you, 
and you shall think within yourself, I will acquire a
new will proprium that is good, because your soul 
longs to do what is good, as it were from yourself, 
you may then acquire a proprium (or feeling as if 
your life came from yourself) in any way that is 
pleasing to the natural affections.

80

21. If the place which the LORD your 
God has chosen to put his name 
there be too far from you, then you 
shall kill of your herd and of your 
flock, which the LORD has given 
you, as I have commanded you, and 
you shall eat in your gates whatever 
your soul lusteth after. 

21. If the holy state in which the Divine Love and 

Wisdom are manifestly perceived to flow into the 
soul from the Divine Humanity alone, be far 
removed from the state of the soul, then you may 
prepare from the goods and truths of the natural 
mind which the Lord has given you such things as 
are in accordance with your perception of His will,
and sustain the external life of the soul with such 
things as are suitable to its state in the natural 
mind.

22. Even as the roebuck and the hart is 
eaten, so you shall eat them: the 
unclean and the clean shall eat of 
them alike. 

22. According to the natural affection of good and 
truth so are these things appropriated; both the 
regenerate and the purely natural principles of the 
mind are alike nourished by them.

23. Only be sure that you eat not the 

blood: for the blood is the life; and 
you may not eat the life with the 
flesh. 

24. You shall not eat it; you shall pour it 

upon the earth as water. 

25. You shall not eat it; that it may go 
well with you, and with your 
children after you, when you shall 
do that which is right in the sight of 
the LORD. 

23. But it is of the greatest importance that the truth of 
the Lord should not be confounded with these 
things; for the truths received from the Lord are 
the very life of the soul, and you may not confound
the holy truths that flow from the Lord with the 
things that belong to the natural proprium.

24. You shall not think to acquire these holy truths 
from yourself; you shall receive them into the 
natural mind as coming direct by influx from 
heaven.

25. You shall not attempt to acquire truth from 

yourself in spiritual things (which is from the Lord
alone); that it may go well with you in your 
spiritual life, and with all the thoughts and 
affections begotten in the soul, when you shall 
follow out the perception that is given you of the 
Lord's will.

26. Only your holy things which you 

26. Only be sure that all the things that are truly 

have, and your vows, you shall take, 
and go to the place which the LORD
shall choose: 

Divine within you, and all your aspirations after 
holiness, you shall take and ascribe to the influx of
the Lord's Divine Spirit within you.

81

27. And you shall offer your burnt 

offerings, the flesh and the blood, 
upon the altar of the LORD your 
God: and the blood of your sacrifices
shall be poured out upon the altar of 
the LORD your God, and you shall 
eat the flesh. 

28. Observe and hear all these words 

which I command you, that it may 
go well with you, and with your 
children after you for ever, when you
do that which is good and right in 
the sight of the LORD your God. 

29. When the LORD your God shall cut 
off the nations from before you, 
whither you go to possess them, and 
you succeedest them, and dwell in 
their land; 

30. Take heed to yourself that you be not
snared by following them, after that 
they be destroyed from before you; 
and that you enquire not after their 
gods, saying, How did these nations 
serve their gods? even so will I do 
likewise. 

27. And you shall dedicate all the worship of your 
heart to the Lord, both from the affections and 
from the understanding, and ascribe it to the 
celestial principle of love received from the influx 
of the Divine Love and Wisdom; you shall 
acknowledge that all the holy truths of your 
worship come from the Divine Love and Wisdom, 
and shall then receive in the natural mind a new 
proprium for good vivified from those truths.

28. Observe and attend to all the perceptions that are 
given you of the Divine will, that it may go well 
with your soul, and with all the affections and 
thoughts begotten in it to eternity, when you do 
what is good and right according to the perception 
given you from the Divine Love and Wisdom.
[Note (verses 20-28).—With regard to the 
proprium, see Proprium in the Index of the AC and
the passages referred to. It is there shown how 
what is of the Lord in the soul must be kept 
separate from what is of self; but that it is right to 
endeavour to do good as if from one's self, but 
acknowledging all the good, nevertheless, to be 
from the Lord. When this is done the soul is gifted 
with a new will-principle or life, as it were from 
itself, but which is vivified from the Divine life.]

29. When the operations of the Divine Love and 

Wisdom shall cut off from the soul all the evils of 
the unregenerate heart, in the new states of life to 
which you shall be brought to possess them as 
your own, and the new regenerate will shall 
succeed them and occupy the mind in their place,

30. Take heed to yourself that you be not snared by 

being again enticed by those evil loves, after that 
they have been driven out from the soul; and that 
you seek not after the thoughts and doctrines 
which favour them, endeavouring to find how far 
those evil loves can be followed and worshiped 
with the sanction of religion—and in that way to 
worship the Lord.

82

31. You shall not do so to the LORD 

your God: for every abomination to 
the LORD, which he hates, have 
they done to their gods; for even 
their sons and their daughters they 
have burnt in the fire to their gods. 

31. This will not lead to the genuine worship of the 
Divine Love and Wisdom; for every possible 
violence to what is good and true, and everything 
that is averse to the true worship of the Lord, has 
been done in the name of worship to favour the 
evil loves of the unregenerate heart; for all the 
good affections and true thoughts begotten in the 
human soul by influx from heaven have been 
sacrificed to the filthy fire of self-love in the name 
of religion.

32. What thing soever I command you, 

observe to do it: you shall not add 
thereto, nor diminish from it. 

32. Whatsoever you perceive to be the Lord's will, that
you shall observe to do; you shall not add thereto, 
nor diminish from it.

83

Deuteronomy Chapter 13

Verses 1-5. No doctrine is to be listened to which tends to draw away the mind from the Lord's Divine 
Humanity. 
Verses 6-18. Everything which draws away the soul from the Lord is to be utterly rejected. 

1.

If there arise among you a prophet, 
or a dreamer of dreams, and gives 
you a sign or a wonder, 

2. And the sign or the wonder come to 
pass, whereof he spoke to you, 
saying, Let us go after other gods, 
which you have not known, and let 
us serve them; 

1.

IF any doctrine should be presented to the mind, or
persuasion arise therein, with reasons or 
inducements for regulating the life or belief in any 
particular,

2. And the reasons or inducements offered seem on 

the surface to be good and true, and from them the 
thought arises in the heart that there are other 
things which should be worshiped supremely 
besides the perfections which are in the Lord's 
Humanity, and different to what He has revealed to
the soul, and that these other things should be 
followed as the supreme good,

3. You shall not hearken to the words 
of that prophet, or that dreamer of 
dreams: for the LORD your God 
proves you, to know whether you 
love the LORD your God with all 
your heart and with all your soul. 

3. You shall not hearken to the false arguments of 

that doctrine, or the enticements of that persuasion,
for these are permitted by the Divine Love and 
Wisdom to act on the soul to prove it, to know 
whether it sincerely loves genuine good and truth 
with all the will and with all the understanding.

4. You shall walk after the LORD your 
God, and fear him, and keep his 
commandments, and obey his voice, 
and you shall serve him, and cleave 
to him. 

4. You shall constantly regulate the life by the Divine
Love and Wisdom, and fear exceedingly to act 
against them; you shall do what you know to be 
the Lord's will, and carefully attend to every 
perception of it that is given you, and you shall 
serve Him, and cleave to Him in all circumstances.

84

 
5. And that prophet, or that dreamer of 
dreams, shall be put to death; 
because he has spoken to turn you 
away from the LORD your God, 
which brought you out of the land of
Egypt, and redeemed you out of the 
house of bondage, to thrust you out 
of the way which the LORD your 
God commanded you to walk in. So 
shall you put the evil away from the 
midst of you. 

5. And that false doctrine, or that evil persuasion 
which endeavoured to pervert the will, shall be 
destroyed out of the soul; because its influence 
tended to draw away the soul from the genuine 
goodness and truth which are in the Lord, as 
revealed in His Humanity alone—which brought 
the soul from its unregenerate condition and from 
the bondage of hereditary evils—and to thrust out 
the soul from regulating the life by the perception 
given of the Divine Love and Wisdom. Thus will 
evil be removed from the interiors of your soul.

6.

6.

If your brother, the son of your 
mother, or your son, or your 
daughter, or the wife of your bosom, 
or your friend, which is as your own 
soul, entice you secretly, saying, Let 
us go and serve other gods, which 
you have not known, you, nor your 
fathers; 

If the hereditary evil that is born with you, and 
derived from the principles on which you were 
brought up, or the thoughts and affections which 
are brought forth from your own natural 
disposition, or the affection which is joined to your
interior will, and is the delight of your life, or the 
doctrine of truth which you have loved and 
regarded as your very life, is perceived to be 
secretly drawing away the soul from the Lord and 
inducing it to worship other things supremely, and 
to believe false doctrines which will not accord 
with your religious life derived from the Word, nor
with any genuine good derived from the Lord;

7. Namely, of the gods of the people 
which are round about you, near to 
you, or far off from you, from the 
one end of the earth even to the other
end of the earth; 

7. Doctrines which accord with the falses of 

hereditary evil which envelop the soul, whether 
they seem like the true principles you have 
received from the Lord or diverse from them, 
whether in first principles or ultimates and 
externals of the Church within you;

8. You shall not consent to him, nor 
hearken to him; neither shall your 
eye pity him, neither shall you spare,
neither shall you conceal him: 

8. You shall not consent to them, nor listen to them; 
neither shall your understanding favour that false 
doctrine, or spare it, or endeavour to excuse or 
cloak it over in the mind.

9. But you shall surely kill him; your 
hand shall be first upon him to put 
him to death, and afterwards the 
hand of all the people. 

9. But you shall surely blot it out of the soul; the 

interior will shall be foremost in the endeavour to 
destroy it, and shall be seconded by the 
endeavours of all the faculties within the soul.

85

10. And you shall stone him with stones,
that he die; because he has sought to 
thrust you away from the LORD 
your God, which brought you out of 
the land of Egypt, from the house of 
bondage. 

10. You shall blot it out with genuine truths from the 
Word till it is destroyed, because its tendency was 
to thrust you away from the Love and Wisdom 
revealed in the Divine Humanity, which brought 
you forth out of your unregenerate condition and 
from the bondage of hereditary evil.

11. And all Israel shall hear, and fear, 
and shall do no more any such 
wickedness as this is among you. 

11. And all that is spiritual in the soul will perceive its 
evil tendency, and fear to act against the Lord as 
revealed in the Divine Humanity, and will no more
follow after the evil that this would certainly bring 
upon you.

12. If you shall hear say in one of your 
cities, which the LORD your God 
has given you to dwell there, saying, 

12. And if you shall perceive in one of your doctrines, 
which have been given you from the Divine Love 
and Wisdom for the establishment of the soul,

13. Certain men, the children of Belial, 
are gone out from among you, and 
have withdrawn the inhabitants of 
their city, saying, Let us go and serve
other gods, which you have not 
known; 

14. Then shall you enquire, and make 
search, and ask diligently; and, 
behold, if it be truth, and the thing 
certain, that such abomination is 
worked among you; 

15. You shall surely smite the 

inhabitants of that city with the edge 
of the sword, destroying it utterly, 
and all that is therein, and the cattle 
thereof, with the edge of the sword. 

16. And you shall gather all the spoil of 
it into the midst of the street thereof, 
and shall burn with fire the city, and 
all the spoil thereof every whit, for 
the LORD your God: and it shall be 
an heap for ever; it shall not be built 
again. 

13. That falses derived from the love of evil have 

departed from the true love of the Lord, and have 
turned aside that doctrine of truth from its original 
purity, and made it a means to serve other things 
supremely than the Lord's Divine Humanity—no 
knowledge of which has been given you by the 
Lord through the Word—

14. Then you shall inquire, and make search, and 

diligently explore that doctrine; and behold, if it be
true and certain that such pernicious tendencies to 
turn away from the Lord exist in the soul,

15. You shall surely destroy the falses existing in that 
doctrine with pure truth from the Word, utterly 
blotting it out of the mind and everything derived 
from it, and the evil affections in the natural mind 
belonging to it, with the unsparing application of 
genuine truth.

16. And you shall collect and gather together in the 

mind all the falsifications of truth which proceed 
from that falsity, and place them with its primary 
principle, and reject the doctrine as something 
denied with the filthy fires of evil loves proceeding
from hell, together with every falsified truth 
adhering to it, for the sake of Divine Love and 
Wisdom which comes from the Lord alone; and it 
shall be entirely rejected and not allowed to spring 
up in the soul again.

86

17. And there shall cleave nought of the 

17. And there shall remain nothing of what averts 

cursed thing to your hand: that the 
LORD may turn from the fierceness 
of his anger, and show you mercy, 
and have compassion upon you, and 
multiply you, as he has sworn to 
your fathers; 

from the Lord in your will and act; that the influx 
of life Divine into the soul be not turned into the 
evil of self-love, and that He may have mercy 
upon you, and fill you with the Divine Love, and 
replenish you with genuine truths, according to the
promises in the Word to those who are in genuine 
goods from Himself,

18. When you shall hearken to the voice 

of the LORD your God, to keep all 
his commandments which I 
command you this day, to do that 
which is right in the eyes of the 
LORD your God. 

18. When you shall obey the perception that you have 
of the Divine Love and Wisdom, and carry out all 
that is perceived in the mind in its states of 
illustration from the Word, and act in accordance 
with the genuine wisdom which flows from the 
Divine Humanity.

87

Deuteronomy Chapter 14

Verses 1, 2. The life of the regenerate flows in direct from heaven.
Verses 3-8. What affections may be appropriated to the soul.
Verses 9, 10. What knowledges and (verses 11-20) what thoughts may be appropriated.
Verses 21-27. What is of self is not to be conjoined to the new regenerate life, but all that flows in from 
heaven is to be conjoined.
Verses 28, 29. By this means the good facilities in the soul will be strengthened. 

1. You are the children of the LORD 
your God: you shall not cut 
yourselves, nor make any baldness 
between your eyes for the dead. 

2. For you are an holy people to the 

LORD your God, and the LORD has
chosen you to be a peculiar people to
himself, above all the nations that 
are upon the earth. 

1. THE regenerate receive their life direct from the 
Divine Goodness and Wisdom flowing into the 
soul. They shall not afflict themselves or consider 
their intelligence and light destroyed when they 
perceive the falsity of their old doctrines or ideas,

2. For they receive pure truths direct from the Divine 
Love and Wisdom—and the Lord gifts them in 
regeneration with truths in a special manner from 
the Word—far more abundant than those which 
could be acquired by any of the faculties of the 
natural mind.

3. You shall not eat any abominable 

3. You shall not adopt into your life and belief 

thing. 

anything which you perceive to be denied with 
evil, or which turns away the soul from the Lord.

4. These are the beasts which you shall 

4. These are the affections which you may 

eat: the ox, the sheep, and the goat, 

5. The hart, and the roebuck, and the 
fallow deer, and the wild goat, and 
the pygarg, and the wild ox, and the 
chamois. 

appropriate into your character: the good of love in
the natural man (or the desire to do good in the 
natural life), the good of mutual charity, and the 
knowledges agreeing therewith.

5. All the good affections of the natural man which 
rejoice in true liberty of soul; its love of absolute 
truth and of absolute good, apart from the fetters of
custom and creed; its love to roam wide in the 
field of external knowledges agreeing with good 
(wild goat), and the powerful affections for 
genuine good thus obtained (bison); and the 
external affection which explores the whole mind 
in search for good, and the active intelligence 
thence resulting;

88

 
6. And every beast that parts the hoof, 
and cleaves the cleft into two claws, 
and chews the cud among the beasts,
that you shall eat. 

7. Nevertheless these you shall not eat 
of them that chew the cud, or of 
them that divide the cloven hoof; as 
the camel, and the hare, and the 
coney: for they chew the cud, but 
divide not the hoof; therefore they 
are unclean to you. 

8. And the swine, because it divides the
hoof, yet chews not the cud, it is 
unclean to you: you shall not eat of 
their flesh, nor touch their dead 
carcase. 

9. These you shall eat of all that are in 
the waters: all that have fins and 
scales shall you eat: 

10. And whatever has not fins and scales
you may not eat; it is unclean to you.

6. And every affection that has its natural attributes 

agreeing with and subordinate to the spiritual, and 
is so disposed as to receive influx from the 
spiritual world, and is the result of mature 
reflection and consideration, this may be joined to 
the spiritual man.

7. Nevertheless there are some which you shall not 

join to you of those that are the result of 
deliberation, or of those that seem to be in 
agreement with spiritual things; as the scientifics 
professing to lead the soul to heaven of 
themselves, and the thoughts and affections thence
derived (which love to immerse themselves in 
worldly and sensual things, and thus shut out the 
light of heaven); for though these seem to be the 
result of thought and intelligence, they do not 
agree with the spiritual wisdom which comes from
heaven; they are to be shunned as false by the 
spiritual man.

8. And the love of money and the pleasures of the 

world, although it might be made subservient and 
in agreement with heavenly love, yet it must be 
rejected if it draws away the mind to follow it 
without due subordination to spiritual love, and 
leads the spiritual man to falses: you shall not 
appropriate the evils derived from it, nor have the 
slightest communication with these things when 
separate from heavenly love.

9. And these are what may be appropriated by the 

spiritual man from the knowledges and scientifics 
of faith. All which are supported and living from 
the spiritual; sense of the Word and rational 
thought, and are contained in and confirmed by the
literal sense of the Word, may be appropriated.

10. And whatever is irrational and has no life from the 

spiritual sense, and is not contained in and 
confirmed by the literal sense of the Word, shall 
not be appropriated; it will lead the soul into error.
[Note. (verses 9,10).— Fins would seem to have 
the same signification as wings, as they raise and 
elevate. Scales correspond to what is literal and 
external in which superior things are contained.]

89

11. Of all clean birds you shall eat. 

11. All pure and holy thoughts may be appropriated to 

the soul.

12. But these are they of which you shall
not eat: the eagle, and the ossifrage, 
and the ospray, 

13. And the glede, and the kite, and the 

vulture after his kind, 

12. But these are they who shall not be admitted into 
the mind: all reasonings which confirm falses and 
evils, and prey upon the internal goods and truths 
of the Church and upon its knowledges;

13. And all false doctrines which love and devour evil,
whether in common things in the understanding or 
the foul evil which exists in the hereditary will.

14. And every raven after his kind, 

14. Melancholy and foreboding thoughts should not be

15. And the owl, and the night hawk, 

and the cuckow, and the hawk after 
his kind, 

16. The little owl, and the great owl, and

the swan, 

17. And the pelican, and the gier eagle, 

and the cormorant, 

18. And the stork, and the heron after 
her kind, and the lapwing, and the 
bat. 

19. And every creeping thing that flies is
unclean to you: they shall not be 
eaten. 

admitted into the soul;

15. Nor those falses which love darkness rather than 
light, and destroy truths in obscure states of the 
mind, or substitute themselves for genuine truths, 
or any kind of falsity which preys upon goodness 
and truth;

16. Nor any kind of falsity which shuns the true light 
of the Word whether in a less or greater degree, or 
anything which destroys the rudimentary sciences 
of the Word. [Note.—Swans are great destroyers of
fish-spawn.]

17. Nor those which destroy the scientifics of religion;
nor those which reason from nature, and find their 
delight in pursuing and voraciously destroying the 
external truths of the Church;

18. Nor those thoughts which love to dwell upon the 
unclean things of the natural mind, whether in the 
will or the thoughts in all their varieties, or which 
love to wander to useless things, and prefer the 
darkness of this world to the light of heaven.

19. And every thought and feeling of the unregenerate 
will, which is really selfish, but assumes the 
appearance of what is spiritual, is harmful, and is 
not to be appropriated by the spiritual man.

20. But of all clean birds you may eat. 

20. But all holy and pure thoughts which come from 

heaven may be appropriated.

90

21. You shall not eat of anything that 

dies of itself: you shall give it to the 
stranger that is in your gates, that he 
may eat it; or you may sell it to an 
alien: for you are an holy people to 
the LORD your God. You shall not 
seethe a kid in his mother's milk. 

22. You shall truly tithe all the increase 
of your seed, that the field brings 
forth year by year. 

23. And you shall eat before the LORD 
your God, in the place which he 
shall choose to place his name there, 
the tithe of your corn, of your wine, 
and of your oil, and the firstlings of 
your herds and of your flocks; that 
you may learn to fear the LORD 
your God always. 

24. And if the way be too long for you, 
so that you are not able to carry it; or
if the place be too far from you, 
which the LORD your God shall 
choose to set his name there, when 
the LORD your God has blessed 
you: 

21. The spiritual man shall not appropriate or conjoin 
to his new life given to him from heaven anything 
which is void of the true regenerate life that comes
from the Lord; he shall relegate it to what is not 
spiritual within him, that it may be conjoined to 
those external things within him which respect this
life only; or he shall altogether alienate it from the 
soul: for the spiritual man is pure by receiving 
only what proceeds from the Divine Love and 
Wisdom. The innocence of true wisdom, which 
consists in acknowledging that all things good and 
true are from the Lord alone, must not be 
conjoined to the innocence of ignorance, which 
imagines there is somewhat good and true 
proceeding from the natural heart of man. (AC 
9301).

22. You shall truly ascribe to the Lord all the increase 
of good and truth within you, that the Lord brings 
forth by means of the Church planted in your soul 
in each succeeding state of regeneration.

23. You shall conjoin to your soul the good things that 
are received into the soul from the Divine Love 
and Wisdom in those states to which He shall lead 
you, in which He shall impress upon you the 
qualities derived from His Divine Humanity, from 
which you shall receive all that is good within you,
all the genuine truth which you have, and all the 
sincere love to the Lord, and all that is good in 
your spiritual and natural affections; that you may 
learn at all times to shun evil, and to conform your 
life to the Divine Goodness and Wisdom.

24. And if the truth of the Lord be too exalted for you, 
so that you can not bring yourself entirely into 
conformity with it; or if the states be too far 
removed from you, which the Lord shall show you
are in accordance with the love and wisdom of His
Divine Humanity, when you have received a new 
proprium, or life as it were of your own from the 
Divine Goodness and Wisdom;

91

25. Then shall you turn it into money, 

and bind up the money in your hand,
and shall go to the place which the 
LORD your God shall choose: 

26. And you shall bestow that money for
whatever your soul lusteth after, for 
oxen, or for sheep, or for wine, or for
strong drink, or for whatever your 
soul desires: and you shall eat there 
before the LORD your God, and you
shall rejoice, you, and your 
household, 

25. Then you shall alienate the affections and thoughts
which cannot be brought into conformity, and 
when you have them thoroughly in your power, 
you shall advance towards those states which you 
perceive to be in accordance with the goodness 
and truth which flow from the Divine Humanity.

26. And you shall acquire in their place what is 

suitable to the regenerate state of the soul, whether
natural affections from a celestial origin (that is, 
those derived from love to the Lord), or spiritual 
affections (those derived from the love of the 
public welfare), or spiritual truth derived from the 
Word, or philosophical truth agreeing with 
spiritual, or whatever is craved for in the new state
of the soul; and these things shall be conjoined to 
the soul in that state as far as they are in 
accordance with the goodness and truth of the 
Lord's Divine Humanity, and the soul will be 
recruited and rejoiced, and all the spiritual part of 
man's nature.

27. And the Levite that is within your 

27. And the desires after genuine good which have 

gates; you shall not forsake him; for 
he has no part nor inheritance with 
you. 

28. At the end of three years you shall 
bring forth all the tithe of your 
increase the same year, and shall lay 
it up within your gates: 

been given you in the natural mind, you shall 
cherish these; for they are from the Lord with you, 
and derive nothing good or true from the natural 
disposition of man.

28. And at the end of every full and complete period 

of regeneration you shall pass in review by self-
examination all the increase of good and truth 
which you have received from the Lord in that 
state, and it shall be stored up in the external mind 
and become serviceable to introduce you to 
heaven.

92

29. And the Levite, (because he has no 
part nor inheritance with you,) and 
the stranger, and the fatherless, and 
the widow, which are within your 
gates, shall come, and shall eat and 
be satisfied; that the LORD your 
God may bless you in all the work of
your hand which you do. 

29. And the desires for genuine good which you have 
(because they are of the Lord, and are not derived 
from the peculiar disposition of the man), and 
those principles which desire instruction in good 
and truth, and those which are in a state of 
innocence and charity, and desire to know and do 
what is good, and those which are in a state of 
truth and not yet in good, which are ready to be 
introduced into more interior states, shall be 
conjoined more closely to the soul, and shall 
appropriate the increase the Lord has given you 
and be satisfied; that the Divine Goodness and 
Wisdom may bless and vivify with real life every 
endeavour and act done with a view to advance in 
the spiritual life.

93

Deuteronomy Chapter 15

Verses 1-6. All idea of merit to be relinquished in spiritual things.
Verses 7-11. The spiritual aspirations to be satisfied as far as possible.
Verses 12-18. Inferior goods and uses are not to be despised, but to be endowed from the spiritual 
mind.
Verses 19-23. All good things to be ascribed to the Lord, and are not to be made use of for evil ends. 

1. At the end of every seven years you 

shall make a release. 

2. And this is the manner of the release:
Every creditor that lends ought to his
neighbour shall release it; he shall 
not exact it of his neighbour, or of 
his brother; because it is called the 
LORD's release. 

1. AND when you are advanced to a state of the love 
of what is good there shall come a period of peace,
when good shall be conjoined to the soul, because 
it shall be seen to be from the Lord and not from 
the man himself.

2. And this is the manner of that conjunction and 

relinquishing of merit on the part of the man 
himself: every good thing which has been acquired
by the practice of good from the spiritual 
principles of the soul shall be ascribed to the Lord,
and will then be conjoined to the soul by Him. The
soul shall no more ascribe to itself any of the 
principles derived from genuine good or charity, 
because they shall be clearly perceived to flow into
the soul from the Lord.

3. Of a foreigner you may exact it 

3. External things which are not of the spiritual man 

again: but that which is your with 
your brother your hand shall release; 

4. Save when there shall be no poor 

among you; for the LORD shall 
greatly bless you in the land which 
the LORD your God gives you for 
an inheritance to possess it: 

5. Only if you carefully hearken to the 
voice of the LORD your God, to 
observe to do all these 
commandments which I command 
you this day. 

in the soul may be regarded as coming from the 
man himself; but the soul shall relinquish all merit 
in the real spiritual good with which it is gifted 
from heaven;

4. To the end that all that is imperfect and wanting in 
the soul may be made perfect and enriched, for the
Lord will then abundantly endow the soul with 
good in those heavenly states which you shall 
receive as an inheritance from the Divine Love and
Wisdom as if they were your own:

5. Only let the soul carefully attend to carry out the 
perceptions which it has of the Divine Love and 
Wisdom, to observe to do all the Lord's will as 
perceived in its states of enlightenment.

94

 
6. For the LORD your God blesses 

you, as he promised you: and you 
shall lend to many nations, but you 
shall not borrow; and you shall reign
over many nations, but they shall not
reign over you. 

6. For the Divine Goodness and Wisdom enrich the 
soul, according to the promises in the Word; and 
the spiritual man shall impart truth in abundance to
the faculties of the soul, but shall not derive its 
wisdom from them; and it shall rule the truths and 
affections of the natural man, but they shall not 
dominate over the spiritual man.

7.

If there be among you a poor man of 
one of your brethren within any of 
your gates in your land which the 
LORD your God gives you, you 
shall not harden your heart, nor shut 
your hand from your poor brother: 

7.

If there be in the soul a humble acknowledgement 
that the soul has nothing from itself in spiritual 
things and a desire for better things in any state to 
which the Divine Love and Wisdom have brought 
the soul in order to introduce it to a more heavenly
condition; you shall not avert the interior will, nor 
shut off the communication of the mind from those
humble and good desires, which are of the spiritual
man.

8. But you shall open your hand wide 
to him, and shall surely lend him 
sufficient for his need, in that which 
he wanteth. 

8. But you shall give full play to those feelings, and 
shall endeavour to the best of your ability to 
satisfy the cravings which they introduce into the 
mind.

9. Beware that there be not a thought in
your wicked heart, saying, The 
seventh year, the year of release, is at
hand; and your eye be evil against 
your poor brother, and you give him 
nought; and he cry to the LORD 
against you, and it be sin to you. 

9. Beware lest you cherish the thought arising from 
the evil unregenerate heart, saying, it is most 
certain that in a holy celestial state everything 
good is perceived to come from the Lord; and your
understanding regard as evil the humble strivings 
after good in the soul, and you in no way 
endeavour to satisfy them; and thus the good 
impulses from the Lord be rejected within you, 
and thus you open your soul to evil.

10. You shall surely give him, and your 
heart shall not be grieved when you 
give to him: because that for this 
thing the LORD your God shall 
bless you in all your works, and in 
all that you put your hand to. 

10. You shall earnestly endeavour to satisfy these 

cravings, and you shall bend your will so that it 
loves to gratify them; because in this way the 
Divine Love and Wisdom will be conjoined to the 
soul in all its efforts after usefulness, and in all the 
exercise of its powers.

11. For the poor shall never cease out of 
the land: therefore I command you, 
saying, You shall open your hand 
wide to your brother, to your poor, 
and to your needy, in your land. 

11. For the feeling of its own insufficiency and the 

endeavour after higher attainments will never 
cease in the regenerating soul; therefore it is the 
Lord's will that the soul should endeavour with all 
its powers to satisfy those spiritual aspirations of 
the soul, when it feels its deficiency of truth and 
desires more, and when it feels its own evil and 
seeks after good.

95

12. And if your brother, an Hebrew man,
or an Hebrew woman, be sold to 
you, and serve you six years; then in 
the seventh year you shall let him go 
free from you. 

12. If some good and useful principle, either of truth 
or in the affections of the external man, derived 
from inferior motives such as the hope of reward 
in the next life, has been made use of by the 
spiritual man, and been serviceable to him during 
the first stages of regeneration; when the soul has 
been brought to a state of celestial love, principles 
from such motives will no longer influence the 
mind.

13. And when you sendest him out free 

13. And when the soul is no longer influenced by 

from you, you shall not let him go 
away empty: 

14. You shall furnish him liberally out of
your flock, and out of your floor, and
out of your winepress: of that with 
which the LORD your God has 
blessed you you shall give to him. 

15. And you shall remember that you 
were a bondman in the land of 
Egypt, and the LORD your God 
redeemed you: therefore I command 
you this thing today. 

these external motives, you shall not dismiss the 
principles derived from them from the mind as 
nothing worth;

14. But you shall endow them with the interior good 

and truth which spring from spiritual motives, and 
from the more exalted truths of the spiritual man; 
with those things which you have freely received 
from the Divine Love and Wisdom shall you 
endow that external principle.

15. It shall be ever present in the thought of the 

spiritual man that the spiritual principle itself was 
in a state of bondage in the unregenerate condition,
and was brought out thence by the Divine Love 
and Wisdom; and therefore this command is given 
by the Lord in your regenerate state.

16. And it shall be, if he say to you, I 

16. And it shall be that if you perceive that these 

will not go away from you; because 
he loves you and your house, 
because he is well with you; 

external principles cannot be separated from the 
soul; because they are in agreement with its state 
and with the interior will, and because the external 
man is satisfied with the former state;

17. Then you shall take an aul, and 

thrust it through his ear to the door, 
and he shall be your servant for ever.
And also to your maidservant you 
shall do likewise. 

17. Then you shall reduce these external truths to 
obedience, and by obedience conjoin them to 
truths introductory to higher states, and in this 
capacity they will always be serviceable to the 
regenerate life; and the same shall be done with 
the external affections.

96

18. It shall not seem hard to you, when 

you sendest him away free from you;
for he has been worth a double hired 
servant to you, in serving you six 
years: and the LORD your God shall
bless you in all that you do. 

18. It shall not seem hard, however, to the internal 
man when these exterior principles are entirely 
removed from the soul; for they have performed 
their service for the spiritual man in conjoining to 
him interior things during the states of temptation-
combat; and the Divine Love and Wisdom will be 
more closely united to the soul in its future 
progress.
[Note (verses 12-18).—There is to be no waste in 
the kingdom of the Lord; nothing is to be despised 
because it is of less use than other things; but 
everything is to be judiciously used with care and 
prudence according to its usefulness.]

19. All the firstling males that come of 

19. All the genuine truths originating in charity in the 

your herd and of your flock you shall
sanctify to the LORD your God: you
shall do no work with the firstling of
your bullock, nor shear the firstling 
of your sheep. 

20. You shall eat it before the LORD 

your God year by year in the place 
which the LORD shall choose, you 
and your household. 

21. And if there be any blemish therein, 
as if it be lame, or blind, or have any 
ill blemish, you shall not sacrifice it 
to the LORD your God. 

soul, both those derived from love to the 
neighbour and those derived from love to the Lord 
(AC 3325), shall be ascribed to the Divine Love 
and Wisdom (AE 725); you shall not perform your
offices to the neighbour, that is, your duties in the 
world which are taught by those truths, for the 
sake of self; nor make use of the holy goods and 
truths of the Church for any selfish end.

20. They are to be received in the soul as flowing from
the Divine Love and Wisdom, and to be carried out
in the life for the sake of the Divine Humanity in 
every state to which the Lord in His Providence 
shall lead you; they shall thus be conjoined to the 
interior will, and to all the subordinate faculties.

21. And if there be anything of evil or falsity in these 

affections of the soul, if you can not carry them 
out in the life, or if your perception of truth is 
destroyed by them, or there is any other 
imperfection in them, they are not then to be 
received as genuine good and truth from the 
Divine Love and Wisdom.

22. You shall eat it within your gates: the
unclean and the clean person shall 
eat it alike, as the roebuck, and as the
hart. 

22. They are then to be received in the external mind 
only, as things that may support alike true or false 
principles, as the natural affection of good in the 
external man and the truth thence derived.

23. Only you shall not eat the blood 

23. Only you shall not in this case confound them with

thereof; you shall pour it upon the 
ground as water. 

the truths derived from the Lord's Divine 
Humanity, which are to be received in the natural 
mind as coming direct by influx from heaven. 
[Note.—Or, by translating the word "blood" in the 
evil instead of the good sense, this verse may be 
rendered, Only you shall not appropriate therefrom
any principle which does violence to the truths, 
proceeding from the Lord's Divine Humanity; you 
shall reject it as a heresy of the external man. See 
chap. xii., verses 23-25. Blood signifies the very 
essence of a thing, specially as to truth; thus to 
drink the blood of the Lord (John 6:53-56), or to 
be washed, and to overcome evil with the blood of 
the Lamb (Rev 7:14, and 12:11), signifies to be 
vivified, and purified by the influx of the Divine 
Life. The same is signified by the wine of the 
sacrament, which is the Divine Life as to Truth; 
whereas the bread signifies the Divine Life as to 
Good. The Church of Rome unconsciously bears 
witness to the law of correspondences, by 
withholding the cup from the laity, and also 
withholding the Word and checking the free search
after truth among the people. See AC Index, 
"Blood," "Supper."]

Deuteronomy Chapter 16

Verses 1-8. It is constantly to be borne in mind that all redemption is from the Lord's Divine Humanity 
(that is, the Lord Jesus Christ), which is signified by the Passover.
Verses 9-12. Thus truths will be implanted in affection, which is signified by the feast of weeks.
Verses 13-15. And the soul will be led to genuine good, which is the feast of tabernacles.
Verses 16, 17 In all these states the soul must endeavour to conform itself to the Divine Humanity 
(verses 18-20) with judgement and without bias (verses 21, 22), and without the admixture of anything 
from self-derived intelligence. 

1. Observe the month of Abib, and 

1. REMEMBER the sanctity of the states proceeding 

keep the passover to the LORD your 
God: for in the month of Abib the 
LORD your God brought you forth 
out of Egypt by night. 

2. You shall therefore sacrifice the 

passover to the LORD your God, of 
the flock and the herd, in the place 
which the LORD shall choose to 
place his name there. 

from the Lord's Divine Humanity, and ever keep in
view His glorification while on earth, and 
remember the necessity of following Him in the 
regeneration; for in the states proceeding from the 
Divine Humanity, the Divine Love and Wisdom 
brought you forth out of the natural unregenerate 
state when the soul was in a state of ignorance and 
falsity.

2. You shall therefore regard as most holy to the 
Lord, all the goodness and wisdom proceeding 
from the Lord's glorification and conjunction with 
mankind, and the redemption effected thereby; and
to Him shall you ascribe all the spiritual and 
natural affections derived from that being in whom
dwelt the fullness of the Godhead visibly 
displayed in human form, namely, the Lord Jesus 
Christ. 

3. You shall eat no leavened bread with

3. You shall not mix or imbibe any false doctrine 

it; seven days shall you eat 
unleavened bread therewith, even the
bread of affliction; for you came 
forth out of the land of Egypt in 
haste: that you may remember the 
day when you came forth out of the 
land of Egypt all the days of your 
life. 

with these holy states; in them you shall receive 
pure good from heaven unmixed with evil, and 
regard it as most holy, even though it seem 
distasteful to the natural man; for deliverance from
the unregenerate condition is thus rendered 
complete and thorough: and by this means the 
deliverance by the Lord from the unregenerate 
condition will be kept in view by the regenerate in 
all their alternating states.

99

 
4. And there shall be no leavened bread
seen with you in all your coast seven
days; neither shall there any thing of 
the flesh, which you sacrificedst the 
first day at even, remain all night 
until the morning. 

5. You may not sacrifice the passover 
within any of your gates, which the 
LORD your God gives you: 

6. But at the place which the LORD 
your God shall choose to place his 
name in, there you shall sacrifice the 
passover at even, at the going down 
of the sun, at the season that you 
came forth out of Egypt. 

7. And you shall roast and eat it in the 
place which the LORD your God 
shall choose: and you shall turn in 
the morning, and go to your tents. 

4. And in these holy states derived from love to the 
Lord, none of the false doctrines which are in the 
memory will be attended to; neither shall the same 
good, from which you worshiped in the prior state 
of ignorance, remain in your state of deliverance 
from evil and clear perception of truth. 
[Note.—For this would be to endeavour to acquire 
genuine good from the proprium, instead of 
receiving into the soul what is given by the Lord, 
day by day. See AC 9299, 8478-8483.]

5. You can not worship the Lord so as to receive pure
innocence from Him from any of the external 
principles or truths with which the Lord has gifted 
the soul.

6. But in those states derived from the Divine 

Humanity alone, upon which the Divine Love and 
Wisdom have impressed the true characteristics of 
Divinity, from these you shall receive the genuine 
innocence of wisdom from the Lord at the close 
and commencement of each fresh regenerate state, 
when the soul perceives its own ignorance and 
obscurity (AE 401)—a state similar to that in 
which you were brought forth by the Lord out of 
the natural unregenerate condition.

7. And the genuine good of innocence from the Lord 

will be adapted and communicated to the soul in 
the states which you shall receive, derived from 
the Love and Wisdom of the Lord's Divine 
Humanity. And in the new state of light and 
illustration to which the soul will be brought, its 
principles of action will be changed, and it will 
serve the Lord with more genuine worship derived
from love to Him.

100

8. Six days you shall eat unleavened 

bread: and on the seventh day shall 
be a solemn assembly to the LORD 
your God: you shall do no work 
therein. 

9. Seven weeks shall you number to 
you: begin to number the seven 
weeks from such time as you 
beginnest to put the sickle to the 
corn. 

8. During the periods of temptations and combats 
with evil you shall be sustained with pure truth 
from the Word unmixed with falsity; and at the 
close of each regenerate state the combats shall 
cease by the reception in the soul of the Love and 
Wisdom proceeding from the Lord's Humanity, 
and you shall carry out the Lord's will without 
effort; and the mind shall be at peace. 
[Note (verses 1-8).—For a detailed description of 
the meaning of the Passover see explanation of 
Exodus, chap. xii. in the AC 7824-8020. It is there 
shown that by the Passover, which is ever to be 
kept in mind, is signified the deliverance of the 
spiritual man from hell by the Lord. This was 
effected by His continual combats with hell when 
in the world, even to the final combat of the Cross,
by which all was finished, and His Humanity 
became absolute Deity, apart from which it is not 
possible for the human mind to form any true 
conception of the attributes and character of the 
Divine Being. To receive the good desires and the 
knowledge of truth which flow from this Divine 
Being, it is necessary to believe that He is absolute
God, to do the things which He said, and to 
conform the life as far as possible to His example, 
by following Him in His combats with evil even to
the death of self; and it is the doctrine of the New 
Church that there is no other possible way of 
salvation. Verses 1-8 describe the necessity of ever
bearing this in mind.]

9. The qualities derived from the conjunction of the 
Lord's Divine Humanity with the human race will 
then be impressed on all your future states; these 
qualities will be impressed upon you as soon as the
truths sown in the heart begin to bear fruit by 
being united to good (which is signified by the 
Feast of Weeks).

10. And you shall keep the feast of 

weeks to the LORD your God with a
tribute of a freewill offering of your 
hand, which you shall give to the 
LORD your God, according as the 
LORD your God has blessed you: 

10. And truths will be implanted in the soul in good 
derived from the Divine Love and Wisdom, by 
which you shall render service to the Lord with all 
your powers from a free principle of love 
according as you shall receive ability from the 
Divine Love and Wisdom. 

101

11. And you shall rejoice before the 

11. And the soul will be filled with joy from the 

LORD your God, you, and your son,
and your daughter, and your 
manservant, and your maidservant, 
and the Levite that is within your 
gates, and the stranger, and the 
fatherless, and the widow, that are 
among you, in the place which the 
LORD your God has chosen to place
his name there. 

Divine Love and Wisdom, both the interior will 
and the principles of action and affections thence 
derived, and the subservient faculties and 
affections of the mind, and the desires for genuine 
good from the Lord which you have in the natural 
mind will be recruited, and all those things in the 
mind which desire to be instructed and led right, 
the truths which desire to be governed by heavenly
affections, and the affections which desire to be 
conjoined to true wisdom, and this joy shall flow 
from the union of the Lord's Divine Humanity 
with the soul.

12. And you shall remember that you 

12. And you shall bear in mind how the soul suffered 

were a bondman in Egypt: and you 
shall observe and do these statutes. 

13. You shall observe the feast of 

tabernacles seven days, after that you
have gathered in your corn and your 
wine: 

14. And you shall rejoice in your feast, 

you, and your son, and your 
daughter, and your manservant, and 
your maidservant, and the Levite, the
stranger, and the fatherless, and the 
widow, that are within your gates. 

bondage from sin and falsity in the natural 
unregenerate condition; and you shall carefully 
observe and carry out the principles derived from 
following the footsteps of the Lord in the 
regeneration, by which alone you are delivered 
from that bondage.

13. And you shall thus be brought to a state of love to 
the Lord (which is signified by the Feast of 
Tabernacles), and a life according to perception 
thence derived, when the soul has been well 
furnished by Him with right principles of truth and
doctrine.

14. And the soul will be filled with happiness from the
influx of good from heaven, both the interior will 
and the truths and affections thence derived, and 
the subordinate principles which are serviceable to
good and truth, and the holy desires which you 
have to rightly serve the Lord, and every principle 
in the mind which desires to be led to better things,
and all things which are innocent but not yet under
the direction of true wisdom, and the affections 
which are not yet united to genuine good from the 
Lord in the external mind.

15. Seven days shall you keep a solemn 
feast to the LORD your God in the 
place which the LORD shall choose: 
because the LORD your God shall 
bless you in all your increase, and in 
all the works of your hands, 
therefore you shall surely rejoice. 

15. And you shall be brought to a state of peace, 

derived from the Love and Wisdom proceeding 
from the Lord's Humanity; and because the Lord 
your God will in that state bless you in all the 
developments of the soul, and in all its endeavours
after higher things, therefore the whole soul shall 
be filled with joy. 

102

16. Three times in a year shall all your 

16. In all these states you shall seek to perceive the 

males appear before the LORD your 
God in the place which he shall 
choose; in the feast of unleavened 
bread, and in the feast of weeks, and 
in the feast of tabernacles: and they 
shall not appear before the LORD 
empty: 

Lord with all your intellectual powers as revealed 
in the Divine Humanity; namely, in those in which 
the soul is sustained with pure truth from the 
Word, and in those in which truth begins to be 
conjoined with good, and in those in which good is
the ruling principle in the mind; and when you 
shall perceive the Lord's will, you shall endeavour 
to carry it out in the life.

17. Every man shall give as he is able, 
according to the blessing of the 
LORD your God which he has given
you. 

17. Every principle and faculty of the mind (shall 

endeavour to serve the Lord), as far as they are 
able, according to the influx received from the 
Divine Love and Wisdom.

18. Judges and officers shall you make 
you in all your gates, which the 
LORD your God gives you, 
throughout your tribes: and they 
shall judge the people with just 
judgement. 

19. You shall not wrest judgement; you 
shall not respect persons, neither 
take a gift: for a gift does blind the 
eyes of the wise, and pervert the 
words of the righteous. 

20. That which is altogether just shall 
you follow, that you may live, and 
inherit the land which the LORD 
your God gives you. 

18. You shall watch with sound judgement and 

circumspection over all the entrances from the 
external man into the soul, in the circumstances 
through which you are led by the Divine 
Providence; and shall discriminate between what 
is true and false with unbiased judgement.

19. You shall not permit your judgement to be warped 
by worldly desires; you shall not permit what is 
fashionable or what is profitable to influence your 
judgement of what is right; for the consideration of
worldly advantage in these matters blinds the 
understanding, and turns aside the dictates of 
conscience.

20. That which is altogether in accordance with your 
perception of right you shall follow, that your 
spiritual life may be recruited, and that you may 
receive from the Lord those heavenly states which 
can be only acquired by conforming the life to the 
Divine Love and Wisdom.

21. You shall not plant you a grove of 
any trees near to the altar of the 
LORD your God, which you shall 
make you. 

21. You shall not commingle anything of self-derived 
human wisdom and intelligence with the holy 
worship of Divine Love and Wisdom, which you 
shall receive and offer to the Lord.

22. Neither shall you set you up any 

image; which the LORD your God 
hates. 

22. Neither shall you make religion to consist in any 
doctrinal creed, or external appearance of good, 
separate from the good derived from the Lord's 
Divine Humanity (AC 3727); for this altogether 
averts the soul from the Divine Goodness and 
Wisdom.

103

Deuteronomy Chapter 17

Verse I. The service rendered to the Lord must be the very best the soul can give.
Verses 2-7. Any thought or affection which averts the soul from the Divine Humanity to be destroyed 
out of the mind.
Verses 8-13. Matters that cannot be decided in the external mind to be submitted to the judgement of 
heaven. 
Verses 14-20. When the soul is perfected it will acquire and be governed by definite principles of 
action, in accordance with its perception of good, but these must be kept constantly subservient to the 
laws of heaven. 

1. You shall not sacrifice to the LORD 
your God any bullock, or sheep, 
wherein is blemish, or any evil-
favouredness: for that is an 
abomination to the LORD your God.

1. YOU shall not render to the Lord your God any 
worship or service either in external or internal 
things which is imperfect, that is, which is not 
your very best, and which is not from the heart; for
this averts the soul from me Divine Love and 
Wisdom.

2.

If there be found among you, within 
any of your gates which the LORD 
your God gives you, man or woman, 
that has worked wickedness in the 
sight of the LORD your God, in 
transgressing his covenant, 

2.

If there be found in the soul, amongst any of the 
external faculties with which you are gifted by the 
Divine Love and Wisdom, thoughts or affections 
that are contrary to the perception that is given you
of the Love and Wisdom as revealed in the Divine 
Humanity, and tend to draw the soul from Him,

3. And has gone and served other gods,
and worshiped them, either the sun, 
or moon, or any of the host of 
heaven, which I have not 
commanded; 

3. Which have turned from the Lord and served other
things, and worshiped them as the supreme good, 
either the man's own selfhood, or any false 
principles derived from self-intelligence, or any of 
the falses which seem truths to the soul when not 
illumined by the Lord through the Word;

4. And it be told you, and you have 

4.

heard of it, and enquired diligently, 
and, behold, it be true, and the thing 
certain, that such abomination is 
worked in Israel: 

If this be perceived and made evident to the 
understanding, and after diligent self-examination 
it is seen to be true and without doubt that such 
things exist in the spiritual mind which avert it 
from the Lord;

5. Then shall you bring forth that man 

or that woman, which have 
committed that wicked thing, to your
gates, even that man or that woman, 
and shall stone them with stones, till 
they die. 

5. Then you shall pluck out those thoughts and 
affections from the interiors of the mind, the 
thoughts and affections that are contrary to the 
Divine Humanity of the Lord, and shall destroy 
them out of the soul by means of pure truths 
derived from the Word.

104

 
6. At the mouth of two witnesses, or 
three witnesses, shall he that is 
worthy of death be put to death; but 
at the mouth of one witness he shall 
not be put to death. 

7. The hands of the witnesses shall be 
first upon him to put him to death, 
and afterward the hands of all the 
people. So you shall put the evil 
away from among you. 

8.

If there arise a matter too hard for 
you in judgement, between blood 
and blood, between plea and plea, 
and between stroke and stroke, being
matters of controversy within your 
gates: then shall you arise, and get 
you up into the place which the 
LORD your God shall choose; 

9. And you shall come to the priests the
Levites, and to the judge that shall be
in those days, and enquire; and they 
shall show you the sentence of 
judgement: 

10. And you shall do according to the 
sentence, which they of that place 
which the LORD shall choose shall 
show you; and you shall observe to 
do according to all that they inform 
you: 

6.

If the evidence of good and truth in conjunction, or
of several agreeing truths, shall show a thought or 
affection to be evil, it must be destroyed out of the 
soul: the evidence of one truth alone unconfirmed 
by others is not sufficient ground to destroy any 
principle of the mind.

7. The powers of good and truth in conjunction, or of
the agreeing truths, shall be at once exerted to 
destroy these errors out of the soul, and shall be 
seconded by the powers of all the faculties of the 
mind. Thus evil shall be put away and removed 
from the soul.

8.

If there arise in the soul a matter too hard for the 
perceptions of good that are given you to decide 
between what is true and what is false, or what is 
right or wrong, in motive or in act—matters that 
cannot be decided in the external part of the mind
—then shall you elevate your soul to the Lord, and
to the state derived from the Love and Wisdom 
which flows from the Lord's Divine Humanity;

9. And you shall consult the desires after genuine 
good in spiritual and natural things which you 
have received from the Lord, and the perception of
right and wrong which the Lord shall give you in 
that state; and wisdom will be given you by means
of them:

10. And you shall do according to the perception that 
is given you, which the principles derived from the
Lord's Divine Humanity shall teach you; and you 
shall take heed to perform all that they shall show 
you:

11. According to the sentence of the law 
which they shall teach you, and 
according to the judgement which 
they shall tell you, you shall do: you 
shall not decline from the sentence 
which they shall show you, to the 
right hand, nor to the left. 

11. According to the interpretation of the Lord's will 
which they shall teach you, and according to the 
perception of what is right you shall have through 
them, you shall do: you shall not decline from the 
path pointed out by these leadings from the Lord 
to any course of action dictated by the 
unregenerate will.

105

12. And the man that will do 

presumptuously, and will not 
hearken to the priest that stands to 
minister there before the LORD your
God, or to the judge, even that man 
shall die: and you shall put away the 
evil from Israel. 

12. And every inclination of the heart to act from the 
unregenerate will, which cannot be brought into 
conformity with the love of genuine good given to 
the soul from the Divine Love and Wisdom, or to 
the perceptions given of truth and right from the 
Lord, that inclination must be destroyed; and so 
evil shall be removed from the spiritual mind.

13. And all the people shall hear, and 

13. And all the faculties of the soul will thus be 

fear, and do no more 
presumptuously. 

brought to obedience to the Lord, and fear to act 
against good, and from self-will.

14. When you are come to the land 

14. When you are come to that heavenly state with 

which the LORD your God gives 
you, and shall possess it, and shall 
dwell therein, and shall say, I will set
a king over me, like as all the nations
that are about me; 

which you shall be gifted, if the dictates of Divine 
Love and Wisdom are followed, and shall be 
habitually therein, and shall desire to be governed 
by definite and fixed principles of doctrine in 
spiritual things, as in moral and external things,

15. You shall in any wise set him king 

over you, whom the LORD your 
God shall choose: one from among 
your brethren shall you set king over
you: you may not set a stranger over 
you, which is not your brother. 

16. But he shall not multiply horses to 
himself, nor cause the people to 
return to Egypt, to the end that he 
should multiply horses: for as much 
as the LORD has said to you, You 
shall now on return no more that 
way. 

17. Neither shall he multiply wives to 

himself, that his heart turn not away: 
neither shall he greatly multiply to 
himself silver and gold. 

15. You shall take care that your ruling principles of 
action are those appointed by the Lord, and in 
accordance with the Love and Wisdom which flow
from the Lord's Humanity, and charity must be the 
ruling principle therein: you must not be governed 
by principles or doctrines which have not charity 
(or mutual love) as their ruling principle.

16. And your ruling principle of action is not to be 
contaminated by doctrinals from the intellectual 
proprium, nor must the mind be brought back into 
a state in which doctrine is regarded as more 
important than life, and religion is made to consist 
in the intellectual belief in doctrinal formulae and 
external propriety; for as much as the soul has 
clearly perceived from the Lord that it cannot be 
brought to heaven by such means (AE 654).

17. Neither is the ruling principle of action of the soul 
to be conjoined with delights proceeding from the 
loves of evil and falsity that flatter self, lest the 
inmost will be drawn away from the Lord: nor 
shall the soul trust to the multiplication of mere 
doctrinals and knowledges acquired by self-
intelligence.

106

18. And it shall be, when he sits upon 
the throne of his kingdom, that he 
shall write him a copy of this law in 
a book out of that which is before the
priests the Levites: 

19. And it shall be with him, and he 

shall read therein all the days of his 
life: that he may learn to fear the 
LORD his God, to keep all the words
of this law and these statutes, to do 
them: 

20. That his heart be not lifted up above 
his brethren, and that he turn not 
aside from the commandment, to the 
right hand, or to the left: to the end 
that he may prolong his days in his 
kingdom, he, and his children, in the 
midst of Israel. 

18. And it shall be, that when these principles of 
action which you have acquired are fully 
established as the guide and leader of the soul, that
they Shall constantly be subordinate to the Divine 
Word, which shall be impressed on the heart, and 
perception from which will be given to the soul 
when in states of good from the Lord:

19. And the principles which the soul acts upon must 
always be drawn from the Divine Word, which 
must be the constant study of the soul in all the 
developments of religious life; that the soul may 
be filled with the holy fear of acting contrary to 
the Divine Love and Wisdom, and ever keep in 
remembrance all that is taught in the Word, and 
comprehend its teaching, and carry it out in the 
life:

20. That the ruling principles of the soul may be 

established in humility, and thus not be against a 
life of true charity, and that they may not lead the 
soul away from the path designed for it by Divine 
Providence into the paths favouring the natural 
loves, and the fallacies which flow from them: to 
the end that the states derived from these ruling 
principles, and from the goods and truths produced
by their means in the soul, may be as full and 
complete as possible in the spiritual mind.

Deuteronomy Chapter 18

Verses 1, 2. Impulses to good are not derived from the man himself.
Verses 3-5. How they communicate with the rest of the mind.
Verses 6-8. How the impulses to good in the external mind are elevated by looking to the Divine 
Humanity. 
Verses 9-14. Caution to keep the heavenly life clear from what proceeds from the evils of the 
unregenerate heart.
Verses 15-22. A development of truth suited to its progress will be given in each state of the soul. 

1. The priests the Levites, and all the 
tribe of Levi, shall have no part nor 
inheritance with Israel: they shall eat
the offerings of the LORD made by 
fire, and his inheritance. 

1. THE Divine good of love to the Lord, and the 

aspirations after genuine good derived therefrom, 
and all the holy impulses of charity from the Lord, 
(or rather the faculties receptive of them in the 
human mind), are not supplied with good and truth
from external study as is the spiritual mind, or that 
part of the soul which is receptive of truth; they 
are recruited by the influx of love from the Lord 
into the soul, and derive their support direct from 
Him.

2. Therefore shall they have no 

2. Therefore they receive no proprium or life as of 

inheritance among their brethren: the
LORD is their inheritance, as he has 
said to them. 

3. And this shall be the priest's due 
from the people, from them that 
offer a sacrifice, whether it be ox or 
sheep; and they shall give to the 
priest the shoulder, and the two 
cheeks, and the maw. 

4. The firstfruit also of your corn, of 
your wine, and of your oil, and the 
first of the fleece of your sheep, shall
you give him. 

themselves amongst the other faculties of the soul;
they ever remain distinct as coming from the Lord,
and they receive influx or support direct from the 
Lord by internal dictate (AC 9809).

3. And this is what the holy impulses of charity shall 
receive from the truths that are with the soul, when
the Lord is worshiped by them, whether it be in 
external or internal worship: these good impulses 
shall receive from them power to act, to make 
known their good intentions, and to communicate 
with the outer world.

4. And the real good derived from your faith, and all 

your perceptions of spiritual truth (AC 9223), all 
your holy affections, and the use you can perform 
from charity, you shall ascribe to these holy 
influences.

108

 
5. For the LORD your God has chosen 
him out of all your tribes, to stand to 
minister in the name of the LORD, 
him and his sons for ever. 

5. For the Divine Love and Wisdom have appointed 
these means out of the faculties of the soul to 
minister to it the things which are Divine, both 
these holy influences and all the things derived 
from them in every state of regeneration.

6. And if a Levite come from any of 

6. And if those holy impulses for good which exist in

your gates out of all Israel, where he 
sojourned, and come with all the 
desire of his mind to the place which
the LORD shall choose; 

7. Then he shall minister in the name of

the LORD his God, as all his 
brethren the Levites do, which stand 
there before the LORD. 

8. They shall have like portions to eat, 
beside that which comes of the sale 
of his patrimony. 

any of the external faculties of the spiritual mind 
desire to rise to higher things, and, seek with all 
the power and desire of the mind to conform 
themselves to the pattern set in the Lord's 
Humanity;

7. Then shall be impressed on these good desires and 
impulses the qualities derived from the Lord's 
Humanity and they shall minister to the welfare of 
the soul as those other perceptions of charity 
which are received direct by influx from the Lord 
into the higher faculties of the soul.

8. They shall alike be recruited by influx of good and
truth from heaven, besides the blessing which 
comes from the alienation of anything of 
ignorance or imperfection from the soul.

9. When you are come into the land 
which the LORD your God gives 
you, you shall not learn to do after 
the abominations of those nations. 

9. When you are come to the heavenly states with 

which the Divine Love and Wisdom will gift you, 
you shall not be seduced to conjoin those states 
with any of the evils of the unregenerate heart.

10. There shall not be found among you 
any one that makes his son or his 
daughter to pass through the fire, or 
that useth divination, or an observer 
of times, or an enchanter, or a witch. 

11. Or a charmer, or a consulter with 
familiar spirits, or a wizard, or a 
necromancer. 

10. It shall not be permitted in the soul that any of the 
goods and truths of the Church should be profaned
to serve self-love, nor shall any principle be 
tolerated that searches into the mysteries of faith 
for selfish ends, and is thus governed by influx 
from hell (that divineth divinations, and that asks 
questions of the hells), or which conjoins the holy 
things of the Church with the loves of self and of 
the world;

11. Or that draws away the soul by worldly delights 

and communicates with evil spirits, and that trusts 
to the falses of evil and the maxims derived from 
self-intelligence (is a soothsayer and makes 
inquiry of the dead).

109

12. For all that do these things are an 
abomination to the LORD: and 
because of these abominations the 
LORD your God does drive them 
out from before you. 

12. For all these things pollute religion and make the 

soul averse to heaven; and because they are averse 
to all good, the providence of the Divine Love and 
Wisdom is directed to drive them out of the heart.

13. You shall be perfect with the LORD 

13. You shall be perfect, and endeavour with 

your God. 

singleness of heart to follow solely the dictates of 
the Divine Love and Wisdom (Matt 5:48).

14. For these nations, which you shall 
possess, hearkened to observers of 
times, and to diviners: but as for you,
the LORD your God has not suffered
you so to do. 

14. For the natural affections over which you shall 

obtain dominion are prone to follow the falsities 
proceeding from the love of self and self-derived 
intelligence, but the regenerate will is restrained by
the Divine Love and Wisdom from doing so.

15. The LORD your God will raise up to
you a Prophet from the midst of you,
of your brethren, like me; to him you
shall hearken; 

16. According to all that you desiredst of
the LORD your God in Horeb in the 
day of the assembly, saying, Let me 
not hear again the voice of the 
LORD my God, neither let me see 
this great fire any more, that I die 
not. 

15. The Divine Love and Wisdom will raise up in the 
soul Divine truth itself, derived from the Humanity
of the Lord and from the Word (which is the 
Divine truth in its internal principles), in which a 
life of genuine charity is the basis, like the truths 
which led it forth from the unregenerate condition;
and this the soul shall hearken to and obey;

16. According to all the desire of the natural man from
the Divine Love and Wisdom, when the soul is in a
state of external worship, and from that state 
contemplates Divine things and the Divinity as a 
strict judge, in which the natural man fears to 
perceive the requirements of the Divine Law, and 
to perceive the complete abnegation of self 
required by the Divine commands, and the burning
zeal of the Lord against sin and evil, on account of
the destruction of all that is good that they bring 
upon the soul, and feels that there is no power in 
the soul itself to contend with evil, which will 
bring destruction upon the spiritual life;

17. And the LORD said to me, They 
have well spoken that which they 
have spoken. 

17. And the soul is reassured by the Divine mercy, 

which teaches that it is well for it to feel its own 
unworthiness;

110

18. I will raise them up a Prophet from 
among their brethren, like you, and 
will put my words in his mouth; and 
he shall speak to them all that I shall 
command him. 

19. And it shall come to pass, that 

whoever will not hearken to my 
words which he shall speak in my 
name, I will require it of him. 

18. The Lord will raise up for the soul doctrines of 

truth from His Divine Humanity, and thereby 
suited to every condition of the soul, of which a 
life of charity is the basis, and in accordance with 
former truths received in the soul proceeding from 
the Word, and will instil the revelation of His will 
into these doctrines; and they shall explain the 
Divine will to the soul in a form accommodated to 
its new condition.

19. And it shall come to pass that whoever will not 
obey the perception of the Lord's will revealed 
through these doctrines for his guidance, will sin 
against knowledge, and thereby damage his soul. 
[Note (verses 15-19).—These verses seem to teach
that the Lord ever reveals Himself to the human 
race in a character accommodated to their state, 
hence the number of religions which have existed 
in the world, and hence the attributes of Deity as 
conceived of by the Jews, by the first Christian 
Church, and again by the New Church, are quite 
different; and hence indeed the necessity, when the
time was fully come, for the appearance of the 
Lord on earth in human form, that there might be 
no misconception as to His character; which 
advent is evidently foretold in the literal sense in 
these verses. In the spiritual sense, the acceptance 
of the doctrine of the absolute Divinity of the Lord
Jesus Christ as the only God, with the truths that 
flow therefrom, is described, which is also meant 
by the Second Coming of the Lord (AE 870). It 
must be evident to the candid mind that the Lord 
Jesus Christ has not been accepted by the first 
Christian Church, at all events in the popular idea, 
as the one only God (the Alpha and Omega), but as
a secondary Deity, distinct from and in some way 
inferior to another Deity who is called the Father, 
and whose character is represented as being quite 
different; so that the latter is said to require 
intercession, and even to be appeased by the 
sufferings of the former; so that, whatever may be 
said in creeds, two gods are thought of in the 
mind, as separate and distinct as those of the 
religions which are called polytheisms.]

111

20. But the prophet, which shall presume
to speak a word in my name, which I
have not commanded him to speak, 
or that shall speak in the name of 
other gods, even that prophet shall 
die. 

21. And if you say in your heart, How 
shall we know the word which the 
LORD has not spoken? 

22. When a prophet speaks in the name 
of the LORD, if the thing follow not,
nor come to pass, that is the thing 
which the LORD has not spoken, but
the prophet has spoken it 
presumptuously: you shall not be 
afraid of him. 

20. But those doctrines which profess to teach the 
Lord's will, but which are not derived from the 
Lord's Divine Humanity, but which teach the soul 
to worship other things as the supreme good; these
are falses to be removed from the soul.

21. And if you shall say in your heart, How can we 

detect falses which do not proceed from the Lord?

22. When a doctrine professes to teach the things 

derived from the Lord's Divine Humanity, but does
not, when followed out, produce any good effect 
upon the life, this is then a falsity which does not 
proceed from the Lord; it proceeds from self-
intelligence, and shall not be regarded (Matt 7:15-
20).

112

Deuteronomy Chapter 19

Verses 1-3. When the soul follows sincerely the truths it knows, faults committed through ignorance do 
not bring guilt or hurt to the soul.
Verses 4-10. An example of this.
Verses 11-13. But theories which are maliciously and persistently against charity are to be destroyed.
Verse 14. The highest standard of good and truth the soul can reach to be rigidly maintained. 
Verse 15. One unconfirmed truth not to condemn anything, but several agreeing together to be taken as
a proof of evil.
Verses 16-21. On the decisions in the soul between evil and good, and between truth and falsity. Evil 
and falsity when brought to light to be destroyed. 

1. When the LORD your God has cut 
off the nations, whose land the 
LORD your God gives you, and you 
succeedest them, and dwell in their 
cities, and in their houses; 

2. You shall separate three cities for 

you in the midst of your land, which 
the LORD your God gives you to 
possess it. 

1. WHEN the Divine Love and Wisdom have 

subjected the evils of the unregenerate heart, 
whose place shall be occupied by the thoughts and 
intentions inspired into the soul from the Divine 
Love and Wisdom which shall succeed them, and 
dwell in the understanding and its doctrines, and in
the will and its intents and desires;

2. There shall be provided states of blamelessness, if 
the soul commits a fault from errors of doctrine, in
the interior thought and will of those new 
regenerate states received as your own from the 
Divine Love and Wisdom.

3. You shall prepare you a way, and 

3. You shall believe in the truths of the Church as 

divide the coasts of your land, which
the LORD your God gives you to 
inherit, into three parts, that every 
slayer may flee thither. 

revealed to your highest perceptions of truth, and 
place all the external truths of the mind which the 
Divine Love and Wisdom has permitted you to 
enjoy in orderly arrangement and subjection to the 
truths of the Church, and then any principle 
destructive of good or truth, through ignorance in 
the soul, shall be blameless.

4. And this is the case of the slayer, 

4. And this is the case with any principle in the mind 

which shall flee thither, that he may 
live: Whoever kills his neighbour 
ignorantly, whom he hated not in 
time past; 

destructive of good through error, which shall be 
blameless and bring no hurt to the soul: Whatever 
destroys goodness and truth through ignorance, 
and not from the malice of an evil heart;

113

 
5. As when a man goes into the wood 

with his neighbour to hew wood, and
his hand fetcheth a stroke with the 
axe to cut down the tree, and the 
head slippeth from the helve, and 
lights upon his neighbour, that he 
die; he shall flee to one of those 
cities, and live: 

6. Lest the avenger of the blood pursue 
the slayer, while his heart is hot, and 
overtake him, because the way is 
long, and slay him; whereas he was 
not worthy of death, inasmuch as he 
hated him not in time past. 

7. Wherefore I command you, saying, 
You shall separate three cities for 
you. 

8. And if the LORD your God enlarge 
your coast, as he has sworn to your 
fathers, and give you all the land 
which he promised to give to your 
fathers; 

9.

If you shall keep all these 
commandments to do them, which I 
command you this day, to love the 
LORD your God, and to walk ever 
in his ways; then shall you add three 
cities more for you, beside these 
three: 

10. That innocent blood be not shed in 

your land, which the LORD your 
God gives you for an inheritance, 
and so blood be upon you. 

5. As when one who is principled in good disputes 
concerning good and truths from his religious 
tenets, and his powers are directed to destroy some
principle which he believes to be false by 
enforcing the tenets he believes to be true, and in 
his effort truth and good become separated with 
him, and he destroys the charity with which he is 
associated, he shall be kept in safety by the Lord 
and shall not thereby lose spiritual life (AC 9011):

6. Lest the punishment of destroying the influx of 

good and truth from the Lord should follow such a
one for the destruction of charity while his will is 
imbued with the evil proceeding from false 
doctrine, and come upon him so as to destroy his 
spiritual life, because he is far removed from real 
truth; whereas his interior will is not in a state of 
condemnation, inasmuch as the destruction of 
charity does not proceed from a heart averse to all 
good and truth (but from mistaken tenets).

7. Wherefore it is the will of the Lord that there shall 
be states of preservation and blamelessness for 
those who have destroyed what is good from false 
religious tenets sincerely believed.

8. And if the faculties of the external mind become 
increased from influx of the Divine Love and 
Wisdom, as is the Divine will for those who are in 
good, and the soul becomes gifted with all those 
heavenly states which are promised in the Word to 
those who receive good from the Lord;

9.

If you carry out in the life all that you shall 
perceive of the Lord's will in your regenerate 
states, to love the Divine Love and Wisdom above 
all things, and habitually to conform your life to 
them; then shall you be more completely purified 
from the evils arising from errors of doctrine:

10. That the Divine principle inseminated by the Lord 
in the interiors of the soul be not destroyed, which 
the Divine Love and Wisdom desire to appropriate
to you, and so the guilt of quenching the Holy 
Spirit (which is spiritual murder) be upon you.

114

11. But if any man hate his neighbour, 
and lie in wait for him, and rise up 
against him, and smite him mortally 
that he die, and flees into one of 
these cities: 

12. Then the elders of his city shall send 
and fetch him thence, and deliver 
him into the hand of the avenger of 
blood, that he may die. 

11. But if any principle in the soul proceeding from 

the evil of the heart is utterly averse to all charity 
and seeks every occasion to destroy it; and ever 
opposes it and aims at the inmost life of good in 
the soul to destroy it, and seeks to justify itself 
from religious tenets believed by the soul:

12. Then the true wisdom given by the Lord to the 

soul from religion shall by rigid self-examination 
root out that falsity, and give it over to destruction 
as something profane and evil, that it may be 
destroyed out of the soul,

13. Yours eye shall not pity him, but you
shall put away the guilt of innocent 
blood from Israel, that it may go 
well with you. 

13. The understanding shall not favour it, but you shall
put away everything which destroys the influx 
from the Lord into the spiritual mind, that it may 
go well with the life of the soul.

14. You shall not remove your 

14. You shall not let selfishness or worldly-

neighbour's landmark, which they of 
old time have set in your inheritance,
which you shall inherit in the land 
that the LORD your God gives you 
to possess it. 

15. One witness shall not rise up against 
a man for any iniquity, or for any 
sin, in any sin that he sins: at the 
mouth of two witnesses, or at the 
mouth of three witnesses, shall the 
matter be established. 

16. If a false witness rise up against any 
man to testify against him that which
is wrong; 

mindedness diminish the standard of good 
appointed by the highest wisdom you can attain to,
derived from the Word according to the perception
given you, which you shall receive in the new 
states or regenerate character which the Divine 
Love and Wisdom give you as your own.

15. If One opinion or view of a matter (though it seem 

derived from good) shall not be permitted to rise 
up against any principle in the soul to condemn it 
as being against the good derived from faith, or to 
condemn any act or desire of the will as being 
against the genuine life of charity; but when good 
and truth both testify against it, or where several 
truths combine to condemn it, the matter enforced 
by them shall be considered fully confirmed (AC 
4197).

16. If any falsity, either derived from education or the 
religious persuasions received in childhood, or the 
lust of evil, rise up in the mind against the goods 
and truths of faith to proclaim them to be evil and 
false;

17. Then both the men, between whom 

17. Then both the doctrines or desires about which 

the controversy is, shall stand before 
the LORD, before the priests and the
judges, which shall be in those days; 

there is dispute in the mind shall be compared with
the standard of the Divine Humanity, by the 
perception of good and judgement of truth which 
is given to the soul in its then state;

115

18. And the judges shall make diligent 
inquisition: and, behold, if the 
witness be a false witness, and has 
testified falsely against his brother; 

18. And the soul shall make diligent examination of 
itself by means of these perceptions; and if it is 
clearly seen that the doctrines or opinions rising up
in the mind testify falsely against principles in the 
soul that are really truths of faith, and the good 
thence derived;

19. Then shall you do to him, as he had 
thought to have done to his brother: 
so shall you put the evil away from 
among you. 

19. Then shall these opinions be destroyed out of the 
mind in proportion as they are perceived to be 
against real charity; and so shall evil be put away 
from the soul.

20. And those which remain shall hear, 
and fear, and shall now on commit 
no more any such evil among you. 

20. And the doctrines and opinions that remain shall 

be confirmed, and be in subjection to the 
perception of good, and so the soul will be 
preserved from sinning against the goods and 
truths that are given it from heaven.

21. And your eye shall not pity; but life 

21. (In these self-examinations) the understanding, 

shall go for life, eye for eye, tooth 
for tooth, hand for hand, foot for 
foot. 

and perception given to the soul shall not permit 
itself to be biassed in favour of anything that is 
false by the unregenerate will: what is destructive 
of spiritual life shall be utterly destroyed out of the
soul; what dims the perception of truth shall be 
accounted as false; what destroys the exterior 
understanding of truth shall be accounted a falsity 
proceeding from the sensual principle; any 
principle that destroys spiritual truth in act must be
accounted destitute of spiritual truth; and anything 
that destroys natural truth will lose the perception 
of natural truth (according to the law of order in 
the spiritual world, that evil intended, immediately
recoils upon the author (AC 9048-9057)). 
[Note (verses 15-21).—To set a question at rest by 
a dogmatic doctrine; or by this or that text by 
itself, is not the way to arrive at the real truth; the 
subject should be looked at and examined from all 
its bearings, and the various passages in the Word 
relating to it taken together, and its effects on the 
life for good or evil considered; otherwise the soul 
will lose perception of rational truth, though the 
memory may be a receptacle of the dogmas of 
others.]

Egypt. 

2. And it shall be, when you are come 
near to the battle, that the priest shall
approach and speak to the people, 

1. WHEN the spiritual man passes out from interior 
reflection to combat with evils and falsities, and 
perceives the numerous arguments and doctrinals 
ranged in favour of evil, and that falsities seem to 
be more abundant and powerful than truths, he 
should not be afraid of them; for the Divine Love 
and Wisdom are with Him, which brought the soul
out of its unregenerate condition.

2. And it shall be, when the soul feels itself falling 
into temptations and surrounded by evils and 
falsities, it will receive aid by means of the soul's 
aspirations after real good, which shall be more 
closely united with it;

3. And shall say to them, Hear, O 
Israel, you approach this day to 
battle against your enemies: let not 
your hearts faint, fear not, and do not
tremble, neither be you terrified 
because of them; 

3. And from these the soul shall perceive that a state 
has arrived in which the spiritual man must 
contend as if from himself with evils and falsities; 
and that the will must not be allowed to succumb, 
nor should the soul fear, or be in trepidation, or be 
dismayed because of them:

4. For the LORD your God is he that 
goes with you, to fight for you 
against your enemies, to save you. 

4. For the Love and Wisdom proceeding from the 
Lord's Humanity are with the regenerate in all 
their struggles, and contend for them against all 
evil and falsity to save them (AE 734).

117

 
5. And the officers shall speak to the 
people, saying, What man is there 
that has built a new house, and has 
not dedicated it? let him go and 
return to his house, lest he die in the 
battle, and another man dedicate it. 

6. And what man is he that has planted 
a vineyard, and has not yet eaten of 
it? let him also go and return to his 
house, lest he die in the battle, and 
another man eat of it. 

7. And what man is there that has 

betrothed a wife, and has not taken 
her? let him go and return to his 
house, lest he die in the battle, and 
another man take her. 

8. And the officers shall speak further 
to the people, and they shall say, 
What man is there that is fearful and 
fainthearted? let him go and return to
his house, lest his brethren's heart 
faint as well as his heart. 

5. And the new regenerate will and the principles 

under it appointed over the faculties of the mind 
shall thus order them in time of temptation by 
careful self-examination; If the new will for good 
has been received in the external mind, but is not 
fully established; then let the endeavour be made 
to firmly establish the will for good, lest the soul 
perish in temptations, and the will for evil be 
implanted instead of for good.

6. And if the truths of faith have been received in the 

external mind, but have not been appropriated to 
the soul by carrying them out; let these first be 
fully implanted in the will, lest the soul perish in 
temptations, and evil be conjoined to the truths in 
the mind.

7. And if the love of good and truth are both received
in the external mind, but are not yet conjoined by 
the practice of charity; then let them both be firmly
implanted in the will, lest the soul perish in 
temptations, and the marriage of evil and falsity 
instead of good and truth have place in the soul.

8. And this shall also be impressed upon the faculties

of the mind by the powers appointed by the new 
regenerate will, that if any affection or principle in 
the soul wavers and is not firmly opposed to the 
evil or falsity which tempts; then let this principle 
be brought to accord with the regenerate will, lest 
the other thoughts and affections waver like it.

118

9. And it shall be, when the officers 

have made an end of speaking to the 
people that they shall make captains 
of the armies to lead the people. 

9. And it shall be that when the thoughts and 
affections received in the soul by the new 
regenerate will have thus ordered all its faculties, 
that they will be led by wisdom from heaven, and 
be prepared to fight against evil and falsity.
[Note (verses 1-9).—From these verses may be 
learned the necessity of fighting in temptations as 
if from oneself, and leaving no stone unturned to 
conquer.
Verses 1-4. It will not do to say the soul cannot 
contend with evil; it can, for the Lord rights for it.
Verse 5. The will must be kept resolutely on the 
right side.
Verse 6. All the truths known which will assist 
against the evil must be made use of.
Verse 7. The will and the intellect must act 
together as one, and Verse 8. the soul must hold on
with fortitude.]

10. When you comest near to a city to

fight against it, then proclaim peace 
to it. 

finds its progress impeded by doctrines existing in 
the mind, then it should be seen if these doctrines 
can be brought into conformity with the perception
of good given to the soul.

11. And it shall be, if it make you 

11. And it shall be, that if these doctrines are in 

answer of peace, and open to you, 
then it shall be, that all the people 
that is found therein shall be

serve you. 

conformity with the soul's perception of good, and 
receive the living influx from heaven, then all the 
truths belonging to those doctrines shall be 
conducive to regeneration, and shall serve the new 
regenerate will.

12. And if it will make no peace with

you, but will make war against you, 
then you shall besiege it: 

perception of good given to the regenerate, and 
endeavour to destroy the work of regeneration, 
then the regenerate will must fight against them as 
false doctrines:

13. And when the LORD your God has 
delivered it into your hands, you 
shall smite every male thereof with 
the edge of the sword: 

13. And when the Divine Love and Wisdom have 
subjected them under the power of the new 
regenerate will, you shall destroy all the falses 
thereof with the power of Divine truth from the 
Word:

119

14. But the women, and the little ones, 
and the cattle, and all that is in the 
city, even all the spoil thereof, shall 
you take to yourself; and you shall 
eat the spoil of your enemies, which 
the LORD your God has given you. 

15. Thus shall you do to all the cities 
which are very far off from you, 
which are not of the cities of these 
nations. 

16. But of the cities of these people, 
which the LORD your God does 
give you for an inheritance, you shall
save alive nothing that breathes: 

17. But you shall utterly destroy them; 
namely, the Hittites, and the 
Amorites, the Canaanites, and the 
Perizzites, the Hivites, and the 
Jebusites; as the LORD your God 
has commanded you: 

18. That they teach you not to do after 
all their abominations, which they 
have done to their gods; so should 
you sin against the LORD your God.

14. But the good affections thereof and all that are 

innocent, and the natural affections thereof and all 
that can. be made subservient to use in those 
doctrines, all the good that remains after 
temptation, shall be appropriated to the soul; thus 
the regenerate life will be recruited by good and 
truth acquired in temptation-combats with evil and
falsity, which will be appropriated to the soul by 
the Divine Love and Wisdom.

15. Thus shall you do to all doctrines relating to the 
external man (to outward actions and words) 
which are not doctrines derived from interior evils.

16. But of the doctrines derived from these falses 

(namely, those derived from the interior evil of the 
unregenerate heart) which the Divine Love and 
Wisdom replace by the good affections of the new 
proprium given from heaven, you shall not permit 
desire, thought, or action from such a source to 
remain in the soul:

17. But you shall utterly destroy them, namely—

(Hittites) The falsities of doctrine which permit or 
encourage evil, and (Amorites) the evils thus 
engendered, (Canaanites) The evils proceeding 
from the lusts of the love of self and of the world 
in the internal mind, and (Perizzites) The falses 
which these evils give birth to in the mind to 
excuse them. (See AC 6858-59.) (The Hittites and 
Jebusites) The worship of anything except the 
Lord as the supreme good, even though there may 
be something of good and truth in the thing 
worshiped (AC 6860). These shall be utterly 
destroyed according to the perception given you of
their evil character from the Divine Love and 
Wisdom:

18. That they seduce not the soul to pervert all the 

good and truth it has received by prostituting them 
to the service of selfish and worldly loves, which 
is the tendency of all these interior evils and 
falsities; for thus the soul would be averted from 
all Divine Goodness and Wisdom. 

120

19. When you shall besiege a city a long 
time, in making war against it to take
it, you shall not destroy the trees 
thereof by forcing an axe against 
them: for you may eat of them, and 
you shall not cut them down (for the 
tree of the field is man's life) to 
employ them in the siege: 

20. Only the trees which you know that 
they be not trees for meat, you shall 
destroy and cut them down; and you 
shall build bulwarks against the city 
that makes war with you, until it be 
subdued. 

19. When the regenerate will has great difficulty in 
overcoming the arguments of falses that oppose 
truth (either in the man's own mind or in the minds
of others), and endures severe temptations because
of them, great care must be taken not to destroy 
the knowledges or perceptions of truth which 
support the false doctrine (as far as they are 
genuine) by the dogmatic assertion of truth; for 
these perceptions or knowledges may be 
conducive to the regenerate life; you shall not 
obliterate these perceptions, for these very 
perceptions, which form the soul's rational 
perception of truth, are the very means by which 
the false doctrines may be eventually overcome in 
the soul (for, O man, the tree of the field is to be 
employed in the siege, marginal reading).

20. Only those perceptions or knowledges which you 
know are not perceptions or knowledges that can 
nourish the regenerate life, you shall destroy and 
pluck them out of the mind; and thus you shall 
raise a defence against the false doctrines that 
oppose the regenerate life until they be subdued. 
[Note.—From this passage we learn that even real 
truths inseminated into the soul in a state of 
compulsion or without being rationally understood
do not assist regeneration.]

Deuteronomy Chapter 21

Verses 1-9. On the purification of the external man from the guilt of rejecting the Divine Influx when 
this has been done through ignorance.
Verses 10-14. On the adoption of natural affections by the spiritual man. 
Verses 15-17. Things inferior are not to be put before others of more importance in the formation of the
character because they are more pleasing to the natural disposition.
Verses 18-21. What stubbornly opposes good and truth in the soul is to be destroyed out of it.
Verses 22, 23. Evils once seen and acknowledged to be destroyed there and then, and not suffered to 
remain in succeeding states. 

1.

If one be found slain in the land 
which the LORD your God gives 
you to possess it, lying in the field, 
and it be not known who has slain 
him: 

2. Then your elders and your judges 
shall come forth, and they shall 
measure to the cities which are round
about him that is slain: 

3. And it shall be, that the city which is 
next to the slain man, even the elders
of that city shall take an heifer, 
which has not been worked with, and
which has not drawn in the yoke; 

1.

IF the Divine Spirit or Influx of good and truth 
from heaven be found profaned, perverted, or 
extinguished in the soul in the new states which 
the Divine Love and Wisdom have given you as 
your own in regeneration, being destroyed in the 
external man, and it be not known what caused it 
to perish;

2. Then shall the soul, by means of its truths which 
are from good, and the power of judgement in 
spiritual things given it, consider the doctrines 
believed in which are most allied to the state in 
which the Divine Spirit is perceived to be 
quenched in the external man:

3. And with respect to that doctrine of faith which 

has most affinity with the state in which the Divine
influence is extinguished, the primary truths in that
doctrine shall take of the good of the natural man 
which is in innocence from not having yet 
attracted to the soul the falses of faith and evils of 
self-love by the service of lusts;

122

 
4. And the elders of that city shall bring
down the heifer to a rough valley, 
which is neither eared nor sown, and 
shall strike off the heifer's neck there
in the valley: 

5. And the priests the sons of Levi shall
come near; for them the LORD your 
God has chosen to minister to him, 
and to bless in the name of the 
LORD; and by their word shall every
controversy and every stroke be 
tried: 

4. And the primary truths of that doctrine agreeing 
with good, together with the good of the natural 
man which is in innocence, shall be brought to a 
perception of their ignorance and obscure state, in 
which there are naturally no genuine truths and 
goods of faith, and in that state of humiliation the 
soul shall reject all that is evil in the doctrines 
imbibed into the external memory, and be freed 
from the evils resulting, because the influx from 
heaven was destroyed through ignorance (AC 
9262, see also AC 8902, 4503):

5. And the good desires and aspirations received 

from the Lord both in spiritual and natural things 
shall be more closely adjoined to the interiors of 
the soul; for these are what minister the things of 
the Divine Love and Wisdom to the soul, and 
confer upon it the qualities derived from the 
Divine Humanity (the Lord Jesus Christ); and by 
perception derived from them shall every difficulty
as to doctrine and as to life be decided:

6. And all the elders of that city, that 

6. And all the truths derived from good in that 

are next to the slain man, shall wash 
their hands over the heifer that is 
beheaded in the valley: 

7. And they shall answer and say, Our 
hands have not shed this blood, 
neither have our eyes seen it. 

8. Be merciful, O LORD, to your 
people Israel, whom you have 
redeemed, and lay not innocent 
blood to your people of Israel's 
charge. And the blood shall be 
forgiven them. 

doctrine, which was allied to the state in which the
Divine Influx was found extinguished in the soul, 
shall be purified from the guilt of profaning or 
rejecting Divine truth, being expiated by the 
innocence of ignorance of the external man:

7. And through them the soul shall confess and 

perceive that these holy influences have not been 
profaned or extinguished through any intention of 
the will, nor with the knowledge of the 
understanding.

8. Be merciful, O Lord, to the regenerating soul 

which You have brought forth from its hereditary 
evil condition, and let not the heinous sin of 
quenching the Divine Spirit which flows from You
come upon the spiritual man; and the soul shall be 
delivered from the evil that comes from the 
rejection or perversion of Divine truth.

123

9. So shall you put away the guilt of 
innocent blood from among you, 
when you shall do that which is right
in the sight of the LORD. 

9. And thus you shall be saved from the rejection or 
perversion of the Divine Influx into the soul, when
you shall carry out the Lord's will as far as 
perception of it is given you. 
[Note (verses 1-9).—From this passage may we 
not learn that the soul will sometimes discover in 
the course of regeneration that all the good that 
flows in from heaven is extinguished by the evil 
tendencies of the natural man? but need not 
despair; for is it not warned in the Word 
beforehand that the unregenerate heart is deceitful 
above all things, and desperately wicked? Only let 
the regenerating be careful that all their powers are
directed to guard against the tendencies to evil in 
the external man being conjoined to the interior 
soul, by being embraced by the affections, and 
permitted by the understanding. If the soul is in the
perception that all good is from the Lord and 
implores His aid, and that all evil is from hell and 
its own perverted tendencies, and desires to shun 
them; no evil will be imputed to it. (See AC 
10219, 6325, 6203-4). The Lord Himself had all 
the tendencies to evil that we have from His 
Humanity derived from the mother, but as He 
never permitted them to be conjoined to Himself 
by adoption, He was without sin, and conjoined 
this perfected Humanity in Himself to the Divinity,
which was His interior soul. Thus by His conquest 
over these tendencies to evil the human race 
became conjoined to the Divinity, and it is by our 
conquest over these tendencies by the Divine aid 
thus acquired, that we become conjoined to the 
Divine life— that is, saved. (See AC 1414, 9452.)]

10. When you go forth to war against 
your enemies, and the LORD your 
God has delivered them into your 
hands, and you have taken them 
captive, 

10. When the soul is remitted into externals to combat 
the evils and falsities which exist in the external 
mind, and the Divine Love and Wisdom have 
reduced them under the power of the regenerate 
will, and they are under its control,

11. And see among the captives a 

beautiful woman, and have a desire 
to her, that you would have her to 
your wife; 

11. And you perceive amongst these external things 
now subject to the regenerate will, affections of 
the natural man, well-pleasing and delightful to the
soul, and the soul desires these, and to have them 
adjoined to its life, 

124

12. Then you shall bring her home to 

your house, and she shall shave her 
head, and pare her nails; 

13. And she shall put the clothing of her 
captivity from off her, and shall 
remain in your house, and bewail her
father and her mother a full month: 
and after that you shall go in to her, 
and be her husband, and she shall be 
your wife. 

14. And it shall be, if you have no 

delight in her, then you shall let her 
go whither she will; but you shall not
sell her at all for money, you shall 
not make merchandise of her, 
because you have humbled her. 

12. These affections shall then be introduced into the 
interiors of the soul by the regenerate will; and 
shall there be purified from the things belonging 
thereto, which are unclean, and void of spiritual 
life in externals (AC 3301);

13. And all things that were remote from spiritual life 
in these affections shall be put off (AC 3703), and 
they shall become more closely conjoined to the 
regenerate will, and shall arrive at a new state in 
which the evils and falsities formerly belonging to 
that state are buried in oblivion (AE 555): and 
after this these affections maybe conjoined to the 
regenerating soul, the regenerate will derived from
the Lord will impart its own quality to them, and 
they will be helpful to the regenerate life.

14. And it shall be that if these affections cease to be 
delightful and helpful to the regenerating soul, 
then you shall relinquish them; but you shall not 
alienate them from spiritual uses to the service of 
self, you shall not turn them to selfish and worldly 
ends, because you have adjoined them to your 
spiritual life. 
[Note (verses 10-14).—Thus, for example, these 
verses seem to teach that when the regenerating 
soul examines the depths of the heart to cast out 
the evils therefrom; many things will be found, 
such as the desire for wealth, worldly position, and
so forth, which are not harmful in themselves, but 
only become so when they dominate over the 
spiritual man; and that these may be adopted by 
the latter, purified from evil and turned to good 
uses, and thus become helpful to regeneration, but 
they are not necessary to spiritual life, and may be 
relinquished; but having adopted them, they must 
not be deprived of all that is spiritual by being 
turned exclusively to worldly and selfish ends.] 

125

15. If a man have two wives, one 

15. If the regenerating soul has conjoined to it the 

beloved, and another hated, and they 
have born him children, both the 
beloved and the hated; and if the 
firstborn son be hers that was hated: 

16. Then it shall be, when he makes his 
sons to inherit that which he has, that
he may not make the son of the 
beloved firstborn before the son of 
the hated, which is indeed the 
firstborn: 

17. But he shall acknowledge the son of 
the hated for the firstborn, by giving 
him a double portion of all that he 
has: for he is the beginning of his 
strength; the right of the firstborn is 
his. 

affection of good and truth spiritual, and the 
affection of good and truth natural (that is, the 
affection of doing good from really wise principles
derived from heaven, which are internal and 
spiritual; and the affection of doing good from the 
natural disposition or good-nature, as it is called, 
which is external), and one is delightful to the will 
and the other is distasteful; and from both are 
derived principles of life and doctrine in the 
character, both from the internal and the external 
affection, and those principles which are really 
essential to spiritual life are derived from the 
affection which is distasteful to the will: 

16. Then it shall be that when the soul in the course of 
regeneration begins to acquire goods and truths by 
means of the principles derived from these 
affections, those principles derived from the 
affection of the natural disposition, and which are 
therefore agreeable to the will, must not be put 
before those derived from the affection distasteful 
to the will, if the latter are perceived to be the real 
essential principles of life derived from heaven:

17. But those principles which are felt to be of primary
importance and real truths derived from heaven, 
even though they are repugnant to the natural 
disposition, must be allowed to have a double 
share in the formation of the regenerate character; 
for thereby comes the first dawning of spiritual life
in the soul; and these principles are given to have 
the primary share in the formation of the 
regenerate character. [Note.—This subject may be 
further illustrated by the account of Jacob's wives, 
Rachel and Leah (see AC 3919), also by the 
consideration of the conduct of parents towards 
their children, where it would be well-pleasing to 
indulge them, but really wise to correct them; —
generally to give, from good-nature, people what 
they clamour for is natural, and to give them what 
is believed to be for their good ultimately is 
spiritual—and to give the same to the various 
appetites and desires of one's own mind is to 
behave with like wisdom towards oneself. (See AC
988, 4992, 5008, 5028, 5032, etc.)]

126

18. If a man have a stubborn and 

18. If there be in the mind a stubborn and rebellious 

rebellious son, which will not obey 
the voice of his father, or the voice 
of his mother, and that, when they 
have chastened him, will not hearken
to them: 

19. Then shall his father and his mother 
lay hold on him, and bring him out 
to the elders of his city, and to the 
gate of his place; 

20. And they shall say to the elders of 

his city, This our son is stubborn and
rebellious, he will not obey our 
voice; he is a glutton, and a 
drunkard. 

principle derived from the false doctrines received 
from education, which will not obey the 
perception given by the good and truths of the 
Church, and when these have done everything 
possible to bring it into conformity, still will not 
obey:

19. Then shall the regenerating soul by means of the 
goods and truths of the Church lay hold of this 
stubborn principle, and bring it out to light before 
such truths derived from good as exist in the 
doctrines from which it is derived, and to such 
elementary truths as may exist in the state derived 
from those doctrines.

20. And by means of the good and truth of the Church 
it shall be made evident to the perception of truth 
existing from that doctrine that the principle is 
unyielding to the influences of good and truth, and
opposes them, and quenches the Divine Influx in 
the soul; and eagerly appropriates evil, and 
imbibes falses which dissipate true wisdom.

21. And all the men of his city shall 

21. Then all that is really good and true in that 

stone him with stones, that he die: so
shall you put evil away from among 
you; and all Israel shall hear, and 
fear. 

doctrine will combine to destroy that stubborn 
principle in the natural mind by the plain truths of 
the Word, that it trouble the soul no more: thus will
evil be removed from the midst of the soul; and all
that is spiritual in the soul shall perceive and obey, 
and fear to act against the good and truth of the 
Church. (See also AE 655.) 
[Note.— This passage (verses 18-21) has relation 
to the violation of truth, as is evident from the 
signification of stoning (see AC 5156), and shows 
that one may judge of doctrines by the effect they 
have on the life; if they reject good influences and 
lead the soul to love evil or to neglect virtue, they 
must be destroyed; no matter how true they have 
been deemed, or how much they have been 
cherished by the soul before.]

22. And if a man have committed a sin 
worthy of death, and he be to be put 
to death, and you hang him on a tree:

22. When there shall be found in the soul an evil 
which ought to be destroyed; and it is seen to 
induce a state utterly devoid of spiritual life, so 
that it must be rejected as utterly averse to the 
good of heaven and the Church:

127

23. His body shall not remain all night 
upon the tree, but you shall in any 
wise bury him that day; (for he that 
is hanged is accursed of God;) that 
your land be not defiled, which the 
LORD your God gives you for an 
inheritance. 

23. You shall not permit any remnant of this evil to 
remain in the proprium through the period of 
temptation to succeeding states of regeneration, 
but shall entirely reject it in the state in which its 
malignity has been fully perceived (for evils that 
are seen and acknowledged separate the soul from 
all spiritual life if not removed); that the holy 
states be not denied, with which the soul is gifted 
by the Divine Love and Wisdom in regeneration. 
(See also AE 655.)

from a natural origin or from a spiritual origin in

Lord and charity to the neighbour, and neglect the

all its powers to bring them back to heavenly 
order.

2. And if your brother be not near to 
you, or if you know him not, then 
you shall bring it to your own house,
and it shall be with you until your 
brother seek after it, and you shall 
restore it to him again. 

2. And if the soul be far removed from a state of true 
charity, or in a state of ignorance as to what true 
charity is, you shall remain in the desire to bring 
back all the affections into heavenly order, and that
desire shall remain in the mind till the nature of 
true charity is perceived, and then you shall bring 
all your affections into conformity with it.

3.

In like manner shall you do with his 
ass; and so shall you do with his 
clothing; and with all lost thing of 
your brother's, which he has lost, and

3. And you shall do the same with natural truth (or 
science and the love of it); or any external truths; 
or any other principle in the soul which has 
wandered from true charity, and you perceive it in 

129

 
you have found, shall you do 
likewise: you may not hide yourself. 

4. You shall not see your brother's ass 
or his ox fall down by the way, and 
hide yourself from them: you shall 
surely help him to lift them up again.

4.

the conscience and interior will, the perception 
must not be neglected; but everything done to 
bring back all the faculties into heavenly order.

If You shall not perceive that the truths or love of 
good in the natural mind, which is subordinate to 
spiritual principles, are unable to persevere in the 
path of duty, and neglect the perception, and gloss 
it over in the mind; but with all your powers you 
shall endeavour to help them, and lift them up to 
receive life from the spiritual principle.

5. The woman shall not wear that 
which pertains to a man, neither 
shall a man put on a woman's 
garment: for all that do so are 
abomination to the LORD your God.

5. The things of the affectional nature or proprium 
that naturally belongs to man must be kept most 
distinct from those of rational wisdom, nor is it 
according to order for the intellect and 
understanding to adopt truths because they are 
favoured by the natural proprium: for by this 
means the Divine Love and Wisdom are averted 
from the soul. [Note.—It is by the complete 
separation between the will and intellect that man 
is capable of regeneration; for by this the 
understanding can be elevated into a higher state 
than that to which the man belongs, but to which 
he can afterwards attain if he follows the light thus
given. (See AC 875, 927, 1023, 1044, etc.)]

6.

If a bird's nest chance to be before 
you in the way in any tree, or on the 
ground, whether they be young ones,
or eggs, and the dam sitting upon the
young, or upon the eggs, you shall 
not take the dam with the young: 

6.

If you shall find in the path of regeneration new 
developments of rational truths either derived from
some knowledges or perception which you have, 
or in the natural mind receptive of the truths of the 
Church, either completely developed truths or the 
germs of them, and the state of the rational 
faculties from which these truths or germs of truth 
are developed is also perceived, you shall not 
ascribe to yourself this state of the rational 
faculties and the truths developed from it:

7. But you shall in any wise let the dam
go, and take the young to you; that it 
may be well with you, and that you 
may prolong your days. 

7. You shall be careful to acknowledge that the origin
of them is not from yourself, and then the truths 
may be adjoined to the life and made use of; that it
may be well with your soul, and that your states in 
the heavenly life may be full and complete. [Note.
—Birds denote thoughts, ideas, reasonings (A. C. 
Index). They are insinuated into the faculties of the
soul from the world of spirits. Good thoughts are 
from heaven; man should make use of and 
appropriate them, but acknowledge they are not

8. When you buildest a new house, 

then you shall make a battlement for 
your roof, that you bring not blood 
upon your house, if any man fall 
from there. 

from himself.]

8. When you are gifted with a new regenerate will for
good, then you shall make a guard round about the
interior states you shall then possess, in which love
to the Lord is the governing principle, that you 
bring not the guilt of rejecting the Divine influence
within you by allowing any principle in the mind 
to relapse into inferior states and act from inferior 
motives. (See AC 10184, 9274; Matt 24:17)

9. You shall not sow your vineyard 

9. You shall not commingle with the holy truths of 

with diverse seeds: lest the fruit of 
your seed which you have sown, and
the fruit of your vineyard, be defiled.

10. You shall not plow with an ox and an

ass together. 

11. You shall not wear a garment of 

diverse sorts, as of woollen and linen
together. 

12. You shall make you fringes upon the 

four quarters of your clothing, with 
which you cover yourself. 

the Church which you have received and accepted,
the ideas derived from different and diverse 
religions; lest what is derived from these ideas 
become mingled with the good derived from the 
holy truths of the Church so that they cannot be 
separated, and thus both become denied (Matt 
9:16, 17).

10. You can not work out your salvation in the natural 
mind from good and from truth at the same time as
primary agents (that is to say, either the mind is in 
the love of good from which it selects truths which
agree with that good; or else the mind is in the 
love of truths, and by them forms an idea of what 
is good; and it cannot be in both states at the same 
time).

11. The soul must not be clothed with truths from 
diverse origins at the same time; thus not from 
those derived from the love of good, which is 
celestial; and those derived from the love of truth, 
which is spiritual (AC 9470). 
[Note (verses 10, 11).—These verses also signify 
that those who are in the love of good ought not to 
regard good and truth as separate things; in fact, to
them truth is only truth so far as it is good, in its 
origin, in the end regarded, and in its effects. (See 
AC 5895.)]

12. Thus the love of good and the truths developed by 
it, and the love of truth and the affections acquired 
by it, must be arranged with order in the natural 
mind and due discrimination made between them.

13. If any man take a wife, and go in to 

her, and hate her, 

13. If the understanding, after having been conjoined 
to an affection, come to be at disagreement with it,

131

14. And give occasions of speech 

against her, and bring up an evil 
name upon her, and say, I took this 
woman, and when I came to her, I 
found her not a maid: 

15. Then shall the father of the damsel, 
and her mother, take and bring forth 
the tokens of the damsel's virginity 
to the elders of the city in the gate: 

14. And suggest to the mind that it is tainted with false
principles and altogether of evil quality, and that it 
ought not to have been conjoined to it, as it is an 
affection of evil instead of what is good;
[Note (verses 13, 14).—Generally an affection is 
evil which regards the love of self or of the world 
as of primary importance; and it is good if it 
regard the love of the Lord and the good of others 
as of primary importance.]

15. Then shall careful inquiry be made by the cardinal 

introductory truths of the Church into the 
principles of good and truth from which the 
affection originated; these shall show whether it 
was joined to evil or no: [Note. —The elders 
which sit at the gate seem to signify here the 
doctrines which discriminate between the things 
which enter into the mind by examination into the 
motives from which they spring.]

16. And the damsel's father shall say to 
the elders, I gave my daughter to this
man to wife, and he hates her; 

16. If it shall be seen from these that the origin of that 
affection was good, and that the understanding 
perversely rejects it; 

17. And, lo, he has given occasions of 
speech against her, saying, I found 
not your daughter a maid; and yet 
these are the tokens of my daughter's
virginity. And they shall spread the 
cloth before the elders of the city. 

17. And desires to make it appear that the affection 
was impure; and yet it was patent before the 
primary truths of doctrine that the affection was a 
good and holy one, undefiled with the loves of self
and of the world;

18. And the elders of that city shall take 

that man and chastise him; 

18. Then shall the understanding be corrected and 
purified by the primary truths of doctrine;

19. And they shall amerce him in an 

19. And the apparent truths (now proved to be 

hundred shekels of silver, and give 
them to the father of the damsel, 
because he has brought up an evil 
name upon a virgin of Israel: and she
shall be his wife; he may not put her 
away all his days. 

falsities, which were against the good affection), 
must be taken from it, and those acceded to which 
are in conformity with the principles of good and 
truth from which the affection originated, because 
the understanding had suggested to the mind that a
holy spiritual affection was evil; and the 
understanding must become conjoined to that 
affection, and may not remove from it through all 
the states of the regenerate life.

20. But if this thing be true, and the 

20. But if the thoughts of the understanding are found 

tokens of virginity be not found for 
the damsel: 

to be correct, and the affection to be defiled with 
the loves of self and of the world;

132

21. Then they shall bring out the damsel 
to the door of her father's house, and 
the men of her city shall stone her 
with stones that she die: because she 
has worked folly in Israel, to play the
whore in her father's house: so shall 
you put evil away from among you. 

21. Then shall the mind be brought to that state in 
which the affection first left its derivative 
principles before it was accepted by the 
understanding, and there the affection shall be 
destroyed by the truths of doctrine; because it has 
led astray the spiritual mind from wisdom by 
introducing the evil loves of self and of the world 
into the soul so as to contaminate the internal will: 
thus sin and hell will be removed from the soul. 
[Example explanatory of verses 13-21.—These 
verses may be understood by applying them to any
virtue and its contrary vice; thus, take economy 
and meanness. Supposing there is in the character 
a strong tendency to economize which the 
understanding is inclined to condemn, and 
suggests that it springs from the love of the world, 
and is avaricious, and that it ought not to have 
such a tendency as it is a worldly affection; then 
careful inquiry must be made by the light of the 
heart-searching doctrines of the New Church into 
the motives from which the tendency originated, 
which shall be the proof as to whether it is evil or 
no. If these shall prove that the tendency was not 
joined to the love of the world, but was simply 
prudence and frugality, which was irksome to the 
natural mind, and hence its disagreement; then the 
natural mind must be purified, and reject its 
calumnies, and study to cultivate more closely the 
frugal tendency. But if it appears that the tendency 
arose from a selfish and worldly love, it must be 
destroyed and rooted out of the mind by the truths 
of doctrine, because it would lead astray the soul 
from heaven.]

22. If a man be found lying with a 

22. If what had been considered as spiritual truth in 

woman married to an husband, then 
they shall both of them die, both the 
man that lay with the woman, and 
the woman: so shall you put away 
evil from Israel. 

23. If a damsel that is a virgin be 

betrothed to an husband, and a man 
find her in the city, and lie with her; 

the mind is found perverting the affections of the 
soul, which had been fixed on good, to what is 
evil, then both must be destroyed, both the false 
doctrine which perverted the affections, and the 
love of evil engendered thereby in the mind; so 
shall you put away evil from the regenerating soul.

23. If the affection of truth in the soul has seen and 
acknowledged the holy truths of the Church and 
yet becomes conjoined to and loves falsity, even in
states in which the doctrines of the Church are 
present in the mind to show the truth;

133

24. Then you shall bring them both out 
to the gate of that city, and you shall 
stone them with stones that they die; 
the damsel, because she cried not, 
being in the city; and the man, 
because he has humbled his 
neighbour's wife: so you shall put 
away evil from among you. 

24. Then the mind must be brought back into that state
in which the doctrines of the Church were first 
received, and the falsity with its perverted 
affection must be destroyed with truths from the 
Word; the affection because it did not take refuge 
in the doctrines which had been acknowledged, 
and the falsity because it had drawn away the 
affections of the mind from its love of the holy 
truth of the Church; and thus shall evil be put 
away from the soul.

25. But if a man find a betrothed damsel 
in the field, and the man force her, 
and lie with her: then the man only 
that lay with her shall die. 

25. But if the mind is in an external state, and becomes
conjoined to falsity (as it were against its will, 
there being no truth at hand to save); then that 
falsity will perish:

26. But to the damsel you shall do 

26. But the will principle has not committed mortal 

nothing; there is in the damsel no sin
worthy of death: for as when a man 
rises against his neighbour, and 
slayeth him, even so is this matter: 

27. For he found her in the field, and the 
betrothed damsel cried, and there 
was none to save her. 

28. If a man find a damsel that is a 

virgin, which is not betrothed, and 
lay hold on her, and lie with her, and 
they be found; 

sin; for as when false principles arise and destroy 
the good of the soul (through ignorance) without 
the consent of the will, even so is this matter:

27. For the soul was in an external condition when it 
was conjoined to the false, and it sought the truth 
but was not able to find it. 
[Note (verses 23, 24).—Thus if falsities are 
received in the soul by the will, or because they 
are loved; against the light which is present in the 
mind, from truths which have been accepted and 
believed; grievous evil is committed, and the soul 
can only be brought back by inversion of the will; 
but if (verses 25-27) the mind fall into falsities 
through ignorance and inability to see what is true,
and not from the love of them; the evil is light and 
easily removed. (See also AE 863; John 9:41.)]

28. If an affection of the soul which is ignorant of true 
doctrines of the Church, though in the sincere love
of the truth, should become conjoined to apparent 
but not real truth, and from inferior motives 
(which is an illegitimate conjunction), and this be 
perceived;

29. Then the man that lay with her shall 
give to the damsel's father fifty 
shekels of silver, and she shall be his
wife; because he has humbled her, he
may not put her away all his days. 

29. The false shall be removed as far as possible, and 

be replaced by genuine truth in accordance with 
the good from which the affection for truth was 
derived; and this truth so purified shall be 
legitimately conjoined to the affection of truth in 

134

the soul, because it has brought about the 
conjunction of good and truth in the soul, which is 
the primary of the Church and the principle by 
which regeneration is effected, therefore they 
cannot be separated in the succeeding states of the 
regenerate life. 
[Note.— Regeneration is effected by carrying out 
in the life the truths which the soul has accepted 
and believed after having arrived at years of 
maturity, and this forms the marriage of good and 
truth in the soul; and though the truths are 
imperfect, or were at first adopted from inferior 
motives, such as the fear of punishment, or the 
hope of advantage either in this world or the next, 
still they are the means by which regeneration is 
effected, and if sincerely believed in, they must be 
followed out throughout the whole regenerate life, 
and what is false and imperfect will be as far as 
possible removed from them.]

30. A man shall not take his father's 

30. Beware lest you profane the love of good, or 

wife, nor discover his father's skirt. 

violate the sacred truths whereby you were born 
again. [Note.— "The profanation of good is the 
affection of evils conjoined to truths, and the 
profanation of truths is the conjunction of truths 
with falses" (AC 10652). To believe the truth and 
afterwards to deny it; or to believe and know what 
is right and yet to do what is evil; or to act 
apparently sincerely and well for the sake of an 
evil end, is profanation.]

Deuteronomy Chapter 23

Verse 1. Those who reject faith and charity cannot enter into heaven.
Verse 2. Nor those whose good conduct is not from religion but from a spurious origin.
Verses 3-6. Nor those principles which falsify truths and adulterate goods, for they do not supply the 
soul with true sustenance, and also endeavour to oppose what is truly spiritual.
Verses 7, 8. But external religion agreeing with internal (or with a life of usefulness for a good end) is 
not to be shunned.
Verse 9. In temptations it is especially essential to avoid everything known to be evil.
Verses 10-14. The soul is remitted into external states to be purified from evils, otherwise the influences
from heaven would be rejected from the soul.
Verses 15, 16. The rational faculty is not to be enslaved by spiritual truths.
Verses 17, 18. No love of perverting truth, or falsity which denies the Lord and the necessity of a good 
life, shall be permitted to exist in the regenerate soul; nor are knowledges acquired for evil ends or for 
vanity acceptable to heaven.
Verses 19, 20. The spiritual must not do good for the sake of reward as an end.
Verses 21-23. Things resolved upon as being right, must be acted upon.
Verses 24, 25. Good and truth derived from others may be adjoined to the soul, but must not be mixed 
with the good developed therein by the Lord in regeneration. 

1. He that is wounded in the stones, or 
has his privy member cut off, shall 
not enter into the congregation of the
LORD. 

2. A bastard shall not enter into the 

congregation of the LORD; even to 
his tenth generation shall he not 
enter into the congregation of the 
LORD. 

1. THOSE who have rejected what relates to faith and 

charity and the conjunction of them, so that they 
cannot bring forth the fruits of good living from 
heaven into the life, cannot enter into the kingdom 
of heaven (AC 2468). 

2. He whose good conduct is not the offspring of 
genuine religion, but is spurious (such as what 
results from a regard to reputation or some worldly
motive), shall not enter into heaven till he has 
acquired remains (i.e. genuine good from the 
Lord).
[Note.—Remains signify all the good states, 
aspirations, and thoughts with which man is gifted 
during the whole of the regenerate life, and which 
are stored up in the interiors of his soul for use, 
and become the medium by which he is saved. 
(See AC Index.)]

136

 
3. An Ammonite or Moabite shall not 

enter into the congregation of the 
LORD; even to their tenth 
generation shall they not enter into 
the congregation of the LORD for 
ever: 

4. Because they met you not with bread
and with water in the way, when you
came forth out of Egypt; and 
because they hired against you 
Balaam the son of Beor of Pethor of 
Mesopotamia, to curse you. 

5. Nevertheless the LORD your God 
would not hearken to Balaam; but 
the LORD your God turned the curse
into a blessing to you, because the 
LORD your God loved you. 

3. Those who have falsified truth and adulterated 
good shall not enter into heaven, because they 
have no remains of genuine good and truth.
[Note.—Ammon and Moab are thus described in 
the AC 2468: "They in general denote those who 
are principled in external worship, which appears 
in some respect holy, but not in internal worship,* 
and who eagerly embrace as good and true 
whatever relates to external worship, but reject and
despise what relates to internal worship: such 
worship and such a religion takes especial root in 
those who are principled in natural good, but who 
despise others in comparison with themselves." In 
the same article, near the end, these verses in 
Deuteronomy are briefly described, and it is shown
how if all the good in the soul becomes adulterated
with evil, and all the truth mixed with falsity, all 
interior religion is despised and rejected; thus all 
the good stored up by the Lord in the soul is 
destroyed.]

4. Because (such principles) do not supply true 

spiritual nourishment of good and truth when the 
soul leaves natural things for the regenerate life; 
and because they endeavour to pervert knowledges
of truth which they suppose favour their doctrines, 
so as to oppose and infest those things in the soul 
which are truly regenerating, and to say that they 
are not from heaven. 
* Internal worship is to carry put the Divine Will, 
as revealed in the Word and the Divine Humanity 
(who is the Word brought forth to view in a Divine
Person, John 1:1, 14, 18), by a life of the highest 
usefulness that can be attained, see AC 7884. 

5. Nevertheless the Divine Love and Wisdom are not 
diverted from the soul by these efforts of the 
perverted knowledges of good and truth; and 
instead of opposing they assist the regenerate life, 
and bring the influx of Love and Wisdom from 
heaven closer to it; for the Lord especially guards 
and protects the spiritual things received from 
Himself with those who are regenerating.

6. You shall not seek their peace nor 

6. This external religion without internal does not 

their prosperity all your days for 
ever. 

bring true peace or spiritual welfare in any state of 
the regenerate life.

137

7. You shall not abhor an Edomite; for 
he is your brother: you shall not 
abhor an Egyptian; because you 
were a stranger in his land. 

7. But external religion agreeing with internal is not 
to be shunned; for it is the brother of internal 
religion: nor are its scientifics (or knowledges in 
the memory) to be shunned; for before 
regeneration the mind dwells amongst scientifics 
(and is kept there) in an external state, to be 
instructed till the time when truths can be 
implanted in the life.

8. The children that are begotten of 

them shall enter into the 
congregation of the LORD in their 
third generation. 

8. The truths that proceed from this external religion 
and its scientifics shall be incorporated into the 
spiritual life when fully agreeing with internal 
truth.

9. When the host goes forth against 

your enemies, then keep you from 
every wicked thing. 

10. If there be among you any man, that 
is not clean by reason of uncleanness
that chanceth him by night, then 
shall he go abroad out of the camp, 
he shall not come within the camp: 

9. When the truths and goods of the soul go forth to 
contend against falses and evils in the life, then be 
especially careful to avoid evil in thought, word, 
and deed.

10. If any principle in the soul has become defiled 

with sin from the impure loves of self and of the 
world while in an obscure state; the soul is 
permitted by the Lord to lapse into a worldly and 
external state for a time, and feel the loss of 
happiness which comes from the removal of 
association with good spirits:

11. But it shall be, when evening comes 
on, he shall wash himself with water:
and when the sun is down, he shall 
come into the camp again. 

11. And at the close of that state, it is purified by 

truths; and when the ardour of its selfish affections
becomes less vehement, it is admitted into a 
heavenly state again.

12. You shall have a place also without 
the camp, whither you shall go forth 
abroad: 

13. And you shall have a paddle upon 
your weapon; and it shall be, when 
you will ease yourself abroad, you 
shall dig therewith, and shall turn 
back and cover that which comes 
from you: 

12. In the regenerate life there will be states when the 

soul is not in heavenly affections;

13. And by them the evil thoughts and affections of 

the heart will be separated and buried by truth, and
left in the natural life: 

138

14. For the LORD your God walks in 
the midst of your camp, to deliver 
you, and to give up your enemies 
before you; therefore shall your 
camp be holy: that he see no unclean
thing in you, and turn away from 
you. 

15. You shall not deliver to his master 
the servant which is escaped from 
his master to you: 

16. He shall dwell with you, even among
you, in that place which he shall 
choose in one of your gates, where it
liketh him best: you shall not 
oppress him. 

17. There shall be no whore of the 

daughters of Israel, nor a sodomite 
of the sons of Israel. 

14. For the Love and Wisdom proceeding from the 
Divine Humanity walk through and survey the 
affections and thoughts of the soul to save what is 
good, and to deliver up to the evil whatever would 
hurt or destroy the soul; therefore shall your 
affections and thoughts be kept pure and holy; for 
if the impure things proceeding from the loves of 
self and of the world are not removed from the 
soul, the Lord cannot dwell there, and all His holy 
influences would be rejected therefrom.

15. You shall not deliver up again to the service of 
falsity and evil, the powers of the rational 
understanding when they have ceased to serve 
falsities, and have acceded to the truths of the 
Church:

16. They shall be with the spiritual things of the soul, 
and be incorporated with them amongst the 
external truths, which are serviceable to introduce 
good into the mind, where they shall be in 
freedom, and be allowed free play; and shall not be
oppressed by dogmatism.

17. No love of falsifying and perverting truths shall be
permitted to exist amongst the affections for truth 
in the soul; nor shall any falses proceeding from 
self-love, which deny the Humanity of the Lord 
and the life of charity proceeding from Him, be 
permitted to exist amongst the truths of the Church
(AC 2350-2354).

18. You shall not bring the hire of a 

18. The knowledges acquired by the perversion or 

whore, or the price of a dog, into the 
house of the LORD your God for 
any vow: for even both these are 
abomination to the LORD your God.

19. You shall not lend upon usury to 

your brother; usury of money, usury 
of victuals, usury of any thing that is
lent upon usury: 

falsification of spiritual truth, or by the mere 
cupidity of knowledges derived from vanity of 
learning, shall not be presented before the Divine 
Humanity, which is the temple of the Divine Love 
and Wisdom, as acceptable worship or desires after
genuine good; for both these do but tend to utterly 
avert from the soul the Love and Wisdom which 
flow from Him.

19. Amongst those who are spiritual, the works of 
charity must not be performed for the sake of 
reward as an end—whether it be the impartation of
knowledges, or of the good derived from them, or 
of anything in which there is any expectation of 
reward either in this world or the next:

139

20. Unto a stranger you may lend upon 
usury; but to your brother you shall 
not lend upon usury: that the LORD 
your God may bless you in all that 
you set your hand to in the land 
whither you go to possess it. 

21. When you shall vow a vow to the 

LORD your God, you shall not slack
to pay it: for the LORD your God 
will surely require it of you; and it 
would be sin in you. 

20. Amongst those who are external, it is permitted to 

do good for the sake of reward; but not amongst 
those who are internal or spiritual: for it is by 
doing good without expectation of reward that the 
Divine Love and Wisdom become conjoined to the
soul in all its efforts after holiness, which will then
be attained in those heavenly states to which the 
soul is being led.

21. When a line of conduct or thought about religious 
matters has been confirmed in the mind as being in
accordance with the Divine Love and Wisdom, and
becomes a deliberate intention (as the right thing 
to do); it is necessary to act upon it without delay: 
it becomes a matter of conscience and duty, and it 
would be sin to neglect it.

22. But if you shall forbear to vow, it 

22. But if it has not been confirmed into deliberate 

shall be no sin in you. 

23. That which is gone out of your lips 
you shall keep and perform; even a 
freewill offering, according as you 
have vowed to the LORD your God, 
which you have promised with your 
mouth.

neighbour's vineyard, then you may 
eat grapes your fill at your own 
pleasure; but you shall not put any in
your vessel. 

intention, that is, if the mind is not fully resolved 
that it is right, it is not binding.

23. Whatever has been fully intended must be 

performed with a willing mind according to the 
full import of what has been deliberately resolved 
on as the right thing to do, and as being in 
accordance with the Divine will.

24. "Every one associating with others who are of a 
different doctrine and religion may learn and 
accept their goods of charity; but not imbibe them 
or conjoin them to his own truths. (A vineyard, as 
it denotes the Church, denotes where there is 
doctrine or religion; grapes are the goods of 
charity; a vessel is the truth of the Church.)" (AC 
5117.)

25. When you comest into the standing 
corn of your neighbour, then you 
may pluck the ears with your hand; 
but you shall not move a sickle to 
your neighbour's standing corn. 

25. So also when you comest amongst the natural 
goods that have been developed from others of 
different religious creed, it is allowable to make 
use of the good scientifics which gave birth to 
those goods as external truths under the power of 
spiritual truth; but it is not allowable to imbibe 
them and make them your own, as the goods with 
which the Lord has endowed your own soul by the 
separation of good and evil within you in 
regeneration. 
Note.—Standing corn denotes the truth of good 
and faith in conception. (See also AC 5212.)]

Deuteronomy Chapter 24

Verses 1-4. When the things loved do not accord with the things believed to be right in the soul, it is in 
a state analogous to divorce, and the things so loved by the external man and believed to be wrong 
must not be conjoined to the interior will.
Verse 5. When the understanding of truths is conjoined to its corresponding affection, a state of peace 
ensues.
Verse 6. No one is to be deprived of the truths of doctrine they live by.
Verse 7. Anything that perverts spiritual goods and truths to worldly uses is to be destroyed.
Verses 8, 9. Caution against the danger of profanation.
Verses 10-13. In imparting truths the endeavour should be made to enable others to see from 
themselves, and not to force upon them one's own view.
Verses 14, 15. Those who do good from inferior motives are not to be deprived of them.
Verse 16. Evil does not condemn till it is made a man's own by consent of the will and of the 
understanding.
Verses 17, 18. External things are not to be despised, for the whole soul was in externals till redeemed 
thence by the Lord.
Verses 19-22. The soul must not return from states of good to the states of truth by which the former 
were gained, and which are for those still striving to reach them; a state of truth is one of bondage 
compared to a state of good. 

1. When a man has taken a wife, and 

1. WHEN the interior understanding of truth or 

married her, and it come to pass that 
she find no favour in his eyes, 
because he has found some 
uncleanness in her: then let him

of his house. 

perception of good in the soul has through its 
obscurity become conjoined to some discordant 
affection of performing uses in the life from the 
will-principle so that they have made a one; and it 
comes to pass that the understanding loses all 
delight in this affection because some difference of
inclination (or supposed taint of evil in the latter) 
is discovered—that is to say, the things loved by 
the will do not agree with the highest perceptions 
of the understanding—it is provided that there 
should be a complete and absolute separation 
between the things believed in and thought to be 
right by the understanding and the things loved by 
the will; and the latter are separated from the 
interior mind, and have complete freedom from its 
perceptions:

2. And when she is departed out of his 
house, she may go and be another 
man's wife. 

2. And when they are separated from the interior 
mind, which is under the government of the 
perception of good, or interior understanding of 
truth, they can become conjoined to other 
principles in the soul which will operate with them

142

 
3. And if the latter husband hate her,

done from other motives than because they accord 
with the highest perceptions of right.

and gives it in her hand, and sends 
her out of his house; or if the latter 
husband die, which took her to be his
wife; 

4. Her former husband, which sent her 

4.

away, may not take her again to be 
his wife, after that she is defiled; for 
that is abomination before the 
LORD: and you shall not cause the 
land to sin, which the LORD your 
God gives you for an inheritance. 

affection, and become completely removed from 
it, and leave it free, or if they perish out of the 
mind after having been conjoined to that affection 
with delight—that is, if uses are performed simply 
from necessity or from some selfish motive, and 
not with the co-operation of any of the truths or 
perceptions of duty in the soul—

It is not lawful for the interior understanding of 
truth, or perception of right and wrong which had 
removed that affection from it, again to take it into
the interior soul after that it has been clearly 
perceived to be discordant, and to be defiled with 
evil motives; for this would be to act against the 
conscience, and mix good and evil in the soul, and 
so cause all the influx from the Lord to be averted 
from the soul; and would bring evil upon all the 
states with which the Divine Love and Wisdom 
desire to gift the soul, as its own.
[Note.—For this would be to endeavour to serve 
both God and Mammon at the same time. Either 
the good uses which a man performs act with and 
are performed from his religious convictions (in 
which case the soul is married), or they are 
divorced—that is, outside the real character 
altogether: that this last is an imperfect state, and 
called hardness of heart, is evident from Matt 
19:3-12, which is explained in detail in AE 710. It 
is there shown that in the marriages in the heavens,
the understanding of truth or perception of good 
must be united with the affection which 
corresponds with it, nor can it be united with any 
other (see also Mark 12:25). And that a man 
should leave that evil and falsity which he has 
hereditarily from education or religion and become
conjoined to the affection which corresponds to his
perception, and these two will then act as a one 
(Matt 19:5, 6). And that this love of doing uses in 
accord with the perceptions of duty must never be 
put away unless it is seen to proceed from evil 
motives, and thus become an affection of evil and 
falsity (verse 9). In verse 12 are described those 

143

who are unwilling to be conjoined to the affection 
of evil, whereby the understanding of good and 
truth would be perverted or dissipated; and by no 
means contains any disapproval of natural 
marriage corresponding to heavenly marriage—
that is to say, where the feminine affection of good
corresponds exactly with the masculine perception 
of good. But see the detailed explanation at AE 
710]

5. When a man has taken a new wife, 

5. When any perception of good or truth becomes 

he shall not go out to war, neither 
shall he be charged with any 
business: but he shall be free at 
home one year, and shall cheer up 
his wife which he has taken. 

conjoined to its corresponding affection of doing 
good in any state of the soul, temptations cease, 
and there is no more labour; and the soul enjoys a 
period of heavenly peace in that state in which the 
newly-acquired love of good uses finds its ability 
to act from the perception of good to which it is 
joined.

6. No man shall take the nether or the 
upper millstone to pledge: for he 
takes a man's life to pledge. 

6. No one is to be deprived of the truths of doctrines 
they live by; for this is to deprive them of the 
means of regeneration. (See AC 9213.)

7.

If a man be found stealing any of his 
brethren of the children of Israel, and
makes merchandise of him, or sells 
him; then that thief shall die; and 
you shall put evil away from among 
you. 

8. Take heed in the plague of leprosy, 
that you observe diligently, and do 
according to all that the priests the 
Levites shall teach you: as I 
commanded them, so you shall 
observe to do. 

7.

If any principle or faculty of the soul alienates 
spiritual truths by making them subservient to 
worldly ends; this principle must be destroyed as a
thief of the real goods of the soul; and thus will 
evil be removed from the regenerate life.

8. Take heed and beware of the danger of profanation
or of sinning against knowledge, and watch 
diligently against it, and do everything that good 
from the Lord and the truths that minister thereto 
shall teach you; as directed by perception or 
conscience through the Word to the soul, to avoid 
it. [Note.—The directions about cleansing from 
leprosy are given in Lev. xiii., xiv., and refer in 
general to discriminations between profanation 
from ignorance, and profanation after faith and 
acknowledgement; and to the cleansing of the soul
that is necessary to remove it; that it must be 
apparently from one's selfhood, though in reality 
from the Lord; that it must be full and complete, 
till horror is excited by evil, and till evils are 
driven without the soul by serious repentance, and 
till genuine truths are implanted. To simulate a 
good life in externals, and to will evil internally, is 

144

9. Remember what the LORD your 

God did to Miriam by the way, after 
that you were come forth out of 
Egypt. 

10. When you do lend your brother any 
thing, you shall not go into his house
to fetch his pledge. 

profanation. (See AE 1045-1064.)

9. Remember how it has happened that even the good
of faith itself has become profaned during the 
progress of regeneration in the soul by rejecting 
the influx of the Divine Love and Wisdom. (The 
good of faith is the affection of doing good 
acquired by truths; it is profaned when applied to 
self-aggrandizement, as in Miriam's case.)

10. (10-13) "That the creditor should stand without, 

and the pledge should be brought forth to him, 
signifies how reply is to be made to truths 
communicated, for by lending is signified the 
communication of truth, and by taking a pledge the
reply. That these things are signified no one can 
know but from such things as are doing in the 
other life, thus unless he knows what it is to enter 
into the house, and what it is to stand abroad, and 
thus what it is to bring forth abroad. They in the 
other life, who enter into the house of another, and 
discourse together in one chamber, so 
communicate their thoughts with all who are there 
that they know no other than that they themselves 
think those things from themselves; but if they 
stand abroad, in this case indeed the thoughts are 
perceived, but as from another, and not from 
themselves. This happens every day in the other 
life; wherefore they who are of one opinion, or of 
one sentiment, appear together in one house, and 
especially if in one chamber of the house; and 
when the same dissent, then they are parted to 
pieces from the eyes of those who dissent. Such 
appearances are continually and everywhere 
presented in the other life. The reason is, because 
parity of thoughts conjoins and causes presence, 
for thought is internal sight, and distances of 
places in the other life are not as in the world. 
Hence it is evident what is meant by not entering 
into the house, but standing abroad and taking a 
pledge, namely, that is not to bind or inflame 
another to confirm his own truths, but to hear and 
apprehend the answers, such as they are, in 
himself; for he who binds and inflames another to 
confirm his own truths, causes the other not to 
speak or think from himself, but from him; and 
when any one thinks or speaks from another, the 

145

truths belonging to him are disturbed, and yet he is
not amended; unless in the case of such a one as is 
yet ignorant of those truths. From these 
considerations it is further manifest that in all the 
things of the Word there are things which 
correspond to such as are in the spiritual world." 
(AC 9213.)

11. You shall stand abroad, and the man 
to whom you do lend shall bring out 
the pledge abroad to you. 

11.

12. And if the man be poor, you shall not

sleep with his pledge: 

13. In any case you shall deliver him the 
pledge again when the sun goes 
down, that he may sleep in his own 
clothing, and bless you: and it shall 
be righteousness to you before the 
LORD your God. 

14. You shall not oppress an hired 
servant that is poor and needy, 
whether he be of your brethren, or of
your strangers that are in your land 
within your gates: 

15. At his day you shall give him his 

hire, neither shall the sun go down 
upon it; for he is poor, and sets his 
heart upon it: lest he cry against you 
to the LORD, and it be sin to you. 

12. (12, 13) These words also signify that those who 
are in external truths or rituals of worship are not 
to be deprived of them; and if they have been 
removed, they should be restored before they enter
into their obscure state caused by external loves, 
for they are their only means of attaining spiritual 
life in that state.

13. Those (principles or persons) who do good for the 

sake of reward are not to be oppressed (or 
discouraged) in their belief, if they acknowledge 
the good to be done by the Lord's help, and not by 
themselves alone; whether they be in internal 
truths, or those who desire to be instructed in the 
external and introductory truths of the Church.

14. In this state the expectation of reward is not to be 
taken from them, otherwise, when they come to an
obscure state caused by external loves and 
anxieties, their love of good and truth might 
perish; for they are in an external state, and this is 
their only motive to good; and if deprived of it, 
they might lose their faith and trust in the Lord, 
and fall into sin.

15. The desire to do good is not to be condemned 
because what is evil or mistaken may proceed 
from it; nor are truths themselves to be condemned
(per se) though they may be professed and 
cherished from an imperfect motive: guilt is 
imputed to man when it proceeds from the will and
understanding together, and is made his own by 
actual commission.

16. The fathers shall not be put to death 
for the children, neither shall the 

16. Be careful not to weaken external things which 

desire to be brought into conformity with spiritual;

146

children be put to death for the 
fathers: every man shall be put to 
death for his own sin. 

17. You shall not pervert the judgement 
of the stranger, nor of the fatherless; 
nor take a widow's clothing to 
pledge: 

18. But you shall remember that you 

were a bondman in Egypt, and the 
LORD your God redeemed you 
thence: therefore I command you to 
do this thing. 

19. When you cuttest down your harvest 
in your field, and have forgot a sheaf
in the field, you shall not go again to 
fetch it: it shall be for the stranger, 
for the fatherless, and for the widow:
that the LORD your God may bless 
you in all the work of your hands. 

20. When you beatest your olive tree, 
you shall not go over the boughs 
again: it shall be for the stranger, for 
the fatherless, and for the widow. 

or those which are consistent with truth but 
without spiritual good; or to take away by any 
manner whatever the external truths of those who 
are in good, but without genuine truths:

17. It must be ever present in the thought of the 

regenerate that spiritual truths in themselves are 
but scientific knowledges, subservient to worldly 
loves in the natural state of the mind, till the soul 
is brought out of an external (to a spiritual) state 
by the Divine Love and Wisdom; hence is the 
Divine law that external truths are not to be 
despised, for they all may conduce to good (as 
explained in the preceding verses).

18. When the soul is advancing from a state of truth to
a state of good, and has become less occupied 
about doctrines; the soul must not return to its 
former state for the sake of these doctrines: they 
are for those who are still learning the truth, or 
who are being led by truth to the life of good, or 
for those who are in truth and not yet in good; that 
you may be gifted by the Divine Love and 
Wisdom with a celestial proprium, or a new will 
for good as if from yourself.

19. Or when you are advancing to a state of love to the
Lord you shall not return to the states by which 
your perception of this state was formed; they are 
for those who are still learning, or are being led 
towards them, or desire them, but have not yet 
attained them.

20. Or when you are advancing to a state of spiritual 

love (and the goods of charity) you shall not return
to a state of spiritual truth with the idea of 
increasing such goods; that state is for those who 
are still learning, or are being led towards spiritual 
good, or desire but have not yet attained it.

21. When you gather the grapes of your 
vineyard, you shall not glean it 
afterward: it shall be for the stranger,
for the fatherless, and for the widow.

21. And remember that a state of truth is a state of 
bondage as compared with that of good, from 
which you have been brought by the Lord in 
regeneration; therefore is this command not to 
return to it. (Matt 24:16-18.)

Deuteronomy Chapter 25

Verses 1-3. The perception of right to be rigidly followed in choosing the right and rejecting the evil 
path, and erring faculties in the soul will be abased, but not more than is necessary for amendment.
Verse 4. External goods are themselves recruited by ministering to others which are more interior.
Verses 5-10. The good formerly done from external motives to be adopted and refined by spiritual 
motives, and that which exists only in thought, and persistently refuses to flow forth into act, to be 
rejected as useless.
Verses 11, 12. The inclinations of the proprium are not to be allowed to avert the decisions of the 
spiritual mind in deciding between good and evil, and truth and falsity.
Verses 13-16, The principles and rules of right and wrong must not be altered as worldly ends dictate, 
but what is believed to be right must be followed, or the heavenly life will be rejected.
Verses 17-19. The evil which those principles which compromise with evil bring upon the soul must be 
ever borne in mind, and as the soul obtains rest from its enemies such principles must be utterly 
destroyed. 

1.

If there be a controversy between 
men, and they come to judgement, 
that the judges may judge them; then
they shall justify the righteous, and 
condemn the wicked. 

1.

IF there be any doubt or dispute in the mind as to 
whether a principle be good or evil, or true or 
false, and the endeavour is made by the soul to 
ascertain the truth by such truths and perceptions 
which it has, and by interiorly inquiring of the 
Lord; be careful to receive the principle approved, 
and reject that condemned by the inward dictate 
given you.

2. And it shall be, if the wicked man be

worthy to be beaten, that the judge 
shall cause him to lie down, and to 
be beaten before his face, according 
to his fault, by a certain number. 

2. And if the thing thought about be determined to be
evil or false, it shall be abased in the interiors of 
the mind by the truths and perceptions of good 
which are there, and kept down and punished 
according to its malignity as much as is required.

3. Forty blows he may give him, and 

not exceed: lest, if he should exceed,
and beat him above these with many 
blows, then your brother should 
seem vile to you. 

3. The visitation of the evil and false shall be full and
complete, but shall not be carried beyond what is 
necessary, lest good and truth should also be 
destroyed. [Note.— From this passage we may 
learn that no punishment is permitted by the Lord 
except what is necessary to restrain evil and 
develop good.]

4. You shall not muzzle the ox when he

4.

treads out the corn. 

It is a law of order that when external good is 
engaged in preparing good for the internal man 
during regeneration, it also should become 
recruited with good itself. (In rendering a service 
to another, good also accrues to him who serves.)

148

 
5.

5.

If brethren dwell together, and one of
them die, and have no child, the wife
of the dead shall not marry without 
to a stranger: her husband's brother 
shall go in to her, and take her to him
to wife, and perform the duty of an 
husband's brother to her. 

If there are two kindred and associated goods 
(such as spiritual and natural good, which are 
brethren), and one of them perish without leaving 
spiritual offspring, the truths associated with the 
lost good must net be alienated from the soul; but 
be cherished by the kindred good which shall be 
conjoined with them, so as to develop fresh goods 
and truths in the soul therefrom. [Note.—Thus in 
regeneration those who have formerly acted from 
merely natural good come at length to see that 
natural good is not real good, and it perishes; but 
the good deeds and thoughts associated with it 
must by no means be omitted but be done in the 
future with more judgement from a superior and 
spiritual motive. (Natural good is that of good-
nature, as it is called, the natural disposition that 
one has to please others.)]

6. And it shall be, that the firstborn 

which she bears shall succeed in the 
name of his brother which is dead, 
that his name be not put out of Israel.

7. And if the man like not to take his 
brother's wife, then let his brother's 
wife go up to the gate to the elders, 
and say, My husband's brother 
refuseth to raise up to his brother a 
name in Israel, he will not perform 
the duty of my husband's brother. 

6. And it shall be that the good and truth that result 
from this union will derive their quality from the 
lost good, so that its peculiar characteristics will 
not be put out from the soul. (Thus natural good 
will remain in the soul purified and refined by 
influx from spiritual good.)

7. But if the kindred good be unwilling to be 

conjoined to the truth of the lost good—i.e. if 
spiritual good be unwilling to flow forth and 
manifest itself in the natural life— let natural truth 
appeal to the primary doctrines of the Church 
relating to the state of communication between the 
spiritual and natural mind, as to the fact that 
spiritual good refuses to perform deeds of natural 
charity, and to flow forth into the natural life.

8. Then the elders of his city shall call 
him, and speak to him: and if he 
stand to it, and say, I like not to take 
her; 

8. Then inquiry shall be made into this thing by the 
primary doctrines of good and truth; and if it 
appear that the spiritual good will not flow forth 
into the natural life;

9. Then shall his brother's wife come to
him in the presence of the elders, and
loose his shoe from off his foot, and 
spit in his face, and shall answer and 
say, So shall it be done to that man 
that will not build up his brother's 
house. 

9. Then shall this apparent good be rejected from the 
interiors by natural truth, under the guidance of the
wisdom of the Church, as something that has no 
connection with practical life; and thus all 
apparent good shall be spurned and rejected that 
will not flow forth into deeds of charity, and 
become conducive to mutual love in the outer life.

149

10. And his name shall be called in

shoe loosed. 

useless in the spiritual life, and an apparent good 
that has no connection with progress in 
regeneration. (It is a law of the spiritual life that all
good that exists merely in thought, and is not 
brought out into the life when occasion presents 
itself, is dissipated from the mind—that is, if the 
opportunity was fully perceived, and rejected from
aversion in the will.)

11. When men strive together one with 
another, and the wife of the one 
draws near for to deliver her husband
out of the hand of him that smites 
him, and puts forth her hand, and 
takes him by the secrets: 

11. When there is a division in the soul as to what is 
good or evil, or true or false, and the proprium or 
natural inclination, which is one with the evil of 
the soul, approaches to avert the decisions of the 
spiritual mind from condemning evil, withholding 
it by applications to the interior springs of 
hereditary evil which exist in the soul;

12. Then you shall cut off her hand, your

worldly ends dictate).

of what is true or false.

15. But you shall have a perfect and just 
weight, a perfect and just measure 
shall you have: that your days may 
be lengthened in the land which the 
LORD your God gives you. 

15. But you shall endeavour to have and to conform 

your life to a perfect and just rule of what is good 
or evil, and a perfect and just rule of what is true 
or false; that you may be led along the path of 
Divine Providence to those blessed states in 
heaven which the Divine Love and Wisdom seek 
to give you as your own.

150

16. For all that do such things, and all 
that do unrighteously, are an 
abomination to the LORD your God.

16. For all that have such diverse principles, and all 

that swerve in the least from what they believe to 
be the strict path of equity and righteousness, avert
themselves from the Divine Love and Wisdom, 
and prevent the good from flowing into them that 
they would otherwise have received. [Note.—To 
have right principles, but when temptation comes 
to think there is no harm in acting in a doubtful 
manner just this once, saying to oneself that the 
conduct will be more strict than ever afterwards; is
to have two weights, a great and a small, and two 
measures, a great and a small.]

17. Remember what Amalek did to you 
by the way, when you were come 
forth out of Egypt; 

17. Bear constantly in mind what false principles 

about evil (that it is allowable) have done to the 
soul in its spiritual progress, when it had already 
advanced from a natural state.

the spiritual life, and destroy those principles not 
fully confirmed in good, and those that are 
wavering, when weak and worn with temptation; 
and how they destroy the holy fear of committing 
evil, which should be ever present in the soul.

remembrance of Amalek from under 
heaven; you shall not forget it. 

Wisdom have given rest to the soul by reducing to 
obedience all the evils of the natural mind, when 
the soul begins to inherit the new life of good 
received as its own from the Divine Love and 
Wisdom, that false principles of this nature, which 
compromise with evil, must be utterly rooted out 
of the interiors of the mind; and their evil qualities 
constantly borne in mind. [Note.—Amalek 
signifies a people that licks up and takes away all. 
Temptations are an opportunity given by the Lord 
to obtain some virtue by resisting the contrary 
vice. If the opportunity is missed, the good 
intended for the soul is lost. The Lord cannot gift 
the soul with good except it will as of itself resist 
evil and do good when opportunity comes.]

Deuteronomy Chapter 26

Verges 1-11. When the soul has received a new will capable of acting out with joy the requirements of 
Divine order; it shall ascribe with thankfulness all things to the Lord, and shall acknowledge the 
wisdom of the dealings of Providence.
Verses 12-15. And when all the good in the soul is ascribed to the Lord, and the perception of right 
given from Him implicitly followed, the soul may ask for and receive the new life promised in the Word 
to those who follow tlie Divine leadings.
Verses 16-19. In this state the soul is betrothed to heaven by the keeping of the Divine commands. 

1. And it shall be, when you are come 
in to the land which the LORD your 
God gives you for an inheritance, 
and possessest it, and dwell therein; 

2. That you shall take of the first of all 
the fruit of the earth, which you shall
bring of your land that the LORD 
your God gives you, and shall put it 
in a basket, and shall go to the place 
which the LORD your God shall 
choose to place his name there. 

3. And you shall go to the priest that 
shall be in those days, and say to 
him, I profess this day to the LORD 
your God, that I am come to the 
country which the LORD swore to 
our fathers for to give us. 

1. AND it shall be that when the regenerating soul has

come into the state of heavenly order with which 
the Divine Love and Wisdom desire to gift it as its 
own, and possesses a new will-principle for good 
derived from heaven, and dwells constantly in it;

2. Then you shall take of the holy affections and 

thoughts in the natural mind which you shall see 
are produced from that state into which the Divine 
Love and Wisdom have brought you, and shall 
store them in the new regenerate will or proprium 
in the external mind, which is perceptive of joy 
from Divine good, and shall advance to those 
states upon which the Divine Love and Wisdom 
have impressed the qualities derived from the 
Lord's Divine Humanity.

3. And you shall come to the celestial good which is 
derived from these states, and shall in them 
acknowledge with thankfulness the goodness and 
wisdom of the Lord, and that you are come into 
the state promised you in all the previous struggles
of the soul that you should possess it. [Note.—
Whatever happiness the soul may have promised 
itself, or imagined (that is really good and 
unselfish), it is to be believed that the reality will 
exceed it eventually if the leadings of Providence 
are followed.]

4. And the priest shall take the basket 

4. And you shall dedicate, by means of the good with

out of your hand, and set it down 
before the altar of the LORD your 
God. 

which you are endowed, the new regenerate will 
that has been given you in the external man, with 
all that is therein, and all the worship that proceeds
therefrom, entirely to the service of the Divine 
Love and Wisdom.

5. And you shall speak and say before 
the LORD your God, A Syrian ready
to perish was my father, and he went 
down into Egypt, and sojourned 
there with a few, and became there a 
nation, great, mighty, and populous: 

6. And the Egyptians evil entreated us, 
and afflicted us, and laid upon us 
hard bondage: 

5. And you shall confess before the Lord your God 
and acknowledge that the beginning of your 
regenerate life was but a few knowledges of good 
and truth ready to perish, and these degenerated to 
mere scientifics, amongst which few truths were 
left—that is to say, all religion consisted in a mere 
system of dogmas not understood,—and that you 
were in that state instructed in genuine truths 
grounded in good, full of power to gift the soul 
with true charity, and mighty against falsities and 
immensely increased:

6. And the scientifics of perverted religion (or the 
system of dogmas passing current for religion) 
were inimical to real truth, and harassed the mind, 
and brought it into a state of slavery—that is, 
truths were subservient to dogma:

7. And when we cried to the LORD 

7. And when the soul besought the Lord, who is 

God of our fathers, the LORD heard 
our voice, and looked on our 
affliction, and our labour, and our 
oppression: 

8. And the LORD brought us forth out 
of Egypt with a mighty hand, and 
with an outstretched arm, and with 
great terribleness, and with signs, 
and with wonders: 

Love itself and Wisdom itself, and who has always
given the knowledges and light of truth to those 
who seek Him; its desires were heard, and the 
difficulties and struggles and oppressions induced 
by falsities perceived;

8. And the Lord delivered what was spiritual in the 
soul from the false persuasions, which prevented 
its deliverance from the evils of the natural 
unregenerate heart,* by His Divine Omnipotence, 
and the manifest workings of Providence, and a 
mighty influx of truth, whereby falsities were 
dissipated, accompanied by many and clear proofs 
to the mind: 
* The regeneration of the soul being solely 
effected by carrying out the Divine will in the life, 
any doctrines which make salvation to consist in 
anything else, such as, in any particular doctrine, 
creed, church, or ceremonial; are falsities, which 
bar the very commencement of the regenerate life, 
by enslaving the only principles that can effect 
regeneration. 

9. And he has brought us into this 

place, and has given us this land, 
even a land that flows with milk and 
honey. 

9. And has brought the soul to its present state, and 
given it the power to receive the things of the 
heavenly kingdom, full of good derived from 
genuine truths, and the happiness thence resulting.

153

10. And now, behold, I have brought the 
firstfruits of the land, which you, O 
LORD, have given me. And you 
shall set it before the LORD your 
God, and worship before the LORD 
your God: 

11. And you shall rejoice in every good 
thing which the LORD your God has
given to you, and to your house, you,
and the Levite, and the stranger that 
is among you. 

10. And the soul shall then ascribe to the Lord the 

good of the new will given in that state, and shall 
acknowledge that it is given by the Lord out of 
pure mercy; and you shall place your newly-
acquired spiritual life entirely in the hands of the 
Divine Love and Wisdom, which shall be ever 
regarded in the first place, and shall be supremely 
worshiped.

11. And you shall rejoice in all the good things with 

which the Divine Love and Wisdom have endowed
you, and the faculties receptive of good in the soul,
both your new will, which is your new self, and all
the desires to receive true usefulness and wisdom 
from heaven which are in the mind.

12. When you have made an end of 

12. When you have devoted all you have to the Lord 

tithing all the tithes of your increase 
the third year, which is the year of 
tithing, and have given it to the 
Levite, the stranger, the fatherless, 
and the widow, that they may eat 
within your gates, and be filled; 

13. Then you shall say before the LORD

your God, I have brought away the 
hallowed things out of mine house, 
and also have given them to the 
Levite, and to the stranger, to the 
fatherless, and to the widow, 
according to all your commandments
which you have commanded me: I 
have not transgressed your 
commandments, neither have I 
forgotten them. 

to the full, and acknowledged that all things are 
from Him, and have thereby recruited the holy 
desires which you have from heaven, and all those 
faculties in the mind which seek for knowledge, or
that desire to be led by good, or which are in good 
and desire truth, that they may be nourished in the 
external mind and be satisfied;

13. Then shall you acknowledge before the Divine 
Love and Wisdom, and say, What is holy in my 
mind is not in the least from myself; and the 
continual sustaining of the holy principle of love, 
and of the external principles that desire 
instruction, and of all those faculties within the 
mind that desire good and truth, is also from the 
Lord, and is solely maintained by perception given
from Him, according to all that is written in His 
Word; I have endeavoured not to act contrary to 
the perception given me by the Lord, nor to 
obscure it:

14. I have not eaten thereof in my

mourning, neither have I taken away 
ought thereof for any unclean use, 
nor given ought thereof for the dead:
but I have hearkened to the voice of 
the LORD my God, and have done 
according to all that you have 
commanded me. 

myself in times of deprivation of truth, nor taken 
thereof for worldly use, nor turned thereof to evil: 
I have endeavoured to obey the dictates of the 
Divine Love and Wisdom as given in the Word and
the conscience, and have endeavoured to conform 
my life to what I know to be right.

Your Divine Humanity, which is the source of all 
good, and bless the soul which You have

derived.

life to the laws of heaven proceeding from the 
Divine Love and Wisdom both as to external and 
internal things; and it is necessary that they should 
permeate and influence the whole will and 
understanding.

17. You have avouched the LORD this 
day to be your God, and to walk in 
his ways, and to keep his statutes, 
and his commandments, and his 
judgements, and to hearken to his 
voice: 

17. For in this state the soul is betrothed to the Lord, 
and there is a holy desire to be conjoined to Him 
and to be led by Him, and to conform the life to 
His laws and His commandments, to attend to 
every perception of His will, and to obey Divine 
truth in all things: [Note.—The voice of Jehovah 
denotes the Word itself, the doctrine of faith, the 
conscience or internal animadvertence: the voice 
of Jehovah is Divine truth (AC Index).]

18. And the LORD has avouched you 

this day to be his peculiar people, as 
he has promised you, and that you 
should keep all his commandments; 

18. And the Lord betrothes the soul to Himself in that 
state, and it becomes more immediately conjoined 
to Him, according to His promises in the Word, to 
enable it to conform the life to His will;

19. And to make you high above all 

nations which he has made, in praise,
and in name, and in honour; and that 
you may be an holy people to the 
LORD your God, as he has spoken. 

19. And to lead it towards interior things and to the 
highest good of which it is capable, and towards 
real and essential truth and a life derived 
therefrom, and towards true love; that it may 
receive the good which flows in from the Divine 
Love and Wisdom without admixture with evil, as 
promised in the Word.

Deuteronomy Chapter 27

Verses 1-8. The Divine commands to be engraved on the will, which is to be entirely at the disposal of 
the Divine will in the regenerate state.
Verses 9,10. The Divine law to be entirely obeyed.
Verses 11-13. Enumeration of the principles which confer happiness on the soul and of those which 
warn it of its evils.
Verses 14-26. Things which curse the soul, that is, destroy its spiritual life by averting from it the 
influences from heaven. 

1. And Moses with the elders of Israel 
commanded the people, saying, 
Keep all the commandments which I 
command you this day. 

2. And it shall be on the day when you 
shall pass over Jordan to the land 
which the LORD your God gives 
you, that you shall set you up great 
stones, and plaster them with plaster:

3. And you shall write upon them all 

the words of this law, when you are 
passed over, that you may go in to 
the land which the LORD your God 
gives you, a land that flows with 
milk and honey; as the LORD God 
of your fathers has promised you. 

1. AND Divine truth as well as all the truths of 

wisdom teach those who are in the Church to keep 
all the commandments of the Word and 
perceptions of the Divine will which they have in 
this state.

2. And when you shall pass from an external to an 

internal state, which is the kingdom of heaven 
within you, which the Divine Love and Wisdom 
will give you, then shall truths derived from good 
be firmly established in the mind, and cemented 
and joined together by the principle of love:

3. And the Word of the Lord shall be engraved upon 
your heart when you are regenerated, in order that 
you may be prepared to receive the heavenly 
kingdom within you, with which the Divine Love 
and Wisdom will endow you, abounding with 
celestial spiritual things, and with abundance of 
happiness and delights thence derived; according 
to the confirmed purpose of the Divine Love and 
Wisdom, which have been the guide of all that is 
spiritual within you in every previous state.

4. Therefore it shall be when you be

impress of the Divine will (see verse 8).

5. And there shall you build an altar to 
the LORD your God, an altar of 
stones: you shall not lift up any iron 
tool upon them. 

5. And you shall sanctify all you have to the Divine 
Love and Wisdom by these truths received from 
heaven: you shall not mix with them anything of 
human science or invention.

6. You shall build the altar of the 

LORD your God of whole stones: 
and you shall offer burnt offerings 
thereon to the LORD your God: 

6. But your sanctification must be by pure and simple
truths received from the Divine Love and Wisdom;
by which you shall offer up all you have and are to
the service of the Divine Love and Wisdom from 
pure love to them:

7. And you shall offer peace offerings, 
and shall eat there, and rejoice 
before the LORD your God.

Providence, and shall receive good from heaven, 
and rejoice in the Divine Love and Wisdom.

8. And you shall write upon the stones 
all the words of this law very plainly.

8. And upon all the principles of your mind thus 

prepared to receive them, shall be indelibly written
the Divine will from the precepts of the Word.

from heaven, and the truths that minister thereto in
the soul, teach all those who are regenerating, 
saying, Take heed and hearken, O regenerating 
soul; you are now become receptive of Divine 
Love and Wisdom.

10. You shall therefore obey the voice of
the LORD your God, and do his 
commandments and his statutes, 
which I command you this day.

interiors of the soul to bless it when it is come to 
an internal state: Faith in the will (Simeon), 
spiritual and mutual love or charity (Levi), and 
celestial love or love to the Lord (Judah); the hope 
of salvation (Issachar), and the conjunction in the 
mind of celestial, spiritual, and natural things 
(Joseph and Benjamin);
[Note.—The soul is in an internal state when it 
loves and desires above all things the Lord's will 
and the good of others. It is in an external state 
when its affections are engaged about selfish and 
worldly things.]

13. And these shall stand upon mount 

Ebal to curse; Reuben, Gad, and 
Asher, and Zebulun, Dan, and 
Naphtali. 

14. And the Levites shall speak, and say 
to all the men of Israel with a loud 
voice, 

15. Cursed be the man that makes any 
graven or molten image, an 
abomination to the LORD, the work 
of the hands of the craftsman, and 
puts it in a secret place. And all the 
people shall answer and say, Amen. 

13. And these are the principles which will be present 
in the interiors of the soul to warn it of what averts
from heaven and to contend with evil: Faith in the 
understanding, which shows what is evil (Reuben);
belief in the omnipotence of God and His power to
overcome evil (Gad), and in eternity and eternal 
happiness (Ashur); a perception of the necessity of
the conjunction of good and truth in the interiors 
and in the natural life, and of victory in 
temptations (Zebulon, Dan, and Naphtali). 
[Note (verses 12, 13).—The names of the twelve 
sons of Israel represent all things of love and faith,
and are mentioned in various orders according to 
the subject treated of (see A/C. 3862). In these two
verses, those which relate more particularly to love
and the will are mentioned in verse 12 for blessing
the people; and those which relate more 
particularly to truth and the intellect are mentioned
in verse 13 for cursing. Thus in the regenerate soul
it is the love of what is good and true that upholds,
blesses, and gives hope and consolation; and it is 
the truths in the understanding that warn and fight 
against evil]

14. And all the truths that lead to good in the soul shall
teach and convince the understanding of those 
regenerating with clear and unmistakable 
perception as follows:

15. It curses the soul and utterly averts from heaven to
fabricate doctrines from self-intelligence or the 
depraved will, which have nothing to do with and 
are diametrically opposed to what comes from the 
Divine, however much they may artfully 
counterfeit what is good and true, and the evil in 
which is carefully concealed in the inmost recesses
of the soul; and the whole mind must be brought to
see and perceive that this is so.

16. Cursed be he that sets light by his 

16. It curses the soul and averts from heaven to 

father or his mother. And all the 
people shall say, Amen. 

despise the good and truth by which the soul is 
born again; and all the mind must be brought to 
assent.

17. Cursed be he that removes his 

neighbour's landmark. And all the 
people shall say, Amen. 

18. Cursed be he that makes the blind to 
wander out of the way. And all the 
people shall say, Amen. 

19. Cursed be he that perverts the 

judgement of the stranger, fatherless,
and widow. And all the people shall 
say, Amen. 

17. It curses the soul and averts from heaven to set up 
a wrong standard of good and evil derived from 
the desire to please self at the expense of the 
neighbour—that is, usefulness;—and all the mind 
must assent that this is so.

18. It curses the soul and averts from heaven for the 
understanding, when enlightened, to favour evil 
and to lead out of the path of rectitude the natural 
inclinations which cannot distinguish between 
good and evil; and all the mind shall assent.

19. It curses the soul by averting it from heaven for 
the understanding, when enlightened, to favour 
evil by perverting the judgement of those faculties 
in the soul which desire instruction, or those which
desire good but have not attained it, or of those 
which are in good and seek for genuine truths but 
have not yet found them; and all the mind must be 
brought to assent.
[Note.—When the understanding is enlightened to 
know what is right, the responsibility comes upon 
the interior will not to allow the other faculties of 
the mind to lapse into error. About the words 
sojourners, orphans, and widows, so frequently 
occurring in the books of Moses; Swedenborg 
gives this explanation in AC 9200: These three, 
when they are thus named together, fall into one 
sense with the angels, namely, into this, that with 
those who are in the Church good and truth ought 
to be conjoined according to order, thus 
reciprocally truth with good and good with truth; 
for by a sojourner are meant those who are willing 
to be instructed in such things as are of the 
Church; by widows, the conjunction of good with 
truth; and by orphans, the conjunction of truth with
good, which conjunction is reciprocal.]

thereby the hereditary evil which exists in the soul 
is called forth and conjoined to the life; and all the 
mind shall assent.

mother in law. And all the people 
shall say, Amen. 

22. It curses the soul by averting it from heaven, and is
profanation, to conjoin the doctrine of truth to any 
evil affection derived from the depraved hereditary
will, or the depraved understanding agreeing 
therewith; and all the mind shall assent.

23. It curses the soul and averts from heaven, and is 
profanation, to conjoin the doctrine of truth to 
false principles agreeing with hereditary evil; and 
all the mind shall assent.

neighbour secretly. And all the 
people shall say, Amen.

against the good of charity whilst pretending to 
favour it; and all the mind shall assent.

promise in the Word to those who will receive

regenerate state is treated of, that good is

first.]

12. Yours interior mind shall be open towards the 

good treasure, the heaven to give the 
rain to your land in his season, and 
to bless all the work of your hand: 
and you shall lend to many nations, 
and you shall not borrow. 

Lord, whose influx of goodness and wisdom shall 
pour in upon you from heaven into your new 
regenerate will according to necessity, to bless all 
your efforts to serve Him: your regenerate life 
shall impart happiness and satisfaction to all the 
exterior faculties of the mind, and shall not need to
borrow aught from them.

13. And the LORD shall make you the 
head, and not the tail; and you shall 
be above only, and you shall not be 
beneath; if that you hearken to the 
commandments of the LORD your 
God, which I command you this day,
to observe and to do them: 

13. You shall be made spiritual and intelligent, and be 
elevated out of the light of the world into the light 
of heaven; you shall look to the Lord and not look 
to self (see AE 559); if that you hearken to the 
commandments of the Divine Love and Wisdom 
now made manifest from the Word, to carry them 
out in your life:

162

14. And you shall not go aside from any 
of the words which I command you 
this day, to the right hand, or to the 
left, to go after other gods to serve 
them. 

15. But it shall come to pass, if you will 
not hearken to the voice of the 
LORD your God, to observe to do 
all his commandments and his 
statutes which I command you this 
day; that all these curses shall come 
upon you, and overtake you: 

16. Cursed shall you be in the city, and 
cursed shall you be in the field. 

14. And you shall be preserved from going in any 
other way than that in which the Lord Himself 
leads, or into which the good and truth of heaven 
and the Church lead (AE 600, end), and from 
every false principle of religion, doctrine, and life 
derived therefrom.

15. But it shall come to pass if you will not hearken to 
the voice of the Lord your God within your soul to
carry out the laws of Divine order in your life both
in internal and external things which are made 
manifest from the Word; then will you avert 
yourself from the Lord and His influences, and 
bring upon yourself all these evils and curses 
which will surely overtake you:

16. The doctrines of truth which you did possess shall 
become falsities, and your external mind shall be 
closed to the Lord, and receive only the fallacies 
that flow from hell.

17. Cursed shall be your basket and your

17. The goods stored up in your will and 

store. 

understanding by the Lord shall become corrupted 
by evil and falsity.

18. Cursed shall be the fruit of your 

18. All the spiritual births of your soul, all the 

body, and the fruit of your land, the 
increase of your kine, and the flocks 
of your sheep. 

products of your mind from the good and truth 
sown therein by the Lord, all the developments of 
your affections, both interior and exterior, will be 
polluted.

19. Cursed shall you be when you 

comest in, and cursed shall you be 
when you go out. 

19. The progress of your spiritual life from interior to 
exterior states, and vice versa, will be from bad to 
worse, and towards utter vastation of all good.

20. The LORD shall send upon you 

cursing, vexation, and rebuke, in all 
that you set your hand to for to do, 
until you be destroyed, and until you 
perish quickly; because of the 
wickedness of your doings, whereby 
you have forsaken me. 

20. You shall bring upon yourself aversion from the 
Lord (which is to be cursed), infestation by evil 
spirits, and punishment, in all that is attempted by 
your perverted will, till your spiritual life is 
destroyed, and you are completely lost; because 
you have rejected life by not receiving and 
appropriating the influx from the Lord. 

21. The LORD shall make the pestilence

cleave to you, until he have 
consumed you from off the land, 
whither you go to possess it. 

21. You shall attract the falsities of evil to you, which 
will utterly destroy all the goods and truths of the 
Church, which you hadst received from the Lord 
as the possession of your new regenerate will.

163

22. The LORD shall smite you with a 
consumption, and with a fever, and 
with an inflammation, and with an 
extreme burning, and with the 
sword, and with blasting, and with 
mildew; and they shall pursue you 
until you perish. 

22. And you will bring upon yourself a consumption 

of your spiritual life, with lust and vehement desire
to commit evil, and the extinction of good by 
burning evil in the natural will, and the false 
destroying all truth, and inability to receive good 
and truth from the Lord; which evils will infest 
you till your spiritual life is perished.

23. And your heaven that is over your 

23. And the whole of your mind, both interior and 

head shall be brass, and the earth that
is under you shall be iron. 

exterior, will be entirely shut out from heaven, and
immersed in worldly and corporeal things. 

24. The LORD shall make the rain of 
your land powder and dust: from 
heaven shall it come down upon you,
until you be destroyed. 

24. And the influx from the' Lord into your soul will 

be turned into what is corporeal and infernal: from 
the interiors of your mind it will stream out upon 
you till your spiritual life is destroyed.

25. The LORD shall cause you to be 
smitten before your enemies: you 
shall go out one way against them, 
and flee seven ways before them: 
and shall be removed into all the 
kingdoms of the earth. 

25. And having removed yourself from the protection 
of the Lord, you will be entirely under the power 
of evils and falses: you shall consider yourself 
secure against them, but all your resistance will be 
utterly dissipated before them: you shall be 
delivered up to every kind of evil and false 
persuasion.

26. And your carcase shall be meat to all

birds of the air, and to the beasts of 
the earth, and no man shall fray them
away. 

26. And your lost soul will become a prey to every 
kind of false imagination and evil craving; there 
will be no spiritual wisdom from the Lord in your 
soul to drive them away.

27. The LORD will smite you with the 
botch of Egypt, and with the 
emerods, and with the scab, and with
the itch, whereof you can not be 
healed. 

27. You shall be smitten with the evils arising from the
filthy loves of the natural man, with truths defiled 
by evils of life, with the blasphemous conjunction 
of good and evil, and with the loss of peace, which
cannot be regained.

28. The LORD shall smite you with 
madness, and blindness, and 
astonishment of heart: 

29. And you shall grope at noonday, as 

the blind gropeth in darkness, and 
you shall not prosper in your ways: 
and you shall be only oppressed and 
spoiled ever more, and no man shall 
save you. 

28. And you will be without conscience or other 

interior plane to retain the Divine influx (see AC 
5145), and you will be destitute of the 
understanding of truth, and of the will of good:

29. And you shall be of such a quality, even though 
you are in the Lord's Church, where the light of 
truth is given by the Word; you shall be as though 
you hadst no light; your course of life will be 
thwarted because against the order of Divine 
Providence; you will be infested by evils and 
falses, and will not be able to receive truths from 
the Lord to deliver you from them.

164

30. You shall betroth a wife, and another
man shall lie with her: you shall 
build an house, and you shall not 
dwell therein: you shall plant a 
vineyard, and shall not gather the 
grapes thereof. 

31. Yours ox shall be slain before your 
eyes, and you shall not eat thereof: 
your ass shall be violently taken 
away from before your face, and 
shall not be restored to you: your 
sheep shall be given to your 
enemies, and you shall have none to 
rescue them. 

32. Your sons and your daughters shall 

be given to another people, and your 
eyes shall look, and fail with longing
for them all the day long; and there 
shall be no might in your hand. 

33. The fruit of your land, and all your 

labours, shall a nation which you 
know not eat up; and you shall be 
only oppressed and crushed always: 

34. So that you shall be mad for the sight
of your eyes which you shall see. 

30. You shall seek to realize your idea of happiness, 
and find it to be a mistaken one and conjoined to 
folly: you may lead an outwardly moral and 
decorous life, but as it does not agree with your 
interior soul you will not be able to retain it: you 
may be in the possession of truth, but shall not 
possess the good of life to which it leads.

31. In the next world such natural good as you have 
possessed will be destroyed, and you shall 
perceive it to be so, and that no part is 
appropriated to you: the understanding of truth 
which you hadst in your natural mind shall be 
completely separated from you (as your true 
interior character becomes developed), and you 
shall not be able to regain it; and the good 
affections which you hadst externally will be 
turned to evils, and there will be no principle in 
your soul to prevent it.

32. And the good affections and good thoughts which 
you hadst given birth to in your natural life will be 
under the power of the false principle that rules 
within you, and your understanding will strive in 
vain to make use of them in that state: and you will
be without the power of doing anything good or 
thinking anything true.

33. And all the results of your life and labour in this 
world will be consumed by your interior evil, the 
quality of which you were not acquainted with 
before; and you will be always restrained and 
prevented from following your own will, because 
against the Divine order:

34. And you shall be insane, and without the power of 
thinking and acting rationally, from the false 
persuasions which will appear to your perverted 
understanding.

35. The LORD shall smite you in the 
knees, and in the legs, with a sore 
botch that cannot be healed, from the
sole of your foot to the top of your 
head. 

35. The holy principle of conjugial love or the 

conjunction of good and truth within you shall 
become infernal, and that even to extremes past 
remedy, and your whole soul will be diseased from
externals to internals. (See AC Index, "Knee.")

165

36. The LORD shall bring you, and your
king which you shall set over you, to
a nation which neither you nor your 
fathers have known; and there shall 
you serve other gods, wood and 
stone. 

37. And you shall become an 

astonishment, a proverb, and a 
byword, among all nations whither 
the LORD shall lead you. 

36. And you will come together with the false 

principles you have taken for a guide to a state of 
evil worse than that of any previous state of your 
soul; where you will love and cherish what is evil 
and false.

37. And you will be more consumed with evil than 
those who are out of the Church, or who are in 
externals, or in whom regeneration has not 
commenced, so as to be an astonishment, proverb, 
and byword amongst them.

38. You shall carry much seed out into 
the field, and shall gather but little 
in; for the locust shall consume it. 

38. You may learn many truths in your natural life, but
shall reap but little in the next world; for the false 
derived from evil shall consume it.

39. You shall plant vineyards, and dress 

39. Though you have abundance of doctrines about 

them, but shall neither drink of the 
wine, nor gather the grapes; for the 
worms shall eat them. 

truth, and have studied them, you will not imbibe 
spiritual truth by their means, nor be endowed with
the good thereof; for they will be destroyed by the 
corrupting influence of your unregenerate 
proprium.

40. You shall have olive trees throughout
all your coasts, but you shall not 
anoint yourself with the oil; for your 
olive shall cast his fruit. 

40. Though you may live in the Church with the 

means of acquiring celestial good within reach, 
you shall not enjoy its felicities; for the good 
within you shall be dissipated by evils.

41. You shall beget sons and daughters, 
but you shall not enjoy them; for 
they shall go into captivity. 

41. You shall develop seeming goods and truths in 

your external mind in this world, but they will not 
benefit you in the next; for they will be kept bound
by your evil lusts.

42. All your trees and fruit of your land 

42. And all the knowledges and spiritual fruit of your 

shall the locust consume. 

soul will be consumed by the false derived from 
your interior evil.

43. The stranger that is within you shall 
get up above you very high; and you 
shall come down very low. 

43. What is evil and false within you will dominate 

over your soul; and what is good and true will be 
reduced beneath.

44. He shall lend to you, and you shall 

44. These false and evil principles shall distort and 

not lend to him: he shall be the head,
and you shall be the tail. 

influence what is good and true in your mind, and 
the latter shall not influence and control the 
former: the false and the evil shall rule in you, and 
the good that you hadst shall be abased beneath 
them.

166

45. Moreover all these curses shall come
upon you, and shall pursue you, and 
overtake you, till you be destroyed; 
because you hearkenedst not to the 
voice of the LORD your God, to 
keep his commandments and his 
statutes which he commanded you: 

46. And they shall be upon you for a 
sign and for a wonder, and upon 
your seed for ever. 

47. Because you servedst not the LORD 
your God with joyfulness, and with 
gladness of heart, for the abundance 
of all things; 

48. Therefore shall you serve your 

enemies which the LORD shall send 
against you, in hunger, and in thirst, 
and in nakedness, and in want of all 
things: and he shall put a yoke of 
iron upon your neck, until he have 
destroyed you. 

45. Moreover, all these evils shall come upon you, and
shall pursue you, and overtake you, till all your 
spiritual life is utterly destroyed in you; because 
you did not obey the voice of the Divine Love and 
Wisdom within you, to attend to follow the 
perception that was given you of what was in 
accordance with the Divine laws, and the 
principles of life laid down by them: 

46. And they shall be upon you as a testification and a 
proof of the evil of rejecting the Divine, the 
terrible consequences of which shall be an 
example to the good for all ages.

47. And because you would not serve the Lord your 
God by receiving and obeying with delight and 
with gladness of heart the precepts of the Divine 
Love and Wisdom, whereby your soul would have 
been filled with happiness;

48. Therefore you will serve the enemies of your soul 
in selfishness, folly, and ignorance, and the loss of 
all true felicity: and you will be held bound by the 
love of evil of your unregenerate nature, till all the 
life from God is destroyed within your soul.

49. The LORD shall bring a nation 

against you from far, from the end of
the earth, as swift as the eagle flies; a
nation whose tongue you shall not 
understand; 

49. And a new state of evil shall come upon you from 
the domination of external things with false 
reasonings thence derived; in which you will 
utterly lose the faculty of understanding what is 
good and true;

50. A nation of fierce countenance, 

which shall not regard the person of 
the old, nor show favour to the 
young: 

51. And he shall eat the fruit of your 
cattle, and the fruit of your land, 
until you be destroyed: which also 
shall not leave you either corn, wine,
or oil, or the increase of your kine, or
flocks of your sheep, until he have 
destroyed you. 

50. And your interiors will become closed, and 
wisdom will not be regarded, nor innocence 
esteemed:

51. This state will consume the produce of the 

apparently good affections and right principles in 
the natural mind until spiritual life is destroyed: it 
will not leave in your soul any kind of spiritual 
nourishment, truth, or good, neither the results of 
your external goodness, nor spiritual and interior 
good, until all is lost.

167

52. And he shall besiege you in all your 
gates, until your high and fenced 
walls come down, wherein you 
trustedst, throughout all your land: 
and he shall besiege you in all your 
gates throughout all your land, which
the LORD your God has given you. 

53. And you shall eat the fruit of your 

own body, the flesh of your sons and
of your daughters, which the LORD 
your God has given you, in the siege,
and in the straitness, with which 
your enemies shall distress you: 

52. It will attack your rational mind (see AC 2851) 
until those doctrinals which you considered so 
exalted and secure will be overthrown: and all the 
entrances from your rational mind to heaven, 
whereby the Lord had given you goodness and 
wisdom from Himself, will become closed.

53. So that you will consume the good of your own 
soul, and the goods of the truths and affections 
which the Divine Love and Wisdom had 
developed within you, in the oppression of the 
false, and deprivation of spiritual nourishment, 
which will be brought upon you by evils and 
falses, the enemies of your soul:

54. So that the man that is tender among 
you, and very delicate, his eye shall 
be evil toward his brother, and 
toward the wife of his bosom, and 
toward the remnant of his children 
which he shall leave: 

54. So that the truth that was once esteemed full of 

goodness and kindness amongst you, shall be 
hostile to all charity, and towards the holy 
affection of doing good that was once joined to it 
in the soul, and towards those right principles of 
conduct that were once developed from it:

55. So that he will not give to any of 
them of the flesh of his children 
whom he shall eat: because he has 
nothing left him in the siege, and in 
the straitness, with which your 
enemies shall distress you in all your
gates. 

55. So that it will not supply to any of them anything 
of what is now called good by the perverted will, 
namely, the desires of the proprium on which the 
soul feeds; and has no other perception of good 
left on account of the oppression of falsities and 
evils, whereby the entrance of all good and truth 
from the Lord into the soul is prevented.

56. The tender and delicate woman 
among you, which would not 
adventure to set the sole of her foot 
upon the ground for delicateness and
tenderness, her eye shall be evil 
toward the husband of her bosom, 
and toward her son, and toward her 
daughter, 

57. And toward her young one that 

comes out from between her feet, 
and toward her children which she 
shall bear: for she shall eat them for 
want of all things secretly in the 
siege and straitness, with which your
enemy shall distress you in your 
gates. 

56. The affection of charity that was esteemed tender 
and pure in the soul, that seemed as though it had 
nothing in contact with carnal things on account of
its sanctity and purity, shall be so blinded as to 
hate the principles of truth and good that were its 
guide and counsellor, and the holy affections and 
thoughts that were once produced from it,

57. And its innocent spiritual births in the natural 
mind, and the good uses performed by it; they 
shall be consumed inwardly and unperceived in 
the soul on account of the defect of all good and 
truth in the oppression and closing of the mind 
from influx of heaven, brought about by the 
dominion of the evil and false.

168

58. If you will not observe to do all the 
words of this law that are written in 
this book, that you may fear this 
glorious and fearful name, THE 
LORD THY GOD; 

58. If you will not observe to carry out into your life 
all the will of the Lord as given by the Word, that 
you may perceive and reverence and exceedingly 
fear to act against the Divine and Holy qualities 
that shine forth from God made manifest,—that is,
THE LORD JESUS CHRIST.
[Note. —In the internal sense, "Name" signifies 
quality or character. The character of Jehovah is 
shown by the fact that to save mankind He 
assumed the sorrows and the sins of human nature;
became the Son of a. peasant's wife, the 
companion of a few poor fishermen, the friend of 
outcasts and the lowest sinners; lived a life of 
poverty, and died a felon's death; so that none of 
His creatures can say his cross is so heavy as that 
voluntarily assumed for his sake by the Creator 
Himself. If it be objected that this Being was not 
God, but a created man like ourselves, it may 
fairly be answered, that what is related of this 
Man, is at all events superior in Divine 
characteristics to what is related of any other god 
elsewhere, in any religion, ancient or modern; and 
how can created man be superior to God?]

59. Then the LORD will make your 

59. Then will all the good that is within you be utterly 

plagues wonderful, and the plagues 
of your seed, even great plagues, and
of long continuance, and sore 
sicknesses, and of long continuance. 

devastated, and all the truths thence derived will 
be utterly devastated, and your understanding will 
be a confused mass of false persuasions derived 
from evil, and your heart will be corrupt with the 
love of evil.

60. Moreover he will bring upon you all 
the diseases of Egypt, which you 
were afraid of; and they shall cleave 
to you. 

60. And you shall bring upon yourself all those evils, 
and the loss of happiness in the natural mind of 
which you were afraid; and they shall cleave to 
you.

61. Also every sickness, and every 

plague, which is not written in the 
book of this law, them will the 
LORD bring upon you, until you be 
destroyed. 

62. And you shall be left few in number, 
whereas you were as the stars of 
heaven for multitude; because you 
would not obey the voice of the 
LORD your God. 

61. And all the evils and falses which come from a life
contrary to the Divine order as revealed in the 
Word, will you bring upon you till your spiritual 
life be destroyed.

62. And all your knowledges of what is good and true 
will be reduced to nothing, whereas you were 
plenteously endowed with knowledges from 
heaven and the Word; because you did not obey, 
and carry out in the life the dictates of the Divine 
Love and Wisdom.

169

63. And it shall come to pass, that as the 

LORD rejoiced over you to do you 
good, and to multiply you; so the 
LORD will rejoice over you to 
destroy you, and to bring you to 
nought; and you shall be plucked 
from off the land whither you go to 
possess it. 

64. And the LORD shall scatter you 

among all people, from the one end 
of the earth even to the other; and 
there you shall serve other gods, 
which neither you nor your fathers 
have known, even wood and stone. 

63. And it shall come to pass that as you were built up 
by the Lord with joyfulness into a Church* full of 
truths of wisdom and good affections; so will it 
become necessary, for the sake of others, that you 
should be utterly deprived of all truth and ability to
act, and that all the things of the Church should be 
plucked away from within you. 
* Each regenerate soul is a Church, and a Temple 
of God (l Cor 3:16). 

64. And all the goods and truths of your mind will be 
scattered among falses in the external principles of
your mind; and you will be brought under the 
bondage of evil affections and false persuasions 
unknown to you in any former period of the soul 
since regeneration commenced, even a simulated 
worship from evils and falses of doctrine, which 
has for its real object nothing but selfishness and 
worldliness.

65. And among these nations shall you 

65. But these external things will give you no true 

find no ease, neither shall the sole of 
your foot have rest: but the LORD 
shall give you there a trembling 
heart, and failing of eyes, and sorrow
of mind: 

66. And your life shall hang in doubt 
before you; and you shall fear day 
and night, and shall have none 
assurance of your life: 

67. In the morning you shall say, Would 

God it were even! and at even you 
shall say, Would God it were 
morning! for the fear of your heart 
with which you shall fear, and for 
the sight of your eyes which you 
shall see. 

satisfaction, and the sensuous or external part of 
your mind will not be tranquil and content: but you
will bring upon yourself a timorous heart, 
weakness of perception, and misery of mind:

66. You shall be full of anxiety and distress about the 
future; you shall be in fear in every state, and shall
not feel any sense of protection by the Lord:

67. And when the light of heaven flows in from the 
Lord revealing your mind you shall say, Would 
God it were obscured! and when kept in ignorance 
you shall wish for more light on account of the 
anxieties of your mind, and your falsified 
perception of the character of God.

170

68. And the LORD shall bring you into 
Egypt again with ships, by the way 
whereof I spoke to you, You shall 
see it no more again: and there you 
shall be sold to your enemies for 
bondmen and bondwomen, and no 
man shall buy you. 

68. And you shall return to a merely natural and 

corporeal state conducted by the false intelligence 
derived from worldly science alone (or, based on 
the evidence of the senses alone), in which you 
trustedst, and by those doctrines which in your 
regenerate state you hadst perceived from the 
Word to be false: and in that natural state you will 
become the slaves of every evil cupidity and false 
imagination, and of no service to real truth.

Deuteronomy Chapter 29

Verses 1-9. A brief résumé of the past, showing from experience the necessity of keeping the Divine 
commands.
Verses 10-15. All the faculties of the soul are present before the Lord, who desires to bring them all to 
Himself, as well as their future developments.
Verses 16, 17. The evils of the unregenerate heart have now been perceived.
Verses 18-21. Let not anyone imagine that it is possible to follow after these evils and yet retain 
spiritual life.
Verses 22-28. The higher principles of the mind become, if perverted, more depraved than those which 
are external.
Verse 29. The operation of Divine Providence is secret, but this is plain, that the Divine commands 
must be worked out in the life. 

1. These are the words of the covenant, 
which the LORD commanded Moses
to make with the children of Israel in
the land of Moab, beside the 
covenant which he made with them 
in Horeb. 

1. NOW these are the rules to conjoin the soul to the 

Lord as given by Him through the Word for the 
use of those regenerating when advanced to a state
of natural good, and derived from experience, 
besides the rules already given them when truths 
were first implanted in the soul.

2. And Moses called to all Israel, and 
said to them, You have seen all that 
the LORD did before your eyes in 
the land of Egypt to Pharaoh, and to 
all his servants, and to all his land; 

2. And the Word proclaims to all who are 

regenerating, and instructs them as follows: You 
have seen what has been done before your 
understanding upon the natural principle separate 
from the spiritual, and all the things in the mind 
which serve it, and the state of the mind in which 
it bears rule.

3. The great temptations which your

eyes have seen, the signs, and those 
great miracles: 

delivered from that state which were evident to 
you, and the proofs to your understanding, that the 
theories of the natural unregenerate heart are false,
and to your affections that the things it loves are 
evil:

4. Yet the LORD has not given you an 
heart to perceive, and eyes to see, 
and ears to hear, to this day. 

4. Yet still you are unable to love what is good above 
all things, and fully believe the truth, and carry 
them out in the life, even in the state to which you 
have now advanced.

172

 
5. And I have led you forty years in the
wilderness: your clothes are not 
waxen old upon you, and your shoe 
is not waxen old upon your foot. 

6. You have not eaten bread, neither 

have you drunk wine or strong drink:
that you might know that I am the 
LORD your God. 

7. And when you came to this place, 

Sihon the king of Heshbon, and Og 
the king of Bashan, came out against
us to battle, and we smote them: 

8. And we took their land, and gave it 
for an inheritance to the Reubenites, 
and to the Gadites, and to the half 
tribe of Manasseh. 

5. And the Lord has led you through all the periods 

of spiritual want and temptation; the truths of faith 
given have been sufficient for you; the external 
principles given to help your walk through life 
have not failed you.

6. You have been preserved from appropriating evil, 
or false doctrine, or persuasions that destroy 
intelligence, that you might be convinced of the 
truth that there is no other God than the Divine 
Humanity of the Lord, who is Love itself and 
Wisdom itself.

7. And when you came to this present state of good 
in externals, the loves of self and of the world, 
which rule hereditarily in the natural mind, came 
forth to combat the regenerating soul led by 
Divine truth, and were overcome by them: 

8. And these principles were made subservient to 

spiritual faith and a life resulting therefrom, and to
the new will-principle in the natural mind.

9. Keep therefore the words of this 

9. Keep, therefore, in this state, as instructed by 

covenant, and do them, that you may
prosper in all that you do. 

10. You stand this day all of you before 
the LORD your God; your captains 
of your tribes, your elders, and your 
officers, with all the men of Israel, 

11. Your little ones, your wives, and 

your stranger that is in your camp, 
from the hewer of your wood to the 
drawer of your water: 

former experience, the commandments necessary 
to conjoin the soul to the Lord, and carry them out 
in the life, that you may be completely 
regenerated, and be happy to eternity.

10. Everything in the souls of those who are 

regenerating is present before the Divine Love and
Wisdom, and accurately discriminated; their chief 
principles of action and thought; whatever they 
have of wisdom; their motives, and everything 
ranged under them; all that is capable of 
regeneration within them;

11. The goods of innocence implanted in the soul in 
infancy; the new proprium, or life from the new 
regenerate affections given by the Lord, and all 
external truths which are in accordance with laws 
of heavenly order in the soul; from those which are
subservient to good affections, to those which 
procure truths.

173

12. That you should enter into covenant 
with the LORD your God, and into 
his oath, which the LORD your God 
makes with you this day: 

13. That he may establish you today for 
a people to himself, and that he may 
be to you a God, as he has said to 
you, and as he has sworn to your 
fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to 
Jacob. 

14. Neither with you only do I make this

covenant and this oath; 

15. But with him that stands here with us
this day before the LORD our God, 
and also with him that is not here 
with us this day: 

12. It is the will of the Lord that you should be 

conjoined with all these to Him by a life according
to the precepts of the Divine Love and Wisdom, 
and secure to yourself the blessings which He 
desires for you to eternity;

13. That He may establish you for ever to be receptive
of the truths that come from Him, and that your 
life may be conformed to Divine truth, according 
to the Word, and to the heavenly order which He 
has appointed to unite the soul to Himself by 
means of the Divine Humanity, both as to the 
internal, which is effected by love; the rational, 
which is effected by truth; and the natural degree, 
which is from both. (See chap 1:8, Note.) 

14. Neither with those faculties which are now present
in the mind only, does the Lord promise this 
conjunction and these blessings;

15. But with those who are now capable of being 

united to the Lord, and also with those which are 
not at present developed in the soul:

16. (For you know how we have dwelt 

16. For the regenerate know that they have been 

in the land of Egypt; and how we 
came through the nations which you 
passed by; 

17. And you have seen their 

abominations, and their idols, wood 
and stone, silver and gold, which 
were among them:) 

merely natural, without spiritual life, and how by 
the guidance of Divine truth they were led through
the opposing evils of the unregenerate heart and 
passed by them;

17. And they have seen how abominable they are in 
the sight of heaven, their internal filthiness and 
defilement, and their simulated worship from evils
of doctrine and falses of doctrine; in which the 
apparent truth leads to what is false both in 
doctrine and life, and the apparent good to what is 
evil both in doctrine and life:

174

18. Lest there should be among you 

man, or woman, or family, or tribe, 
whose heart turns away this day 
from the LORD our God, to go and 
serve the gods of these nations; lest 
there should be among you a root 
that bears gall and wormwood; 

19. And it come to pass, when he hears 
the words of this curse, that he bless 
himself in his heart, saying, I shall 
have peace, though I walk in the 
imagination of mine heart, to add 
drunkenness to thirst: 

18. Lest there should be amongst you any thought, or 
affection, or evils derived from some falsity or 
false doctrine which should induce the will even in
this regenerating state to turn from Divine good 
and truth to follow after those false principles 
which favour evil; lest in bringing forth the 
principles of the spiritual man into the natural life, 
evil should be mixed with good, or truth falsified, 
by the imagination that an evil life can be 
compatible with true religion;

19. And it comes to pass that when he who is 

regenerating hears from the Word the warning of 
the inevitable punishment which follows evil, that 
he flatters himself that all will be well with him, 
though he follows the leadings of his unregenerate 
will, thus from ignorance of truth accepting a 
manifestly absurd dogma as true doctrine, namely, 
that salvation is possible for any one who neglects 
the laws given to enable him to obtain salvation; or
that anything can save or be put as a substitute for 
patiently working out and doing the 
commandments of the Lord:

20. The LORD will not spare him, but 

then the anger of the LORD and his 
jealousy shall smoke against that 
man, and all the curses that are 
written in this book shall lie upon 
him, and the LORD shall blot out his
name from under heaven. 

20. Those who commit sin cannot be unpunished. The 
Lord's protection of those in heaven and zeal for 
the salvation of all will appear as anger against the
sinner; he will bring upon himself all the evils 
which are described in this book, and he will be 
removed from the number of those who are saved 
and regenerate.

21. And the LORD shall separate him to 
evil out of all the tribes of Israel, 
according to all the curses of the 
covenant that are written in this book
of the law: 

21. And the Lord's mercy for others will require that 
that man or that evil principle be separated from 
the Church, or from the soul on account of the 
evils which it would bring, by preventing 
conjunction of others or other faculties of the soul 
with the Lord, as written in this book of God's 
holy law: 

175

22. So that the generation to come of 

your children that shall rise up after 
you, and the stranger that shall come 
from a far land, shall say, when they 
see the plagues of that land, and the 
sicknesses which the LORD has laid 
upon it; 

23. And that the whole land thereof is 

brimstone, and salt, and burning, that
it is not sown, nor bears, nor any 
grass grows therein, like the 
overthrow of Sodom, and Gomorrah,
Admah, and Zeboim, which the 
LORD overthrew in his anger, and in
his wrath: 

24. Even all nations shall say, Wherefore
has the LORD done thus to this 
land? what means the heat of this 
great anger? 

25. Then men shall say, Because they 
have forsaken the covenant of the 
LORD God of their fathers, which 
he made with them when he brought 
them forth out of the land of Egypt: 

26. For they went and served other gods,
and worshiped them, gods whom 
they knew not, and whom he had not
given to them: 

22. So that the principles derived from your present 
conduct which will succeed in future states, and 
the rationality derived from natural lumen alone 
having little in common with the true principles of 
the Church, shall inquire, when the vastation of the
good and truth derived from regeneration, and the 
irruption of evil into the interiors of the soul is 
perceived;

23. And that all good affections and right principles 
are destroyed, and that all love of good in the 
internal will is extinct; that no truths are learned 
there, nor is there any acknowledgement of them 
in faith or action, nor do any true scientifics grow 
therein by which the truth of faith can come; but 
the whole soul is one mass of evil and falsity from 
the loves of self and the world, and from a false 
external worship in which these principles rule, 
which cannot but be dissipated when genuine good
and truth flow in from the Lord: 

24. Then shall even those principles in the soul which 
are merely external inquire, Why do all these evils 
come upon those things in the mind which were 
derived from the Church and revelation? and 
whence comes this great domination of the lust of 
evil? [Note.—Those principles in the mind which 
are capable of the highest perfection, become, if 
perverted, the most degraded.]

25. And the internal dictate of conscience shall reply 
that it is because they have neglected to carry out 
the commandments of the Divine Love and 
Wisdom as given in former states to bring them to 
Himself, when the means of regeneration were 
placed before them to bring them out of a merely 
natural state.

26. For they left the true path of life to follow the 
falses which favoured their evil loves, and 
worshiped these as true doctrines, though they 
were opposed to the knowledges of the soul, and 
were not given by the Word.

176

27. And the anger of the LORD was 
kindled against this land, to bring 
upon it all the curses that are written 
in this book: 

27. So that the soul (or the Church) rejected the influx 

from the Lord by which it might have been 
regenerated, and brought upon itself all the evils of
which warning is given in this book:

28. And the LORD rooted them out of 

their land in anger, and in wrath, and
in great indignation, and cast them 
into another land, as it is this day. 

29. The secret things belong to the 

LORD our God: but those things 
which are revealed belong to us and 
to our children for ever, that we may 
do all the words of this law. 

28. So that they entirely plucked themselves away 
from the Lord's Church, and can derive no 
nourishment thence (like a plant plucked up by the
roots) by being adverse to its principles both in 
will and faith, and burn with the vehement lust of 
evil, and thus come into a fresh state in which they
derive influx from hell. 

29. The way in which the goodness and wisdom of the
Lord lead the soul by His Providence is secret and 
concealed for wise reasons; but this is clearly 
revealed in every state, and made patent to every 
rational principle in the mind, "If you would enter 
into life, KEEP THE COMMANDMENTS" (Matt 
19:17).

177

 
Deuteronomy Chapter 30

Verses 1-10 If in any state the soul repents of its evils, and turns to the Lord with the whole heart, all 
the blessings before enumerated shall be heaped upon it, and all the curses removed far fromit.
Verses 11-14. The simplicity and clearness of the Divine commands.
Verses 15-20. The choice between life and death rests with the soul, and is most plainly set before it. 

1. And it shall come to pass, when all 
these things are come upon you, the 
blessing and the curse, which I have 
set before you, and you shall call 
them to mind among all the nations, 
whither the LORD your God has 
driven you, 

1. AND it shall come to pass when all these things are
come upon you, and you have experienced the 
blessedness of obeying the commandments of the 
Lord, and the misery of disobeying the same, and 
shall remember this in all the states of evil which 
you shall bring upon yourself by turning away 
from the Divine Goodness and Truth,

2. And shall return to the LORD your 
God, and shall obey his voice 
according to all that I command you 
this day, you and your children, with 
all your heart, and with all your soul;

2. And shall return to the Lord your God, and shall 
obey the influx of what is good and true which is 
given to those who are regenerating, both in intent 
and deed; and with all your will and with all your 
understanding;

3. That then the LORD your God will 
turn your captivity, and have 
compassion upon you, and will 
return and gather you from all the 
nations, whither the LORD your 
God has scattered you. 

3. Then will the Divine Love and Wisdom deliver 

you from the bondage of sin, and will have mercy 
upon you, and will re-enter into the citadel of your 
soul, and withdraw you from the power of the 
evils by which you hadst been driven far from a 
heavenly state.

4.

If any of your be driven out to the 
outmost parts of heaven, from there 
will the LORD your God gather you,
and from there will he fetch you: 

4.

If by reason of sin your thoughts and affections are
become quite corporeal and defiled, from this state
even will the Goodness and Wisdom of the Lord 
bring them back and conjoin them again with 
heaven: 

5. And the LORD your God will bring 
you into the land which your fathers 
possessed, and you shall possess it; 
and he will do you good, and 
multiply you above your fathers. 

5. And the Goodness and Wisdom of the Lord will 
lead you back to a state of primitive innocence, 
and give to you the spiritual riches of that state; 
and He will bless you with good affections and 
truths more than in any previous state.

178

 
6. And the LORD your God will 

circumcise your heart, and the heart 
of your seed, to love the LORD your
God with all your heart, and with all 
your soul, that you may live. 

7. And the LORD your God will put all
these curses upon your enemies, and 
on them that hate you, which 
persecuted you. 

6. And the Lord your God will purify your heart by 
love from the evils of the natural man, and the 
motives of all your thoughts, that them may love 
the Divine Goodness and Wisdom with all your 
will and with your understanding, and thus attain 
the blessedness of heaven.

7. And by the Divine goodness and mercy of the 

Lord, the evils of your soul shall be brought into 
complete subjection, as well as the false principles 
which desire to destroy your spiritual life, and 
which infested you.

8. And you shall return and obey the 
voice of the LORD, and do all his 
commandments which I command 
you this day. 

8. And you shall come again into heavenly order, and
act from a perception which is given you from 
heaven, and thus you will carry out the Lord's will 
in your daily life.

9. And the LORD your God will make 
you plentiful in every work of your 
hand, in the fruit of your body, and 
in the fruit of your cattle, and in the 
fruit of your land, for good: for the 
LORD will again rejoice over you 
for good, as he rejoiced over your 
fathers: 

10. If you shall hearken to the voice of 
the LORD your God, to keep his 
commandments and his statutes 
which are written in this book of the 
law, and if you turn to the LORD 
your God with all your heart, and 
with all your soul. 

9. And the Divine Love and Wisdom will abundantly
assist you in every effort made towards your 
reformation, by spiritual births from your new 
will, by a life now formed by good affections, and 
by the true doctrines of the Church to give you 
heavenly happiness—for it is always the joy of the
Divine Goodness to form likenesses of itself by 
regeneration in the Church, as the Lord Himself 
was also glorified—

10. If you obey the internal admonition of what is 

good and true from the Lord in the soul, to form 
your life according to the rules of heavenly order 
as given in the Word, and if you in everything seek
to please the Lord Jesus Christ (who is the 
manifestation of the character of God) with your 
utmost endeavour, and with every thought of your 
understanding.

11. For this commandment which I 
command you this day, it is not 
hidden from you, neither is it far off. 

11. For the knowledge of what is pleasing to Him 

which is given you in this state is not hidden from 
you, nor remote from your perception.

12. It is not in heaven, that you should 
say, Who shall go up for us to 
heaven, and bring it to us, that we 
may hear it, and do it? 

12. It is not so interior that you should say, Who can 
penetrate into these interior things for us, and 
bring them within the range of our thoughts, that 
we may understand and do them?

179

13. Neither is it beyond the sea, that you 
should say, Who shall go over the 
sea for us, and bring it to us, that we 
may hear it, and do it? 

13. Neither is it hidden beneath the stores of scientific 
knowledge, that you should say, Who shall go 
through all this mass of learning for us to explain 
to us the will of the Lord, that we may understand 
and do it?

14. But the word is very near to you, in 
your mouth, and in your heart, that 
you may do it. 

14. But the Divine will is now made perfectly 

manifest to you in your thought and affections, 
that you may live in accordance with it.

15. See, I have set before you this day 
life and good, and death and evil; 

15. Perceive clearly that you now have set before you 
on the one hand a life in accordance with the 
Divine will and eternal happiness, and on the other
a life against that will and misery (the choice 
belongs to you);

16. In that I command you this day to 

16. In that you can plainly discern in this state the 

love the LORD your God, to walk in
his ways, and to keep his 
commandments and his statutes and 
his judgements, that you may live 
and multiply: and the LORD your 
God shall bless you in the land 
whither you go to possess it. 

17. But if your heart turn away, so that 

you will not hear, but shall be drawn 
away, and worship other gods, and 
serve them; 

18. I denounce to you this day, that you 
shall surely perish, and that you shall
not prolong your days upon the land,
whither you passest over Jordan to 
go to possess it. 

19. I call heaven and earth to record this 
day against you, that I have set 
before you life and death, blessing 
and cursing: therefore choose life, 
that both you and your seed may 
live: 

absolute necessity of conforming your life to the 
Divine Goodness and Wisdom as the main object 
of life, and of following the path pointed out by 
them, by bringing your affections, your external 
life, and your thoughts into agreement with the 
Divine will, that you may live and abound with 
truths and power from Him: and the mercy and 
truth of the Lord will bless you in the heavenly 
state towards which you will then be led by Him.

17. But if your affections turn away from Him, so that 
you will not conform your life to His will, but 
suffer yourself to be led away by the evil loves of 
self and the world, and love the false principles 
which favour them;

18. It is now plainly told you that in such case you 
cannot possibly be saved, or have any of those 
states of mind which belong to the regenerate in 
the Lord's Church, to which you are introduced by 
genuine truths, in order that you may take root 
therein by carrying them out in the life. 

19. For now you may perceive that both the internal 

and external sense of the Word most plainly warn 
you that you have been placed in a state of 
freedom to choose either heaven or hell, happiness
or misery: choose, therefore, the only road to life, 
that you may be saved, and be able to retain the 
truths which have been given you.

180

20. That you may love the LORD your 
God, and that you may obey his 
voice, and that you may cleave to 
him: for he is your life, and the 
length of your days: that you may 
dwell in the land which the LORD 
swore to your fathers, to Abraham, to
Isaac, and to Jacob, to give them. 

20. That them may love supremely the Lord Jesus 
Christ, and regulate your life by the perception 
given of His will, that you may be united to Him; 
for thus alone can you receive the Divine life and 
heavenly happiness; that you may follow Him in 
regeneration, even as His Divine Human principle 
was glorified in the celestial, spiritual, and natural 
degrees. (See chap 1:8.)

181

 
Deuteronomy Chapter 31

Verses 1-8. The guidance of the soul must now be undertaken by the principle of Truth combating 
against the interior evils of the soul.
Verses 9-13. The law delivered to the faculties receptive of good in the soul, and all things in the soul 
attentive to it when a state of good prevails.
Verses 14,15. The change of state in which an active warfare against evil takes the place of the 
implantation of truth.
Verses 16-30. Before the soul ceases to be led by truth the testimony of the Word as to the fundamental 
principles of salvation is deeply impressed on the interiors of the soul to testify against it when it strays
into evil, which it is prone to do, from its hereditary evil tendencies when the visible guidance of truth 
is withdrawn.

hundred and twenty years old this 
day; I can no more go out and come 
in: also the LORD has said to me, 
You shall not go over this Jordan. 

implantation of truth has now come to a full and 
complete state; and cannot flow into the soul and 
operate in the recurring stages of regeneration 
without another instrument; and also perception is 
given from the Lord that a new principle must 
govern the mind, as the soul passes the boundary 
now reached between the external and internal 
man.

3. The LORD your God, he will go 

over before you, and he will destroy 
these nations from before you, and 
you shall possess them: and Joshua, 
he shall go over before you, as the 
LORD has said. 

3. The Divine Love and Wisdom themselves lead the 
mind, and will destroy the evils which oppose 
regeneration in the internal mind, and goods shall 
take their place: and Truth combating against the 
evil and the false is the new principle which shall 
guide the soul as appointed by the Lord.

4. And the LORD shall do to them as 
he did to Sihon and to Og, kings of 
the Amorites, and to the land of 
them, whom he destroyed. 

4. And the Lord shall do to these evils as was done to
the loves of self and of the world in your external 
mind, with all the evils thence derived, which have
been destroyed as far as they prevented 
regeneration.

your mind, that you may be enabled to reduce all 
things into heavenly order, according to the 
precepts which have been given to the soul by 
truth from the Word.

182

 
6. Be strong and of a good courage, 
fear not, nor be afraid of them: for 
the LORD your God, he it is that 
does go with you; he will not fail 
you, nor forsake you. 

6. Strive with all your might, and as if it depended on
yourselves alone; be determined to overcome 
evils: have confidence in the Lord, and be not 
disheartened with the power of evil: the Lord, who
has been through the same struggles in His 
Humanity, and is omnipotent, is present with you 
in the conflict; He will not fail you, nor forsake 
you.

7. And Moses called to Joshua, and 

7.

said to him in the sight of all Israel, 
Be strong and of a good courage: for 
you must go with this people to the 
land which the LORD has sworn to 
their fathers to give them; and you 
shall cause them to inherit it. 

If And Divine truth now appoints Truth combating 
against the evil and the false, the leader of the 
soul; and, as is clearly perceived throughout the 
spiritual mind, endows it with strength and 
courage: for this is the principle which must lead 
whatever is capable of being made spiritual in the 
soul to heaven, according to the promises of the 
Lord by the Word in those states that went before; 
and this principle when followed out will cause the
mind to inherit heaven.

8. And the LORD, he it is that does go 
before you; he will be with you, he 
will not fail you, neither forsake you:
fear not, neither be dismayed. 

9. And Moses wrote this law, and 

delivered it to the priests the sons of 
Levi, which bare the ark of the 
covenant of the LORD, and to all the
elders of Israel. 

8. And it is the Lord Himself that leads the mind 
through this principle; He will be with you, He 
will not fail you, nor forsake you: fear not, neither 
be disheartened at the stubbornness of evil within 
you.

9. And Divine truth delivers all these commands 
from the Word, and impresses them upon the 
faculties in the soul which are derived from the 
good of charity, which receive influx from the 
celestial principle of love from the Divine Human 
of the Lord; and upon all those principles in the 
mind which are in genuine spiritual wisdom.

10. And Moses commanded them, 

10. And the Divine law instructs them that after the 

saying, At the end of every seven 
years, in the solemnity of the year of 
release, in the feast of tabernacles, 

period of struggle with evil, when a time of peace 
conies from the soul's resigning all it has to the 
Lord, in which the soul will be relieved from the 
infestation of hell, and will be recreated and 
protected by Divine good. [Note.— The feast of 
tabernacles represents the implantation of good in 
the soul.]

183

11. When all Israel is come to appear 
before the LORD your God in the 
place which he shall choose, you 
shall read this law before all Israel in
their hearing. 

12. Gather the people together, men and 
women, and children, and your 
stranger that is within your gates, 
that they may hear, and that they 
may learn, and fear the LORD your 
God, and observe to do all the words
of this law: 

13. And that their children, which have 
not known any thing, may hear, and 
learn to fear the LORD your God, as 
long as you live in the land whither 
you go over Jordan to possess it. 

11. When all the principles of the soul which are 

capable of being made spiritual are brought into 
heavenly order by Divine Goodness and Wisdom, 
and to the states derived from the Divine 
Humanity, then will the Divine commands be 
obeyed by all the spiritual faculties of the mind.

12. And all things in the soul must act from them as 
one; both the understanding, the affections, the 
undeveloped faculties, and the external things of 
the memory that serve the spiritual man, that they 
may attend to and receive the instructions from 
heaven, and fear to act contrary to Divine 
goodness and truth, and make it their chief study 
to conform their life to the Divine law;And that the
innocent and undeveloped faculties of the mind 
which have not yet been receptive of either good 
or evil may thus receive influx from heaven, and 
thus be taught to fear to act against Divine 
goodness and truth in all the new internal states to 
which the soul is progressing.

13. And it is perceived from heaven in this state that 
the soul can no more live under the guidance of 
Divine truth alone: it is necessary that it should be 
conjoined with a determined warfare against every
evil in the soul; and this combating principle and 
Divine truth must approach the Lord in the inmost 
of the soul, and take their commands from Him. 
Thus the Divine law, and Truth combating against 
evil and falsity, occupy the centre of the soul in a 
state derived from the love of good.

14. And the LORD said to Moses, 

Behold, your days approach that you
must die: call Joshua, and present 
yourselves in the tabernacle of the 
congregation, that I may give him a 
charge. And Moses and Joshua went,
and presented themselves in the 
tabernacle of the congregation. 

14. And the Lord is perceived present in the inmost of 
the soul, in the literal sense of the Word enclosing 
the spiritual sense: and Divine truth in the sense of
the letter of the Word is present at the place of 
communication between the interior and exterior 
faculties of the soul (the internal sense being for 
the one, and the literal for the other, see AC 
10551).

184

15. And the LORD appeared in the 

tabernacle in a pillar of a cloud: and 
the pillar of the cloud stood over the 
door of the tabernacle. 

16. And the LORD said to Moses, 

Behold, you shall sleep with your 
fathers; and this people will rise up, 
and go a whoring after the gods of 
the strangers of the land, whither 
they go to be among them, and will 
forsake me, and break my covenant 
which I have made with them. 

17. Then my anger shall be kindled 

against them in that day, and I will 
forsake them, and I will hide my face
from them, and they shall be 
devoured, and many evils and 
troubles shall befall them; so that 
they will say in that day, Are not 
these evils come upon us, because 
our God is not among us? 

18. And I will surely hide my face in 

that day for all the evils which they 
shall have worked, in that they are 
turned to other gods. 

19. Now therefore write you this song 
for you, and teach it the children of 
Israel: put it in their mouths, that this
song may be a witness for me 
against the children of Israel. 

15. And it is perceived in the interiors of the soul that 
a new state is to be entered upon in which Divine 
truth will lie dormant and concealed in the 
interiors; and the falses which favour hereditary 
evils will make their appearance, and the soul will 
be seduced to trust in falses from the fallacies of 
the senses which exist in the interiors of the 
unregenerate mind, and will leave the truth, and 
break off their close conjunction with the Lord by 
neglecting to seek the wisdom that comes from 
Him.

16. And it will appear as if the Lord is angry with the 
soul in that state, and that He has left it, and that 
His mercy is departed from it, and the spiritual life
will be consumed and inundated with evils and 
troubles; and the soul will then begin to inquire 
whether these evils have not come upon it because 
the Lord is no more within it;

17. For in every state in which man is in evil and lives 
from false doctrines, the Lord cannot remain in the
interiors of the soul.

18. Let the internal man, therefore, plainly testify the 
doctrine of truth received from the Lord, and teach
it to all the soul; let it flow forth into the external 
mind, that this acknowledgement may be a witness
for the Lord throughout all the spiritual mind.

19. For when the Lord has brought the spiritual man to
the regenerate state in which he is gifted with a 
new will to serve Him, which is the purpose of the 
Lord for all who are in good, a state abounding 
with the delights of spiritual good and the delights 
of natural good; and when these are imbibed, and 
fill the life so that the regenerating soul feels itself 
satisfied with good things; then will it be drawn 
away by falses which favour its hereditary evils 
and serve them, and turn from the Lord, and 
neglect to live from His commands.

185

20. For when I shall have brought them 
into the land which I swore to their 
fathers, that flows with milk and 
honey; and they shall have eaten and
filled themselves, and waxen fat; 
then will they turn to other gods, and
serve them, and provoke me, and 
break my covenant. 

20. And it shall come to pass that when many evils 

and troubles have befallen the soul, the truths that 
are acknowledged by the internal man shall come 
forth to testify against its evils; for they shall not 
be forgotten out of the understanding in any future 
state; for the Lord knows the depravity of man's 
heart which will lead him astray, and foresees it 
from the first, and provides accordingly before He 
gifts him with a new will, and brings him to the 
heavenly state which He designs for him.

21. And it shall come to pass, when 

21. Divine truth, therefore, impresses deeply upon the 

many evils and troubles are befallen 
them, that this song shall testify 
against them as a witness; for it shall
not be forgotten out of the mouths of
their seed: for I know their 
imagination which they go about, 
even now, before I have brought 
them into the land which I swore. 

22. Moses therefore wrote this song the 
same day, and taught it the children 
of Israel. 

23. And he gave Joshua the son of Nun a
charge, and said, Be strong and of a 
good courage: for you shall bring the
children of Israel into the land which
I swore to them: and I will be with 
you. 

soul in this state the acknowledgement and 
confession of the truths necessary for salvation, so 
that they permeate the whole spiritual man,

22. And particularly instructs him that it is necessary 
he should fight perpetually against hereditary 
evils, and the falses favouring them; that they must
be contended against with all the might of the soul,
and with full trust and confidence in heaven: for 
by this means alone can the soul be brought to the 
heavenly state designed for it by the Lord; who 
Himself will concur with it in every effort.

23. And it came to pass that when Divine Law had 

fully impressed these commands on the memory as
much as could be received,

24. And it came to pass, when Moses 
had made an end of writing the 
words of this law in a book, until 
they were finished, 

24. That all those principles in the soul which are in 
good, and which love the Lord as revealed in the 
Divine Humanity, and hold Him up as an example 
to the soul, gladly receive the Divine commands,

25. That Moses commanded the Levites,
which bare the ark of the covenant of
the LORD, saying, 

25. And the Divine Law is stored up in the inmost of 
the soul in the principles derived from the Lord's 
Divine Humanity, whereby alone is conjunction 
with His Divine Goodness and Wisdom, and there 
it will correct the soul of its evils and falses.

186

26. Take this book of the law, and put it 
in the side of the ark of the covenant 
of the LORD your God, that it may 
be there for a witness against you. 

27. For I know your rebellion, and your 
stiff neck: behold, while I am yet 
alive with you this day, you have 
been rebellious against the LORD; 
and how much more after my death? 

28. Gather to me all the elders of your 
tribes, and your officers, that I may 
speak these words in their ears, and 
call heaven and earth to record 
against them. 

29. For I know that after my death you 
will utterly corrupt yourselves, and 
turn aside from the way which I have
commanded you; and evil will befall 
you in the latter days; because you 
will do evil in the sight of the 
LORD, to provoke him to anger 
through the work of your hands. 

26. For the soul is naturally against Divine truth, and 
averse to receiving the Divine influx from heaven 
in regeneration; in a state when Divine truth was 
present and leading the soul it has rebelled against 
it; and how much more when truth is indrawn, and 
hereditary evils are permitted to infest it!

27. All the primary truths with which the mind is 

stored are therefore now collected into heavenly 
order with those principles by which the conduct is
actuated, that they may receive and obey the influx
from heaven, and that both internal and external 
principles may be in a position to instruct and 
warn the soul.

28. For it is foreseen that in the new state when Divine
truth is indrawn in the soul the corrupt evils of the 
will will come forth to turn it aside from the only 
right way, namely, from acting out the Divine 
commands; so that evil will come upon the soul in 
the states which will succeed; because it will act 
against what it knows to be right, and be led astray
from the Lord by its own perverted self-will.

29. And the Word brought to the apperception of the 

whole spiritual man the following 
acknowledgement of the Lord and Divine truth, as 
much as could be received.

187

 
Deuteronomy Chapter 32

Verses 1-6. The Lord recruits the soul with spiritual life when there is reception; it is man himself that 
rejects the Divine influx.
Verses 7-14. The implantation of good and truth in the soul in infancy and youth. 
Verses 15-33. The declension of the natural man from Divine truth, and consequent destruction of good
and truth in the soul.
Verses 34-43. But when the soul has found by experience the futility of all else and turns to the Lord, its
evils and falsities are dissipated. 
Verses 44-52. The absolute necessity of carrying out the Divine will in the life again impressed upon 
the soul. Truth gives to the soul a perception of heaven, but cannot bring it thither till carried out in the
life. 

1. Give ear, O you heavens, and I will 
speak; and hear, O earth, the words 
of my mouth. 

2. My doctrine shall drop as the rain, 

my speech shall distil as the dew, as 
the small rain upon the tender herb, 
and as the showers upon the grass: 

3. Because I will publish the name of 
the LORD: ascribe you greatness to 
our God. 

1. LET the internal man be studious to obey the 
Divine influx, which will then flow in from 
heaven, and let the external man receive and carry 
out in the life the Divine truths, which will then 
flow in to the understanding.

2. Truth from the Lord will then nourish and refresh 
the soul, as the rain from heaven nourishes the 
earth, and the perception given from Him will 
renew it with tranquillity and peace (AC 8455); 
and this gentle influx from the internal to the 
external man produces happiness and charity, 
while genuine truth invigorates the knowledges 
that lead to heaven. (See AE 644.) 

3. Because it teaches the goodness and wisdom of the
Lord as revealed in His Humanity, to Him be 
ascribed all excellency. [Note.—The internal sense
of the Word throughout teaches how good and 
wise the Lord is; but His character is chiefly 
manifested by God in the flesh, the Lord Jesus 
Christ.]

4. He is the Rock, his work is perfect: 
for all his ways are judgement: a 
God of truth and without iniquity, 
just and right is he. 

4. Faith in Him is the only foundation on which to 

build, His work is perfect: the way that He leads is
the only wise way: a God of truth and without 
iniquity, just and right is He (AE 411).

5. They have corrupted themselves, 
their spot is not the spot of his 
children: they are a perverse and 
crooked generation. 

5.

It is man himself that turns away from the Lord. 
With him is the imperfection, all the faculties 
receptive of good from heaven are distorted and 
perverted.

188

 
6. Do you thus requite the LORD, O 

foolish people and unwise? is not he 
your father that has bought you? has 
he not made you, and established 
you? 

6. Thus to reject what flows in from the Lord is folly 
and madness, for is He not your spiritual Father 
that redeemed you? By Him you were born again 
and regenerated, and all His dealings are intended 
for your good.

7. Remember the days of old, consider 

the years of many generations: ask 
your father, and he will show you; 
your elders, and they will tell you. 

8. When the Most High divided to the 

nations their inheritance, when he 
separated the sons of Adam, he set 
the bounds of the people according 
to the number of the children of 
Israel. 

7. The experience of the past may teach this; it was 
for this end that innocence was implanted in the 
soul by the Lord in infancy; and help afforded you 
in all the succeeding states of youth. Inquire of the 
perceptions of good given you by heaven, and they
will show you this; and of the truths of wisdom 
that you have, and they will convince you of it. 

8. When the Lord from the inmost principles of the 
soul began to arrange the affections in heavenly 
order by regeneration, when He separated what 
could be regenerated by love to Himself, He 
furnished the mind with truths necessary for 
salvation in complete order.
[Note.—With reference to the last two verses the 
following passage is given in the AC 6075: 
"Remember the days of eternity, understand the 
years of generation and generation. When the Most
High gave an inheritance to the nations, when He 
separated the sons of man, He appointed the 
boundaries of the people according to the number 
of the sons of Israel. When Jeshurun waxed fat he 
forsook God. He sacrificed to demons, to gods 
who came not near, and your fathers knew not" 
(Deut 32:7, 8, 15, 17). This passage occurs in the 
prophetic song of Moses, wherein the Ancient 
Church is treated of from verses 7-15, and the 
posterity of Jacob from verses 15-44; the state of 
the Most Ancient Church, which was before the 
Flood, is signified by the days of eternity; and the 
state of the Ancient Church, which was after the 
Flood, by the years of generation and generation; 
the state of their good by the inheritance which the
Most High gave to the nations, and the state of 
their truth by the Most High separating the sons of 
men, appointing the boundaries of the people 
according to the number of the sons of Israel; this 
number, or twelve, denotes all the truths of faith in
the complex." As explained in the preface, the 
endeavour is made in this Study of the Book of 
Deuteronomy to develop the internal sense as it 

189

applies to the individual soul, and not as it applies 
to mankind as a whole: but the one sense is 
involved within the other; for the mind of man is a 
microcosm, and an individual in regeneration has 
to go through the same changes that mankind has 
gone through collectively. We have had our Most 
Ancient Church in the innocence of infancy; our 
Ancient Church in the period of youth; and the 
destiny desired for us by the Lord, if we will 
follow Him, is that we should ultimately be 
brought to that state which is described by the 
New Jerusalem in the Revelation (Rev. xix—
xxii.), and by verses 36-43 of this chapter; in 
which the innocence of infancy is united to the 
wisdom of adult age.]

9. For it is the earnest desire of the Lord to save all 
who will follow His necessary commands; it was 
to regenerate even the most external that He 
assumed the Divine Humanity.

10. He found them in a state void of spiritual life, their
affection for good gone, their truths destroyed by 
falses; He led them step by step from that state, He
instructed them, He preserved them with the 
utmost care in the interior understanding of truth 
(AE 730).

11. The rational principle enlightened from heaven 
stirred up the natural truths of the mind, and 
guarded the new truths developed from itself, 
exercised all its powers in examining into truths, 
and took natural truths and elevated them by this 
examination into celestial light (AE 281):

12. So that the soul was entirely under the guidance of
truth from the Lord, and rejected all falsities.

13. And the Lord gifted the soul with interior 

intelligence that He might enable it to profit by the
good and truth sown in the mind; and caused it to 
be delighted with the study of the scientific truths 
of religion, and imbued it with good by the truths 
of faith;

9. For the LORD's portion is his 
people; Jacob is the lot of his 
inheritance. 

10. He found him in a desert land, and in
the waste howling wilderness; he led
him about, he instructed him, he kept
him as the apple of his eye. 

11. As an eagle stirs up her nest, 

fluttereth over her young, spreadeth 
abroad her wings, takes them, bears 
them on her wings: 

12. So the LORD alone did lead him, 
and there was no strange god with 
him. 

13. He made him ride on the high places 
of the earth, that he might eat the 
increase of the fields; and he made 
him to suck honey out of the rock, 
and oil out of the flinty rock; 

14. Butter of kine, and milk of sheep, 
with fat of lambs, and rams of the 

14. With celestial things derived from external or 
natural good, and spiritual things derived from 

190

breed of Bashan, and goats, with the 
fat of kidneys of wheat; and you did 
drink the pure blood of the grape. 

15. But Jeshurun waxed fat, and kicked: 
you are waxen fat, you are grown 
thick, you are covered with fatness; 
then he forsook God which made 
him, and lightly esteemed the Rock 
of his salvation. 

internal good. [Note. — The character is made 
celestial by conforming the external or natural life 
to it, and spiritual truth is acquired and embraced 
by means of the internal good given from the 
Lord.] The innocence derived from the faith of 
charity (fat of lambs). [Note. — "Lambs in the 
original tongue are expressed by various names, 
and thereby are expressed various degrees of 
innocence; they are here expressed by a word 
whereby sheep also are expressed, and it is the 
innocence of the faith of charity which is here 
signified" (AC 3994).] Celestial-spiritual 
affections (rams of Bashan). "The celestial exterior
principle Is an affection of good; nay, it is also a 
pleasure which is derived from the affection of 
good. So far as the good of love and charity is in 
the affection of good and the pleasure thence 
derived, so far such an affection and pleasure are 
celestial and so far also they are happy. But the 
celestial-spiritual principle is every affection of 
truth in which is the affection of good" (AC 1824).
Bashan denotes the good of the natural principle 
(AC Index). And faith (goats) with the celestial 
things of love and charity (the fat of kidneys of 
wheat). [Note. — 'Inasmuch as fat denotes good it 
is adjoined to such things as are not fat in 
themselves but still signify good, thus fat and good
are, as it were, the same thing" (AC 5943). This is 
for the sake of the internal sense.] And you did 
imbibe the pure truths proceeding from the Divine 
love (the pure blood of the grape). (AE 314, 374.) 

15. But evils derived from the hereditary tendency 
began to assert themselves in the natural 
unregenerated part of the mind and to reject the 
Divine influence: the soul then becomes filled with
the lust of evil, and there is a dense resistance to 
the inflowing of good from heaven, and the 
internal has become covered up by external things;
then the soul forsook the Divine truth that 
regenerated him, and lightly esteemed faith in the 
sacred doctrines of truth from the Word and the 
Lord's Humanity whereby alone is salvation.

16. They provoked him to jealousy with 
strange gods, with abominations 
provoked they him to anger. 

16. Thus the regenerating drive the Lord from them by
evils and the falses of evil; they become averse to 
Him by reason of their internal defilement. ("The 

191

Lord is especially called Zealous or the Avenger 
when the man of the Church has corrupted the 
Divine which ought universally to reign with him, 
and which he ought above all things to love, to 
reflect on, and to fear; when this is corrupted or 
destroyed, then instead of heavenly light mere 
darkness usurps its place, as there is no longer any 
influx thereof from the Divine, because there is no 
reception" (AC 8875).)

17. They worshiped their evil lusts and not the Lord; 
and false persuasions which favoured them, 
foreign to the truth implanted by the Lord in the 
soul, and new doctrines of the false appeared in the
soul, which had not been believed in any previous 
state.

18. Of the faith in Divine truth proceeding from the 
Lord's Humanity, which first commenced your 
regenerate life, you have been unmindful, and 
have forgotten the doctrines of truth which shaped 
your spiritual life.

19. So that when the good and truth of the Lord is 
perceived, it is abhorred by reason of the 
perversion caused in the soul by evils and falses.

17. They sacrificed to devils, not to God;
to gods whom they knew not, to new
gods that came newly up, whom 
your fathers feared not. 

18. Of the Rock that begat you you are 
unmindful, and have forgotten God 
that formed you. 

19. And when the LORD saw it, he 

abhorred them, because of the 
provoking of his sons, and of his 
daughters. 

20. And he said, I will hide my face 

from them, I will see what their end 
shall be: for they are a very perverse 
generation, children in whom is no 
faith. 

20. And it was seen to be necessary that interior good 
and truth should be hidden, lest in the end they 
should be profaned; for the mind in this state is in 
a very perverse condition, and gives birth to ideas 
in which is no truth.

21. They have moved me to jealousy 
with that which is not God; they 
have provoked me to anger with 
their vanities: and I will move them 
to jealousy with those which are not 
a people; I will provoke them to 
anger with a foolish nation. 

21. On account of the reception of these false 

doctrines in the mind, the Lord is compelled for 
the sake of the ultimate safety of the soul to act 
vigorously against the unregenerate will; by reason
of its perversion and love of empty vanities which 
lead to no real happiness, He seems to the mind in 
this state to be against its welfare; and the will 
becomes zealous about doctrines that are not true; 
and eager after things that are not really good.

22. For a fire is kindled in mine anger, 

and shall burn to the lowest hell, and
shall consume the earth with her 
increase, and set on fire the 

22. And the influx of the Lord's love into the soul is 
turned into self-love, which contains in itself 
infernal hatred against good, and consumes the 
external man and all that is spiritual within it, 

192

foundations of the mountains. 

when it becomes the ruling and fundamental 
principle in the soul.

23. I will heap mischiefs upon them; I 
will spend mine arrows upon them. 

24. They shall be burnt with hunger, and
devoured with burning heat, and 
with bitter destruction: I will also 
send the teeth of beasts upon them, 
with the poison of serpents of the 
dust. 

25. The sword without, and terror 

within, shall destroy both the young 
man and the virgin, the suckling also
with the man of gray hairs. 

26. I said, I would scatter them into 
corners, I would make the 
remembrance of them to cease from 
among men: 

23. And all kinds of evils will then be heaped upon the

soul, and every kind of falsity possess the 
understanding.

24. The affections will burn with lust after evil, and be

consumed with the fire of self-love, and with the 
ruin of the mind thence resulting: the dense 
falsities arising from earthly lusts (teeth of beasts) 
will come upon the natural man, and hypocrisy, 
and reasonings derived from mere sensual 
principles separate from spiritual life, which 
altogether destroy the life of heaven in man (the 
poison of serpents of the dust).

25. Thus the false and the evil which are from hell will
devastate both the natural and the rational man, 
and will destroy both the understanding of truth 
and the affection for it, and also innocence with 
wisdom.

26. The Lord would have deprived these principles of 
all power by reducing the soul to externals, and 
holding it in Divine order by external bonds, and 
permit the memory of its struggles with sin no 
more to come up in the mind,

27. Were it not that I feared the wrath of 
the enemy, lest their adversaries 
should behave themselves strangely, 
and lest they should say, Our hand is 
high, and the LORD has not done all
this. 

27. Were it not that thereby the power of hell would 
increase, and worse evils would invade the soul, 
and the mind would be filled with the insane 
phantasy that it was like a god, and that by its own 
power it had triumphed over evil; and would trust 
in itself and not in the Lord.

28. For they are a nation void of counsel,
neither is there any understanding in 
them. 

28. For the natural mind of man is full of ideas which 
produce insane falsities, nor is there any genuine 
perception of truth in it.

29. O that they were wise, that they 
understood this, that they would 
consider their latter end! 

29. If the soul would but derive its motives and 

intelligence from the Lord it would understand the 
dealings of Divine Providence with it, and would 
consider that they respect its eternal happiness.

30. How should one chase a thousand, 
and two put ten thousand to flight, 
except their Rock had sold them, and
the LORD had shut them up? 

30. In this case the whole of the mind would act 

together to drive away evils and falses, and truth 
joined to good in the regenerate soul would put to 
flight the whole power of hell, if they had not 

193

alienated themselves from Divine truth and 
suffocated the influx of Divine good into the soul.

31. For their rock is not as our Rock, 

31. For there is no sure resting-place for the soul but 

even our enemies themselves being 
judges. 

32. For their vine is of the vine of 
Sodom, and of the fields of 
Gomorrah: their grapes are grapes of
gall, their clusters are bitter: 

33. Their wine is the poison of dragons, 

and the cruel venom of asps. 

34. Is not this laid up in store with me, 
and sealed up among my treasures? 

35. To me belongs vengeance and 

compensation; their foot shall slide 
in due time: for the day of their 
calamity is at hand, and the things 
that shall come upon them make 
haste. 

36. For the LORD shall judge his 

people, and repent himself for his 
servants, when he sees that their 
power is gone, and there is none shut
up, or left. 

37. And he shall say, Where are their 
gods, their rock in whom they 
trusted, 

trust in the Divine Humanity of the Omnipotent 
Lord. Let the principles derived from evils and 
falses declare if they have ever been able to give 
the soul any real peace or repose.

32. Any apparent truth from any other source is but 
the false derived from hell, and from the evil 
affections springing from the falsities that reign 
therein: and any other apparent goods are but evils 
in disguise, which lead to misery and unhappiness.

33. Doctrines that support them, drawn from the Word,
are the most direful of falsities, for they are the 
Word profaned, and bring upon the soul the 
malignant and poisonous evils of hypocrisy.

34. The wisdom by which the Lord delivers man from 

these things, as far as possible, by the operations 
of Providence, is profound and inscrutable, and 
cannot be fathomed by human intelligence.

35. Divine order appoints punishment or reward for 
every action of man; the power shall at length be 
taken from the evil to tempt man's lower nature: it 
is absolutely certain that they will perish, the zeal 
of the Lord for the safety of the soul requires it.

36. For the Lord is not unmindful of those who have 
endeavoured to keep in His truth, and will have 
mercy on those that strive to serve Him, when they
perceive that they have no power of themselves; 
and nothing of their natural evils that can be 
removed is left shut up within them,

37. And when the soul has learned the futility of any 
aid but that which comes from the Lord, and the 
impotence of the false doctrines in which it 
trusted,

38. Which did eat the fat of their 

38. Which consumed the good of their worship, and 

sacrifices, and drank the wine of 
their drink offerings? let them rise up
and help you, and be your protection.

destroyed all perception of truth in the soul; which 
are unable to oppose evils, or to afford any real 
help or protection in temptations.

194

39. See now that I, even I, am he, and 

39. In this state the soul clearly perceives that all 

there is no god with me: I kill, and I 
make alive; I wound, and I heal: 
neither is there any that can deliver 
out of my hand. 

power belongs to the Lord—that is, the Lord Jesus
Christ—alone; nor is there any truth to combat 
with falses and evils but that which proceeds from 
Him: according as the influx which comes from 
Him is received, or perverted and rejected by man,
the soul is destroyed or saved; is made sick or 
made whole; if it derives its power from the Lord, 
it is invulnerable to the whole power of hell.

40. For I lift up my hand to heaven, and 

say, I live for ever. 

40. For communication is then opened up for it to the 
highest heavens, and it receives life from the Lord,
who is the Life itself.

41. If I whet my glittering sword, and 

41. The lightning of Divine truth then streams forth 

mine hand take hold on judgement; I
will render vengeance to mine 
enemies, and will reward them that 
hate me. 

42. I will make mine arrows drunk with 

blood, and my sword shall devour 
flesh; and that with the blood of the 
slain and of the captives, from the 
beginning of revenges upon the 
enemy. 

upon the evils and falses which infest the soul, the 
understanding grasps eternal truth; the evils 
intended to man's eternal life recoil back on the 
spirits that tempt to evil, their hatred against the 
Lord and the good brings on their own 
punishment.

42. The new truths that dart into the understanding 
from heaven will dissipate old fallacies, and 
imbibe and appropriate the truths that were in 
them; and Truth Divine will combat with and 
destroy the hereditary evils of the will, and will 
appropriate all the truths of the mind that were 
paralyzed by evils, and kept bound by falses, 
because the soul has begun to turn away from 
itself and from evil, and to look to the Lord.

43. Rejoice, O you nations, with his 

people: for he will avenge the blood 
of his servants, and will render 
vengeance to his adversaries, and 
will be merciful to his land, and to 
his people. 

43. Let all the good affections and genuine truths in 
the soul rejoice: for He will remember the 
struggles of those who have contended against 
their evils from faith, and will destroy their 
adversaries, and will save all those principles in 
the mind which receive good and truth from Him.

44. And Moses came and spoke all the 
words of this song in the ears of the 
people, he, and Hoshea the son of 
Nun. 

44. And Divine Truth entered the soul and deeply 

impressed all these things upon it as necessary to 
be obeyed, and the soul became filled with the 
ardent desire of combating with, and utterly 
destroying, the evils and falsities that were in it.

45. And Moses made an end of speaking

45. And the spiritual man arrived at a new state of 

all these words to all Israel: 

regeneration in which it ceased to be of primary 
importance to learn fresh truths:

195

46. And he said to them, Set your hearts 
to all the words which I testify 
among you this day, which you shall 
command your children to observe 
to do, all the words of this law. 

47. For it is not a vain thing for you; 

because it is your life: and through 
this thing you shall prolong your 
days in the land, whither you go over
Jordan to possess it. 

46. In which it is perceived that the things now 

impressed upon the understanding by Divine truth 
must be carried out in the life with all the heart; so 
that the laws of heavenly order as given in the 
Word may govern the whole soul from first 
principles to last.

47. It is seen that these truths are not vain things that 
may be neglected; but that they are the very life 
itself of the soul; and by means of them holy states
are acquired by the spiritual man, which will be 
useful to him in the next world, and when he 
passes from external to internal things.

48. And the LORD spoke to Moses that 

48. And the Lord illustrates the soul by means of 

selfsame day, saying, 

Divine truth in that state,

49. Get you up into this mountain 

Abarim, to mount Nebo, which is in 
the land of Moab, that is over against
Jericho; and behold the land of 
Canaan, which I give to the children 
of Israel for a possession: 

50. And die in the mount whither you go
up, and be gathered to your people; 
as Aaron your brother died in mount 
Hor, and was gathered to his people: 

51. Because you trespassed against me 
among the children of Israel at the 
waters of MeribahKadesh, in the 
wilderness of Zin; because you 
sanctified me not in the midst of the 
children of Israel. 

49. And raises it to a state of love above the external 
things, in which the inferior faculties still remain, 
and to the highest intelligence it is possible for the 
soul to attain, whilst in a state of natural good; and
thereby a perception is gained of the future 
heavenly states, to which the Lord will bring the 
spiritual man, and in which He will preserve him:

50. And after this illustration Divine truth ceases to 
actively lead the soul, but is placed in its order 
amongst the interior things of the mind as arranged
by the Lord; even as the externals of religious 
worship had ceased to be of fundamental 
importance to the soul, and had been placed in 
their order by the Lord in the soul:

51. For both these principles, when actively leading 
the mind, produce contentions about truth 
(Meribah-Kadesh, see AC 1678) and states which 
develop fallacies, and do not exclusively uphold 
the necessity of conforming the life to the Lord's 
Divine Human, and the holy principle of love as 
the supreme things of the Church.

52. Yet you shall see the land before 

52. Yet these principles give to the regenerating soul a 

you; but you shall not go thither to 
the land which I give the children of 
Israel. 

perception of the heavenly state to be gained; but 
they do not alone enable the spiritual faculties to 
actually enter upon that state.

Deuteronomy Chapter 33

Verse 1. The state of the soul when it ceases to be led by Divine truth.
Verses 2-5. The Lord by obedience to the Divine law raised His Humanity even to the Divinity, whence 
is all the Divine life of the regenerate. 
Verse 6. The understanding of the Word illuminated from heaven is the life of the soul.
Verse 7. Of good thence derived in the natural principle.
Verses 8-11. Concerning the genuine love of good or charity.
Verse 12. Of truth thus brought down into the life.
Verses 13-17. Of the internal good thus acquired in the rational mind.
Verses 18, 19. Of the marriage between good and truth in the said.
Verses 20, 21. Of a good life thence derived, and (verse 22) the consequent confirmation of truth in the 
soul, and (verse 23) victory in temptations, and (verses 24, 25) happiness even to external and worldly 
things.
Verses 26-29. There is no help like the Lord, and none are so blessed as those who suffer themselves to 
be regenerated by Him. 

1. And this is the blessing, with which 

Moses the man of God blessed the 
children of Israel before his death. 

2. And he said, The LORD came from 
Sinai, and rose up from Seir to them;
he shined forth from mount Paran, 
and he came with ten thousands of 
saints: from his right hand went a 
fiery law for them. 

1. NOW these are the heavenly states with which the 
soul was endowed by Divine truth leading it from 
the Lord, before the new state came in which it 
ceased to be led immediately by Divine truth.

2.

It was perceived how the Lord by obedience to the
Divine law elevated His natural Human principle 
even to the Divinity itself; and from His state of 
glorification light shone forth, and the Church was 
filled with truth and holiness proceeding from 
Him; and with ability to follow the doctrines of 
love which He taught.

3. Yea, he loved the people; all his 

3. For which also He loved truths; and all those who 

saints are in your hand: and they sat 
down at your feet; every one shall 
receive of your words. 

4. Moses commanded us a law, even 
the inheritance of the congregation 
of Jacob. 

5. And he was king in Jeshurun, when 
the heads of the people and the tribes
of Israel were gathered together. 

are regenerated are reformed by His power; and 
are collected in heavenly order under Him as their 
Head in one Church; and receive their life from 
Him.

4. They obey His will as given in His law; which is 

true happiness for the natural mind.

5. And thus the whole mind, even to the natural 

principle, is ruled by the Lord, when the truths 
acquired, and all the principles of the soul under 
them are arranged in the true heavenly order of the
spiritual man.

197

 
6. Let Reuben live, and not die; and let 

not his men be few. 

6. Let the understanding of the Word, illuminated by-
light from heaven, be the life of the soul, and 
never be extinguished; yet such illumination is 
rarely received (AE 434).

7. And this is the blessing of Judah: 

7. And it is perceived concerning the love of good 

and he said, Hear, LORD, the voice 
of Judah, and bring him to his 
people: let his hands be sufficient for
him; and be you an help to him from 
his enemies. 

8. And of Levi he said, Let your 

8.

Thummim and your Urim be with 
your holy one, whom you did prove 
at Massah, and with whom you did 
strive at the waters of Meribah; 

9. Who said to his father and to his 

9.

mother, I have not seen him; neither 
did he acknowledge his brethren, nor
knew his own children: for they have
observed your word, and kept your 
covenant. 

thence derived in the natural mind (AC 5782), that
it is the Divine will that all the holy aspirations 
after good in the natural principle proceeding from
the genuine love of good should be cherished; and 
that the soul should progress to a state in which 
they can be carried out; and that strength should be
given it to accomplish this; and the Lord Himself 
will help against the evils that assault and try to 
quench them. [Note. —Judah seems, in the 
blessing of the tribes in this chapter, to take the 
usual place of Simeon, who is not mentioned; this 
is doubtless because a state proceeding from truth 
or faith (Reuben) is treated of; and not one 
proceeding primarily from love, which is signified 
by Judah.]

If And concerning spiritual love or genuine charity,
it is perceived, that all the desire of doing good, 
and wisdom as to the means of accomplishing it, 
are by illumination from the Lord by the Word, as 
has been made evident to the soul in states of 
temptation from defect of truths, in which it 
seemed to be left without help.

It then perceives of the good and truth which it has
received from infancy, that they are not to be 
accepted if not in accordance with the light given 
from heaven; and that good works are not genuine 
unless prompted by love to the Lord, and that 
nothing that comes from the man himself is good: 
but that all genuine good is from the teaching of 
the Word, and the endeavour to regulate the life by
the rules therein given.

10. They shall teach Jacob your 

10. This is the principle which shall teach external 

judgements, and Israel your law: 
they shall put incense before you, 
and whole burnt sacrifice upon your 
altar. 

truths to the natural mind, and internal to the 
spiritual: and from this shall arise from the soul an 
acceptable worship to the Lord, a worship that 
proceeds from the love of genuine good derived 
from Him.

198

11. Bless, LORD, his substance, and 

accept the work of his hands; smite 
through the loins of them that rise 
against him, and of them that hate 
him, that they rise not again. 

12. And of Benjamin he said, The 

beloved of the LORD shall dwell in 
safety by him; and the Lord shall 
cover him all the day long, and he 
shall dwell between his shoulders. 

13. And of Joseph he said, Blessed of 
the LORD be his land, for the 
precious things of heaven, for the 
dew, and for the deep that coucheth 
beneath, 

11. Bless, O Lord, the things already acquired in the 
soul by means of this principle, and accept its 
endeavours after higher virtue: smite down all 
those evils which would prevent the union of good
and, truth in the soul, and oppose themselves to 
these holy aspirations after good from Thyself, that
they no more oppress the spiritual life.

12. And of the truth thus brought down into the life it 
is predicated that all that is beloved of the Lord in 
the soul shall dwell safely by its means; and shall 
be protected in every state, and by means of it 
shall the powers of the soul for good and truth be 
exercised.

13. And of the internal good thus acquired in the 

rational mind it is said, Blessed shall the soul be of
the Lord when this state is acquired, both in the 
spiritual internal riches with which it is endowed, 
with their influence on things natural, and with the
stores of wisdom with which the natural principle 
shall be enriched;

14. And for the precious fruits brought 

14. And for the good fruits brought forth by the 

forth by the sun, and for the precious
things put forth by the moon, 

influence of the love of the Lord on the soul, and 
for the spiritual perceptions of Divine truth;

15. And for the chief things of the 
ancient mountains, and for the 
precious things of the lasting hills, 

15. And for the influx into the mind of pure affections 
from the celestial heavens of the Lord, and for the 
influx of truth from the spiritual heavens;

16. And for the precious things of the 
earth and fullness thereof, and for 
the good will of him that dwelt in the
bush: let the blessing come upon the 
head of Joseph, and upon the top of 
the head of him that was separated 
from his brethren. 

16. And for the good works which thence exist in the 
external man, conjoined with wisdom, and union 
thence with the Lord, who Himself in the Divine 
Humanity regenerated even the external principles 
of human nature: these things come upon the soul 
regenerated by the Lord, and upon the inmost 
principles of the minds of those who have been 
separated from their hereditary evils and falses by 
Him.

199

17. His glory is like the firstling of his 
bullock, and his horns are like the 
horns of unicorns: with them he shall
push the people together to the ends 
of the earth: and they are the ten 
thousands of Ephraim, and they are 
the thousands of Manasseh. 

18. And of Zebulun he said, Rejoice, 
Zebulun, in your going out; and, 
Issachar, in your tents. 

19. They shall call the people to the 
mountain; there they shall offer 
sacrifices of righteousness: for they 
shall suck of the abundance of the 
seas, and of treasures hid in the sand.

20. And of Gad he said, Blessed be he 
that enlargeth Gad: he dwells as a 
lion, and tears the arm with the 
crown of the head. 

17. The beauty of this good work of the Lord in the 
soul is made known from the good that results in 
the natural mind; and the mighty and powerful 
truths of which it then becomes possessed; by 
means of which falsities are dispersed, and the 
whole mind arranged in heavenly order; whereby 
the soul receives wisdom from genuine truths, and 
good desires and determinations from the Lord to 
live thereby. (See AE 316.)

18. And of those who are both in truth as to the 
understanding and good as to the will, or the 
heavenly marriage, it is perceived that they have 
happiness in all their undertakings; and thence 
come salvation and heavenly reward in the 
interiors of the soul (Issachar).

19. This union of good and truth conducts all things in

the mind to heaven where the good of love 
prevails; and makes the life a sacrifice of 
righteousness to heaven; from this the soul 
abounds in truths of doctrine from the Word, and 
in intelligence thence derived; and understands the
spiritual things which lie hidden beneath the literal
sense of the Word, (See AE 445.)

20. And it is perceived concerning a life in conformity
with truth from the Word that he is blessed who 
receives this by carrying out truths into the life; for
thereby the soul has strength and security from 
falses, and is nourished with external and internal 
truths.

21. And he provided the first part for 

21. He who makes this his care follows after those 

himself, because there, in a portion 
of the lawgiver, was he seated; and 
he came with the heads of the 
people, he executed the justice of the
LORD, and his judgements with 
Israel. 

things which are really essential and needful; it is 
his portion in some measure to understand the 
hidden wisdom of the Divine laws; whence comes 
intelligence for the whole mind, and this enables 
him to carry out good works from the Lord, and to 
receive the truths of the Church.

22. And of Dan he said, Dan is a lion's 
whelp: he shall leap from Bashan. 

22. Hence comes the affirmation of all truth in the 

mind, and its power: which springs from the good 
now formed in the natural principle.

200

23. And of Naphtali he said, O Naphtali,

23. Hence also come victory in temptations, and 

satisfied with favour, and full with 
the blessing of the LORD: possess 
you the west and the south. 

consolation and benediction from the Divine love 
after them, and the consequent affection of truth 
and illumination thence. (See AE 439.)

24. And of Asher he said, Let Asher be 
blessed with children; let him be 
acceptable to his brethren, and let 
him dip his foot in oil. 

24. And it is perceived that felicity of life and delight 
of the affections come from this source above all 
others; whence all things in the soul are in 
agreement and act together, which causes even the 
lowest principles of the mind to be filled with 
celestial delights, and

25. Your shoes shall be iron and brass; 
and as your days, so shall your 
strength be. 

25. Things corporeal and worldly to be in agreement 
with the principles of good and truth; and fortifies 
the mind for every state. (See also AE 438.)

26. There is none like the God of 

Jeshurun, who rides upon the heaven
in your help, and in his excellency 
on the sky. 

26. There is none like the Lord, who in His Humanity 
leads and wars for those regenerating, who is 
present in the interiors of the soul for their help, 
and by His Divine power is ever operating through
Providence for their good.

27. The eternal God is your refuge, and 
underneath are the everlasting arms: 
and he shall thrust out the enemy 
from before you; and shall say, 
Destroy them. 

27. Who thus fills the angels with all their life and 

power from truth Divine, and hence is all life and 
strength also to men in the world; and He shall 
thrust out all evil and falsity from the soul, and 
they shall be destroyed.

28. Israel then shall dwell in safety 

alone: the fountain of Jacob shall be 
upon a land of corn and wine; also 
his heavens shall drop down dew. 

28. The spiritual man shall then be without infestation 
from evils and falses, and shall be led by the Lord 
alone; and the Divine Word shall be opened, and 
from it good and truth shall flow forth into the 
Church and each individual soul that will receive 
them, and they shall be recruited by continual 
influx from heaven.

29. Happy are you, O Israel: who is like 
you, O people saved by the LORD, 
the shield of your help, and who is 
the sword of your excellency! and 
your enemies shall be found liars to 
you; and you shall tread upon their 
high places. 

29. Blessed is the man regenerated by the Lord; who is
like him? a man saved by the immediate care of 
the Lord, who is the defence of his help, and his 
irresistible weapon of offence against all evil and 
falsity! he shall see the folly of all the false 
principles that entice him; and shall trample their 
power under foot.

201

 
Deuteronomy Chapter 34

Verses 1-4. By Divine truth the soul gains a perception of the heavenly life before its acquisition.
Verses 5, 6. A new state in which the acquisition of truth ceases to be of primary importance in the 
soul.
Verse 7. Truths being now in their fullness.
Verses 8, 9. Anxiety of mind and change of state in which an ardent warfare against evil takes the place
of the acquisition of truth.
Verses 10-12. There is no teacher for the regenerating like Divine truth from the Word. 

1. And Moses went up from the plains 
of Moab to the mountain of Nebo, to
the top of Pisgah, that is over against
Jericho. And the LORD showed him 
all the land of Gilead, to Dan, 

2. And all Naphtali, and the land of 

Ephraim, and Manasseh, and all the 
land of Judah, to the utmost sea, 

3. And the south, and the plain of the 
valley of Jericho, the city of palm 
trees, to Zoar. 

4. And the LORD said to him, This is 
the land which I swore to Abraham, 
to Isaac, and to Jacob, saying, I will 
give it to your seed: I have caused 
you to see it with your eyes, but you 
shall not go over thither. 

5. So Moses the servant of the LORD 
died there in the land of Moab, 
according to the word of the LORD. 

1. THUS was Divine truth in the mind elevated into a 
state of love, whilst the mind was still in external 
things to the highest degree it is capable of 
reaching before the soul passes from external to 
internal things; and in that state a perception is 
given from heaven of what the Christian life and 
its happiness really consists to its utmost 
boundaries (AC 4117),

2. The struggles required against evil, the formation 
of a new regenerate understanding and will in the 
soul from the Lord, and that the principle of doing 
all things from the motive of love to the Lord must
extend to the most external actions,

3. The clear perception of truth, and the state of the 
external life of the soul now first commencing to 
live the true heavenly life, in which truths are not 
merely known but practised from an affection for 
goodness.

4. These things are revealed to the soul by Divine 
truth, and it is perceived that these are the 
heavenly states promised in the Word to all things 
in the mind derived from the celestial, spiritual, 
and natural principles of the Lord's Divine 
Humanity (see chap 1:8, note); this is perceived by
means of Divine truth, but that principle alone 
cannot conduct the soul thither.

5. So the state in the soul ceased in which the 

acquisition of Divine truth was accounted the main
thing after it had served its purpose, and the soul is
ready to advance from natural good to higher 
states, according to heavenly order.

202

 
6. And he buried him in a valley in the 
land of Moab, over against Bethpeor:
but no man knows of his sepulchre 
to this day. 

6. And while the soul is in this external state, Divine 
truths from the Word, both from the spiritual sense
and from the sense of the letter, are ingrafted in it 
for future use; and exert their influence even when 
not evident to the perception.

7. And Moses was an hundred and 

twenty years old when he died: his 
eye was not dim, nor his natural 
force abated. 

7. And Divine truths are in their fullness when the 
soul ceases to acquire them as the main object of 
spiritual life; the perception of them is not 
obscured, nor is their force in any way abated.

8. And the children of Israel wept for 
Moses in the plains of Moab thirty 
days: so the days of weeping and 
mourning for Moses were ended. 

9. And Joshua the son of Nun was full 

of the spirit of wisdom; for Moses 
had laid his hands upon him: and the 
children of Israel hearkened to him, 
and did as the LORD commanded 
Moses. 

8. And the regenerating soul passes through a state of
anxiety in the natural mind when the acquisition of
truth ceases to be its ruling motive, and use and 
love predominate, and fears the loss of truth; but 
as the new state approaches in which spiritual 
things are seen in more clearness the anxiety 
passes away.

9. And the soul is now filled with the ardent desire to
completely root out its evils and falsities, and this 
principle is endowed with a spirit of discrimination
between good and evil; for all the power of Divine
truth flows into it, and the whole soul follows its 
dictates, and carries out what has been learned in 
previous states.

10. And there arose not a prophet since 
in Israel like Moses, whom the 
LORD knew face to face, 

10. And there can arise no teacher for those 

regenerating like Divine truth from the Word, 
which reveals the character of the Lord as He 
really is, 

11. In all the signs and the wonders, 

which the LORD sent him to do in 
the land of Egypt to Pharaoh, and to 
all his servants, and to all his land, 

12. And in all that mighty hand, and in 
all the great terror which Moses 
showed in the sight of all Israel. 

11. In all the clear evidence both to the affections and 
understanding which the Lord gives by it to the 
natural mind, to the destruction of the false 
principles which reigned in the unregenerate heart;
and of all the false theories which support, and the 
states of mind which favour them,

12. And in all the great power, and holy fear of 

committing evil which the Divine truth from the 
Word infuses into the understanding and 
perception of the regenerating soul.
