</p><p>
<br>Lecture One</p><p>INTRODUCTION</p><p>Secular society governs itself thr=
ough laws, which in turn are controlled by national constitutions, outlinin=
g the "spirit" of the law. A national constitution, while it may mandate ce=
rtain specific laws, more generally interprets the attitudes and intentions=
 national laws will follow. National constitutions are the single most impo=
rtant declaration of nationhood, and without them the ship of state is with=
out a rudder, the rights, privileges and guarantees of the citizenry are ne=
ither defined nor protected.</p><p>Ideally a nation should reflect the idea=
ls and concepts of heaven, and, in a way, the modern system of creating dir=
ective constitutions in itself is a form of the heavenly ideal. In the heav=
enly model the Lord is the highest authority, the angels under His guidance=
 and care, much as the differing aspects of natural government are under th=
e guidance of the constitution.</p><p>The book "Angelic Wisdom concerning t=
he Divine Providence" is the Lord's constitution for the human race. In the=
 opening paragraphs this work defines the Divine Providence as the Lord's g=
overnment, thus drawing the comparison between a Divinely given constitutio=
n and a natural one. Interestingly it was written at a time before natural =
constitutions had come into being. </p><p>If one views Divine Providence as=
 a Divine framework for governing the human race, one is shown in both stru=
cture and content of the book, how the Lord's love, operating through His w=
isdom strives unceasingly towards the goal of human salvation.</p><p>Like a=
 natural constitution this work follows in broad sweeps to establish the Lo=
rd's relationship to people, His responsibilities towards us, and human res=
ponsibilities to the Lord. The work makes provision for those who turn away=
 from the Lord, much as the penal section of a constitution outlines the ri=
ghts of the state and position of criminals who place themselves beyond the=
 laws of the state. The constitution ends with a description of the nature =
of the Lord's love for people, and the inviolability of His government.</p>=
<p>The fundamental difference between natural and Divine law, however, is t=
he end in view. Natural law seeks to protect the rights of the citizenry an=
d maintain order. Divine law looks to one end: salvation. This theme runs l=
ike a scarlet cord throughout the entire book. </p><p>The purpose of the fo=
llowing notes on the book, Divine Providence, is threefold:</p><p>1. to ful=
ly acquaint the reader with the structure of the Divine constitution. By se=
eing the relevant sections of the book in relation to each other, one is ab=
le to appreciate the complete sense of order prevailing in the Lord's gover=
nment.<br>2. to acquaint the reader with the content of the book, which, by=
 focusing on the Lord's goal in creation, a heaven from the human race, giv=
es us a deeper insight into and understanding of human behavior in terms of=
 the Lord's goal.<br>3. to acquaint the reader in a structured way of human=
 responsibilities towards the Lord, in other words, to foster good citizens=
hip in the Lord's kingdom.</p><p>This study is in no way a replacement for =
the book, Divine Providence, and it is strongly recommended that the reader=
 read the notes in conjunction with the book. Further, this book cannot pos=
sibly hope to cover every subject or nuance contained within the original, =
but it is hoped that they will foster further investigation, and encourage =
the reader to think in terms of Divine Providence.</p><p>LECTURE ONE</p><p>=
THE GOVERNMENT OF THE LORD</p><p>The Writings define "Divine Providence" as=
 the "government of the Divine Love and Wisdom of the Lord" (DP 1).</p><p>A=
C 10773: "The government of the Lord in the heavens and on earth is called =
Providence. And as all the good which is of love and all the truth which is=
 of faith, are from Him, and absolutely nothing from a person, it is eviden=
t from this that the Divine Providence of the Lord is in each and all thing=
s that conduce to the salvation of the human race. This Lord thus teaches i=
n John: -</p><p>JOH 14:6 Jesus said to him, "I am the way, the truth, and t=
he life. No one comes to the Father except through Me.</p><p>JOH 15:4 "Abid=
e in Me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, unless it=
 abides in the vine, neither can you, unless you abide in Me. </p><p>JOH 15=
:5 "I am the vine, you are the branches. He who abides in Me, and I in him,=
 bears much fruit; for without Me you can do nothing."</p><p>Rev. Ormond Od=
hner writes:</p><p>"The Lord Jesus Christ is the one and only God. He alone=
 rules heaven and earth. He alone is the king of angels and man, and His ki=
ngdom is an everlasting kingdom. Of His government there shall be no end, a=
nd this for one special reason: because it is a government of absolute free=
dom, and that which is inseminated (planted) in freedom endures forever." (=
Odhner, Ormond. DIVINE GOVERNMENT, NCL 1951:207).</p><p>In order to underst=
and the nature of Divine Providence as the government of Divine Love and Di=
vine Wisdom, we are directed by the book itself to examine the nature of th=
e Lord as shown in the book "Divine Love and Wisdom."</p><p>As we study thi=
s book, we find that the Lord's creation is governed and maintained by His =
providence. In one sense, creation is continual, and the continuation is "p=
rovidence." Thus creation was effected by means of the Divine Love acting t=
hrough the Divine Wisdom, and providence is the continuation of this outflo=
wing Love through wisdom."</p><p>DP 2: "We shall consider in this section t=
he preservation of the union of the Divine Love and the Divine Wisdom, or o=
f the Divine Good and the Divine Truth, in the things which were created."<=
/p><p>THE DIVINE LOVE AND THE DIVINE WISDOM</p><p>Divine Love and Divine Wi=
sdom are completely interrelated. They cannot be separated, except intellec=
tually. We are told:</p><p>DLW 34. The Divine being and Divine expression i=
n the human God are in a distinct combination one =EF=BF=BD; and because th=
e Divine being is Divine love, and the Divine expression is Divine wisdom, =
therefore these, too, are in a distinct combination one. </p><p>We say that=
 they are in a distinct combination one because love and wisdom are two dis=
tinct attributes, but so united that love is a property of wisdom and wisdo=
m a property of love. For love has its being in wisdom, and wisdom has its =
expression in love.</p><p>Moreover, because wisdom takes its expression fro=
m love =EF=BF=BD, therefore Divine wisdom also is being; and it follows fro=
m this that love and wisdom taken together are the Divine being, whereas in=
 considering them in distinction from each other we call love the Divine be=
ing, and wisdom the Divine expression. Such is the angelic idea of Divine l=
ove and wisdom. </p><p>This concept of the innermost nature of God is centr=
al to New Church teaching. The Divine Love is the core, the very being of t=
he Lord Himself. But love can only be manifested by means of wisdom. Strict=
ly speaking, one cannot separate the love from its wisdom, just as one cann=
ot separate being from manifestation, or substance from form. Thus while th=
ey are completely one, they are distinct from each other. This is the meani=
ng of the term used above "one distinctly."</p><p>It is pointed out in DP 3=
 that love cannot exist without wisdom, or wisdom without love. </p><p>DP 3=
: "...love without wisdom cannot do anything, nor wisdom without love; for =
love without wisdom cannot form a single thought. Indeed, it cannot see, pe=
rceive, or say anything; therefore it cannot do anything..."</p><p>Later we=
 are shown that although we can intellectually separate good and wisdom and=
 see them as if they were distinct from each other, they are nevertheless c=
ompletely one. It is this oneness which is explained in the following passa=
ge:</p><p>DP 10: The Good of love is not good except so far as it is united=
 to the good of love.</p><p>The same passage explains how this unity comes =
about: </p><p>DP 10: Good has its origin in the Lord, and likewise truth; f=
or the Lord is Good itself and Truth itself, and these two in Him are one. =
For this reason good in the angels of heaven and in men on earth is good in=
 itself only so far as it has been united to truth, and truth is only truth=
 in itself only so far as it has been united to good.</p><p>This relationsh=
ip between good and truth is described in the Writings as a "marriage", bec=
ause of their interconnectedness. This marriage, originating in the Lord, i=
s present in each and everything of creation, including the way the human s=
pirit responds to the Lord, the structure of the mind, and even in the diff=
erences between the sexes themselves. </p><p>However, because our minds are=
 able to see things independently, for the sake of intellectual thought, on=
e is able to consider the Divine Love on its own, and the Divine Wisdom on =
its own, as if they were separate things, when in fact they are inseparably=
 one.</p><p>When the Lord created He created FROM love, BY MEANS OF wisdom.=
 Thus the two are present in every part of creation. From this, it follows =
that love and wisdom are also present in every part of the Lord's governmen=
t of creation. Take note of the examples of Love in Wisdom as given in the =
following:</p><p>DP 3: That the universe, with all things in general and in=
 particular therein, was created from the Divine Love by means of the Divin=
e Wisdom can be confirmed from all things in the world that may be examined=
 by the eye.</p><p>The book, Divine Providence, invites people to examine a=
 tree with the most powerful means at their disposal, penetrating more and =
more deeply into the mysteries of the object. Then, we are told, think from=
 spiritual things, in which case we will see that the tree tends towards re=
producing itself, and that the whole of its existence it geared to that end=
. This is called the "prolific principle":</p><p>DP 3: Moreover, if you wil=
l reflect deeply enough from the spiritual point of view, you will see that=
 this prolific principle is not from the seed, nor from the sun of this wor=
ld which is pure fire, but that it is in the seed from God the Creator, to =
whom belongs infinite Wisdom.</p><p>Examine any object in the created unive=
rse, with the purpose of finding the Divine Love present in Divine Wisdom t=
here and this will become clear. However, in order to see these things, we =
need to examine the objects from the point of view of the spiritual things =
within and not simply according to their external appearance. </p><p>The Di=
vine Love and Wisdom proceeding together form a "one"; thus, their form is =
impressed on all of creation. The unity of love and wisdom, while distinct,=
 is completely whole, and is so because of the distinctions between them. T=
hus we are told:</p><p>DP 4: "...that form makes one more perfectly in prop=
ortion as those things which enter into it are distinct from one another an=
d are yet united." </p><p>Angels confirmed this by saying:</p><p>DP 4: "...=
 the more distinctly [good and truth] are two, the more perfectly can they =
constitute one..."</p><p>The angels themselves are perfect examples of how =
perfect oneness is made up of a series of different things. Each angel is a=
 unique, individual human being, each reflecting some aspect of the Lord's =
Divine Love and His Divine Wisdom, and yet groupings of angels form societi=
es, in which the love of the individual angel is perfected by the loves of =
those around them. In a continuation of this process, groupings of societie=
s form heavens, and heavens kingdoms. Heaven increases in perfection accord=
ing to the multitude of angels there in their order. From this we can see t=
his principle most clearly: that from a variety of many things one has a pe=
rfect oneness. </p><p>It is this oneness of the Divine Love and Wisdom, whi=
ch act together both to create, and to preserve creation. The process of pr=
eservation is the Lord's Divine Providence: </p><p>DLW 37: "The Divine Prov=
idence in the forming, regenerating, and saving of men, partakes equally of=
 Divine Love and Divine Wisdom. From more of Divine Love than of Divine Wis=
dom, or more of Divine Wisdom than of Divine Love, a person cannot be refor=
med, regenerated and saved. Divine Love wills to save all, but it can save =
only by means of Divine Wisdom; to Divine Wisdom belong all the laws throug=
h which salvation is effected; and these laws Love cannot transcend, becaus=
e Divine Love and Divine Wisdom are one and act in unison."</p><p>The entir=
e providence of the Lord, then, is the coming forth into creation, of this =
love and wisdom from the Lord. A person either receives it, or not, accordi=
ng to his freedom, but no matter what our choice may be, our lives are stil=
l governed by this providence.</p><p>THE DIVINE LOVE AND WISDOM EXIST IN FO=
RMS CREATED BY IT</p><p>In the book "Divine Providence", we are clearly sho=
wn how the oneness of the Divine Love and Wisdom are reflected in creation.=
 We are told in TCR 43 that the essence of love is:</p><p>"... to love othe=
rs outside of oneself, to desire to be one with them, and to render them bl=
essed from oneself."</p><p>Creation, then, had as its aim the creation of b=
eings, or vessels, which are able to receive the Divine Love in a suitable =
form, and to be able to respond to that love. The reason for this is given:=
</p><p>DLW 47: "It is the essential of love not to love self, but to love o=
thers, and to be conjoined with others by love. It is the essential of love=
, moreover, to be loved by others, for thus conjunction is effected. The es=
sence of all love consists in this conjunction; this, in fact, is its life,=
 which is called enjoyment, pleasantness, delight, sweetness, bliss, happin=
ess, and felicity. Love consists in this, that its own should be another's;=
 to feel the joy of another as joy in oneself, that is loving. But to feel =
one's own joy in another, and not the other's joy in oneself is not loving;=
 for this is loving self, while the former is loving the neighbor." </p><p>=
These essentials of love exist in the Lord. His love is so powerful that He=
 created the universe itself in order to be able to have a vessel suitable =
to receive His love, not only passively, but responsively, that is able to =
return that love.</p><p>AC 1735: "The Most High, or Inmost, is the Celestia=
l element of Love, or Love itself. Jehovah, or the Lord's internal, was the=
 celestial element itself of love, that is, it was Love itself, to which no=
 other attributes are appropriate than those of pure Love and so pure Mercy=
 towards the whole human race, that Mercy being such that it wills to save =
all men, to make them eternally happy, and to impart to them all that is it=
s Own - thus out of pure Mercy and by the mighty power of love to draw towa=
rds heaven, that is, towards Itself, all who are willing to follow. That Lo=
ve itself is Jehovah.."</p><p>DLW continues with the same idea:</p><p>DLW 4=
9: "With respect to God; it is impossible for Him to love others and to be =
loved reciprocally by others in whom there is anything of infinity, that is=
, anything of the essence and life of love in itself, or anything of the di=
vine, for if there were things having in them anything of infinity, that is=
, of the essence and life of love in itself, that is, of the Divine, it wou=
ld not be God loved by others, but God loving Himself; since the Infinite, =
that is, the Divine, is one only, and if this were in others, Itself would =
be in them, and would be the love of self Itself; and of that love not the =
least trace can be possible in God, since it is wholly opposed to the Divin=
e Essence."</p><p>Thus in order to satisfy His Divine Love, the Lord create=
d people who are able to receive His Love and to return it to Him.</p><p>AL=
L CREATED FORMS ARE RECIPIENTS OF THE DIVINE</p><p>All of creation, then, w=
as created in order to receive the Divine Love and Wisdom:</p><p>DLW 55: "T=
he angelic idea of this is that what is created in God from God, is like th=
at in a person which has been derived from his life, but from which the lif=
e has been withdrawn, which is such a nature as to be in accord with his li=
fe, and yet it is not his life."</p><p>Thus creation, while it can receive =
God's life, is not God. It is separated from Him to the degree that His lif=
e has been withdrawn from the created things. Nevertheless, the reciprocal =
nature of creation requires that even though the Lord's life has been withd=
rawn from creation, the created thing must be in such a form that this very=
 life can then flow back into it. In flowing back into the created form, ho=
wever, the life does not become one with the created form, but remains apar=
t from it, as it continues to belong to the Lord Himself.</p><p>DLW 56: "Ev=
ery created thing, by virtue of this origin, is such in its nature as to be=
 a recipient of God, not by continuity, but by contiguity."</p><p>Thus the =
Divine Love and Wisdom do not flow directly into the created form (continui=
ty), for if it did this, the power of the Divine would completely take over=
 the nature of the vessel, and the created form would cease to exist as an =
entity in itself. </p><p>Instead the Lord is present as it were next to the=
 vessel (contiguity), and thus flows into it and thus preserves the vessel.=
 Perhaps the clearest example of this is the way the Lord flows into people=
: He does not flow directly into our bodies (which would be continuity from=
 Himself), for the matter of our bodies could not receive the Divine Presen=
ce and maintain its integrity. By the Lord flows into the soul which receiv=
es life from the Lord, and them transfers that life to the body. Thus the s=
oul is an intermediary between the Lord and our body. In this way the body =
is able to continue to exist, and the Lord is present by "contiguity" that =
is, by being "next" to the body, but not in the body except by means of the=
 soul.</p><p>We are shown this reception of life from the Lord clearly in t=
he case of angels who are angels because their bodies have been taught to r=
eceive the Lord's presence:</p><p>DLW 57: "From this it is that angels are =
angels, not from themselves, but by virtue of this conjunction with God-Man=
; and this conjunction is according to the reception of Divine Good and Div=
ine Truth, which are God, and which seem to proceed from Him, though really=
 they are in Him. This reception is according to their application to thems=
elves of the laws of order, which are Divine truths, in the exercise of tha=
t freedom of thinking and willing according to reason, which they possess f=
rom the Lord as if it were their own. By this they have a reception, as fro=
m themselves, of Divine Good and of Divine Truth, and by this there is a re=
ciprocation of love..." </p><p>Thus in angels the form which receives the i=
nflowing life from the Lord is their ability to apply the laws of order fre=
ely. When they do this, they come into a state of order which can then rece=
ive the Lord's order within them. Thus a reciprocal relationship is establi=
shed between the angels and the Lord. </p><p>This same principle works for =
the rest of creation as well (cf. DLW 57e, 58).</p><p>ALL THINGS WERE CREAT=
ED BY THE DIVINE LOVE AND WISDOM</p><p>It follows from this that since the =
Lord can only be present in things created by Him, and yet we know that the=
 Lord is present everywhere, that therefore the Lord created all things.</p=
><p>DLW 52: "So full of Divine Love and Divine Wisdom is the universe in gr=
eatest and least, and in first and last things, that it may be said to be D=
ivine Love and Divine Wisdom on an image... Not that the created universe i=
s God-Man, but that it is from Him; for nothing whatever in the created uni=
verse is substance and form in itself, or life in itself, or love and wisdo=
m in itself, yea, neither is a person in himself, but all is from God, who =
is Man, Wisdom and Love, also Form and Substance in itself. That which has =
Being-in-itself is uncreate and infinite, but whatever is from Very Being, =
since it contains in it nothing of Being-in-itself, is created and finite, =
and this exhibits an image of Him from whom it has being and has form."</p>=
<p>This concept is captured in the Psalm:</p><p>"The earth is the Lord's, a=
nd all its fullness, The world and those who dwell therein. For He has foun=
ded it upon the seas, and established it upon the waters" (Psalm 24:1, 2).<=
/p><p>THE SPIRITUAL SUN</p><p>Before the Lord could create the natural univ=
erse, He had to create a first finite substance, which could mediate his pr=
esence to mankind. In a sense He had to create a universal "soul" which wou=
ld be act for the rest of creation as our soul acts for us. Thus He had to =
create a substance which on the one hand could receive His Divine presence,=
 and on the other could communicate this divine presence without it being f=
ully present in the created things. </p><p>This first substance was really =
the first "finiting of the infinite," or the first substance from which the=
 infinite had been withdrawn. As such it was no longer infinite, no longer =
continuous with the Lord, but now limited and finited, "separated" from the=
 Lord. By means of this first substance the Lord could be present in all th=
ings:</p><p>DP 5: "... the Divine is in every created thing, because God th=
e Creator, who is the Lord from eternity, produced from himself the Sun of =
the spiritual world, and through that Sun all things in the universe; conse=
quently, that that Sun, which is from the Lord and in which the Lord is, is=
 not only the first substance but is also the one substance from which all =
things are; and because it is the one only substance it follows that this s=
ubstance is in every created thing, but with infinite variety according to =
the uses of each." </p><p>The spiritual sun, then, is the first proceeding =
of the Divine Love and Wisdom:</p><p>DLW 151: "The Lord created the univers=
e and all things of it by means of the sun which is the first proceeding of=
 Divine Love and Wisdom."</p><p>The book, Divine Love and Wisdom, challenge=
s us to think of creation arising from any other source. Even if we turn to=
 our physical universe, we find that suns were the first things from which =
planets were subsequently created. Initially planets themselves were hot, b=
urning, balls of fire, miniature suns in their own right. Once they began t=
o cool off, various life forms were formed. Creation, both spiritual and na=
tural, then seems to begin in fire and heat:</p><p>DLW 152: "No one who is =
capable of seeing effects from causes, and afterwards causes from effects i=
n their order and sequence, can deny that the sun is the first of creation,=
 for all the things that are in its world have perpetual existence from it,=
 their existence is derived from it... The sun is spoken of as creating, bu=
t this means the Lord, by means of the sun; for the sun was also created by=
 the Lord."</p><p>We can see the truth of this from our own world: the sun =
was indeed created first, and from that planets, upon which the Lord gradua=
lly evolved life until life receptive of Him could respond directly to Him =
(for the most recent thoughts on evolution, cf. TIME MAGAZINE, October 11, =
1993). We need, however, to be able to work backwards from effects to cause=
s, and back to the causes of causes. Thus it follows that our natural sun i=
s merely a creation on the natural place of a corresponding creation on the=
 spiritual plane:</p><p>DLW 153: "There are two suns through which all thin=
gs were created by the Lord, the sun of the spiritual world and the sun of =
the natural world. The Lord created all things by the sun of the natural wo=
rld, since the latter is far below the former; it is in middle distance; ab=
ove it is the spiritual world and below it is the natural world. This sun o=
f the natural world was created to render aid, as kind of substitute..."</p=
><p>DLW 296: "There are in the Lord three things that are the Lord, the Div=
ine of Love, the Divine of Wisdom, and the Divine of Use; and these three a=
re presented in appearance outside of the sun of the spiritual world, the D=
ivine of love by heat, the Divine of wisdom by light, and the Divine of use=
 by the atmosphere which is their containent."</p><p>The sun of the spiritu=
al world is the medium by which the Lord created the universe:</p><p>DLW 15=
4: "...because that sun is the first proceeding of Divine Love and Wisdom, =
and from Divine Love and Divine Wisdom all things are."</p><p>Thus the spir=
itual sun conveys, by correspondences, the things of Divine Love and Wisdom=
, and through the correspondences, it creates forms, which can receive the =
Divine. It is important, however, to keep firmly in mind that the Spiritual=
 Sun is not the Lord Himself:</p><p>DLW 93: "The sun of the spiritual world=
 is not God, but is a proceeding from the Divine Love and Divine Wisdom of =
God-Man; so also are the heat and light from that sun."</p><p>And later on =
we are warned:</p><p>DLW 97: "Let everyone beware of thinking that the sun =
of the spiritual world is God Himself. God Himself is a Man. The first proc=
eeding from His Love and Wisdom is that fiery spiritual [substance] which a=
ppears before the angels as a sun. Where, therefore, the Lord manifests Him=
self to the angels in person, He manifests Himself as a Man; and this somet=
imes in the sun, sometimes outside of it."</p><p>SPIRITUAL HEAT AND LIGHT</=
p><p>The Lord created the Spiritual Sun first because the sun carries His l=
ove and wisdom onto lower places of creation, much as our soul carries His =
life into our minds and bodies.</p><p>DLW 86: "That sun is not the Lord Him=
self, but is from the Lord. It is the Divine Love and Divine Wisdom proceed=
ing from Him that appears as a sun in that [spiritual] world. And because L=
ove and Wisdom in the Lord are one, that sun is said to be Divine Love; for=
 Divine Wisdom is of Divine Love, consequently is Love."</p><p>To angels th=
e spiritual sun appears the same as our natural sun appears to us:</p><p>DL=
W 87: "Since love and fire mutually correspond, that sun appears before the=
 eyes of the angels as fiery; for angels cannot see love with their eyes, b=
ut they see in place of love what corresponds to it."</p><p>Thus when angel=
s see the spiritual sun, they think of the Lord, and He appears to them in =
this sun: </p><p>HH 117: "In heaven the Lord is seen as a sun, for the reas=
on that He is Divine Love, from which all spiritual things, and by means of=
 the sun of the world all natural things, have their existence. That love i=
s what shines as a sun."</p><p>Thus when angels see the spiritual sun, they=
 think of the Lord, and He appears to them in this sun: </p><p>DLW 89: "In =
the spiritual world where angels and spirits are there are heat and light, =
just as in the natural world where men are; moreover in like manner as heat=
, the heat is felt and the light is seen as light. Still the heat and light=
 of the spiritual world and of the natural world are so entirely different =
as to have nothing in common. They differ one from the other as what is ali=
ve differs from what is dead. The heat of the spiritual world in itself is =
alive; so is the light; but the heat of the natural world in itself is dead=
; so is its light. For the heat and light of the spiritual world go forth f=
rom a sun that is pure love, while the heat and light of the natural world =
go forth from a sun that is pure fire; and love is alive, and the Divine Lo=
ve is Life itself; while fire is dead, and solar fire is death itself, and =
may be so called because it has nothing whatever of life in it."</p><p>DLW =
91: "Such being the difference between the heat and light of the two worlds=
, it is very evident why those who are in the one world cannot see those wh=
o are in the other world. For the eyes of a person, who sees from natural l=
ight are of the substance of his world, and the eyes of an angel are of the=
 substance of his world; thus in both cases they are formed for the proper =
reception of their own light."</p><p>THE DIVINE ATMOSPHERE</p><p>The heat a=
nd light of the spiritual sun are carried forth by "the Divine of Use", or =
the sphere of use proceeding from the Lord. This sphere of use performs the=
 same functions as atmospheres do in this world, for we need atmospheres to=
 carry the heat and light of the natural sun.</p><p>DLW 299: "Now since the=
se three, love, wisdom and use, are in the Lord, and are the Lord, and sinc=
e the Lord is everywhere, for He is omnipresent; and since the Lord cannot =
make Himself present, such as He is in Himself and such as He is in His own=
 sun, to any angel or a person, He therefore presents Himself by means of s=
uch things as can be received, presenting Himself, as to love by heat, as t=
o wisdom by light, and as to use by an atmosphere. The Lord presents Himsel=
f as to use by an atmosphere, because an atmosphere is a continent of heat =
and light, as use is the containent of love and wisdom. For heat and light =
going forth in nothing, that is, in vacuum, but must go forth in a containe=
nt which is a subject. This containent we call atmosphere; and this encompa=
sses the sun, receiving the sun in its bosom, and bearing it to heaven wher=
e angels are, and then to the world where men are, thus making the Lord's p=
resence everywhere manifest." </p><p>HOW WAS THE UNIVERSE CREATED?</p><p>Th=
is lecture is not the place to go into a long description of how the univer=
se was created by means of the spiritual sun. That process is described in =
the work Divine Love and Wisdom. However, it would be useful to examine a v=
ery short article on the subject:</p><p>"God created the universe by pourin=
g out divine substance from Himself, and then, in some mysterious way we ca=
nnot understand, withdrawing Himself from it, until it became dead matter, =
separate entirely from Himself, and therefore finite. This might be explain=
ed in mathematical terms by saying, "Infinity divided by infinity equals an=
y finite number, or all finite numbers."</p><p>"If this proposition is corr=
ect, then it could represent the "big bang" which exploded into stars, plan=
ets, oceans, forests, fertile lands, the whole tremendous universe!"</p><p>=
"We are on firm ground when we assert that creation started with dead matte=
r, of the lowest and most inert degree - grasses, water, rocks, minerals et=
c. God then fashioned these into forms capable of receiving life on a highe=
r level: first the vegetable kingdom; then, from the animal kingdom which i=
s sustained by the vegetable kingdom; then, from the animal kingdom, Man. S=
omehow at this stage a "soul" must have been implanted, but when exactly th=
is was done, and how (perhaps by a virgin birth?) we cannot tell, because w=
e are part of the process. WE know that love was the driving force, and tha=
t wisdom was the controlling factor. Divine love set the process going, and=
 Divine Wisdom planned the action. And when you have love and wisdom workin=
g together, then you have power" (Kingslake 1992:31).</p><p>THUS DIVINE LOV=
E AND WISDOM ARE REFLECTED IN ALL THINGS</p><p>Because the Lord is Divine L=
ove, expressed through Divine truth, and because His impress is on the whol=
e of creation, all things in creation are reflections of the Lord Himself. =
However, as we have seen, the Divine Love and Divine Wisdom are "distinctly=
 one," meaning that they may appear to be separate and different. It follow=
s then that there are some things, which receive more of the Divine Love th=
an of the Divine Wisdom, and vice versa.</p><p>The primary focus of creatio=
n, however, is the human being, because people can respond to the Lord. The=
ir minds are able to take the Divine Life flowing into the soul, and to use=
 it to lift them out of the animal-like degree of life into a higher level =
of thought and response. Thus, the human being is capable of rational thoug=
ht, of directed emotions and of decisive actions - which animals are not ca=
pable of.</p><p>Thus in the first chapter of Divine Providence, we see the =
focus of creation shifting from its universal approach given in Divine Love=
 and Wisdom, and centering on the human race.</p><p>THE PARALLEL WITH WILL =
AND UNDERSTANDING</p><p>The first parallel Divine Providence draws between =
creation in general and mankind in particular is that of will and understan=
ding. All things were made FROM Divine Love, BY MEANS of the Divine Wisdom.=
 The interrelationship of these has been described above, and yet it exists=
 fully in the human mind.</p><p>DP 11: "All willing is of love, and has rel=
ation to good; and all knowing, perceiving, and thinking are of the underst=
anding, and have relation to truth. From this it is clear that to will has =
no reality, but to will this or that has reality."</p><p>Thus, the human mi=
nd is the arena in which the finite marriage of good and truth takes place.=
</p><p>DP 12: "There is a marriage in everything that a person wills and th=
inks, and in his consequent conclusions and purposes... For instance, when =
a person wills and thinks about being fed, clothed, having a dwelling place=
, conducting any business, performing any work, or engaging in social inter=
course, he first wills and thinks about these things, or forms his conclusi=
ons and purposes, simultaneously; but when he has reduced into effects what=
 he has willed and thought, the one follows after the other; nevertheless t=
hey continue to make one in his will and thought."</p><p>There is no area i=
n our lives where we are able to think without willing, or to will without =
thinking. It is possible to think about things that are distasteful, but in=
 order to entertain those thoughts, even if it is only out of curiosity, or=
 in order to judge them, there still has to be a willingness to entertain t=
hose thoughts.</p><p>In a similar way, willingness must express itself in t=
hought, for that is the only way that our inner feelings can come to our co=
nsciousness. Thus the two are as interconnected in us as love and wisdom in=
 the Lord, or as the heat and light of the spiritual sun. </p><p>THE AIM OF=
 THE DIVINE PROVIDENCE</p><p>All of creation then is from the Lord. However=
, creation must be sustained. The Lord must control it Himself. This contro=
lling process, or government, is the Divine Providence.</p><p>We are told i=
n Genesis</p><p>GEN 1:27: "So God created man in His own image; in the imag=
e of God He created him; male and female He created them."</p><p>This image=
 is implanted in all things of creation because all creation is from the Lo=
rd. The image of the Lord in a person relates to the a person's will, and t=
he likeness of the Lord is in our understanding. But the Lord is ONE, and t=
he Divine Love and Divine Wisdom, although intellectually distinct, are nev=
ertheless one in operation and in life. Thus mankind was created to reflect=
 this oneness from the Lord.</p><p>The difference between the Lord and us h=
owever, is that while Love and Wisdom are distinctly one, in humans the wil=
l and understanding are separated, divided from each other. In order to und=
erstand this, we must remember that while thought is always from the will, =
we have two wills, one from inherited evil, one from the remains, or states=
 of good and truth implanted in us by the Lord.</p><p>The aim of the Lord's=
 providence, however, is to provide a vessel which can receive His presence=
 and which, through a response to Him, be brought into a state of heaven. I=
n order to bring this about, the human mind needs to be one. Thus:</p><p>DP=
 16: "The Lord does not suffer that anything should be divided; therefore i=
t must be either in good and at the same time in truth, or in evil and at t=
he same time in falsity."</p><p>The Laws of Divine Providence all work towa=
rds the end of bringing a person into a union of good and in the will and t=
ruth in the understanding, although the Lord allows people the freedom to f=
orm a hellish marriage in their minds between evil and falsity.</p><p>DP 17=
: "After death, however, every one comes into one union or the other, becau=
se he can no longer be reformed or regenerated; he then remains such as his=
 life, that is, such as his ruling love has been in the world."</p><p>We ha=
ve to make this marriage in our minds, because good has no reality unless i=
t is conjoined to truth, nor truth unless it is conjoined with good. Thus n=
o matter how much we INTEND to do good, that good does not actually exist u=
ntil we do it. Our lives then create within us a reality of either good or =
evil.</p><p>DP 21: "From what has been said it maybe evident that the Divin=
e Providence of the Lord is continually operating to unite truth to good an=
d good to truth in a person, because this union is the Church, and is also =
heaven, for this union is in the Lord and in all things that proceed from H=
im. It is from this union that heaven is called a marriage, as also is the =
Church..."</p><p></p><p></p><div align=3D"Right">2</div><hr><p>

</p><p>
&nbsp;THE DIVINE PROVIDENCE</p><p>Lecture Two - The Aim of Creation</p><p>I=
NTRODUCTION</p><p>When the Lord created, He created for a specific reason: =
to create people who could respond to Him, who could receive His love and r=
eturn it to Himself. To understand this, we need to have an understanding o=
f the nature of the Lord's love. In the work, Divine Love and Wisdom, this =
love is called spiritual love, and is defined in the following way:</p><p>"=
... spiritual love is such that it wishes to give its own to another; and s=
o far as it can do this it is in its being (esse), in its peace, and in its=
 blessedness."</p><p>Thus in the Lord's love we see the elements of creatio=
n. His love is the essence of spiritual love: He wished to give of Himself =
to someone outside of Himself, to bring His peace and blessedness to the wh=
ole of creation. In TCR we read a similar passage:</p><p>"It is the essence=
 of love to love others outside of oneself, to desire to be one with them, =
and to render them blessed from oneself" (TCR 43). </p><p>The same concept =
it repeated in the Divine Love and Wisdom:</p><p>"It is the essential of lo=
ve not to love self, but to love others, and to be conjoined with others by=
 love. It is the essential of love, moreover, to be loved by others, for th=
us conjunction is effected" (DLW 47).</p><p>In these passages we are shown =
that the Lord's love, which is His esse or very being, strove to come out i=
nto action. The activity of love, which is truth, is the creative force wit=
hin the entire universe. But the lord's love needed an object that could re=
ceive it as if it were from a separate source. The Lord therefore created p=
eople to appear to be separated from Him. Thus in TCR 43, we are told that =
the essence of love is "to love others outside of oneself." But one only lo=
ves others outside of oneself if one can be conjoined with them and make th=
em happy from oneself.</p><p>Conjunction with the Lord, therefore, is the v=
ery essence of the whole creation:</p><p>"The essence of all love consists =
in conjunction; this, in fact, is its life, which is called enjoyment, plea=
santness, delight, sweetness, bliss, happiness and felicity. Love consists =
in this, that its own should be another's; to feel the joy of another as jo=
y in oneself, that is loving" (DLW 47).</p><p>This love then, is what cause=
d the Lord to create the human race. He created mankind to be vessels that =
could receive His love. But He also created them with freedom to reject His=
 love if they so choose.</p><p>For this reason He created mankind into His =
own image and likeness - able to love or not to love, according to their ow=
n choice. His aim, or end in creation was a state of conjunction with Himse=
lf, a heaven from the human race. In this chapter of Divine Providence, we =
are shown how the Lord brings that conjunction about.</p><p>These ideas may=
 initially sound strange to those who are not familiar with New Church doct=
rine. No other church believes that heaven is from the human race:</p><p>"I=
n the Christian world it is wholly unknown that heaven and hell are from th=
e human race..." (HH 311)</p><p>Most people believe that angels are a compl=
etely separate creation from ordinary people populate heaven. These angels =
are often seen as being between the Lord and people. Those who believe in a=
 separate creation of angels also believe that when we die we stay in our g=
raves until judgment day, whereupon we are resurrected and our earthly bodi=
es are restored. Those who are good continue to live on this earth forever.=
</p><p>But this belief springs from a false understanding of the Lord's pur=
pose for creation: The Lord created mankind specifically to become angels, =
so that we can be conjoined with Him and He with us. In DP we read:</p><p>"=
Both heaven and hell are from the human race - heaven from those who are in=
 the love and good and from this in the understanding of truth, and hell fr=
om those who are in the love of evil and from this in the understanding of =
falsity..." (DP 27)</p><p>In a later lecture we will see how the Lord allow=
s people to choose between good and evil. But at this moment it is enough t=
o say that the Lord:</p><p>"...did not create the universe for His own sake=
, but for the sake of those with whom He will be in heaven..." (DP 27)</p><=
p>The Writings stress that everyone who loves good and does it will go to h=
eaven. We are told that heaven consists of everyone from the beginning of t=
his earth who have lived well, and this number includes all the children wh=
o have died before they reach maturity (Cf. HH 415, 416).</p><p>DEFINITION =
OF HEAVEN</p><p>It is at this point that we begin to see something of the r=
eason for the Lord's creation. Compare the difference between two books of =
the Doctrine: in Heaven and Hell heaven is described in great detail. We ar=
e taught about the way angels live, what their homes, clothes, and so on ar=
e like. We are told about the sun of heaven, about the quarters in heaven, =
about kingdoms and societies.</p><p>But in Divine Providence heaven is port=
rayed in a completely different way, a way that deals with the essential in=
ner things of heaven rather than with the outer things. In this latter work=
 heaven is defined more as a state of being, from which one expects the des=
cription given in Heaven and Hell will flow.</p><p>There is a real importan=
ce to knowing both things about heaven: we need to know what to expect to h=
appen to us when we die. This expectation is often the prod that stirs us t=
o turn aside from evil and follow the path of regeneration. But in order to=
 follow that path, we have to have an understanding of what the inner relat=
ionship between the Lord and ourselves is like. In the Gospel the Lord says=
:</p><p>" ... the kingdom of heaven is within you" (Luke 17:21).</p><p>It i=
s this point that the book Divine Providence develops in this chapter the i=
dea that we are created by the Lord in order to populate His kingdom, not a=
 kingdom similar to an earthly country, but a kingdom which is based on our=
 relationship with the Lord Himself.</p><p>Because heaven is within us, it =
follows that we enter it through the life of regeneration in this world:</p=
><p>"Those who have heaven in them desire the good of all, and feel delight=
 in benefiting others, not for the sake of themselves and the world, but fo=
r the sake of the good, and for the sake of truth, which is to be done. But=
 those who have hell in them desire evil to all, and feel delight in doing =
evil to others. If these feel delight in benefiting others, it is not for t=
he sake of what is good and true, but for the sake of themselves and the wo=
rld" (AC 10718).</p><p>The chapter of Divine Providence under study here de=
als with heaven in terms of a person's conjunction with the Lord. The Oxfor=
d Dictionary defines "conjunction" as making a single one or whole out of t=
wo or more things. This concept is of central importance to understanding t=
he state of heaven within people, and from that understanding the goal or e=
nd of creation.</p><p>CONJUNCTION WITH THE LORD</p><p>Heaven, we are told i=
n Divine Providence, is heaven from the Lord:</p><p>"... for the love and w=
isdom in which the angels are and which constitute heaven are not from the =
angels, but from the Lord, and are, in fact, the Lord in them" (DP 28).</p>=
<p>This means that the Lord is heaven, and people are in heaven to the degr=
ee that they receive the Lord's love. This concept is taught in many places=
 in the Doctrines:</p><p>"The Divine of the Lord makes the heavens, and hea=
ven is with everyone according to his reception of love and of faith from t=
he Lord" (AC 10717). </p><p>"Nevertheless, regarded in themselves, the men =
themselves do not constitute the church, but the Lord in them; and so neith=
er do angels regarded in themselves constitute heaven, but the Lord in them=
. For the Lord does not dwell in anything of the person's or angel's own; b=
ut in His own with them; hence it is that when the church and heaven are sp=
oken of, the Divine of the Lord is meant with those who are there, from whi=
ch it is plain how it ought to be apprehended that the Lord is to all in al=
l of heaven and the church, and that the Lord Himself is heaven and the chu=
rch" (AC 10125). </p><p>"Be it known that whatever represented the Lord Him=
self (in the Word) also represented by heaven, for the Divine that proceeds=
 from the Lord, when received by the angels makes heaven. Thus in respect t=
o what is their own the angels themselves do not make heaven; but in respec=
t to the Divine which they receive from the Lord. That this is so can be se=
en from the fact that each one of them there acknowledges, believes, and al=
so perceives, that there is nothing of good from himself, but only from the=
 Lord; and that whatever is from him is not good... As this is so, it follo=
ws that it is the Divine of the Lord which maketh heavenly life with them, =
consequently heaven" (AC 10151). </p><p>In these and many other passages of=
 the Heavenly Doctrines, the teaching is affirmed that heaven consists of a=
 relationship between a person and the Lord. In this relationship a person =
recognizes, "acknowledges, believes and perceives" that of himself he is no=
thing and that the Lord is every thing. When a person comes into this state=
, he is completely open to the Lord's presence, and heaven is firmly establ=
ished within him.</p><p>In Divine Providence this relationship is defines a=
s a "conjunction" between the Lord and a person (DP 28). The conjunction co=
mes about as the person puts aside the evils of his own proprium and learns=
 the love and wisdom of the Lord.</p><p>"The angels themselves confess that=
 they live from the Lord; hence it may be evident that heaven is conjunctio=
n with the Lord" (DP 28).</p><p>Conjunction, therefore, is a relationship i=
n which the person receives love and faith from the Lord and returns it. Th=
is return is called "reciprocation", and therefore in order for conjunction=
 to be effective, a person must reciprocate the Lord's presence:</p><p>"...=
all conjunction need reciprocity, whereby there is a consent on both sides"=
 (AC 6047).</p><p>In Divine Providence 28 we are given a model of reciproca=
l conjunction in terms of love conjoining itself to wisdom by means of and =
affection for knowing. When a person wants to know, then that desire is joi=
ned with an affection for truth, for what is the point of knowing anything =
if it is not the truth? The person who has this desire, then, to know the t=
ruth, acts upon that desire, and searches for an understanding of the truth=
. The more he knows, the more he wants to understand, and the more he is ab=
le to gain a perception of the truth itself. This perception, or the abilit=
y to see the truth in the things learned, feeds the affection to the point =
where he learns the truth, which then becomes a part of his way of thinking=
 - in essence it becomes a part of himself, and he is changed by the experi=
ence. But remember that both the affection and the truth come from the Lord=
. Thus the person's affection for truth is actually an affection stimulated=
 by the Lord, it is the Lord's presence in a person. Similarly, the underst=
anding and perception of truth is also the Lord's presence in a person. Thu=
s it seems as if it is we who conjoin ourselves to the Lord, but this is on=
ly an appearance of truth. The reality is that:</p><p>"... it is in fact th=
e Lord who conjoins them to Himself by wisdom" (DP 28).</p><p>In the AC 604=
7 we are given an outline of how people are led by affection from truth to =
a perception of that truth, and wishes to be conjoined to the Lord:</p><p>"=
First there must be learned the doctrinal things of the church, and then th=
e Word must be examined to see whether these are true; for they are not tru=
e because the heads of the church have said so and their followers confirm =
it ... When this is done from the affection of truth, then the person is en=
lightened by the Lord so as to perceive, without knowing whence, what is tr=
ue; and he confirmed therein in accordance with the good in which he is..."=
 (AC 6047)</p><p>Thus the Lord, according to a set principle forms heaven w=
ithin us. We feel, in this world as if we are the originators of this conju=
nction, as if we turn to the Lord and He responds to us. This, however, is =
an illusion, for the Lord is constantly, and by every means at His disposal=
, drawing us to Himself, and our proper response is to respond affirmativel=
y to His drawing.</p><p>"From this it is clear that the reciprocal conjunct=
ion of angels with the Lord is not from the angels, but only seems to be fr=
om them. Such also is the conjunction of the Lord with the Church..." (DP 2=
8e) </p><p>Conjunction of angels and men with the Lord, then is the vital c=
omponent of heaven. Without a reciprocal conjunction, there would be no hea=
ven and no church. It follows from this that the whole of heaven is created=
 in such a way to preserve and enhance that conjunction, so that the angels=
 of heaven, who are continually being perfected, are, in that perfection, r=
eceiving the Divine Love and wisdom more and more, and in turn reflecting i=
t more in their own lives.</p><p>To explain how people in heaven are contin=
ually perfected, the book Divine Providence concentrates on two things: the=
 way in which this conjunction is communicated between the Lord and the ang=
els, and secondly, how the angels themselves are perfected.</p><p>CONJUNCTI=
ON IN THE SPIRITUAL WORLD</p><p>Divine Providence introduces the concept of=
 how conjunction is attained in the Spiritual World in the following passag=
e. It is important because it gives us an insight into the mechanics of the=
 Spiritual World:</p><p>"All conjunction in the spiritual world is effected=
 by means of looking. When anyone there is thinking of another from a desir=
e to speak with him, the other immediately becomes present, and they see ea=
ch other face to face" (DP 29).</p><p>This system of communicating is commo=
n in heaven:</p><p>"For it is a common occurrence in heaven for persons to =
appear to be present in a place where their look is fixed or terminated, ev=
en when this place is far away from where they really are. This presence is=
 called the presence of the internal sight..." (HH 121)</p><p>In the spirit=
ual world angels and spirits are able to communicate their thoughts and fee=
lings in this way. To some degree we do this in this world as well: we pict=
ure the qualities and even the appearance of a person about whom we are thi=
nking, or we look intently at a person with whom we are speaking. It is har=
d to speak to a person who doesn't look one in the eye. So we also rely to =
some degree on communication by look. But we are considerably limited compa=
red to spiritual communication.</p><p>When the Lord communicates with spiri=
ts He fixes "His look" upon them. Thus He focuses His Love and Wisdom on th=
at particular individual. This is really an appearance, for the Lord's love=
 and wisdom is constant for all people, just as the sun sends its light and=
 heat consistently on all people. But the reality is that the Lord communic=
ates with those people who are willing to receive His presence. For those p=
eople it is as if they had turned themselves to the Lord, and opened their =
minds to Him. When this happens, it seems as though the Lord is more closel=
y present.</p><p>"For all angels turn their face towards the Lord, and the =
Lord looks upon their forehead, because the forehead corresponds to love...=
 while angels direct their eyes towards the Lord, because eyes correspond t=
o wisdom and its perception" (DP 29). </p><p>Thus conjunction between angel=
s and the Lord is a matter of sharing love and wisdom, or, in other words, =
of the angels receiving the Lord's love and returning it to Him, making the=
 union between Him and them reciprocal. This relationship of reciprocity wa=
s designed by the Lord to bring joy and peace to the individual angel as th=
ey receive His presence.</p><p>PEOPLE ARE CREATED TO BE MORE AND MORE CONJO=
INED WITH THE LORD (DP 32).</p><p>One of the most wonderful teachings in th=
e Doctrines is that this relationship between the Lord and a person, create=
d by the Lord for our benefit is continuing and leads to a closer and close=
r relationship with the Lord. The bond of love is never static, the human b=
eing, both in this world and in the next, is in a continual process of perf=
ection by the Lord. </p><p>The means by which this perfection takes place l=
ies in the structure of the mind. As modern psychologists can tell us, the =
human mind is a wonderfully complex thing, and they are only dealing with t=
he last degree of our minds. </p><p>The Writings describe the mind in terms=
 of heaven. This description is important, because heaven really exists wit=
hin our minds. Remember the Lord's words: "the kingdom of heaven is within =
you." Thus heaven is formed within our minds, within the things we love and=
 think, within our thoughts and intentions. From this it follows that our m=
inds are an image of heaven:</p><p>"The interiors of a person, which belong=
 to his mind and disposition, are also in like order (i.e. the order of the=
 three heavens see HH 29). He has an inmost, a middle, and an outmost part;=
 for when a person was created all things of Divine order were brought toge=
ther in him, that he became Divine order in form, and consequently a heaven=
 in miniature" (HH 30).</p><p>A footnote to the above-quoted passage gives =
a list of other passages in the Arcana Coelestia which elaborate on the tea=
ching that as to our minds we are miniature heavens, see this footnote as i=
t is important.</p><p>This concept of our minds as miniature heavens is imp=
ortant. When the Lord created mankind, He created us in such a way that onc=
e we begin the process of being conjoined with Him, we continue in that pro=
cess to eternity. There is no point at which we can say "I am perfect."</p>=
<p>To explain how we are conjoined to the Lord in an ever-increasing percep=
tion, Divine Providence explains that the mind is created in three discrete=
 degrees corresponding with the degrees of heaven.</p><p>Students are direc=
ted to the work of Divine Love and Wisdom #173 to 281 for an important expl=
anation of the concept of degrees. As this information is too long to be in=
cluded in these notes, we simply outline the basics concerning them:</p><p>=
"The things which follow cannot be comprehended unless it be known that the=
re are degrees, also what they are, and what their nature is, because in ev=
ery created thing, thus in every form there are degrees" (DLW 179).</p><p>"=
A knowledge of degrees is like a key to lay open the causes of things, and =
to give entrance into them. Without this knowledge, scarcely anything of ca=
use can be known; for without it the objects of both worlds seem to have bu=
t a single meaning, as if there were nothing in them beyond that which meet=
s the eye; when yet compared to the things which lie hidden within, what is=
 thus seen is as one to thousands, yea, to tens of thousands" (DLW 184). </=
p><p>This point is especially true in the subject under discussion here: DP=
 32, points out that the way people are conjoined to the Lord forever is by=
 means of the degrees of the mind. We have to understand how these degrees =
are going to function if we are to have any idea of how the Lord creates th=
e reciprocal relationship within us. It needs to be clearly understood that=
 there are two different kinds of degrees:</p><p>"'Continuous' degrees is a=
 term applied to the gradual lessening or decreasing from grosser to finer,=
 or from denser to rarer; or rather, to growths and increasing from finer t=
o grosser, or from rarer to denser; precisely like the graduations of light=
 to shade, or of heat to cold" (DLW 184).</p><p>Thus a continuous degree wo=
uld be the variation from cold to hot, or the change in light from brillian=
t afternoon sun to evening twilight. The main point of continuous degrees i=
s that the subject under discussion does not change but varies.</p><p>The c=
ase is quite different with discrete degrees:</p><p>"But discrete degrees a=
re called discrete because the prior is by itself, the subsequent by itself=
; and the final end by itself; and yet taken together they make a one" (DLW=
 184).</p><p>One way to describe discrete degrees is to describe the change=
 in feeling to a thought to an action. Say, for example a person has a desi=
re for something. The feeling or desire exists within itself. But, in order=
 to come into being, the desire is clothed in thought, so a person thinks a=
bout the feeling. Note here, however, that feeling becomes thought, the two=
 are actually one, even though they are distinct. Then, when the thought is=
 acted on, and becomes a spoken or written word, then both the feeling and =
the thought are present in the word, but the word is nevertheless separated=
 from them.</p><p>This concept is important in New Church doctrine, because=
, as we have seen above, everything has three degrees of height (or discret=
e degrees within them).</p><p>When the Lord created people, He created them=
 with the intention that they should, by being conjoined with Him, become a=
ngels of heaven. In order to conjoin people to Himself, He made their minds=
 able to receive His presence at the level of life they choose, and then to=
 continue to receive it more and more perfectly at that level. Thus in DP 3=
2 we read:</p><p>"These degrees are in every one from birth, and as they ar=
e opened, the person is in the Lord and the Lord is in him."</p><p>The same=
 passage then goes on to describe how these degrees are opened in us. Study=
 this passage carefully, and note the following:-</p><p>1. When a person is=
 born he or she is born into the first (or outer) degree. This is the level=
 of our consciousness in this world. Other places in the Writings describe =
this degree of the mind as having three levels: the level which receives da=
ta from the senses, the level which creates images from these sensual thing=
s, and finally the rational level, which judges the "goodness" or "badness"=
 of the lower levels. Ideally the rational is formed from the truths a pers=
on has learned from the Lord.</p><p>We live in this degree while we are ali=
ve in this world, and while it is possible for us to come stuck at either o=
f the two lower levels, it is ideal for us to become rational. Thus DP 32 s=
tates that people may "increase this degree in himself by continuous proces=
s until he becomes rational." (The mind and its degrees are studied more fu=
lly in the third year under the subject of the mind.)</p><p>2. Even though =
we live in the natural degree of the mind in this world, we are not designe=
d to live at that level to eternity. The natural level, being tied as it is=
 to sensual data from the world around us really only forms a foundation fo=
r the higher, more spiritual degrees of our minds, which are opened after d=
eath. A person comes into the second degree after death "if he lives accord=
ing to the spiritual laws of order which are the principles of Divine Truth=
" (DP 32).</p><p>In a similar way, the person comes into the third degree, =
also after death, "if he lives according to the celestial laws of order, wh=
ich are principles of Divine good" (DP 32).</p><p>Thus we see the way in wh=
ich our mind reflects heaven, and is opened according to the order of heave=
n; inmost is a celestial degree, related to the Lord's Divine love and whic=
h is opened after death if we live in accordance with His laws of love, the=
 primary of which is to love the Lord Himself. Notice how this love is in a=
greement with the first of the great commandments:</p><p>"You shall love th=
e Lord your God with all your heart..."</p><p>The celestial degree, however=
, is quite different from the spiritual, which reflects the laws of the Lor=
d's Wisdom. Central to these laws is the second great commandment:</p><p>"Y=
ou shall love your neighbor as yourself."</p><p>On these two laws, the Lord=
 says, hang all the Laws and the Prophets, and so also hang our entire spir=
itual life. They are present in all people, but are not active until by our=
 life in this world we make them so. These degrees are opened according to =
a person's life in this world, and are perfected in heaven:</p><p>"As they =
are open and afterwards perfected, a person is more and more nearly conjoin=
ed to the Lord" (DP 32).</p><p>Our state of conjunction with the Lord, and =
consequently the state of heaven within us is determined by how opened thes=
e two levels are in us. While we are in this world, and are concerned with =
the matter of daily survival, we are not conscious of these two inner degre=
es,</p><p>"... because it is an earthly body, and in that body its spiritua=
l mind thinks naturally. But it is otherwise when the mind is loosed from t=
he bonds of that body; then it no longer thinks naturally, but spiritually.=
.." (HH 314)</p><p>Our mind, then, is especially designed for the increase =
of our conjunction with the Lord. While we live in this world, if we seek t=
he Lord, and try to live our lives according to the teachings He gives us, =
and to shun evil as sins against us, so He is able to open our inner degree=
s. As these degrees are opened, unconsciously in this world, consciously in=
 the next, the Lord then "fixes His look" on us, and we, because our life i=
s in agreement with His receive that look, and the bond is established.</p>=
<p>It is important to note at this point, that conjunction with the Lord ta=
kes place on a deeper plane than that of simple knowledge. Conjunction real=
ly takes place on the plane of charity, rather than that of faith. We can s=
ee this from experience: it doesn't matter what we know about ANY subject, =
but what we do with that knowledge. The same is true with spiritual matters=
 as well.</p><p>Thus we are told:</p><p>"A person is more and more nearly c=
onjoined to the Lord, not by knowledge alone, nor by intelligence alone, no=
r even by wisdom alone, but by a life conjoined to these" (DP 33).</p><p>Th=
e life of knowledge, intelligence and wisdom does not conjoin a person to t=
he Lord because these things belong to the understanding, which can be led =
either by hereditary evil or by the new will. Thus a person can be in great=
 knowledge, intelligence and even in wisdom without actually being regenera=
te at all (see DP 222). The spiritually determining part of a person's life=
, therefore, is his will, which receives the Lord's life and transmits that=
 to the understanding. This will must be purified of evil.</p><p>"Hence it =
is evident that so far as one shuns evils of the devil and as obstacles to =
the Lord's entrance, he is more and more nearly conjoined to the Lord..." (=
DP 33)</p><p>This same passage, DP 33 continues to state that:</p><p>"The m=
ore fully evils in the natural man are removed by shunning and turning away=
 from them, the more nearly is the person conjoined to the Lord."</p><p>In =
the activity of shunning evils as sins against the Lord, one sees a person'=
s side of the reciprocal conjunction with the Lord. Consider that the Lord,=
 by means of remains, the Word and His presence inspires us in this world t=
o shun evil. We respond to this by actually turning away from evil, thus in=
 essence we receive the Lord's presence into our lives. In this world this =
process takes place on the natural or conscious degree, and we are perfecte=
d in that degree by becoming increasingly rational. After death we are then=
 led into consciousness of one of the two levels, in which we are then perf=
ected to eternity. Thus the Lords end, which is a heaven from the human rac=
e finds its fulfillment. </p><p>"THE MORE NEARLY A PERSON IS CONJOINED TO T=
HE LORD, THE WISER HE BECOMES" (DP 34).</p><p>The result of this closer con=
junction with the Lord is an increased state of perfection. As the degrees =
of the mind are opened, so the person becomes wiser. A person's wisdom, the=
refore, is proportional to the level of his mind opened by regeneration:</p=
><p>"There are three degrees of wisdom, the natural, the spiritual and the =
celestial. A person is in the natural degree of wisdom while he lives in th=
is world" (DP 34:2).</p><p>The concept of discrete degrees discussed in DLW=
 179 - 281 is that one degree does not BECOME the next degree by perfection=
. They remain forever separate, and yet in their perfection refer more and =
more closely to each other. Consider an analogy of a person who has a wonde=
rful vocabulary to describe his thoughts - his words may give a picture of =
the thoughts and feelings he has, but they remain forever a description, th=
ey never become the thoughts and feelings themselves.</p><p>This principle =
holds true for the structure of the mind and the way in which it is conjoin=
ed to the Lord. We are told that the natural degree of the mind can be open=
ed and developed during our life in this world, but it does not BECOME the =
spiritual degree:</p><p>"...because the spiritual degree is not an extensio=
n of the natural degree by continuity, but is conjoined to it by correspond=
ences..." (DP 34:2)</p><p>It follows, therefore, that a person enters the c=
elestial or spiritual degree after death (DP 34:2). Thus wisdom is a result=
 not of an accumulation of knowledge, but of the light and heat of the high=
er degrees upon those knowledge. As a person is regenerated so these higher=
 degrees imperceptibly affect his knowledge, and he becomes wise:</p><p>"Bu=
t let no one believe that a person has wisdom because he knows many things,=
 and perceives them in a certain light, and can talk about them intelligent=
ly, unless that wisdom is conjoined with love" (DP 35). </p><p>In other wor=
ds, wisdom is the interplay of knowledge and love. The Writings use this co=
ncept in many places, for example, faith must be conjoined with charity in =
order to be real. Wisdom, then, is the result of a person's receiving the L=
ord's presence in life, actually in the activity of life. The more closely =
a person is conjoined with the Lord, the more the Lord stirs his love, and =
the more he or she is able to perceive the things of knowledge in the prese=
nce of that love:</p><p>"The wisdom that comes to perception is a perceptio=
n of truth from an affection for it, especially a perception of spiritual t=
ruth" (DP 36).</p><p>The person who is being regenerated and who is thus en=
tering into the sphere of the Lord sees truths as they pertain to life: thi=
s is the perception he has from the affection for truth.</p><p>"THE MORE NE=
ARLY A PERSON IS CONJOINED TO THE LORD, THE HAPPIER HE BECOMES" (DP 37)</p>=
<p>Conjunction with the Lord bringing wisdom, brings with it also happiness=
. These two go together, one affecting the understanding of a person, the o=
ther his will, or affection. Happiness is a result of conjunction with the =
Lord because as a person is regenerated so his mind is opened and receives =
the Lord's presence.</p><p>"For happiness, or states of blessedness and joy=
, become more and more exalted as the higher degrees of the mind, which are=
 called spiritual and celestial, are opened in a person, and after his life=
 in this world, these degrees continue to develop to eternity" (DP 37).</p>=
<p>In one sense happiness is the ultimate goal of all creation: if the Lord=
 created mankind in order to populate His heavens, it follows that He creat=
ed mankind in order to be happy. Heaven is, by definition, a state of happi=
ness, blessedness and peace. In TCR 43 the essence of the Lord's love is de=
scribed as to render creation blessed from Himself, and this state of happi=
ness exists in heaven.</p><p>As people are more and more closely conjoined =
to the Lord, so their sense of happiness increases:</p><p>"For happiness, o=
r states of blessedness and joy, become more exalted as the higher degrees =
the mind, which are called the spiritual and celestial, are opened in a per=
son, and after his life in this world, these degrees continue to develop to=
 eternity" (DP 37).</p><p>A person comes into true happiness as the delight=
 of evil is removed. People in evil loves are happy, but their happiness is=
 not heavenly. In fact, it is a form of misery which evil spirits define as=
 happiness.</p><p>All happiness is from love (DP 38), but only truly heaven=
ly loves produce true happiness. There is a vast difference between these t=
wo kinds of happinesses, but notice the following passage:</p><p>"The delig=
hts of the lusts of evil and the delights of the affection of good cannot b=
e compared" (DP 40).</p><p>The truth of this statement is obvious in these =
two examples from the Writings:</p><p>"...heavenly love is such that it wis=
hes what is its own to be another's; consequently no one in heaven perceive=
s his own good in himself to be good unless it is also in another; and this=
 is the source of happiness in heaven" (HH 268).</p><p>Swedenborg once aske=
d evil spirits what their delight was. They replied:</p><p>"... it is the d=
elight of committing adultery, stealing, defrauding and telling lies. Again=
, I asked, what are these delights like? They replied, they are perceived b=
y others as offensive odors from excrement, and as the putrid smell from de=
ad bodies, and as the reeking stench from stagnant urine pools..." (DP 340 =
supp)</p><p>By comparing just these two passages, and there are many, many =
more in the Writings which even more graphically point out the difference b=
etween heaven and hell, we are shown that happiness and delight comes from =
love. That which a person loves will be delightful to him. For this reason,=
 heaven, which is loved by the angels there is most delightful to them. Evi=
l spirits perceive a delight in their evil loves, but that delight is not t=
rue delight, for it inward oriented, looking away from the Lord who is the =
true source of all happiness. Thus we are told that:</p><p>"... the more ne=
arly anyone is conjoined to the Lord, the happier he becomes..." (DP 41)</p=
><p>It is pointed out in DP 41 that this heavenly happiness is "rarely mani=
fested" in the world, but becomes so when a person passes into the next wor=
ld. For more information on this subject read HH 395 to 414 on the subject =
of Heavenly Joy and happiness.</p><p>FREEDOM </p><p>Because the Lord create=
d people in order to populate His heavens, and in order that this goal may =
be realized, He created us with a mind in the heavenly form with the abilit=
y to increase in wisdom and happiness, it follows that He also created peop=
le to be free. Human freedom in spiritual matters is the pivot upon which o=
ur entire conjunction with the Lord is built. As this course progresses, we=
 will spend a great deal of time discussing the issue of freedom. At the mo=
ment, however, it is sufficient to point out that there are two kinds of fr=
eedom:</p><p>1. Heavenly freedom, which is our freedom to choose to follow =
the Lord and be conjoined with Him. It is the exercise of this freedom whic=
h leads us into conjunction with the Lord, and so into wisdom and happiness=
.</p><p>2. Opposite to this heavenly freedom is our freedom to choose the e=
vil and selfish things to which we incline from hereditary. This freedom is=
 that of hell, and ultimately leads us away from the Lord, away from happin=
ess and away from wisdom. </p><p>During a life of regeneration, which ultim=
ately leads one into conjunction with the Lord, people act from heavenly fr=
eedom. The more closely a person is conjoined to the Lord, the "more distin=
ctly does appear to be the master of himself" (DP 42).</p><p>When we act in=
 freedom, our life seems to be our own. When however, we are in the throws =
of temptation, this life is threatened by the sense of delight in evil infu=
sed into us by hell. In temptation we are not sure quite who we are: are we=
 really good or really evil. But, as the temptation passes, we come into a =
clearer idea of our spiritual identity. The Writings teach that as we give =
ourselves over to the Lord, and internalize His teachings, so we feel more =
and more that we are in control of our own lives, and yet we acknowledge mo=
re and more that the Lord is in control. The reason for this is that as we =
give our lives to the Lord, the evil spirits around us loose their influenc=
e on us, and we are freer to do the good things we want to do without the t=
emptation to turn away from them. Thus our lives seem to be more and more c=
ompletely our own. </p><p>To evil spirits this seems to be impossible. To t=
hem the idea of submission to the Lord is not one of gaining freedom to do =
good, but of loosing the freedom to do evil. Thus they see heavenly freedom=
 as bondage. DP 43 gives us an interesting insight into their concept of fr=
eedom and bondage:</p><p>"Moreover, it cannot be denied that to be led by g=
ood is freedom, and to be led by evil is slavery; for to be led by good is =
to be led by the Lord, and to be led by evil is to be led by the devil." </=
p><p>Thus a person is in freedom and in happiness of life resulting from li=
ving according to freedom. But true happiness is the result of being conjoi=
ned to the Lord. In this conjunction the Lord gives more and more freedom, =
and the person sees himself as being more and more the master of his life: =
he is doing what he wants to do, that is: to follow the Lord.</p><p>It is i=
mportant to know that the Lord never forces anyone, for He leaves each pers=
on in total freedom to choose good or evil:</p><p>"... the Lord never force=
s anyone, for nothing to which anyone is forced appears as his own, and wha=
t does not appear to be his own cannot be his love's and so be appropriated=
 to him as his own. Therefore a person is led by the Lord continually in fr=
eedom, and is also reformed and regenerated in freedom" (DP 43).</p><p>CONC=
LUSION </p><p>From this chapter, then, we are able to see that the Lord cre=
ated the human race for the sake of heaven, thus so that He can bring peopl=
e into heaven where He can make them happy. By doing this He satisfies the =
essence of His love. In order to achieve His goal He created us to operate =
as if we were separate from Him:</p><p>1. He created us so that heaven coul=
d be formed within us by creating our minds according to the structure of h=
eaven (see DP 34-36).</p><p>2. He created us so that as heaven is formed wi=
thin us, we become wiser and happier, and in a greater state of spiritual f=
reedom. This comes about because as we come into a conjunction with Him by =
shunning evils and being regenerated, our minds are reformed, and the evils=
, which infest us and cause misery, are separated from us. </p><p>3. By com=
ing into the state of heaven we fulfill the essence of the Lord's love, whi=
ch is: "to love others outside of oneself, to wish to be one with them, and=
 to render them blessed from oneself" (TCR 43.) This is fulfilled because w=
hen we are in heaven, we are to all extents and appearances "outside of the=
 Lord", and yet because we receive His presence in a reciprocal conjunction=
 we are one with Him, and thus by virtue of this conjunction receive His lo=
ve and blessedness. </p><p>"Finally (Providence) has for its end that a per=
son should appear more distinctly to himself to be master of himself, and y=
et to recognize more clearly that he is the Lord's" (DP 45).</p><p>Thus thi=
s chapter of the Book Divine Providence closes. If one regards this book as=
 a kind of Divine constitution outlining the Lord's government of the human=
 race, this chapter is a sort of prologue, or introduction to that constitu=
tion. It sets out the reason for creation, as well as the goal the Lord has=
 in mind for each one of us. Subsequent chapters describe in detail how thi=
s goal is achieved.</p><p></p><p></p><div align=3D"Right">3</div><hr><p>

&nbsp;Lecture Three - The Lord Regards the Eternal.</p><p>INTRODUCTION</p><=
p>By way of introducing this lecture, answer the following questions: (circ=
le the answer)</p><p>1.&nbsp;You are overweight and need to go on a diet. W=
hen confronted with a piece of chocolate, do you choose to abandon your die=
t, and eat the chocolate, or reject the chocolate? </p><p>Eat the chocolate=
&nbsp;- stick to diet</p><p>2.&nbsp;You want to go on holiday, but are face=
d with the choice of saving for the holiday or buying a new pair of shoes t=
hat you want but do not need. Do you buy the shoes or save the money?</p><p=
>But the shoes - save the money</p><p>3.&nbsp;You have just left school. Yo=
u could go to university, or get a job, a car and new clothes. Which do you=
 choose?</p><p>Go to university - get the job</p><p>4.&nbsp;Your child want=
s to watch a television show that you think is unsuitable. You inform the c=
hild he/she cannot watch. The child throws a tantrum. Do you give in to the=
 child or stick to your guns?</p><p>Give in to child - stick to guns</p><p>=
5.&nbsp;You are happily married. Lately a person at work has been showing s=
exual interest in you. Part of you thinks an affair would be fun. Do you gi=
ve in to the affair, or resist it?</p><p>Resist the affair - Give in</p><p>=
One of life's great problems is the problem of choosing something that has =
immediate results over things that have long term results. Psychologists ca=
ll this the problem of "immediate gratification" and its opposite, "delayed=
 gratification".1 </p><p>1. These terms are difficult to translate directly=
 into Zulu. It seems that the closest we can come to (with thanks to Rev. L=
ucky Thabede) is the following:</p><p>Immediate gratification =3D ukugculis=
eka manjalo</p><p>Delayed gratification =3D ukugculiseka okugodliwe</p><p>W=
hen we have to choose between two things, we often tend to choose the thing=
 that will please us at the moment. In a choice we have to give up things t=
hat will give us more pleasure, but they are things we will have to wait fo=
r. A student who watches television rather than doing homework gets the imm=
ediate gratification of television, but not the long-term happiness of pass=
ing school. On the other hand, the student who foregoes the TV and does the=
 homework loses the momentary pleasure of that particular show, but gets fa=
r more, and lasting, pleasure later when the subject is passed with distinc=
tion.</p><p>Gratification is an important part of our lives, yet all too of=
ten we give in to the immediate pleasure without thinking about the long te=
rm effects this pleasure will have on us - often they are negative. The old=
 saying, "the best things in life are worth waiting for" has a good deal of=
 truth in it.</p><p>The issue of immediate and delayed gratification is als=
o vitally important to our spiritual life as well. All too often the deligh=
ts of immediate gratification are incompatible with good. Think of some of =
the things we do on the spur of the moment that are harmful to our spiritua=
l lives: anger, adultery, and theft, murder. All those things, and others, =
feel good at the time. But in the long run they ruin our lives. On the othe=
r hand, spiritual happiness is a result of things done: self-discipline, re=
pentance, trust and faith. All these are things we have to "wait" for.</p><=
p>As we make choices, whether for immediate or delayed gratification, we fe=
ed loves within us. Thus every choice has an impact on our lives, no matter=
 how small the choice seems to be. Consider the following teachings from th=
e Doctrines:</p><p>AC 3854: "... every smallest moment of a person's life i=
nvolves a series of consequences extending to eternity, each moment being a=
s a new beginning to those which follow; and so with all and each of the mo=
ments of his life, both of his understanding and of his will. And as the Lo=
rd foresaw from eternity what would be the person's quality, and what it wo=
uld be to eternity, it is evident that His providence is in the veriest sin=
gulars, and as before said governs and bends the person to such a quality; =
and this by a continual moderating of his freedom."</p><p>And also in the f=
ollowing passage:</p><p>AC 6490: "Unless the Lord's Providence was in the v=
eriest singulars, it would be impossible for a person to be saved, or indee=
d to live, for life is from the Lord, and all the moments of life have a se=
ries of consequences to eternity."</p><p>This means that every choice we ma=
ke has an eternal effect on our lives. Why, then, are we given the ability =
to choose? This is a question we will return to in a later lecture. But it =
is an important one. We are given choice because that is how the Lord leads=
 us to heaven.</p><p>Obviously the types of choices we make will influence =
whether we finally go to heaven or hell. These, however, are not a reward o=
r a punishment, but rather the fruit of our life in this world.</p><p>Our e=
ventual position in heaven or hell is not the result of a single choice, bu=
t of a series of choices made during the course of our lives.</p><p>Making =
choices influences the whole of our lives, and this needs to be kept in min=
d when we are thinking of immediate or delayed gratification. If we always =
give in to the pleasures of the here and now, we run the danger of never ha=
ving the pleasures of heaven. The reason lies in the nature of pleasure.</p=
><p>THE DIVINE PROVIDENCE ONLY REGARDS ETERNITY</p><p>Because our life is m=
ade up of a series of choices between things that feel good and those that =
we ought to do, it follows that when the Lord leads us in His providence, H=
e continually leads us to eternity. Consider the following:</p><p>The Divin=
e Providence of the Lord, in everything that it does, regards the infinite =
and the eternal (DP 46 - heading).</p><p>We have already seen that the Divi=
ne Providence is continually present in each and every detail of our lives,=
 including the choices we make, and the things that happen to us. But His p=
resence regards eternity.</p><p>How does one define "eternity"? The Oxford =
Dictionary says:</p><p>eternal: that always has existed and will exist.</p>=
<p>Most of our definitions of eternity will include some idea of time and s=
pace. Perhaps the most common definition for eternity is "forever" or "alwa=
ys".</p><p>But another way of looking at eternity is to remove the concept =
of time and space, for "these cannot but limit ideas and cause abstract ide=
as to be as nothing" (DP 46). If we take time out of eternity we are given =
and different idea: that of BEING, or REALITY. Think of the origin of etern=
ity: it comes from the Lord, for He is eternal, He "is and was and is to co=
me", not in a sense of time, but in the sense that His Being (i.e. the Divi=
ne Esse) is constant. </p><p>Hence it may also be comprehended that a perso=
n has reality because he was created by the Infinite God who is the ALL; an=
d that he is a finite substance because he was created by the Infinite God =
who is Substance itself; and further that he is wisdom because the was crea=
ted by the Infinite God who is wisdom itself, and so on" (DP 46).</p><p>The=
 eternity of a person, then, is not a matter of time, but rather a matter o=
f being. Because we are created into the image and likeness of God, we have=
 His attributes in a finite manner. This means that our life, once it has b=
een created, is constant, it cannot be "unmade" or destroyed.</p><p>From th=
is it follows that every created thing, and especially a person, and the lo=
ve and wisdom in him, have reality and are not merely ideas of being. For u=
nless God were infinite there would be no finite; and unless the Infinite w=
ere the All there would be no reality; and unless God had created all thing=
s from Himself there would be nothing. In a word, We are because God is (DP=
 46e).</p><p>This is the eternity that the Lord regards within us. In a sen=
se, He regards those things in us that are from Him (as we shall see later.=
)</p><p>Our eternal life, then is a reflection of the Lord's infinity. In o=
rder to understand this subject further, the rest of the chapter is divided=
 into five subsections, each developing this concept further.</p><p>POINT O=
NE: The Infinite in Itself and the Eternal in Itself are the same as the Di=
vine (DP 48).</p><p>We cannot separate the concept of infinity and eternity=
 from the Lord. When we think of the Lord as Divine Being (Esse) and Divine=
 Manifestation (Existere), we cannot but think of them as having no boundar=
ies, of time, space, or reality. God is God is God. He is the All in all th=
ings. But the way we understand His nature is described in terms of infinit=
y and eternity:</p><p>"...the angels understand by the Infinite nothing els=
e than the Divine Being (Esse) and by the Eternal the Divine Existing (Exis=
tere)" (DP 48).</p><p>Another way of looking at this, is to consider it in =
terms of love and wisdom, or good and truth:</p><p>INFINITY&nbsp;ETERNITY</=
p><p>Esse&nbsp;Existere</p><p>Being&nbsp;Existing (Manifesting)</p><p>Love&=
nbsp;Wisdom</p><p>Good&nbsp;Truth</p><p>The book points out that when we co=
nfuse infinity and eternity with time and space, we limit the idea. Time an=
d space are in creation, while infinity and eternity are from God alone. Un=
less we raise our eyes from natural things, we will not be able to comprehe=
nd this matter:</p><p>It can be seen by hose who think of the Infinite not =
from space and of the Eternal not from time; but it cannot be seen by those=
 who think of the Infinite from the Eternal from space and time. Thus it ca=
n be seen by those who think on a higher, that is, more interior plane in t=
he rational (mind); but it cannot be seen by those who think on a lower, th=
at is, more exterior plane.</p><p>Thus in this first section of this chapte=
r, we are given an insight into the nature of Infinity and Eternity of the =
Lord, which is of great importance, because that is what His providence reg=
ards in us. In DP 50 we are shown that spirits and angels think apart from =
time and space. Thus as soon as we leave this world, we leave the limitatio=
ns of this world, and come into the freedom of the spiritual world, where t=
ime and space are no longer factors.</p><p>The fact that we cannot think of=
 the Infinite and Eternal in terms of time and space has ramifications for =
our lives in this world. We are surely to model our lives upon, and make de=
cisions based upon the fact that the things we do affect our being. Time an=
d space should be of no consideration. Thus when faced with the decision be=
tween immediate and delayed gratification, our question should not be "what=
 does this do for me now," but rather "how does this decision affect my ver=
y being, which will have consequences to eternity?" </p><p>Thus we are lead=
 into a consideration of the second point:</p><p>POINT TWO: The Infinite an=
d Eternal in Itself cannot but regard what is Infinite [and Eternal] from i=
tself in finite things (DP 52).</p><p>We only enter heaven if we have heave=
n within us. Consider the following passage:</p><p>DP 53: "The Divine canno=
t regard anything but what is Divine, and it cannot regard this anywhere bu=
t in things created by itself. That is this so is evident from this fact, t=
hat no one can regard another from what is his own."</p><p>When we look at =
things, and have to make a choice about them, our choice is based either on=
 things we love, or things we don't love. If we love heaven, then our choic=
es will be determined by whether we want to go to heaven or not, and so we =
will shun evils that draw us away from heaven. If we love hell, we will all=
ow hell to influence our decisions.</p><p>The Lord loves each one of us, bu=
t He can only love things within us that are a reflection of His Divinity. =
Thus He cannot love hell in us. All the good we do is from the Lord Himself=
. None of it originates in us. Divine Providence states this very clearly:<=
/p><p>DP 53: "For it is known that all the good and all the truth which any=
one has is not from himself but from the Lord alone; indeed, that no one ca=
n even name the Lord, or utter His names Jesus and Christ, except from Him =
alone... In a word, the Lord cannot have an abode in a person and in an ang=
el and dwell with them except in what is His own, and not in what is their =
proprium."</p><p>It is the way we reflect the Infinite and Eternal, that is=
, the Lord, in our lives that determines the kind of conjunction we have wi=
th Him. Remember that the object and goal of Divine Providence is a heaven =
for a human race. Therefore the Lord is constantly looking for things withi=
n us which can be conjoined to Him. Only those love which relate to His lov=
e and wisdom can receive Him. Above we made a chart of the properties of In=
finity and Eternity, relating to the Lord. Let us extend that now to includ=
e mankind:</p><p>INFINITY&nbsp;|&nbsp;ETERNITY&nbsp;<br>L&nbsp;Esse&nbsp;|&=
nbsp;Existere<br>o&nbsp;Being&nbsp;|&nbsp;Existing (Manifesting)<br>r&nbsp;=
Love&nbsp;|&nbsp;Wisdom<br>d&nbsp;Good&nbsp;|&nbsp;Truth<br>---------------=
--------------------------------------------------<br>M&nbsp;Charity&nbsp;|=
&nbsp;Faith<br>a&nbsp;Willing well&nbsp;|&nbsp;Doing well<br>n&nbsp;Feeling=
s&nbsp;|&nbsp;Thoughts</p><p>In a word, the Lord cannot have an abode in a =
person and in an angel and dwell with them except in what is His own and no=
t in what is their proprium (DP 53).</p><p>The things we chose to do becaus=
e they are from the Lord form vessels within us that receive His presence. =
Without those vessels He cannot be with us, as there is nothing to receive =
Him. Our "vessels" are formed according to the choices we make during our l=
ives. </p><p>POINT THREE: The Divine Providence in Everything it does regar=
ds what is infinite and eternal from itself, especially in saving the human=
 race (DP 55).</p><p>The things of the Lord in us take form in the choices =
we make, because it is in the level of choice that we differentiate between=
 the Lord in us, and our own propria. As we choose to live and develop acco=
rding to the Lord's pattern, so we become more and more an image of Himself=
, and thus His infinity and eternity are reflected in us, in our love and w=
isdom, in our charity and faith.</p><p>In DP 56 and 57 our attention is dra=
wn to another quality of the infinity and eternity of the Lord, and the way=
 in which it is reflected in our lives. Remember to shut out ideas of time =
and space and consider the following passages:</p><p>An image of the Infini=
te and Eternal in the variety of all things is apparent in this, that there=
 is not one thing the same as another, nor can there be to eternity (DP 56)=
.</p><p>An image of the Infinite and Eternal in the fructification and mult=
iplication of all things is evident in the vegetable kingdom... (DP 56)</p>=
<p>It is the same with men with regard to their affections, which belong to=
 their love, and to their perceptions that belong to their wisdom (DP 57).<=
/p><p>Thus the concept of infinity and eternity as being represented in ves=
sels within us is sharpened. The Lord's presence is full to the degree that=
 we are open to Him in our own unique and individual way. His concern is ou=
r reality, our being, our very life, and the expression of that in our exte=
rnal actions.</p><p>The Lord's concern with us, then, is with how we receiv=
e Him, not for His sake, but for ours:</p><p>DP 58: "The Divine Providence =
regards what is infinite and eternal from itself especially in saving the h=
uman race, because the Divine Providence has for its end a heaven from the =
human race... and because of this end it follows that the reformation and r=
egeneration of a person, thus salvation, is what the Divine Providence espe=
cially regards; for heaven exists from those who have been saved or regener=
ated..." </p><p>Our regeneration is played out in the choices we make. How =
do we know if we are being regenerated? By checking to see if our choices a=
re based on eternal things, for those are the things of the Lord in us. Thu=
s we can ask ourselves a checking question when faced with a choice:</p><p>=
DP 59: "What is that which is not eternal? It not the temporal comparativel=
y as nothing, and does it not also become nothing when it comes to an end? =
It is not so with what is eternal: that alone is, because its being has no =
end."</p><p>To rephrase this question would be to put it into a form someth=
ing like this: If I choose such and such, will it gratify me immediately, a=
nd if so, how long will that gratification last? What sort of choice would =
I make if I looked for something that will last to eternity?</p><p>As we ba=
se our choices on eternal principles, so we gradually undergo a personality=
 change. Immediate gratification looses its delights, and is replaced with =
the more lasting satisfaction of knowing that one has done the right thing,=
 that the series of consequences stretching to eternity as a result of that=
 choice will lead us into a closer relationship with the Lord. </p><p>POINT=
 FOUR: An image of the Infinite and Eternal is presented in an angelic heav=
en (DP 60).</p><p>Consider the following passage:</p><p>DP 60: "=EF=BF=BDhe=
aven, however, is granted to none but those who know the way to it and who =
walk therein. This way can in some measure be known from a knowledge of the=
 character of those who constitute heaven, and also by knowing that no one =
becomes an angel, that is, comes into heaven, unless he carries with him fr=
om the world something of the angelic character..."</p><p>When we consider =
the angelic heaven, we must think of it as the state following death. But w=
e should also think of it as the state of being in relation to the Lord. Th=
e Kingdom of God is within you - now. Because Infinity and Eternity are a s=
tate of reality, and because they cannot be defined in terms of time and sp=
ace, one cannot say that there is any time in our lives when we are not rec=
eptive of infinity and eternity - unless by our deliberate choices we close=
 our minds to receiving the Lord's inflowing life. Each of us is a spirit, =
and so each of us is governed by the laws of the spiritual world:</p><p>Eve=
ry one's spirit is affection and thought thence derived; and as all affecti=
on is of love and thought is of the understanding, every spirit is his own =
love and his own understanding thence derived (DP 61).</p><p>Thus by defini=
tion we are spirits, and so by definition we are beyond the constraints of =
time and space, except for the body. Also, because of this, we are represen=
tation of the Infinite and Eternal love and care of the Lord, for we are im=
ages of the Lord's heaven:</p><p>"The angelic heaven is an image of the Inf=
inite and eternal, because it is an image of the Lord, and the Lord is the =
Infinite and the Eternal" (DP 62).</p><p>While heaven is made up of many an=
gels and angelic societies, so each of us is made up of many loves, or love=
s in many forms, which, when orchestrated by a ruling love for good, makes =
a harmony within us. The Lord alone unites our affections and loves (DP 63)=
, and so brings us into the form and association with heaven and Himself.</=
p><p>This is the object of creation, but it can only come about by a carefu=
l application to life of the laws of Providence, especially with regard to =
the fact that the Infinity and Eternity of Providence is reflected in the w=
ay we make our choices and live our lives. When choices are made from good =
motives, then they reflect the Lord's infinity, when made from true princip=
les, they reflect His eternity, and heaven is formed within us.</p><p>POINT=
 FIVE: The inmost of the Divine Providence is to regard what is infinite an=
d eternal in forming the angelic heaven, in order that it may be before the=
 Lord as one person, the image of Himself (DP 64).</p><p>By forming people =
into the image of heaven, the Lord beings people into a harmony with Himsel=
f and with others. In DP 64 it is pointed out that heaven as a whole is in =
the form of a single person, and in DP 65 we are shown that even in this on=
eness the Lord allows for a range of variety only reflected in the human bo=
dy. This variety allows for as full as possible expression of the Lord infi=
nite love and eternal truth, each aspect of which finds expression in some =
individual angel, or some society of heaven.</p><p>Now since a person by cr=
eation is a heaven in the least form, and consequently an image of the Lord=
, and since heaven consists of as many affections as there are angels, and =
each affection in its form is a person, it follows that it is the continual=
 design of the Divine Providence that a person may become a heaven in form =
and consequently and image of the Lord, and since this is effected by means=
 of the affection of good and truth, that he may become such an affection (=
DP 67).</p><p>It is in this passage that the Chapter builds to its closest =
identification with the Infinite and Eternal as being the expressions of af=
fection in each person. When the Lord regards that which is infinite in a p=
erson, He is regarding the person's loves, his affections, his motives in d=
oing things. In regarding the person's eternal life, He is referring to the=
 persons understanding, his faith, his expression of the loves within him, =
for these are what make a person an angel, bring him or her into harmony wi=
th the Divine, and receive the Lord's influx.</p><p>In a later passage we a=
re told:</p><p>DP 68: "Since ... none can become angels but those who have =
been men in the world, it follows that the person who suffers himself to be=
 led to heaven is continually prepared by the Lord for his own place; an th=
is is done by means of such an affection of good and truth as corresponds w=
ith it..."</p><p>Thus our choices and the way we gratify them is of greates=
t importance in our lives. If we apply the test of the eternal use of a cou=
rse of action, then the Lord will lead us to see things in terms of eternit=
y, and we will walk the path leading to heaven.</p><p>Taking this all into =
account then, we should be aware of the dangers of immediate gratification.=
 By being conscious of the Lord's influx into our will and understanding, a=
nd His desire that these should reflect His own love and wisdom, should giv=
e us reason to examine our action, our choices and our motives for why we c=
hoose the things we do.</p><p></p><p></p><div align=3D"Right">4</div><hr><p=

</p><p>
&nbsp;Lecture Four - The Laws of Divine Providence </p><p>INTRODUCTION</p><=
p>In our study of Divine Providence so far, we have been shown that Provide=
nce is the government of the Lord, specifically that it is the government o=
f Divine Love by means of Divine Wisdom. Because it is such, the goals of D=
ivine Providence are identical to the goals of the Lord's love and wisdom, =
that is, the creation of a heaven from the human race. We were shown that t=
he more a person lives in the stream of providence, the more fully and comp=
letely he is conjoined to the Lord. The direct benefit of this conjunction =
is that the person is then brought into a state of happiness and wisdom.</p=
><p>The course of the Book Divine Providence then swings to the way in whic=
h the Lord's providence works. We are shown the parameters set by the Lord:=
 He regards only things that are infinite and eternal in a person. Understa=
nding this is of great importance to understanding the Lord's presence in o=
ur lives: His concern is not with short-term things, but with the way thing=
s affect our spiritual salvation.</p><p>In the long fourth chapter of the b=
ook we are shown how the Lord's Divine Providence provides for our spiritua=
l states, by providing certain freedoms to people, which enable them to res=
pond to the Lord.</p><p>The Need for Spiritual Freedom</p><p>In the first l=
ecture we discussed the nature of the Lord, notably that the essence of His=
 love is "...to love others outside of oneself, to desire to be one with th=
em, and to render them blessed from oneself" (TCR 43). We also noted that:<=
/p><p>* DLW 47: "It is the essential of love not to love self, but to love =
others, and to be conjoined to others by love..."</p><p>When the Lord creat=
ed people, in order to fulfill the nature or essence of His love, He create=
d people with the ability of returning and responding to His love. We call =
this response a "reciprocal conjunction" ("reciprocal" means, "to return").=
</p><p>In order to receive and return the Lord's love, He created us to exi=
st as independent beings, separated from the Lord, responsible for our own =
response to Him. As we shall see as this lecture develops, this response is=
 vitally important. However, there are certain things about it which need a=
 brief explanation:</p><p>1.&nbsp;Firstly even though life appears to us to=
 be our own, it nevertheless belongs entirely to the Lord. We are told cont=
inually in the Doctrines that people are only vessels that receive the Lord=
. He alone has life.</p><p>2.&nbsp;Even though the Lord created us to feel =
as though our thoughts and feelings are our own, because feelings and thoug=
hts can only have their origin in life, and because we are recipients of li=
fe, it follows that our thoughts and feelings flow into us from the Lord by=
 way of angels and/or evil spirits.</p><p>Having said this, however, does n=
ot mean that we are sort of pale images of the Lord: the life He gives us, =
while it is His alone, is given to us as though it were our own, to use as =
we will. Similarly, the thoughts and feelings flowing into us, while they a=
re sourced in the Lord, nevertheless have a reality in our lives that makes=
 it seem that they originate in ourselves. </p><p>Finally it is vitally imp=
ortant to understand that the Lord has given us spiritual freedom, or, in o=
ther words, control over the thoughts and feelings which affect our lives. =
We can choose to follow any path in life we want (spiritually speaking, tha=
t is), and end up in heaven or hell. The Lord never interferes with this fr=
eedom.</p><p>Thus the concept of spiritual freedom is vital to our spiritua=
l life. In one sense it is the link between the Lord and people. It is inex=
tricably bound into our concept of salvation, thus the fulfillment of the L=
ord's end in creation: a heaven from the human race.</p><p>HOW THE LORD CRE=
ATED AND PRESERVES FREEDOM</p><p>The Lord created, and protects freedom thr=
ough a series of spiritual laws, which we call the Laws of Divine Providenc=
e. These laws are universal: in a sense they describe the human condition, =
because they show us how people's minds are created. Understanding these la=
ws is vital to understanding Divine Providence, as well as understanding hu=
man salvation, which is our reciprocal response to the Lord.</p><p>First La=
w</p><p>"It is a law of the Divine Providence that a person</p><p>should ac=
t from freedom according to reason" (DP 71).</p><p>If a person looks around=
 himself or herself, he will see many of the miracles of nature, some great=
, some small. Each miracle is wrought by the wisdom of the Lord. The way a =
worm turns into a butterfly, crystals with brilliant colors buried in a dra=
b grey stone, the billowing clouds of a windswept veld. There are many exam=
ples of the Lord's work that show us something of the quality of His wisdom=
.</p><p>In nature, especially, we see that the Lord never works in a random=
 or haphazard way. Every detail of creation is related to every other detai=
l - minute plankton of the sea, for example, feed the great whales. The ele=
mental substances of nature combine to form the most beautiful and useful c=
ompositions that each plays a part in the organization of the whole. Think =
for a moment of water, formed by combining two tiny substances, hydrogen an=
d oxygen, to become a mainstay of life. The combination of these substances=
 is not an erratic hit-and-miss, once in a lifetime chance, but part of a c=
arefully worked out order impressed on creation by the Lord. </p><p>The Lor=
d has taken so much care with the ordering of nature, and continues to cons=
tantly ensure that nature continues to function in the way the He intended.=
 It is reasonable to conclude, therefore, that the Lord's relationship with=
 people must also follow a nature and design that will maximize each person=
's likelihood of coming into the state of heaven, which is the Lord's whole=
 purpose of creation. We are told:</p><p>DP 70: "It is well known that ther=
e is a Divine Providence, but it is not known what its nature is..."</p><p>=
The Doctrines of the New Church show us that the Lord governs us through a =
series of principles, a constitution, so to speak, that cannot be changed, =
for it ensures the greatest freedom of the individual to respond to the Lor=
d from his own free will, and so be conjoined with the Lord. These principl=
es are called the LAWS OF PROVIDENCE, and understanding them is like unders=
tanding the laws of one's country: it helps one to live within the sphere o=
f order.</p><p>The first law of Divine Providence is "that a person should =
act from freedom according to reason" (DP 71). Within this one sentence lie=
 all the secrets not only of our response to the Lord, but also our ability=
 to interact with everything else in our own little worlds. </p><p>The obje=
ct of religion and the end of creation is for each person to become an ange=
l of heaven (DP 19ff). But the Lord is not satisfied with pre-programmed pe=
ople - He wants people to come into heaven from their own free choice. He w=
ants us to go to heaven because we choose to. To enable us to make this cho=
ice He created each person with two faculties or abilities: one is the abil=
ity to reason, or rationality, the other is the ability to bring our reason=
 into act, or freedom (DP 71). In other words, the Lord made us so that we =
can decide to do something, and then have the freedom to actually commit th=
e act.</p><p>These two faculties, freedom and reason, give us the challenge=
 of spiritual life: we are constantly faced with the choice between bringin=
g into action or suppressing our thoughts and feelings in word or deed. We =
can think and will as we please, but we are not always allowed to do or exp=
ress these things (DP 71). For example we may think that we would like to m=
urder someone, but unless we are willing to face the consequences, we are n=
ot free to actually commit the crime.</p><p>The result is that our lives ex=
ist on two planes simultaneously: the internal part of us that thinks and f=
eels, the private thoughts that we conceal from others for one reason or th=
e other forms a spiritual plane in our lives. The external words and action=
s, displayed for all to see, is our natural <br>part. And so we are divided=
, often, but not always, between what we would like to do and what we are a=
ctually able to do.&nbsp;</p><p>In the spiritual world, however, this divis=
ion cannot exist. Remember the teaching given in the first chapter of Divin=
e Providence:</p><p>DP 16: "The Lord does not suffer that anything should b=
e divided; therefore it must be either in good and at the same time in trut=
h, or in evil, and at the same time in falsity..."</p><p>A person in heaven=
 or hell is unable to speak differently from how he feels, he cannot act ap=
art from his loves. So our ability to do so in this world is a temporary st=
ate, given for our own protection, given to create and preserve an orderly =
society, for in this world if people were able to act as they pleased befor=
e they are reformed and regenerated, society would collapse immediately and=
 the end of creation, a heaven from the human race would be instantly thwar=
ted.</p><p>In order to control our inherently evil loves and to allow us to=
 act apart from these loves, the Lord has given us the ability to reason. W=
e are told in the Doctrines that each person inclines to evils of every kin=
d (TCR 520). But because we can reason, we are able to lift our minds highe=
r than our personal feelings. We may feel like murdering someone, but, from=
 reason, we can see that to commit that deed would have sad results, not on=
ly for ourselves, but also for the family and friends. And so, because of o=
ur ability to understand and reason, we are able to restrain ourselves and =
find another vent for our feelings.</p><p>Being able to reason, however, wo=
uld be meaningless unless we were able to act according to that reasoning, =
for it is only by bringing our reasoning into action (if it is good reasoni=
ng) that we can break clear of our inherited evils, or, if one is an evil p=
erson, it is only by being able to confirm the with reasons evil loves. </p=
><p>So the Lord gives us the freedom to live our lives in a way that reflec=
ts our reasoning ability. Most of the time we do this without actually thin=
king about it. But if we did think about it, however, we would soon see tha=
t the choices we make are the result of the things we love:</p><p>DP 73: ".=
..it should be known that all freedom is of love, insomuch that love and fr=
eedom are one; and as love is the life of a person, freedom also is his lif=
e. For every delight that a person has is from his love, nor can delight co=
me from any other source; and to act from the delight of love is to act fro=
m freedom, for a person is led by delight as something that is borne along =
by the current of a river." </p><p>Each person has a set of loves, and thos=
e loves are enforced or confirmed in their minds by an unconscious reasonin=
g, a confirming of good, and a justification of evil, which clothes the lov=
es and gives it form, by means of this a person lives his or her life by fr=
eely acting out their loves.</p><p>So, the Writings tell us, there are thre=
e general kinds of freedom (see DP 73), each the result of different loves:=
 </p><p>1. The first is natural freedom, which is the freedom to act accord=
ing to our evil inclinations.</p><p>DP 73:3: "Natural freedom every person =
has from inheritance. From it a person loves nothing but self and the world=
: his first love is nothing else..."</p><p>A thief, for example, acts from =
natural freedom when he steals. In a sense natural freedom is the freedom t=
o act according to the lowest things in human nature:</p><p>DP 73:4: "A per=
son's desire, for example, to commit adultery, to defraud, to blaspheme, to=
 take revenge, is from the love into which he is born..."</p><p>2. The seco=
nd kind is rational freedom, which is the freedom to pretend to be somethin=
g we are not. </p><p>DP 73:5: "Rational freedom is from the love of reputat=
ion for the sake of honor and gain. The delight of this love is to appear e=
xternally as a moral person..."</p><p>A person, who wishes to present himse=
lf to the world as an honest person, may act honestly, but on the inside fe=
el that lying and cheating are permissible. He refrains from doing certain =
things, not because he thinks they are evil, but because he wants to preser=
ve his reputation. </p><p>DP 73:5: "His freedom, therefore, derives nothing=
 from a love of public welfare, nor does his reason derive anything, for it=
 harmonizes with his love..."</p><p>3. The third kind of freedom is the fre=
edom that comes from actually not doing evil things because they are sins a=
gainst the Lord. </p><p>DP 73:6: "Spiritual freedom is from the love of ete=
rnal life. Into this love and its delight no one comes but the person who t=
hinks that evils are sins, and consequently does not will them, and at the =
same time looks to the Lord..."</p><p>A person, who believes theft is a sin=
, and does not commit it for that reason, exercises spiritual freedom.</p><=
p>The Lord safeguards these types of freedom in each person in order to all=
ow each person to develop his loves in his own way. There is never a time t=
hat the Lord Himself will take away even the natural freedom of an evil per=
son, nor the hypocritical freedom of the merely rational man. Instead He tr=
ies to elevate, or up-grade the freedom from which a person acts. Thus He a=
llows a person who is externally good to see that he can also be spirituall=
y good.</p><p>The law of freedom and rationality is constant in our lives. =
We are encouraged to act in freedom according to our reason, if that action=
 leads to good. At the same time we are permitted to act freely even if tha=
t action results in evil - the Lord's laws are not there to bind us into a =
certain course of action, but to free us to develop as we choose, so that w=
e can respond to the Lord freely.</p><p>There are, however, results of the =
Law of Freedom and Rationality, and these also are inviolate. We are told t=
hat </p><p>DP 74: "Whatever a person does from freedom, whether it be of re=
ason or not, provided it be according to his reason, appears to him to be h=
is own."</p><p>This happens because when we decide to pursue a course of ac=
tion, our loves are united with our understanding, and so we have a double =
investment in the action. It becomes a part of us, indelibly written on our=
 spirits, for this is the way our spirit is molded - either into an image o=
f the Lord or of hell.</p><p>At the same time we are told that whatever we =
do in freedom according to our reason remains with us to eternity (DP 78). =
For most of us this may be a frightening thing: to realize that all the thi=
ngs we have done, things we are not particularly proud of, will always be a=
 part of us. The Lord cannot remove them, for to do so would be to breach t=
he terms of His own laws. They stay with a person because they</p><p>DP 78:=
 "... enter his life and become a part of it, consequently they become his =
own..."</p><p>DP 79: "What a person does from freedom according to his thou=
ght is also said to remain with him, since nothing that a person has approp=
riated to himself2 can be eradicated; for it has come to be [a part] of his=
 love and at the same time of his understanding, and consequently of his li=
fe."</p><p>2. Appropriated to himself =3D to make his own</p><p>These teach=
ings need to be seen in the light of other teachings. We can always repent =
and should we begin to shun evils as sins against the Lord, then He rearran=
ges our minds so that what was once confirmed in thought and deed and there=
fore had taken centre place, can be pushed to the edges of our minds and so=
 forgotten about (DP 79).</p><p>This concept is important: once we confirm =
some evil in our lives, it cannot be removed entirely, but only pushed to t=
he edges of our minds. Consider the teaching of DP 79:&nbsp;</p><p>DP 79: "=
[Evil] ... can be removed indeed, but still it cannot be expelled; as when =
it is removed it is transferred as it were from the centre to the circumfer=
ence, and there it stays. This is what is meant by its remaining..."</p><p>=
But still, the influence of each thing we do remains with us. The evils we =
do and think influence the way our mind is formed, even after we repent, fo=
r the repentance and the exercise of spiritual freedom will follow the natu=
re of the evil. When we repent and shun evils as sins against the Lord, we =
then come into good principles:</p><p>DP 79: "these good principles then co=
nstitute the centre, and they remove the evils towards the circumference fu=
rther and further as he abhors and turns away from them..."</p><p>If goods =
or evils of life stay with us when they are confirmed by both the will and =
understanding, it follows that both our freedom and reason have to be prese=
nt to make the states of life permanent. This concept has serious ramificat=
ions when we think of it from another angle: what should happen if either o=
ur freedom or reason was missing from an action? </p><p>DP 80: "Nothing is =
appropriated to a person that he merely thinks, or even that he thinks to w=
ill, unless at the same time he wills to such a degree as to do it when opp=
ortunity offers."</p><p>This teaching has important consequences in our liv=
es. One often hears the old saying, "the road to hell is paved with good in=
tentions." Intentions are part of our thinking, and so is a part of our rea=
soning. Unless those intentions are brought into act, by acting in freedom =
according to our reason, the act never exists. </p><p>On this point we shou=
ld be warned, however, that as far as evil is concerned, thoughts on a subj=
ect often find a kindred spirit with the tendencies of our hereditary will,=
 and going hand in hand, the thought can lead us to action in accordance wi=
th natural freedom. The danger of this is highlighted in the following pass=
age:</p><p>DP 81: "The evils which a person believes to be allowable, even =
though he does not commit them, are also appropriated to him; since whateve=
r is allowable in the thought comes from the will, for then there is consen=
t. When, therefore, a person believes any evil to be allowable, he loosens =
an internal restraint upon it, and he is withheld from doing it only be ext=
ernal restraints, such as fears; and because his spirit favors that evil, w=
hen external restraints are removed he does it as allowable; and meanwhile =
he continually does it in his spirit."</p><p>Thus we are shown how importan=
t spiritual freedom is and why the law of freedom and reason is the first o=
f the laws of Divine Providence. By creating us free, with the ability to r=
eason out our motives and actions for ourselves, the Lord has created us so=
 that we are truly able to respond to and reciprocate His love. These two a=
bilities are present in every detail of our lives. "It is by means of these=
 two faculties (rationality and liberty) that a person is reformed and rege=
nerated by the Lord; and without them he cannot be reformed and regenerated=
" (DP 82).</p><p>Remember that the purpose of creation is a heaven from the=
 human race. In order to achieve this, the Lord created us in such a way th=
at we can turn to Him in freedom, according to our understanding of Him, an=
d so be reformed and recreated. The concept of freedom and reason is centra=
l to this process, for unless we had the ability to reason, we would never =
see our evils, and if we did not have the freedom to turn from them, the si=
ght of them would not help us at all.</p><p>This is not the time to go into=
 a detailed description of the process of regeneration, but we are given an=
 overview of it. Read DP 83 and notice the three states of a person. Then r=
efer back to DP 73 and compare these states with the three states of freedo=
m. The result should be something of a general correlation:</p><p>DP 83: "M=
an's first state, which is a state of condemnation, everyone has by inherit=
ance from his parents; for a person is thereby born into the love of self a=
nd the world, and from these as well-springs, into evils of every kind."</p=
><p>DP 73: "Natural freedom every one has from inheritance. From it a perso=
n loves nothing but self and the world: his first love is nothing else."</p=
><p>This first state or the "state of condemnation" is a person's spiritual=
 state before they begin the active process of repentance, reformation and =
regeneration. Notice how the natural freedom governs this state: a person w=
ho is bent on selfishness finds "freedom" in a life of selfishness, and so =
reasons selfishly and acts in accordance with that reason.</p><p>But what h=
appens if the person begins to reason apart from his or her selfishness? Wh=
at is a person takes some of the truths of the Word to heart, and begins to=
 change his or her reasoning? The result then is the "state of reformation.=
"</p><p>DP 83: "Man's second state, which is a state of reformation, is tha=
t in which he begins to think about heaven on account of the joy there; and=
 thus concerning God from whom the joy of heaven comes to him."</p><p>At fi=
rst glance one would expect this second state to fit nicely into the second=
 kind of spiritual freedom mentioned in DP 73, namely, rational freedom. An=
d to a degree it does. Notice the description of DP 73: </p><p>"Rational Fr=
eedom is from the love of reputation for the sake of honor and gain. The de=
light of this love is to appear externally as a moral person, and because s=
uch a one loves his reputation, he does not defraud, commit adultery, take =
revenge, or blaspheme.... he also from freedom according to his reason acts=
 in sincere, chaste and friendly ways."</p><p>At first these two states see=
m to go together. The state of reformation is, to some degree, a state of s=
elf-compulsion, when our externals are in order, while our internals are on=
ly coming into order. This state is described in the Arcana:</p><p>AC 4353e=
: "Act precedes, a person's willing follows, for that which a person does f=
rom his understanding, he at last does from the will, and finally puts it o=
n as a habit; and it is then insinuated in his rational or internal man."</=
p><p>The discrepancy between the two, however, arises in the matter or moti=
ve. The person who is pharisaic, and who exercises merely natural freedom d=
oes not derive anything spiritual from his external behavior. He is, indeed=
, a whitened sepulcher.</p><p>But, the person who is truly reforming exerci=
ses more a spiritual freedom. Note the description of that freedom:</p><p>D=
P 73:6: "Spiritual freedom is from the love of eternal life. Into this love=
 and its delight no one comes but the person who thinks that evils are sins=
, and consequently does not will them, and at the same time looks to the Lo=
rd."</p><p>Thus in a state of reformation a person is midway between ration=
al freedom and spiritual freedom. As he or she progresses away from natural=
 things, he or she will move towards spiritual things:</p><p>DP 83: "At fir=
st such thoughts [about spiritual things] spring from the delight of self l=
ove; for to him this delight is heavenly joy..."</p><p>DP 84: "Man's third =
state, which is a state of regeneration, follows upon and is a continuation=
 of the former state. It begins when a person desists from evils as sins, a=
nd it progresses as he shuns them, and it is perfected as he fights against=
 them; and then, as he from the Lord conquers them, he is regenerated."</p>=
<p>At this point the person exercises true spiritual freedom:</p><p>DP 73:6=
: "Spiritual freedom is from the love of eternal life. Into this love and i=
ts delight no one comes but the person who thinks that evils are sins, and =
consequently does not will them, and at the same time looks to the Lord."</=
p><p>The importance of this concept of freedom and reason in our regenerati=
on cannot be stressed enough. We are told in no uncertain terms that:</p><p=
>DP 85: "Man is reformed and regenerated by means of these two faculties, c=
alled rationality and liberty, and he cannot be reformed and regenerated wi=
thout them, because it is by means of rationality that he can understand an=
d know what is evil and what is good, and it is by means of liberty that he=
 can will what he understands and knows."</p><p>They are so important that =
the Lord never removes them from people. Even evil people, who grossly misu=
se their rationality and liberty, still have it, and even though they may p=
ut themselves into bondage to hell, their faculties are preserved (DP 86).<=
/p><p>In the passages DP 87 - 95 we are shown how the faculties of freedom =
and reason give the Lord the ability to fulfill His greatest wish: a heaven=
 from the human race. In Chapter Two heaven is defined as conjunction with =
the Lord (DP 28). We are also shown that as a person is more closely conjoi=
ned with the Lord, the wiser and happier he becomes (because he enters more=
 and more into the state of heaven.)</p><p>In the present section we are wo=
rking on, we are shown how the faculties of freedom and reason bring about =
this conjunction. Firstly we have been shown that a person is conjoined to =
the Lord through the process of reformation and regeneration, and these are=
 contingent on rationality and freedom.</p><p>Then, in DP 87 we are shown h=
ow the person is lead into a state of wisdom:</p><p>"By means of these two =
faculties a person can be so far reformed and regenerated so he can be led =
by means of them to acknowledge that everything true and good that he think=
s and does is from the Lord and not from Himself."</p><p>This insight is th=
e start of real wisdom: for all good is from the Lord, and of ourselves we =
are nothing but evil. Remember that during our reformation and regeneration=
, our evils are not removed from us, they are merely pushed to the edges of=
 our minds. Thus the Lord leads a person to recognize that true power belon=
gs to the Lord alone, especially our power, or ability to think and will. <=
/p><p>Thus the regenerating person comes to realize that his ability is not=
 his own, and so therefore does not take merit for his good actions (DP 90)=
, and it is this ascription of good to the Lord that finally regenerates a =
person:</p><p>DP 91: "However, very few can apprehend with the understandin=
g that the acknowledgement of the Lord, and the acknowledgement that all th=
at is good and true is from Him, are what cause a person to be reformed and=
 regenerated."</p><p>This acknowledgement of the Lord's power in our lives =
alive in our rationality and freedom, is what reforms and regenerates us. U=
ltimately it conjoins us to the Lord:</p><p>DP 92: "The conjunction of the =
Lord with a person, and the reciprocal conjunction of a person with the Lor=
d, are effected by means of these two faculties?." Conjunction with the Lor=
d and regeneration are one, for so far as anyone is conjoined to the Lord h=
e is regenerated..."</p><p>CONCLUSION</p><p>The Lord has given us this law,=
 not to scare us into repentance, but so that we can begin to understand th=
e mechanics of His government. This law explains why the Lord permits evils=
 to happen, it explains why there is not instant salvation, why we have to =
do the work of regeneration set forth by the Lord.</p><p>All the laws of pr=
ovidence are inviolate:</p><p>DP 96: "The Lord preserves these two facultie=
s in a person unimpaired, and as sacred in every step of His Divine Provide=
nce."</p><p>The Lord will not break them. They are even handed, operating t=
he same for an evil person as for a good person, and they ensure that for e=
ach action there is a consequence: the result of evil is hell, of good, hea=
ven. Thus they Lord governs His creation with absolute fairness, and at the=
 same time with pity and compassion, with mercy and gentle leading. But He =
also is firm - those who break His commandments will reap the fruit of thei=
r actions, not because the Lord wishes to punish them, but because there is=
 no way He can waive the results.</p><p>The ability of mankind to act in fr=
eedom according to reason is a marvel in itself. In the operation of this l=
aw we are shown that the Lord allows nothing haphazard in His creation. We =
are more miraculously made, and more carefully governed than all the wonder=
s of the natural world for while the laws of nature are merely to serve man=
kind and give him an environment to live in. But the Laws of Providence are=
 the means to the end: they are the laws that draw all creation into perspe=
ctive, for they these laws were given that mankind, of his own free will ma=
y approach the Lord and be conjoined to Him, thus fulfilling the whole purp=
ose of creation: a heaven from the human race.</p><p></p><p></p><div align=

</p><p>
&nbsp;Lecture Four b - The Laws of Divine Providence </p><p>INTRODUCTION</p=
><p>In the first Law of Divine Providence, we are shown how the Lord create=
d people to live in spiritual freedom according to their reason. This abili=
ty is essential to human life, and is what enables us to respond to the Lor=
d, or reject Him, as fully individual and free people. As a law it is how t=
he Lord fulfils the essence of His love: to create people outside of Himsel=
f, to wish to be one with them, and to render them blessed. For when we are=
 free to act according to our reason, we are essentially "outside" of the L=
ord, and so can enter into a relationship with Him of our own free will and=
 accord. By creating us to act as if we are separate from Him, the Lord is =
able to fulfill the desire of creation, which is a heaven from the human ra=
ce.</p><p>By creating people in this way, the Lord focused the force of His=
 Divine wisdom on people. Had He formed us in any other way, then He would =
have thwarted not only the essentials of His love, but also the very reason=
 for creation: a heaven from the human race.</p><p>To act in freedom accord=
ing to reason, therefore, is the Lord's primary gift to us? However, it has=
 ramifications. We know from practical experience that freedom brings respo=
nsibility with it, spiritual freedom no less than natural. The result of gi=
ving us freedom, therefore, is that each one of us has the responsibility o=
f exercising that freedom - our final resting-place in heaven or hell depen=
ds on that exercise. Thus the second law of Divine Providence deals with ou=
r use of this wonderful gift given to us by the Lord.</p><p>SECOND LAW</p><=
p>"It is a law of the Divine Providence that a person should as from himsel=
f remove evils as sins in the external man; and thus not otherwise can the =
Lord remove evils in the internal man, and then at the same time in the ext=
ernal." (DP 100 - heading)</p><p>Imagine a person burning with anger, the m=
ore angrily he acts, the angrier he becomes, until his whole being is consu=
med by it, until every waking moment is dominated by it. Picture this anger=
 to be so pervasive in his life that no feeling thought or action is free o=
f it. A person so obsessed with his anger is actually ruled by it - it beco=
mes his life's love and everything else in him exists only to serve and fee=
d this internal fury.</p><p>Many people fall into this kind of obsession wi=
th an evil - if it is not anger, it is something else, usually it is many i=
nterrelated evils. They may not even be aware that they are obsessed - the =
person in our example may feel so fully justified in his anger that instead=
 of seeing it as evil, he may see it as a good or righteous anger. And so t=
he evil, masquerading as good in his life stays hidden, fermenting and grow=
ing, gaining dominion over his whole being.</p><p>The object of the Divine =
Providence is a heaven from the human race, and this can only be achieved w=
hen an individual turns to the Lord and enters into a state of conjunction =
with Him. Conjunction with the Lord, however, can only come about by submis=
sion to the Lord's will, by a life according to the Lord's commandments, an=
d by a subjection of evils within one's life.</p><p>The Lord wants nothing =
more than to be united to each person and to draw each of us into the spher=
e of heaven. But He cannot enter into us with His love unless the evils tha=
t are rampant within us are removed. </p><p>"Everyone can see from reason a=
lone that the Lord, who is Good itself and Truth itself, cannot enter into =
a person unless the evils and falsities in him are removed. For evil is the=
 opposite of good, and falsity is the opposite of truth..." (DP 100)</p><p>=
Evil is opposite to good, falsity from evil is opposite to the truth coming=
 from good - they are mutually destructive, and so, to protect our freedom =
to choose good or evil, the Lord does not draw near to us when we are consu=
med with evil, for that would be too painful for us (cf. DP 100e).</p><p>If=
, then, we want conjunction with the Lord, if we want to go to heaven, we m=
ust, as of ourselves remove evil in our external man, and when we do that w=
e open a door which allows the Lord to remove evils in our internal man. Th=
en, when this happens, the Lord draws near us, our spirits are drawn into t=
he angelic sphere, just as the Lord taught: </p><p>"Behold, I stand at the =
door and knock: if any one hears my voice, and opens the door, I will come =
in to him, and will sup with him and he with me" (Rev. 3:20).</p><p>The pri=
nciple that we must remove evils in our external man is so important that i=
t is listed as a Law of Providence. It cannot be changed. The Lord will not=
, indeed cannot, bring anyone into heaven if that person does not first fig=
ht against evil in himself. There is no other gate to the sheepfold than th=
rough the shunning of evils as sins against the Lord.</p><p>THE INTERNAL AN=
D THE EXTERNAL</p><p>Key to understanding and practicing this Law of Provid=
ence is knowing that each one of us has two parts, an internal and an exter=
nal of thought:</p><p>"By the external and the internal of thought are here=
 meant the same as by the external and the internal man, and by these are m=
eant the external and internal of the will and of the understanding..." (DP=
 103)</p><p>It is of great importance to understand the nature of the inter=
nal and external of our minds. </p><p>The person in our example burned with=
 an inner anger that influenced his entire life. The anger burns deep insid=
e him, so deep in fact that by justifying it he believes it to be good and =
as a result is unaware that it is there. Yet this anger finds outlets in th=
oughts and actions. Even when he is doing something good or ostensibly kind=
, still, the action is polluted by anger. Thus we see the distinction betwe=
en internal and external things in our lives: we can feel one thing in our =
internals, e.g. anger, and express a different thing in our external, such =
as friendliness towards the very person to whom our anger is directed.</p><=
p>"For anyone can talk with another in a friendly way from external thought=
, and yet be at enmity with him in internal thought. Anyone can talk about =
love towards the neighbor and love to God from external thought and at the =
same time from its affection, when nevertheless in his internal thought he =
cares nothing for the neighbor and does not fear God... Those do so who are=
 in the lusts of evil and who yet wish it to appear before the world that t=
hey are not in them" (DP 104).</p><p>The deeply rooted anger forms this per=
son's internal man, while the thoughts (apparently friendly) constitute his=
 external man. From his internal, the person burns with anger. In his exter=
nal he puts on a front, thinking the polite thoughts to hide the anger he d=
oesn't want shown to the public. So his anger, covered over by the external=
 of thought and the action itself, lies hidden from view.</p><p>Most people=
 have this form of "double thought" (DP 104), partly because of the way we =
are brought up to hide our inner thoughts and feelings, and partly because =
society would be torn asunder if each person gave vent to their inclination=
s towards evil.</p><p>But there is another reason why the Lord allows us to=
 have this double thought:</p><p>"Unless a person had from these an externa=
l and internal of thought he would not be able to perceive and view any evi=
l in himself and be reformed; in fact, he would not be able to speak, but o=
nly to utter sounds like a beast" (DP 104e).</p><p>These two levels of thou=
ght, therefore, are of great importance to our spiritual life. Each of us i=
s created to act in freedom according to reason. In order to be able to do =
this, we have to be able to reflect on our actions and intentions, which in=
 turn can only happen if we are able to divorce our inner thoughts from our=
 outer, and so sit in judgment on ourselves.</p><p>It is easier to understa=
nd this if we pay attention to the following teaching:</p><p>"The internal =
of thought is from the life's love and its affections and consequent percep=
tions; while the external of thought is from the contents of the memory whi=
ch minister to the life's love as confirmations and as means to further its=
 end" (DP 105).</p><p>One way of understanding this is to ally the internal=
 thought with our attitudes, for these spring from love, and are expressed =
in thought and word. If we consider our example we find the person consumed=
 with anger takes an angry attitude towards the world. This attitude is lik=
e a pilot directing an aircraft, for it steers the person's entire external=
 interaction with others. Because we are capable of double thought, the att=
itude is often hidden behind actions or words, but it is there as a powerfu=
l force, nonetheless.</p><p>The external of thought, we are told, is from t=
he things of the memory. These are the countless things we learn during our=
 lives. Imagine the memory to be a giant filing cabinet, stuffed full of in=
formation. What draws out the relevant data for use? The internal of though=
t: our affections and attitudes. This accounts for why a person who is angr=
y interprets things in such a way that they feed his or her anger. A non-an=
gry person may interpret the same data in a completely different way.</p><p=
>For this reason we are told that</p><p>"The external of a person's thought=
 is in itself of the same nature as its internal" (DP 106).</p><p>Because o=
f this it is important for a person to become aware of the nature of his in=
ternal of thought. Remember the teaching that each person is free to act in=
 accordance with reason. That freedom is in fact an activity of the will, e=
specially as it shows itself in the internal of thought. Thus our freedom l=
ies in our love of good or evil. But, as we have seen, the external of thou=
ght is derived from the internal, if follows the real powerhouse in our min=
d is the internal of thought. Note the following passage:</p><p>"The life's=
 love of a person, by means of its affections and their consequent percepti=
ons and by means of its delights and their consequent thoughts, rules the e=
ntire person - the internal of his mind by means of affections and their co=
nsequent perceptions, and the external of his mind by means of the delights=
 of the affections and their consequent thoughts" (DP 106e).</p><p>So the i=
nternal of thought, the external and the ultimate action act together as en=
d, cause and effect. The internal is the end, so if anger is the end, or th=
e purpose of one's life, then it will come into being through the cause, or=
 the means. The cause is made up of the surface thoughts we have that we do=
 not actually believe but which we want others to think we believe. They se=
rve to cover up our end, but also to bring it into action that is the effec=
t. In this way our life forms a unit, for the internal flows into the exter=
nal and then into the action. Anger finds itself a home in our thoughts and=
 consequently in our actions.</p><p>THE EXTERNAL MUST BE PURIFIED</p><p>In =
order to be conjoined to the Lord and so fulfill His end of creation, we ha=
ve to be purified of our evil loves and practices, for these form an obstru=
ction between the Lord and us. He cannot enter an evil sphere; neither can =
one who is in evil enter heaven. And so we must be purified which can only =
be done with our co-operation.</p><p>The evils within the internal and exte=
rnal are so closely bonded together that to remove evil from one means remo=
ving evil from both. They cannot be separated. </p><p>"... the external of =
a person's thought in itself is of the same character as the internal of hi=
s thought; and that they cohere like two things, one not only being within =
the other but also existing from the other, so that it is not possible to r=
emove one without at the same time removing the other..." (DP 111)</p><p>It=
 is the teaching then, that we cannot remove evils from our internal man as=
 these form too much a part of our being - we reflect very little on these =
evils:</p><p>"A person is not able to perceive the lusts of his own evil. H=
e does indeed perceive their delights, but he reflects little upon them; fo=
r delights captivate the thoughts and banish reflection. Therefore unless h=
e knew from some other source that they are evil he would call them good, a=
nd from freedom according to reason of his thought he would commit them; an=
d when he does this he appropriates them to himself" (DP 113).</p><p>Yet if=
 we are to be regenerated, the lusts controlling us must be removed. The ke=
y to this removal does not lie in the internal of thought, but in purifying=
 the external. It lies in the recognition that certain delights are evil, a=
nd that those delights therefore need to be shunned.</p><p>Only the Lord ca=
n look at our ends and purify them. Our responsibility, then, and our area =
of co-operation with the Lord is to remove evil in our external man. When w=
e allow our evil loves to come out into activity, the activity hides the lo=
ve, with the result that the originating evil love is bottled up within us,=
 erupting into life in the form of open evils. Thus the person in the examp=
le actually nurtures anger when it is allowed it to control his life. Angry=
 thoughts and actions actually protect anger.&nbsp;</p><p>However, when we =
shun the evils of life, and stop doing them, the evil love in us finds no o=
utlet into our lives (DP 112, 113). If we do not allow our evil love to fin=
d expression in our thoughts and life, then suddenly the evil internal, whi=
ch before had been hidden and protected, is suddenly made vulnerable. When =
we shun an evil as a sin against the Lord in our external man, then the Lor=
d is able to approach our internal man and put the evil to flight.</p><p>MA=
N'S INSTRUMENTALITY</p><p>"Evils in the external man cannot be removed exce=
pt through a person's instrumentality, because it is of the Divine Providen=
ce of the Lord that whatever a person hears, sees, thinks, wills, says and =
does should appear entirely as his own" (DP 116).</p><p>We can only fight a=
gainst evils in our external by the combats of temptation - when we as if f=
rom our own power, fight against our evil thoughts and actions because they=
 are sins. The person in our example may decide that to no longer think ang=
ry thoughts against other people. To achieve this he will have to compel hi=
mself to think, say and do things that seem to go against his anger. The ba=
ttles of temptation are long and hard because when we are in them we are fi=
ghting against what seems to be our very nature.</p><p>In those battles, ho=
wever, the Lord gives us both courage and strength to resist evil. Consider=
 the following passage:</p><p>"Let anyone who will, consult his reason as t=
o whether it does not appear that a person thinks from himself about good a=
nd truth, spiritual as well as moral and civil. Let him then accept this te=
net of doctrine that everything that is good and true is from the Lord and =
nothing from a person. He will then acknowledge this as a consequence, that=
 a person ought to do good and think truth as of himself, but yet should ac=
knowledge that he does these things from the Lord, and that a person should=
 remove evils as of himself but yet should acknowledge that he does so from=
 the Lord" (DP 116e).</p><p>The central tenet in removing evils from our ex=
ternal, then, is that each person operates in conjunction with the Lord. Th=
e desire to remove evil, the will and power to do so come from the Lord. Bu=
t the effort to apply these must come from the individual.</p><p>The Heaven=
ly Doctrines assure us that the Lord is always present during temptation. W=
hen we fight an evil in our external, He fights against it in our internal.=
 What we feel within ourselves is a lessening of our delight in that evil, =
until the Lord is able to completely remove any delight in the evil and we =
are then free from its effects (cf. DP 118 et al.).</p><p>As we go through =
the process of shunning evil in our externals, that is evil in thought, spe=
ech and act, </p><p>"The Lord then purifies a person from the lusts [of evi=
l] in the internal man, and from the evils themselves in the external" (DP =
119).</p><p>The Lord, however, cannot purify a person unless we first begin=
 the process. This is why it is so important for people to examine themselv=
es from time to time. The examination should not concentrate only on action=
s, but on our intentions, for when we look at our intention we get an idea =
of what our internal is. We cannot know our deepest loves, but we are very =
aware of the things that delight us and give us pleasure. When we shun evil=
 pleasures, then the Lord is able to remove the evil love that causes those=
 pleasures. So we read that:</p><p>"Man is in no wise purified by all these=
 works unless he examines himself, recognizes his sins, acknowledges them, =
condemns himself for them and does the work of repentance by desisting from=
 them; and unless he does all these things as of himself, but still in ackn=
owledgement from heart that he does them from the Lord" (DP 121:2e).</p><p>=
There is, then, no other way for the Lord to begin the process of bringing =
a person into heaven. Each individual has to see his evils and begin to shu=
n them. Then the Lord is able to purify the person and draw him close to hi=
mself. Each person is given the tools to do this, for the Lord has given us=
, and protects within us, the ability to reason, the ability to lift our mi=
nds higher than our own current circumstances and survey our lives. He has =
given us rationality so that we are able to learn the difference between go=
od and evil. He has given us the freedom to implement that rationality in o=
ur lives so that we are not forced to act simply because we want to act - w=
e are able to rise above our base desires and act according to our understa=
nding of the Lord's truth.</p><p>And the Lord has given us the responsibili=
ty of taking the first step away from evil. Although He always leads us tow=
ards good and works to turn all our evils into good, still He will not inte=
rfere with our choices. We have to turn to Him as if from ourselves.</p><p>=
THE LORD'S CONTINUAL ENDEAVOR</p><p>And when we do turn to the Lord, He rec=
eives us with joy. When we shun evils in our external man, He renders us al=
l possible assistance to remove the loves from our internal man. Even durin=
g the combats of temptation He is always at our side helping us during the =
battle, for the good fight is the way He can lead us into His kingdom, and =
so His end in creation, a heaven from the human race, is made a reality. So=
 we are told:</p><p>"It is the continual endeavor of the Divine Providence =
of the Lord to unite a person to Himself and Himself to a person in order t=
hat He may be able to bestow upon a person the felicities of eternal life; =
and this can be done only so far as evils with their lusts are removed" (DP=
 123).</p><p>In the last passages dealing with this law we are shown how th=
e Lord acts on our lives. He acts in two ways:</p><p>"The Lord in no wise a=
cts upon any particular thing in a person separately but upon all things at=
 the same time" (DP 124).</p><p>The Lord regards the whole of heaven as one=
 person, the Grand Man. Thus in the Lord's sight all things are connected a=
nd form a oneness. By acting on the whole of heaven, the Lord also acts on =
each individual in heaven, and each person in creation. Thus by being prese=
nt in the whole of heaven, He is also present in each part of heaven. Becau=
se we are connected with heaven by means of associate spirits, and because =
each person is a spirit clothed in a natural body, it follows that the Lord=
 is directly present with each person as well. </p><p>"It should, however, =
be clearly observed that the Lord also acts upon every particular thing in =
a person separately, and most meticulously, but at the same time through al=
l things of his form..." (DP 124)</p><p>The second point is as follows:</p>=
<p>"The Lord acts from inmost things and from ultimates at the same time." =
(DP 124)</p><p>He is able to do this because He took on the ultimates of th=
e human form and glorified them. Thus He is able to be present with people =
on all levels of life simultaneously. But He can only be present in a perso=
n's ultimates unless people co-operate with the Lord in removing evil from =
the externals of life. The Lord is then present in the externals of life as=
 well as in the internals (DP 125). </p><p>"When the Lord has implanted a h=
eavenly life's love in place of the infernal one then there are implanted a=
ffections of good and truth in place of the lusts of evil and falsity; and =
in place of the delights of the lusts of evil and falsity there are implant=
ed the delights of the affections of good; and in place of the evils of inf=
ernal love there are implanted the goods of heaven love. Then also instead =
of cunning there is implanted prudence, and instead of thoughts of malice t=
here are implanted thoughts of wisdom. Thus a person is born again and beco=
mes a new person" (DP 126).</p><p></p><p></p><div align=3D"Right">6</div><h=

&nbsp;Lecture Four c - The Laws of Divine Providence </p><p>INTRODUCTION</p=
><p>The Lord is Order Itself, and it follows that each and everything He do=
es, or that comes from Him, reflects order. He created with a set purpose: =
a heaven from the human race, a heaven of people who wish to be there, who =
responded to His leading from their own volition. The Lord's order shines t=
hrough as each level and part of creation, particularly in the laws of Prov=
idence. </p><p>To achieve His end of a heaven from the human race, He made =
people with two great faculties: freedom and reason, the ability to learn a=
bout God, to see the relationship between oneself and the Lord, and the fre=
edom to then act and live according to it. These two most important abiliti=
es make a person a person, distinguishing him from animals. Without them we=
 are incapable of any spiritual life. With them we can be brought into the =
close relationship the Lord wants for us.</p><p>It follows then that the Lo=
rd protects these two abilities in us most carefully. Anything that takes a=
way our freedom and reason takes away our ability to respond to the Lord, t=
akes away our freedom to be reformed and regenerated, so thwarting the Lord=
's desire of a heaven from the human race. According to His order, the Lord=
 created people able to remove evils in the external person, and, as one do=
es this the Lord removes the myriad lusts of evil which infest the internal=
 person. Thus the order of reformation and regeneration was established by =
the Lord and inscribed on the very being of the human race, and is protecte=
d by the laws of order known as the Laws of Providence.</p><p>In this way t=
he Lord ensures that the individual must respond to the Lord from his own c=
hoice. The Lord can do nothing with a person who does not choose to follow =
Him, He can neither reform nor regenerate him. The onus of choosing spiritu=
al life rests with the individual, with the result that heaven is made up o=
f those who freely turn to the Lord and embrace Him with their lives, while=
 hell is made up of those who from their own free choice turn away from Him=
 and reject His leading. </p><p>THIRD LAW&nbsp;</p><p>"It is a law of the D=
ivine Providence that a person should not be compelled by external means to=
 think and will, and thus to believe and love, the things of religion, but =
should persuade and at times compel himself to do so." (DP 129 - heading)</=
p><p>It is a law of Divine Providence, then, following upon the first two l=
aws, that the freedom to think and will must be most carefully guarded. If =
this were not so, people would be deprived of the very abilities that make =
them human, and heaven would be barren.</p><p>There is nothing in the world=
 which can make a person love something against his will, nor anything that=
 can make a person think one thing when in fact he thinks another. No numbe=
r of laws can enforce this on people, no amount of fear can make people rev=
ise the way they think and feel - even though they may put on an external f=
ace of agreement for certain reasons, still in their hearts, the freedom to=
 embrace or not embrace a concept is their own.</p><p>MIRACLES AND SIGNS</p=
><p>Down through the centuries many people have been swayed by external thi=
ngs, most particularly by miracles and signs. This was certainly true of th=
e crowds of simple people in the New Testament who followed the Lord becaus=
e He healed them, or multiplied loaves of bread and so on. </p><p>Even toda=
y it is often felt that if a person could only see a miracle one would beli=
eve. One only has to think of Lourdes and other places where people flock f=
or healing because they believe a miracle took place on that site. Yet doct=
rine teaches and experience demonstrates that this is not so. The Lord perf=
ormed miracle after miracle during His ministry, and yet the Pharisees stil=
l asked Him to show them a sign from heaven (Mark 8:11).</p><p>There are st=
ill miracles in the world, but not the kind people are thinking of. Conside=
r the following passage:</p><p>"... manifest miracles do not take place at =
this day, but miracles not manifest, or invisible, which are such things as=
 do not infuse what is holy, or take away freedom from a person; and theref=
ore the dead do not rise again, and a person is not withheld from evils thr=
ough immediate revelations, and through angels..." AC 4031:3)</p><p>In mode=
rn times, people observe miracles without seeing them - the birth of a baby=
, the intrinsic order of sub-atomic particles. And yet they still see nothi=
ng of God in these things. The reason is that in order for a person to see =
the Lord reflected in the miracles of the world around us, we must first wa=
nt to see Him. </p><p>An actual miracle will never convert us, for if it di=
d, it would take away our ability to think apart from that miracle.&nbsp;</=
p><p>"Compelled faith, such as is that which enters by means of miracles, d=
oes not stick; and also would do harm to those with whom faith can be impla=
nted by means of the Word in a state not compelled" (AC 10571e.)</p><p>One =
sees this phenomenon in fundamentalist Christianity, in which people who ha=
ve witnessed the miracles of healing and talking in tongues may be brought =
to believe. The Heavenly Doctrines tell us that when we see something like =
this, our minds are so taken with the miracle they become incapable of thin=
king apart from the miracle. It becomes very easy to say "I don't understan=
d, and would deny it, but because I saw such-and-such, I cannot deny, and s=
o will believe..." </p><p>Miracles hold us in bondage, for they take away o=
ur freedom of thought and hold us in faith to the miracle itself, rather th=
an in faith to the Lord.</p><p>The reason why miracles and signs do not ref=
orm us, is that they captivate our external mind, but not the internal. The=
 Lord's presence with us is in the internal mind, and from that in the exte=
rnal (DP 130):</p><p>"It cannot be denied that miracles induce a belief and=
 a strong persuasion that what is said and taught by him who performs the m=
iracles is true, and that this at first so occupies the external of a perso=
n's thought as to hold it spell bound" (DP 130).</p><p>And in another passa=
ge we are told:</p><p>"Miracles close up the internal man, and take away al=
l free will... And miracles are like veils and bolts to prevent anything fr=
om entering; but this bolt or barrier is successively broken down, and all =
truths are dissipated.." (Inv 6)</p><p>The problem miracles raise, therefor=
e, is the way they tie-up the external mind. Notice the words used in DP 13=
0: miracles hold a person "spell-bound", they "deprive" him of rationality =
and liberty.</p><p>Miracles work in the opposite direction from the Lord: w=
hen a person sees something that is apparently irrefutable, the person has =
no reason think rationally about that thing. Nor is there the freedom to re=
ject it. For example: grass is green, no one debates this. Because it is so=
 obvious, one is also not free to believe that grass is red. Thus the obvio=
usness of the fact removes human freedom from reasoning and acting accordin=
g to reason.</p><p>Miracles present an absolute in front of a person: if on=
e saw a person raised from the dead, they would have no option but to belie=
ve the miracle.</p><p>"From these considerations it may be evident that fai=
th induced by miracles is not faith but persuasion; for there is nothing ra=
tional in it, still less anything spiritual, as it is only external without=
 an internal" (DP 131).</p><p>Miraculous faith imposes an external faith in=
 a person: it is the faith in the event, or in the person who experienced t=
he event, but not in the Lord Himself, or,</p><p>"He who worships God solel=
y on account of a miracle, worships only the name of God..." (AC 10566)</p>=
<p>In the New Church this creates some interesting problems for us: do we b=
elieve the Writings to be the second coming of the Lord because Swedenborg =
had a series of spiritual adventures, or do we believe it because the truth=
s contained in the Writings make philosophical and rational sense? If the f=
irst is the case, then the faith before us is miraculous, if the second it =
is not.</p><p>Because of this the New Church has taken pains over the past =
two hundred years to downplay Swedenborg's experiences, and increase the th=
eological importance of the Writings. By doing this they allow people to ap=
proach the New Church from the point of view that the Writings in themselve=
s make perfect theological and Biblical sense. Swedenborg's experiences are=
 considerably secondary. Thus while Swedenborg relates that his entrance in=
to the spiritual world is a miracle:</p><p>"When my interior sight was firs=
t opened and through my eyes they saw the world and what was in it, spirits=
 and angels were so astonished that they said it was the greatest miracle o=
f all time..." (AC 1880:3)</p><p>We are frequently told that the New Church=
 would not be based on miracles, but on the revelation of the internal sens=
e of the Word:</p><p>"This New Church is not being established by any mirac=
les..." (Coro L)</p><p>"But in place of them there has been revealed the sp=
iritual sense of the Word; and the Spiritual World has been disclosed; and =
the nature of heaven and hell has been manifested; and also that a person l=
ives as a person after death; which are more excellent than all miracles" (=
Coro Li see also Inv. 39, 43, 46, 52, 55e).</p><p>"That this Church is rais=
ed up and established not through miracles, but through the revelation of t=
he spiritual sense, and through the introduction of my spirit and at the sa=
me time of my body into the Spiritual World, in order that I might know the=
re what heaven and hell are; and that, immediately in light from the Lord, =
I might imbibe the Truths of faith through which a person is led to eternal=
 life" (Inv. VII).</p><p>Before closing this section on miracles, however, =
it is useful to notice that miracles serve some good use: with those who ar=
e already in faith, miracles can serve to confirm and strengthen that faith=
.</p><p>"They who have faith from revelation, can be confirmed ... from mir=
acles, because they are in the affirmative ... But they who have not faith =
from revelation, cannot be confirmed ... from miracles, because they are in=
 the negative" (SD 4759).</p><p>In another passage:</p><p>"They who have be=
en in the good of life ... can be brought to the affirmative through experi=
ences, and through miracles. They who are in evil of life cannot; because e=
vil is recipient of the negative..." (SDm 4580:2)</p><p>In general, however=
, miracles work opposite to the Lord's chosen method of leading us into hea=
ven: by a life chosen in freedom according to reason. Miracles close reason=
 and remove freedom. Thus the Lord has provided in this grand constitution =
that no one can be compelled by external means. The only path to reformatio=
n and regeneration, thus the only true response to the Lord's presence, mus=
t be through our own preparedness, in freedom to accept the Lord's governme=
nt in our lives.</p><p>[Refer to the Articles on Miracles at the end of thi=
s lecture.]</p><p>VISIONS AND CONVERSATIONS WITH THE DEAD</p><p>The same th=
ing is true with other spiritual phenomena: many believe, like the rich man=
 in hell, that if only they could speak to someone from heaven, they would =
believe (Luke 16:27-31). In one sense visions are another form of miracle. =
Speech with the dead also compels a person, for one then puts faith in what=
 the dead person has said, rather than in the Word, which is the Lord speak=
ing to us. Abraham told the rich man that if his brothers would not listen =
to Moses and the Prophets, meaning the Word, neither would they listen to a=
nyone sent from the dead. </p><p>Consider the following passages relating t=
he origin of both visions and speech with the dead:</p><p>"Visions are of t=
wo kinds, Divine and diabolical. Divine visions are produced by means of re=
presentatives in heaven, and diabolical visions by means of magic in hell. =
There are also fantastic visions, which are the delusions of a distracted m=
ind" (DP 134).</p><p>Divine visions, the same passage says, "do not appear =
at the present day". That means that the only kinds of visions that do appe=
ar are either diabolical or of a "distracted mind." It is interesting to re=
ad the accounts of the many "saints" who saw visions: St. Ignatius Loyola f=
requently saw visions of the Virgin Mary, but these visions were always sou=
ght by him, and usually occurred after periods of fasting and intense spiri=
tual activity on his part. Could not they then be the result of a "distract=
ed mind"?</p><p>"...Infernal visions have sometimes appeared, induced by fa=
natical and visionary spirits who, from the madness which possessed them, c=
alled themselves the Holy Spirit. But these spirits have now been gathered =
together by the Lord and cast into a hell separate from the hells of others=
" (DP 134).</p><p>The case is equally true with conversations with the dead=
: these also have little effect on the implantation of faith:</p><p>"... a =
person might indeed by persuaded and driven to worship for a short time" (D=
P 134a).</p><p>It should be pointed out, here, that contact with spirits is=
 possible, but not desirable. DP 135 states that contact has been possible =
for ages, but that it is seldom granted, and then the spirit it limited in =
what he or she can say to the person. This teaching is confirmed by the tea=
ching in the Arcana that a person was created to speak to spirits:</p><p>"T=
he human being has been created by the Lord in such a way that while living=
 in the body he could at the same time talk to spirits and angels, as actua=
lly happened in most ancient times; for being a spirit clothed with a body =
he is one among them. But because, after a period of time, people have so i=
mmersed themselves in bodily and worldly interests that they hardly care ab=
out anything different, that path has therefore been closed. But as soon as=
 the bodily interests in which a person is immersed retire into the backgro=
und, the path is opened, and he finds himself among spirits and shares his =
life with them" (AC 69).</p><p>This particular teaching is expanded in AC 1=
880:4:</p><p>"... He was so created that heaven and earth might co-exist an=
d act as one, with men knowing what was going on in heaven and the angels w=
hat was going on in the world. And when they departed the earthly life men =
might accordingly pass from the Lord's kingdom on earth into the Lord's kin=
gdom in the heavens, passing not as into a different kingdom, but as into t=
he same one in which they had been when they lived in the body. But because=
 a person has become so bodily-minded he has closed heaven against himself.=
"</p><p>The exception to this rule seems to be Swedenborg himself, who was =
consciously alert in both worlds simultaneously. Perhaps his preparation fo=
r this had the effect of making his "bodily interests retire into the back-=
ground". Certainly, as he says in DP 135 and in many other passages in the =
Writings, the angels and spirits with him did not give him anything of thei=
r own, but everything taught to him was from the Lord alone.</p><p>With us,=
 however, this is not permissible because as we are so worldly and bodily m=
inded, the faith formed from miraculous events not only compels a person, b=
ut also has the added effect of blocking in one's evils, and so preventing =
reformation and regeneration (DP 134a). We have been taught that we incline=
 to evils of every kind which must be seen and rooted out of us, otherwise =
they fester. They can only be removed from our lives if we shun them as sin=
s against the Lord. However, a person who has faith in a miracle puts his f=
aith in the miracle itself, not in the Lord, and the result is that the evi=
l within stays shut inside him, like an abscess with no place to drain. Thu=
s it festers until it finally erupts into blasphemy and profanation, if not=
 in this world, certainly in the next.</p><p>THREATS AND PUNISHMENTS</p><p>=
By this law of providence, the prohibiting of compelling influences from fo=
rcing us to believe and will, to reform and regenerate, the Lord ensures ou=
r spiritual freedom. Many people are indeed converted by the miracles they =
see, or other spiritual experiences they have. If they are essentially good=
 people, looking to the Lord as their Lord and Savior, then the miracle doe=
s them no harm, for it serves to confirm what they already believe. But if =
they have no such faith, then the miracle does them no spiritual good, for =
it serves to inhibit their progress rather than promote it. Two people may =
watch the birth of a child, truly a miracle in itself. One sees the hand of=
 the Lord, His wondrous creation and so worship Him from the vision. The ot=
her person may see nothing except a natural sequence of events, common to a=
nimals and men, with nothing of God or order or miracle in it.</p><p>Just a=
s there is nothing outside a person, except the Word, which teaches a perso=
n the proper way to respond to the Lord, so nothing can compel someone to b=
elieve or disbelieve. If miracles and other such forceful experiences canno=
t lead a person to reform or regenerate because they compel, so also the ex=
periences of everyday life also do not lead one to reformation.</p><p>The r=
eason why miracles, visions and conversations with the dead to not give ris=
e to true faith is because they compel the external man. In DP 136 we are s=
hown a progression of thought along these lines:</p><p>1. The external cann=
ot compel the internal, but the internal can compel the external.</p><p>2. =
The internal is so averse to compulsion by the external that it turns itsel=
f away.</p><p>3. External delights allure the internal to consent and also =
to love.</p><p>4. There can be a forced internal and a free internal.</p><p=
>The relationship laid out in this passage between the internal and externa=
l is very clear: miracles etc. compel the external, but, they only hold the=
 external in bondage:</p><p>"One can no more be compelled to believe than t=
o think that a thing is so when he thinks that it is not so; and one can no=
 more be compelled to love than to what he does not will, for belief belong=
s to the thought and love to the will" (DP 136:2).</p><p>Thus external thin=
gs hold the mind in thrall, but they do not affect the internal things of t=
he mind. Instead, we are told, the internal man turns away from these thing=
s. In a sense we have all had the experience of being presented with eviden=
ce of something we do not believe. If the evidence is irrefutable, we may f=
ind ourselves grudgingly assenting, while a part of us resists the evidence=
 none the less. This is true in spiritual matters as well.</p><p>While the =
external cannot compel the internal, it can allure the internal with certai=
n delights, thus seduce the internal into accepting the evidence before it.=
 However, when this happens, the internal is actually assenting to the exte=
rnal, and thus leads the external, so we cannot say that compulsion has tak=
en place.</p><p>The effect of this upon worship is that our relationship wi=
th the Lord must be free. People ought to worship the Lord because from wit=
hin they see value to it, and wish to worship. </p><p>"Worship that is forc=
ed is corporeal, lifeless, vague and gloomy; corporeal because it is of the=
 body and not of the mind, lifeless because there is no life in it, vague b=
ecause there is no understanding in it, and gloomy because there is no heav=
enly delight in it. On the other hand, worship that is not forced, when it =
is genuine, is spiritual, living, clear and joyful; spiritual because there=
 is spirit from the Lord in it, living because there is life from the Lord =
in it, clear because there is wisdom from the Lord in it, and joyful becaus=
e there is heaven from the Lord in it" (DP 137.)</p><p>NO REFORMATION WITHO=
UT RATIONALITY OR LIBERTY</p><p>As a consequence of this we are given a gen=
uine rule: if miracles, visions and conversations with the dead compel the =
external and take away spiritual freedom, then</p><p>"No one is reformed in=
 states that are not of rationality and liberty" (DP 138).</p><p>This rule,=
 while applying to the states above, also apply to other times in our lives=
 when we are compelled. Many people when faced with situations of extreme f=
ear or misfortune cry out to the Lord for help, for the moment they put the=
ir trust and faith in Him, imploring His help. But then, after the fear sub=
sides, so also their faith subsides, and gradually disappears completely. F=
ear induces faith only so long as the fear lasts, and once it is past, the =
faith passes with it.</p><p>One great hindrance to reformation is a state o=
f ignorance and blindness in the understanding. A person who is ignorant of=
 the Lord cannot respond to Him, and one whose understanding has been blind=
ed by a false dogma sees only the dogma, not the Lord. Thus the rational fa=
culty is greatly reduced, scarcely serving any function at all, for a perso=
n in ignorance cannot think rationally, and one who is blinded by a false d=
octrine is incapable of thinking for himself beyond that doctrine. The effe=
ct is the same as that of miracles, a stunted rational and deprivation of f=
reedom. These things compel a person just as effectively as miracles.</p><p=
>Healthy spiritual life, therefore, depends on a healthy body and mind, cou=
pled with a clear understanding of what the Lord is teaching us. Thus it de=
pends on a genuine rationality with the freedom to bring that rationality i=
nto act. Anything short of this takes away our freedom to act as a spiritua=
l being.</p><p>Each of the states given in DP 139 to 144 indicate certain t=
hings that remove our rationality. The interesting thing is that at some po=
int we all fall into these categories. This is a thought provoking concept =
- our rationality and liberty are interrupted during the course of life, no=
t by the Lord, but by our own ignorance, fear and general spiritual conditi=
on.</p><p>MENTAL STATES THAT COMPEL</p><p>1. State of fear: fear of loss of=
 honor or gain, civil or religious punishment (DP 139).</p><p>2. State of m=
isfortune: times of danger, loss of wealth, honor, etc. (DP 140).</p><p>3. =
State of mental disorder: melancholy (depression) spurious and false remors=
e, hallucinations, grief, or bodily related mental disorders (DP 141).</p><=
p>4. State of bodily disease: when the body is sick the mind is also sick (=
DP 142).</p><p>5. State of blindness of the understanding: ignorance of the=
 truth.</p><p>SELF COMPULSION</p><p>The only valid compulsion to faith is t=
he compulsion from within - a self compulsion based on a sight of the Lord =
drawn from rational thought, and from a desire to live according to it deri=
ved from the freedom implanted in us by the Lord at creation. When a person=
 learns from the Word, and confirms that teaching in his own life, then the=
 Lord forms a conscience within him. This conscience acts to remind us when=
 necessary to keep to the path of regeneration, to stick to the way of the =
Lord. At times we have to compel ourselves, literally forcing ourselves to =
maintain the life dictated by religion.</p><p>But this inner compulsion is =
different from an external compulsion: it arises from a different source an=
d has different effects. No one is led to reformation because of miracles, =
conversations with the dead or fear, because they compel a person, taking a=
way his liberty and rationality, closing the mind and blocking in the evils=
 which should be removed from our lives. But, when we compel ourselves, jus=
t the opposite happens, for we come into true states of freedom - freedom t=
o follow the Lord. Our minds are opened to inflowing life from the Lord whi=
ch vitalizes us and forces the evils loves to become quiescent, the evil de=
eds and thoughts to die down altogether. By compelling ourselves we literal=
ly turn ourselves to the Lord and place ourselves in His care, and the Lord=
, like a gentle shepherd leads us into the pasture so His kingdom. </p><p>T=
he faculties of freedom and reason, implanted in us by the Lord sets us apa=
rt from common animals. Because of these two abilities we can worship and f=
ollow the Lord - without them we can do neither. With them we can be reform=
ed and regenerated, without them we can respond only to our innate evil lov=
es. The Lord, therefore, protects these two great faculties by means of His=
 Divine Providence, and by protecting them, He also protects us from those =
who would take away our souls by compelling signs and arguments, for as the=
y Lord admonishes us:</p><p>"Do not fear those who kill the body but cannot=
 kill the soul, but rather fear him who is able to destroy both soul and bo=
dy in hell" (Matt. 10:28).</p><p></p><p></p><div align=3D"Right">7</div><hr=

&nbsp;Lecture Four d - The Laws of Divine Providence </p><p>INTRODUCTION</p=
><p>The quest for truth has led many people down paths of falsity, for bein=
g ignorant of truth at its source, they look instead to its effects and try=
 to determine the origin. So they look at the world around them and see the=
 state of the human race, the cruelty and injustice of a person upon a pers=
on, and instead of inquiring the source of these things, they blame an unse=
eing, uncaring God. The result is that they leave the things of religion, t=
urning their backs on God and turn to rationalizations and justifications o=
f the world. </p><p>Take the example of those who see the beauties of natur=
e, the complexities of created substances, but because of a childish unders=
tanding of God, disregard His involvement in creation, and so attribute all=
 of nature to some vague and blind force that by chance produced both the o=
rder of molecular structure and the chaos of a volcanic eruption.</p><p>It =
is common for people, in their search for truth to begin from natural and v=
isible things as an approach to the cause of things. When we learn any fact=
, we first learn the fact itself, then, when that is mastered, the underpin=
ning of reasoning and understanding follows. Thus it appears as if we learn=
 from the outmost inward. And yet this is merely an appearance.</p><p>The f=
ourth law of Divine Providence builds on the fact that if a person is expec=
ted to act from freedom according to reason, and in doing this remove evils=
 from the external being, and if the person only can compel him or herself =
to do so, then it follows that the knowledge of doing this must come from t=
he Lord Himself.</p><p>In a sense all knowledge comes from the Lord. In rev=
elation we are given the concept of Divine Providence, of freedom and reaso=
n, of self compulsion. We are shown the difference between good and evil, r=
ight and wrong. These knowledges from the Lord enrich the things we observe=
 in the world around us, giving us a heightened awareness of the Lord Himse=
lf and our relationship with Him. </p><p>FOURTH LAW</p><p>"It is a law of t=
he Divine Providence that a person should be led and taught by the Lord fro=
m heaven by means of the Word, and doctrine and preaching from the Word, an=
d this to all appearance as of Himself" (DP 154 - heading).</p><p>The expla=
nation of this law begins with the observation that this law runs opposite =
to the appearance:</p><p>"The appearance is that a person is led and taught=
 of himself, but the truth is that he is led and taught by the Lord alone" =
(DP 154).</p><p>If we give in to the appearance that we lead and teach ours=
elves, three things happen:</p><p>1. the person is unable to remove evils (=
DP 154).</p><p>2. the effectively worship other gods than the Lord (DP 154)=
.</p><p>3. the rational degree of the mind is unable to develop (DP 154).</=
p><p>In spite of these consequences, however, it still has to appear to the=
 person that he or she is learning the truth from his or her own volition. =
The law of providence states that this appearance is necessary, for "man sh=
ould be led and taught by the Lord... by means of the Word..." The appearan=
ce that we learn of our own accord and ability enhances the appearance of s=
elf-life so important to our freedom to respond to the Lord.</p><p>The real=
ity, of which we are all but intellectually unaware, is that our life is no=
t our own, it flows into us from the Lord, for He is the source of all life=
. Consider the following passage:</p><p>"Now, because there cannot be given=
 to a person, so long as he is in the world, the perception by sensation th=
at he lives from the Lord alone, since the appearance that he lives from hi=
mself is not taken away from him, for without it a person is not a person..=
." (DP 156)</p><p>Thus the Lord is the substance to our form. But He gives =
us the appearance of self-life for the sake of His end, which is a heaven c=
reated of those who freely receive His inflowing life.</p><p>The same is tr=
ue of learning truth and being led by the Lord. The appearance is that we l=
earn from our own ability, that from the knowledge we acquire, we determine=
 our lives and lead ourselves, even though at times we may acknowledge that=
 this is only an appearance. The reality is that all knowledge is given to =
us by the Lord, and that we are led by Him alone if we accept and receive t=
he things He has given us.</p><p>The explanation of this law gives us a det=
ailed description of the fact that although we have the appearance of self =
life, in fact "there cannot be given to a person, so long as he is in the w=
orld, the perception by sensation that he lives from the Lord" (DP 156), th=
ere still needs to be an intellectual understanding and awareness of the fa=
ct that this is an appearance. The reality is that our life is from the Lor=
d alone. Several reasons are given for the truth that our lives begin in th=
e Lord:</p><p>1. The first reason is that there is only one essence, one su=
bstance, and one form from which all things are derived. Philosophically th=
is means that all things originate in a one, and that oneness is the Lord H=
imself. He is the only essence, of life, meaning the originator, He is the =
only substance, meaning that all substances come from Him. His is the only =
form (the human form) and thus all other forms are "images and likenesses" =
of Him created by Him, from His essence and substance. Thus there is only o=
ne God who is the source of all things, and people are creations from the L=
ord.</p><p>2. The essence, substance and form of the Lord are His Divine lo=
ve and wisdom, and from these all things were created. Because we are creat=
ed from these things, in a finite form, so we have the imprint of them with=
in ourselves. The Divine Love is imaged in our will and our love. This in u=
s is the essence of our lives. The form of this essence is in the Divine Wi=
sdom, which in us takes the form of understanding and the wisdom or knowled=
ge we might have. Love always expresses itself as truth or wisdom. Thus our=
 minds are drawn from the Lord, and are images of Him.</p><p>3. As a result=
 of this, our minds are formed and shaped by the Lord. We receive His love =
in our will, and His truth in our understanding.</p><p>4. Since we can acce=
pt and acknowledge from observation that the real person within us is our w=
ill and through, thus our mind, therefore we can also acknowledge that if t=
he mind is a reflection of the Divine, that therefore our life is from Him =
alone.</p><p>5. Further, by acknowledging ourselves to be from the Divine, =
we can also acknowledge that all other people are also from the Divine. Thi=
s leads to the conclusion that the Divine is everywhere, omnipresent, omnis=
cient and omnipotent.</p><p>6. Finally we can see that this one originating=
 self, who is everywhere, and who created all beings, is the Lord Himself.<=
/p><p>Thus we are given from our reason to see that the appearance of self =
life on our parts is just an appearance, equivalent to the appearance of th=
e sun rising in the east and setting in the west, or the further appearance=
 that the earth is suspended motionless in space. </p><p>Now because people=
 are created from the Divine, it follows that they are also led by Him. The=
 Lord, however, in leading people preserves the appearance that we learn fr=
om our selves. To do this, He uses the angels who spiritual accompany us.</=
p><p>THE ROLE OF ANGELS</p><p>According to appearances, we turn to the Word=
 as the source of knowledge and leading, we actually turn to the Lord, for =
the Lord is the Word, He is the Divine Truth, that once was made flesh and =
dwelt among us. He speaks through the Word to us. As we read and learn the =
things He teaches there, we open our hearts and minds to Him, enabling His =
influence to come down into our gestures and actions. Thus the Lord leads u=
s from the level of effects, from our everyday thoughts and feelings, to th=
e degree of causes, to an understanding of, and a control over, the loves a=
nd affections which give rise to the effects. And so the Lord is able to in=
fluence our lives by means of His truth.</p><p>This process, of course does=
 not happen without intermediate steps and degrees through which the truth,=
 descending from the Lord is gradually brought into a form that we, in our =
external states can receive and accept. Each of these accommodations is so =
carefully governed by this law of providence that without the revelation gi=
ven to the New Church we would be entirely ignorant of them.</p><p>The role=
 played by the angelic heavens in our learning from the Word and being led =
by it is considerable. We are told that:</p><p>"Man is led and taught by th=
e Lord alone through the angelic heaven and from it." (DP 162)</p><p>The Lo=
rd uses the angelic heaven, because He is in heaven: </p><p>"... as the sou=
l is in a person... in like manner He is in every society of heaven and als=
o in every angel there; for a person's soul is not only the soul of the who=
le person but also the soul of every part" (DP 162).</p><p>It is frequently=
 taught in the Writings that the Lord sees the whole of heaven as if it wer=
e one person, and so governs heaven as one person. By being the soul within=
 heaven, He is in the whole and in all parts, just as our soul is within th=
e whole and each part of our bodies. In DP 164 we are shown how each person=
 in this world receive the Lord and have a place in the spiritual world det=
ermined by our reception of Him. In that place we are ruled and governed by=
 the Lord. </p><p>It is generally known in the New Church that each part of=
 the Word is associated with and corresponds to some society in heaven. As =
we read the Word and learn from it, so we are brought into association with=
 the angelic societies who influence us, as the soul inflows into and gives=
 life to the body. Thus the Word brings us into the presence, and sphere of=
 heaven, putting to flight the evil spirits who infest our hereditary and a=
ctual evils. </p><p>But the heavens do not act from their own will and unde=
rstanding. The Lord, acting through the angels acts directly into our lives=
. It is His love and wisdom that makes heaven, it is His power that conquer=
s the evil spirits, but He uses the ministrations of angels to protect a pe=
rson from the full force of His love, for the Lord desires nothing else tha=
n to bring all people into heaven, for this reason He created, and for this=
 reason He established the laws of providence that a person might freely of=
 his own accord turn to and respond to the Lord. Without the intermediate a=
ngels, we would be caught up by the Divine Love and lifted into heaven, whe=
ther we wished it or not, with the result that the end of creation would be=
 thwarted.</p><p>INFLUX AND ENLIGHTENMENT</p><p>But all these things happen=
 above our conscious realm. We can neither influence nor change them, for t=
hey are patterns of influx set into place by the Lord, and entrenched in Hi=
s providence. The Lord leading it still more directly, for as we read and l=
earn from His Word, as we enter the angelic sphere, so the influx from the =
Lord touches our both our will and our understanding.</p><p>Truth, presente=
d in the Word, appeals to our understanding, as it is learned. The things o=
f our understanding, however, do not enter into our lives, there are many t=
hings we know about, but for which we have no affection. We may know about =
the horrors of war, or the brutality of crime, we may understand how these =
things come about. But as we have no affection for them, they do not enter =
into our lives - they are knowledges dissociated from us, even though they =
are, so to speak, within us.</p><p>The same is true of truth. No matter how=
 much we learn truth, it remains "outside" us until an affection for it is =
formed. Thus the Lord flows into our will and kindles within us a desire fo=
r the truth, a desire to learn more, to absorb into our very makeup the thi=
ngs we have learnt. In this way the Lord leads us from without, by means of=
 the truths of the Word entering into our understanding, and from within, b=
y an influx into our will which causes us to accept the things given to us.=
 So the will and the understanding are united by the Lord, and we are led i=
nto our place in heaven.</p><p>"The term influx is used because it is custo=
mary to say that the soul flows into the body; and ... influx is spiritual =
and not physical; and a person's soul or life is his love or will. The term=
 is used also because influx is comparatively like the flow of blood into t=
he heart and from the heart into the lungs" (DP 165).</p><p>The influx from=
 the Lord into our will is also an influx into our understanding, for the w=
ill flows into and colors the things we see and hear. If, for example, we h=
ear something we like, we will have little difficulty in assimilating that =
new knowledge into our lives. But if we have no affection for the things we=
 hear, they are as water of a ducks back.</p><p>The Lord's influx into our =
will, acting into the understanding, affects our understanding. The result =
is enlightenment. As we the continue to learn, so the Lord enlightens us, H=
e gives us the ability to see the use, the goodness of the things we are le=
arning, He shows us ways to apply these according to the wisdom gradually d=
eveloping in our rational minds.</p><p>Enlightenment is spiritual light, re=
sulting from the light of the spiritual sun, that is, Divine truth, enterin=
g our minds:</p><p>"There is spiritual light and there is natural light; an=
d both are alike in external but unlike in internal appearance; for natural=
 light is from the sun of the natural world, and consequently in itself is =
dead, while spiritual light is from the Sun of the spiritual world, and con=
sequently in itself is living. It is this spiritual light and not natural l=
ight that enlightens the human understanding" (DP 166).</p><p>It also needs=
 to be pointed out that hell also has a light which attracts us in this wor=
ld, and which influences our minds. Hellish light is completely different f=
rom heavenly light. Hellish light is really darkness, and produces a darkne=
ss on the mind. </p><p>The influx of spiritual or heavenly light from the L=
ord, and the resulting enlightenment, however, is only received by the pers=
on who wishes to receive it. "The light a person has is such as his underst=
anding is" (DP 167). The person who reads the Word and who allows himself t=
o be affected by it will receive, the person who is impervious to its teach=
ings, or who reads the Word only to confirm some previously held doctrine, =
will not. The person who shuns evils as sins against the Lord as a result o=
f being so taught, opens himself to the Lord, but he who ignores the teachi=
ngs concerning charity closes himself off to the Lord.</p><p>It follows, th=
erefore, that there are different types of enlightenment:</p><p>1.&nbsp;Int=
erior enlightenment from the Lord: | 2. Exterior enlightenment from the Lor=
d: </p><p>*a percept |* enlightenment of <br>relating to God. |thought from=
 interior<br>| enlightenment. <br>|* sees issues from <br>|sides (valid and=
 invalid)<br>|<br>3.Interior enlightenment from |4. External enlightenment =
<br>man: |from man: <br>*things seen from one |* speaks only from know-</p>=
<p>side only. |ledge in the memory. <br>*sight closed by |* confirms what o=
thers </p><p>falsity. | have said.</p><p>"Such are the differences of enlig=
htenment, and consequently of perception and thought. There is an actual en=
lightenment from spiritual light; but the enlightenment itself from that li=
ght does not appear in common with spiritual light. This enlightenment, how=
ever, has sometimes appeared to me in the spiritual world, being visible in=
 the case of those who are in enlightenment from the Lord as a luminous app=
earance around the head, glowing with the color of the human face. But in t=
he case of those who were in enlightenment from themselves, this luminous a=
ppearance was not about the heat, but about the mouth and over the chin" (D=
P 169).</p><p>WAYS OF LEARNING THE TRUTH</p><p>It follows then, that respon=
se to the Word is an all important factor in our response to the Lord, for =
the Word is the Lord speaking to us, leading and guiding us. The more we tu=
rn to the Lord, the more we are able to receive Him.</p><p>There are many t=
eachings in the Heavenly Doctrines that speak of the importance of learning=
 knowledges. There is a direct relationship between understanding the Lord,=
 being aware of His operation, as well as our personal religious responsibi=
lities and our ability to turn to Him. Ignorance gives rise to evil. If tha=
t ignorance comes about from circumstance, then the evil can be remedied in=
 the World of Spirits. But if we fall into evil because we have been remiss=
 in taking what the Lord has freely and lovingly given us, then the ignoran=
ce arises not from circumstances, but from our own negligence.</p><p>Learni=
ng the truth does not mean that one has to be a doctrinal scholar. There ar=
e those who have the ability, and the opportunity to study the Word for the=
mselves, and these people are encouraged to do so. But the Lord also makes =
provision for those who are not so able, those who do not have the ability,=
 nor the time, nor the resources to draw for themselves doctrine from the W=
ord. We are told that:</p><p>"Man is taught by the Lord by means of the Wor=
d, and by doctrine and preaching from the Word, and thus immediately from H=
imself alone" (DP 171).</p><p>The Lord teaches us by means of the Word beca=
use He is the Word, it is from Him and treats of Him.</p><p>"Now since the =
Word is from the Lord alone and treats of the Lord alone, it follows that w=
hen a person is taught from the Word he is taught from the Lord, for the Wo=
rd is Divine. Who can communicate the Divine and implant it in the heart ex=
cept the Divine Himself from whom it is derived and of whom it treats?" (DP=
 172:2)</p><p>The Lord teaches us from the Word "because it is the Divine T=
ruth of the Divine Good", and that in fact is the Lord Himself, for He comm=
unicates His Divine Good to us by means of His Divine Truth. The conclusion=
 in DP 172 is that </p><p>"to be taught by the Word is to be taught by the =
Lord Himself... the fact that this is done mediately by preaching does not =
destroy its immediate nature."</p><p>Thus the Lord provides that all people=
 may be taught by means of doctrine and preaching from the Word. Doctrine, =
drawn by those with the resources and communicated to those without opportu=
nity to draw it for themselves. Preaching at services of worship serve to i=
nstruct people about the truth.</p><p>"The Word can only be taught mediatel=
y through parents, teachers, preachers, books and especially through the re=
ading of it. Nevertheless it is not taught by these, but by the Lord throug=
h them" (DP 172:6).</p><p>The wonderful thing is that even though doctrinal=
 teachings and sermons are produced from a human understanding of the Word,=
 when they contain the Divine truth within them, the Lord can still use tha=
t truth to lead the person. The truth still affects his understanding. The =
Lord still flows into his will, and the person is enlightened by the Lord a=
nd led to the life of goodness.</p><p>PEOPLE TAUGHT AS IF FROM SELF</p><p>T=
he Lord's end of creation is a heaven from a human race. Each one of us is =
beautifully and carefully formed to be able to come into that heaven. We ar=
e provided with the ability to learn in freedom and to act according to tha=
t knowledge, but it is the Lord who provides us with the knowledge, with th=
e incentive to act. But the decision must be our own. We have the responsib=
ility to learn what the Lord has to teach, and to apply it as well as we ar=
e able. The Lord does the rest.</p><p>"No one knows how the Lord leads and =
teaches a person in his internal just as no one knows how the soul operates=
 to cause the eye to see, the ear to hear, the tongue and mouth to speak, t=
he heart to keep the blood in motion, the lungs to breathe, the stomach to =
digest, the liver and the pancreas to distribute, the kidneys to secrete an=
d countless other things. These things do not come within a person's percep=
tion and sensation. The same is true of what id done by the Lord in the int=
erior substances and forms of the mind, which are infinitely more numerous.=
 The Lord's operations in these are not apparent to a person; but many of t=

&nbsp;Lecture Four e - The Laws of Divine Providence </p><p>INTRODUCTION</p=
><p>In tracing the Laws of Divine Providence, we are shown clearly how the =
Lord's government by means of good and truth has to be received by a person=
 in total freedom. The focus of the five laws is individual spiritual freed=
om, instilled in us by creation, and fixed in our minds by the way in which=
 we receive the Lord's teaching. Nothing can alter that freedom, nothing na=
tural or spiritual. We are, as it were, independent of the Lord. (In realit=
y this independence is an appearance, but one so necessary that without it =
the entire structure of creation would fall.</p><p>The final law of Provide=
nce, then, is a natural conclusion to all the previous ones. Just as the fi=
rst law, which states that a person must needs act from freedom according t=
o reason, defines our relationship with the Lord, so the final law sets the=
 seal on everything before it.</p><p>FIFTH LAW</p><p>"It is a law of the Di=
vine Providence that a person should not perceive and feel anything of the =
operation of the Divine Providence, but still that he should know and ackno=
wledge it" (DP 175 - heading).</p><p>In the Word we are told the story of N=
aaman the Syrian who suffered from leprosy. Hoping to be cured he sent a hu=
ge gift to the prophet Elisha, asking for advice. Elisha told him to go and=
 wash seven times in the river Jordan. At first Naaman was furious, asking =
whether the waters of Syria were not better than those of Israel. What good=
 would it do him to wash in the Jordan. As his servant begged him to wash i=
n the river, his refusal gradually gave way to agreement. When he finally w=
ash, his leprosy left him, and he was made clean. Naaman's disbelief was tu=
rned into belief in the Lord. (2 Kings 5)</p><p>When he was raging about th=
e perfidy of Elisha, Naaman could not have known that the Lord was leading =
him through his completely negative state to a point when he could say with=
 utter sincerity "Now I KNOW that there is no God in all the earth, except =
in Israel". The Lord had allowed Naaman his rage, he allowed him to turn aw=
ay from the advice He had given to the Syrian by way of Elisha, because whe=
n Naaman finally obeyed the Lord, and put his faith in Him, he did it from =
his own freedom, according to his own reason.</p><p>One can empathize with =
Naaman, for we are often told things, or told to do things by the Lord thro=
ugh the Word. Frequently they are things we don't like, actions which seem =
to run contrary to popular opinion. Naaman must have thought he would look =
like a fool, trying to wash away leprosy in the Jordan river. Some of the t=
hings the Lord asks us to do may seem to make us look like fools in our eye=
s, or in the sight of others.</p><p>Is not foolish to reserve oneself for o=
ne's married partner, when all the world lives in a state of promiscuity? A=
t first it may seem so, but as the Lord promised Naaman that he would be cl=
ean if he washed in the Jordan, so he promises in the Word that marriage lo=
ve is enhanced and made holy when the partners have waited until after thei=
r wedding to consummate their wedding.</p><p>Is it not foolish to come into=
 the house of the Lord to worship and be instructed, when all the world is =
playing and recreating? At first glance it may appear to be. But the Lord c=
ompares His Word to a rock, and it is a wise man who builds his house on th=
e rock of truth.</p><p>There are many things that the Lord asks us to do th=
at run contrary to the practices of the world. And, at times, like Naaman, =
we are tempted not to observe them, but the Lord asks us to obey and listen=
 for a reason: because when we do He can lead us out of a state of real foo=
lishness into true wisdom.</p><p>It is a law of Divine Providence that we c=
annot feel the Lord's leading. He gives us a command. Often the world aroun=
d us gives us a counter proposal - one which appeals to our natural man and=
 gives us the idea that if we give in to it, it would make us feel good, or=
 look good to those around us. So we are caught between two points of view,=
 and although the Lord is leading us, we can't feel His leadership. We have=
 to make up our own minds: will we follow the Lord, or will we follow the w=
orld?</p><p>In Divine Providence, two different types of people are describ=
ed:</p><p>Natural People</p><p>1. Does not believe in Divine Providence.</p=
><p>2. Reasons negatively about Providence.</p><p>3. Judges from the senses=
.</p><p>4. Ascribes nothing to God, by all things to nature.</p><p>SPIRITUA=
L PERSON</p><p>"The spiritual man, on the other hand, speaks and thinks wit=
hin himself quite differently. Although he has no perception in his thought=
, and is not sensible by his eye-sight, of the Divine Providence, still he =
knows and acknowledges it" (DP 175).</p><p>What would happen if we could fe=
el providence? What would it be like if we were always aware of the Lord's =
leading? Naaman the Syrian would have felt compelled to wash in the river. =
He would never have been able to rage against the Lord. He also would not h=
ave come, voluntarily, to the point when he was able to state that the Lord=
 is indeed the Lord. He would have been no more than a puppet.</p><p>The qu=
estion is answered for us directly:</p><p>"If a person perceived and felt t=
he operation of the Divine Providence he would not act from freedom accordi=
ng to reason, nor would anything appear to him to be as from Himself. It wo=
uld be the same if he foreknew events." (DP 176)</p><p>If we could feel the=
 Lord's leading, if we always knew what the Lord had in store for us, all o=
ur freedom of choice would be gone. We would simply react to the Lord's com=
mands. The freedom of choice according to our rationality that establishes =
and makes us humans would cease to exist.</p><p>The same thing would be tru=
e if we knew exactly what the Lord had in store for us. What would we do if=
 we knew that we would go to a certain society in heaven? Would there not a=
utomatically be the feeling of lassitude about our spiritual life? If we ar=
e going to heaven, why shun evils as sins against the Lord? Why not just li=
ve the way we wish because it does not matter what we do? Divine Providence=
 176 puts this most succinctly:</p><p>"... he would have no proprium, and s=
o there would be no imputation to him, without which it would be a matter o=
f indifference whether he did evil or good, and whether he had the faith of=
 God or the persuasion of the hell; in a word he would not be a person" (DP=
 176).&nbsp;</p><p>Or even worse, and just as likely we may decide that we =
are not satisfied with the spiritual home the Lord is providing for us, so,=
 in typical human fashion we will set out to adjust the Lord's plan, subver=
ting it to suit our own ideas on the subject.</p><p>And if we decided we kn=
ew better than the Lord where we should go in heaven, would we not be putti=
ng ourselves above the Lord, claiming to know better than He? Eventually we=
 would deny the presence and existence of God completely, which is spiritua=
l insanity, for "the fool has said in his heart, there is no God" (Ps. 53:1=
).</p><p>All these things would not only be possible, but likely, if we cou=
ld see the providence of the Lord. If we could feel His leading and see His=
 end for us, we would walk the long road downwards into spiritual madness. =
There could be no way out.</p><p>The passages in Divine Providence that tre=
at of this subject give us a clear reason why we cannot perceive and feel t=
he Divine Providence:</p><p>1. We would cease to be human (DP 176).</p><p>2=
. He would continually struggle against Providence (DP 177).</p><p>3. He wo=
uld either make himself God or deny God (DP 177).</p><p>"These and many oth=
er harmful results would follow if a person were manifestly to perceive or =
feel the operation of the Divine Providence" (DP 177e).</p><p>Not only are =
people not permitted to feel the operations of Divine Providence, but we ar=
e not allowed to know future events either:</p><p>"also for the reason that=
 he may be able to act from freedom according to reason; for it is well kno=
wn that a person desires to have in effect whatever he loves, and he leads =
himself to this end by his reason..." (DP 178)</p><p>The pitfalls of knowin=
g the future then are obvious: if one knew what would happen, there would b=
e no reason to act from freedom according to reason in an attempt to achiev=
e it. All delight in life would be taken away from us (DP 178).</p><p>This =
does not mean that we should not think about or consider the future:</p><p>=
"As a foreknowledge of future events destroys the human itself, which is to=
 act from freedom according to reason, therefore it is not granted to anyon=
e to know the future; but everyone is permitted to form conclusions concern=
ing future events from the reason; hence reason with all that pertains to i=
t enters into a person's life" (DP 179).</p><p>We would soon find ourselves=
 in trouble if we could not assess the future in some way - we would not pl=
ant in spring for harvest, nor plan retirement packages. In other words, to=
 not use reason to plan for the future is foolish.</p><p>Most people, we ar=
e told, would like to know what is going to happen, but for those who trust=
 the Lord, this desire disappears:</p><p>"A longing to know the future is i=
nnate with most people; but this longing derives its origin from the love o=
f evil. It is therefore taken away from those who believe in the Divine Pro=
vidence; and there is given them a trust that the Lord is disposing their l=
ot. Consequently they do not desire to know it beforehand lest they should =
in anyway set themselves against Divine Providence..." (DP 179)</p><p>It is=
 exactly to protect us from this that the Lord gives us the fifth law of Hi=
s providence: that we cannot perceive or feel the Divine Providence. </p><p=
>Another reason why we cannot feel Divine Providence, or know the future, i=
s that if we did, we would most certainly fiddle with it:</p><p>"If a perso=
n saw clearly the Divine Providence he would interpose in the order and ten=
or of its course, and would pervert and destroy that order" (DP 180).</p><p=
>Our spiritual life is as complex as our natural body, and bears a direct c=
orrespondence to it. However, just as the inner parts of our body are cover=
ed by the skin, and it is the skin that presents us to view, so our natural=
 life covers our inner, and presents that to view. As we cannot know the in=
tricate workings of our bodies, so also we cannot know all the intricacies =
of our inner beings. If we did, we are told, we would interfere with them a=
nd pervert them. </p><p>"Consequently, as a person disposes the externals s=
o the Lord disposes the internals, and this He does in one way if a person,=
 of himself disposes the externals from the Lord and at the same time as of=
 himself" (DP 181).</p><p>Thus we work in conjunction from the Lord, when w=
e allow reason to direct our freedom, the Lord brings about changes to our =
spirits - but we cannot feel those changes, we only feel the effects of the=
m as they relate to our external lives.</p><p>But, if we could feel the Div=
ine Presence, we would assume that it is a part of us, it is our power, and=
 thus we would usurp Providence. The effect of this would be to make oursel=
ves God, and ultimately deny the real God (DP 182). </p><p>"If a person saw=
 clearly the operations of the Divine Providence he would go contrary to Go=
d and also deny Him, because a person is in the delight of self-love, and t=
his delight constitutes his very life. Therefore, when he is kept in the de=
light of his life he is in his freedom, for freedom and that delight make o=
ne. If, therefore, he perceived that he is constantly being led away from h=
is delight he would be enraged as against one who desired to destroy his li=
fe, and would regard him as an enemy. In order to prevent this the Lord doe=
s not manifestly appear in His Divine Providence, but by it He leads a pers=
on as silently as an imperceptible stream or favoring current bears a vesse=
l along. Consequently a person does not know but that he is constantly in h=
is own proprium, for a person's freedom and his proprium make one. Hence it=
 is clear that freedom appropriates to a person what the Divine Providence =
introduces; but this would not take place if the Divine Providence make its=
elf evident. To be appropriated is to become part of life" (DP 186).</p><p>=
There is, however, a corollary to this law: we should not feel or perceive =
the Divine Providence, "but still, that he should know and acknowledge it."=
</p><p>Knowledge of and acknowledgment of Divine Providence is the willingn=
ess on our parts to believe that the Lord is leading us at all times. It is=
 an acknowledgment that all the Laws of Providence which precede this one a=
re active in our lives: that we should act from freedom according to reason=
, and that even when it seems that life is becoming unbearable, the Lord st=
ill preserves both of these faculties for us, so that we can, as if from ou=
rselves, shun evils in our external man, which allows the Lord to cleanse o=
ur internal. It is the assurance that even though no one can compel us to r=
efrain from evil, the Lord Himself gives us the wherewithal to resist in a =
state of temptation. We know that resistance to evil does not come from our=
selves, for we know the inner pressures to give in, but it is the power fro=
m the Lord to say "no". </p><p>Acknowledgement of Divine Providence is the =
knowledge that all the things we have been taught from the Word come from t=
he Lord alone, so that we don't have to vacillate between two principles, b=
ut need only to respond to the Lord as the angels do. </p><p>Thus we may no=
t be able to see Providence in action, but, we are able to recognize it onc=
e it has passed:</p><p>"It is granted to a person to see the Divine Provide=
nce in the back and not in the face; and this in a spiritual state and not =
in a natural state" (DP 187).</p><p>We are told that this means we can see =
Providence after it operates, and not before (DP 187). When we see Providen=
ce after the fact, it enhances our appreciation of the Lord's love for us. =
It also preserves both our rationality and freedom. If Naaman had known for=
 a fact that the Lord would heal him of leprosy before he entered Jordan's =
waters, he would not have had the freedom to act from himself. Yet, once he=
 entered that river and was healed, he could see the working of the Lord in=
 hindsight, and say with true feeling, "Now I KNOW that there is no God in =
all the earth, except in Israel."</p><p>CONCLUSION</p><p>These are the laws=
 of providence as the Lord has revealed them to us in the Heavenly Doctrine=
s of the New Church, and as we live our daily lives they operate unceasingl=
y, and mostly unnoticed, like a well oiled machine, efficiently guiding our=
 lives, step by step, so that the Lord can be present to give us help in th=
e bad times, leadership in times when we don't know what to do next. It is =
the assurance that the Lord brings good out of every situation, even the mo=
st painful or awful.</p><p>But Providence does not operate totally invisibl=
y. There are times when we can see Providence. We can imagine Naaman, ridin=
g back to Damascus reflecting on his new vision of the Lord. What did the t=
hink? Surely that the Lord was all powerful, that he would continue to serv=
e Him all the days of his life. Would he not also have wondered about his r=
eaction to the Lord? Of how the Lord, in spite of Naaman's rage, was able t=
o bring him into a state of belief?</p><p>And how often do we stop and refl=
ect on how often the Lord has guided us down the paths of life. How many ti=
mes has the Lord caused us to grow from some experience, both positive and =
negative. How many times would we have stopped a course of events that were=
 uncomfortable and threatening, only to discover years later that if we had=
, those events would not have produced the often wonderful fruit they did?<=
/p><p>We can see Providence from behind. It takes thought to see the Lord's=
 hand in our lives, but if we look, it is there. It does not mean that we s=
hould deliberately seek out evil, or abandon our selves to our lusts, but i=
t does mean that when our lives seem hard, that when it looks like every cl=
oud has no silver lining, the Lord is still with us, guiding us by means of=
 His providence. It means that these negative times will pass, and if durin=
g them we have lived our lives according to the Lord's Word as best we can,=
 we will eventually see how the Lord has brought good out of them.</p><p>Wh=
en we look back over our lives, and see the power of the Lord, He strengthe=
ns our faith in Him, so that when the next wave of temptation or combat aga=
inst evil rises up against us, we will be less likely to despair, for we wi=
ll have seen the Lord's work, we have seen His operation in our lives. We w=
ill not know as we enter into those states how they will turn out. The evil=
 may overwhelm us, there may be a great deal of pain for ourselves and for =
others. We may not see or understand why things will be like that. But if w=
e are to know and acknowledge that the Lord is leading us, He will lead us =
out of those states, and like a snake that sheds its skin to grow bigger, s=
o we will shed those temptations and grow spiritually bigger, stronger and =
more competent to face evil. </p><p>"The fool says in his heart there is no=
 God" (Ps. 53) for "It is a law of the Divine Providence that a person shou=
ld not perceive and feel anything of the operation of the Divine Providence=
, but still that he should know and acknowledge it." </p><p></p><p></p><div=

&nbsp;Lecture Five - Human Prudence</p><p>INTRODUCTION</p><p>In the previou=
s chapter we examined how in creating people in order to populate heaven, t=
he Lord made people according to a Divine principle (called the Laws of Pro=
vidence) which allows the human race the greatest degree of spiritual freed=
om possible. Each person is created with the ability to reason, and the fre=
edom to act according to that reason. Nothing whatsoever can interfere with=
 this, not miracles, nor anything else. This freedom allows each individual=
 in a state of total freedom to choose to accept or reject the Lord. Thus e=
ach of us is created in such a way that the essence of Divine Love, describ=
ed in TCR 43 can be fulfilled.</p><p>But the very freedom to reason and act=
 according to it, creates perceptual problems for people in this world. We =
are unaware, unless warned by Doctrine, that our life flows into us from wi=
thout. The appearance of self life created in us by the Lord is so strong, =
that we come to put greater trust and emphasis in our own abilities than on=
 the Lord's leadership. The result is that we think we know it all.</p><p>P=
erhaps it is simply to burst this bubble of illusion that the chapter follo=
wing the five laws of Providence, deals with our side of the picture:</p><p=
>"There is no such thing as a person's own prudence. It only appears that t=
here is, and there ought to be this appearance; but the Divine Providence i=
s universal because it is in things most individual" (DP 191 - heading).</p=
><p>The chapter begins in DP 191 with the statement of the strength of the =
appearance of human prudence. No one can argue with this: we think, we feel=
, we decide our own course of action, totally as if we were the source and =
origin of our own thoughts and feelings. For many people this appearance is=
 very difficult to overcome, and perhaps we can only overcome it by intelle=
ctual means. We were, after all, created to think as if our life was our ow=
n.</p><p>But we need to be reminded of our relationship with the Lord. In t=
he Writings we are shown that all thoughts and feelings flow into us from t=
he Lord (see appendix A - Thought). The manner in which feelings and though=
ts flow into us is described in AC 5846 - 5865. </p><p>"When this teaching =
is accepted it must also be accepted that there is no such thing as a perso=
n's prudence, but that it only appears that there is. Prudence is from no o=
ther source than intelligence and wisdom, and these are from no other sourc=
e than the understanding and thought derived from it concerning what is goo=
d and true" (DP 191).</p><p>Thus we are put into a position in which we mus=
t make a choice:</p><p>"Now either what the Church teaches must be true, th=
at all wisdom and prudence are from God, or what the world teaches, that al=
l wisdom and prudence are from a person" (DP 191).</p><p>In addition to def=
ining the dilemma in this way, DP 191 continues to ask if the two points of=
 the dilemma can be reconciled in any way? The only solution is to recogniz=
e that the Church's teachings are true, while those of the world around us =
are false. The remainder of this chapter is devoted to arguing the case in =
favor of the Church.</p><p>THE LIFE'S LOVE</p><p>The argument begins with t=
he concept of a person's ruling love. Love is the source and origin of all =
things. The teachings show us that in Himself, in His Esse, or Being, God i=
s pure, Divine Love. This love is clothed with wisdom, and, while the two m=
ay appear distinct in our thought, they are not, and cannot ever be anythin=
g but one. Thus the Divine Esse brings forth the Divine Existere, or in oth=
er words, the Divine Love produces Divine Wisdom. From this first principle=
, proceed all other relationships between good and truth, charity and faith=
, love and thought:</p><p>"All a person's thoughts are from the affections =
of his life's love; and there are no thoughts whatever, nor can there be, e=
xcept from them" (DP 193).</p><p>Human prudence is the thought drawn from a=
 person's ruling love, and thus is an effect of the love in one's life.</p>=
<p>There is a series of descending levels of good and truth in our lives, a=
lthough in the descent they relationship between them does not change. Cons=
ider the following:</p><p>"Now since the soul of the will is love and the s=
oul of the understanding is wisdom, both being from the Lord, if follows th=
at love is the life of everyone, and is life of such a quality as is joined=
 to wisdom; or what is the same, that the will is the life of everyone and =
is life of such a quality as is joined to the understanding" (DP 193).</p><=
p>Picture, if you will, life flowing into a person from the Lord, which is =
received in two faculties, or abilities. Life from the Lord's love flows in=
to a person's will, and from His wisdom into a person's understanding:</p><=
p>LORD</p><p>Love&nbsp;Wisdom</p><p>Will&nbsp;Understanding</p><p>The love =
and wisdom in our soul is too high for our perception, and therefore it nee=
ds to be accommodated to us. In this accommodation, the relationship betwee=
n will and understanding remains constant:</p><p>Affection</p><p>(Interior)=
&nbsp;perceptions</p><p>(exterior)&nbsp;thoughts</p><p>From this simple dia=
gram we can see how the Lord is the origin of all our conscious affections =
with their related perceptions and thoughts. </p><p>People in the natural w=
orld, feel their life's love as if it is there own, and thus also feel thei=
r thoughts as if the thoughts originated from within themselves, and we fee=
l pleasure at thinking and feeling. </p><p>"From this it is clear what it i=
s in a person that is called good, and what it is that is called truth; als=
o what it is in a person that is called evil and what it is that is called =
falsity; namely, that that is evil to him which destroys the delight of his=
 affection and that false which destroys the pleasure of his thought derive=
d from it" (DP 195).</p><p>Thus not only do we feel our thoughts and feelin=
gs as our own, but we interpret them according to their impact on our loves=
, affections and delights. The appearance is that all this happens within u=
s. We think according to our feelings:</p><p>"Now since it is a person's mi=
nd and not his body that thinks, and thinks from the delight of his affecti=
on, and since a person's mind is his spirit, which lives after death, it fo=
llows that a person's spirit is nothing but affection and thought derived f=
rom it" (DP 196).</p><p>Thus we see the beginning of the explanation as to =
why our prudence is nothing but an appearance. The explanation begins with =
the concept that we think in spirit according to our ruling love. Each pers=
on's ruling love is different, and that would account for the many differen=
t thoughts people have. Also, the ruling love is not fixed in this world, w=
hich explains why people's thoughts develop and change.</p><p>This lays the=
 ground work for the explanation, but still does not explain the appearance=
. But having laid this ground work, we can move on to the next proposition:=
</p><p>THE AFFECTIONS OF A PERSON'S LIFE'S LOVE ARE KNOWN TO THE LORD ALONE=
.</p><p>We can know our thoughts because we can see them. But, as we have j=
ust seen, our thoughts are the product of love, and love we cannot know! </=
p><p>"Since, then, a person sees his thought, but cannot see his affection,=
 for this he feels, it follows that it is from sight, which is in the appea=
rance, that he concludes that one's own prudence does all things; and not f=
rom affection, which does not come into sight but into feeling" (DP 198).</=
p><p>The thought process, which we call prudence, is really an effect arisi=
ng from a cause. We can only reflect on our feelings as they arise, and eve=
n then, we reflect on our external affection "while this delight is in harm=
ony with the delight of some bodily sense" (DP 199). The external affection=
s of thought show themselves in bodily sensation, for example, when we feel=
 drawn to something, or when we like or dislike something, and because they=
 find expression in our senses, we can think about them, and find ways of e=
ither fulfilling or rejecting them.</p><p>But the inner affections are hidd=
en from our view, and yet these inner affections are what produce the exter=
nal ones. The Lord governs us through these inner affections, thus governin=
g us in secret to preserve the external appearance of prudence. </p><p>Our =
prudence, then, is the most external descent of the Lord's presence with us=
: think of it according to the following chart:</p><p>Directly influenced b=
y the LORD</p><p>Will&nbsp;Understanding</p><p>Ruling Love</p><p>Inner Affe=
ctions&nbsp;Concepts<br>---------------------------------------------------=
-------------</p><p>Outer Affections&nbsp;Thoughts</p><p>(Prudence)</p><p>C=
onscious level in people</p><p>As we can see, the prudence we so highly est=
eem is the most outer degree of life passed to us from the Lord. The danger=
 is believing that our prudence is in the be all and end all of our lives, =
is that in doing so we cut out the Lord's direct influence in the higher, s=
ubconscious regions of our lives. He is active in those parts of our minds.=
</p><p>THE LORD ARRANGES OUR AFFECTIONS</p><p>The Lord's presence in the in=
ner affections and ruling love is something we are not conscious of, but, o=
n reflection makes a great deal of sense. We are taught that the Lord's Div=
ine Providence is in all things, thus it is a universal providence:</p><p>"=
But reflect within yourself what universal providence is when the individua=
l things are taken away. It is anything more than a mere word? For that is =
said to be universal which is constituted of individual things taken togeth=
er, just as that is said to be general which exists from particulars" (DP 2=
01).</p><p>In other words, the Lord's Providence enters into all things in =
creation, and in doing so, it enters into the most individual things, for e=
xample, our affections and the thoughts drawn from them. DP 201 stresses th=
e point that the Divine Providence is in every detail of human prudence:</p=
><p>"But the case really is that the Divine Providence is in the most indiv=
idual things of nature and in the most individual things of human prudence,=
 and from these it is universal" (DP 201e).</p><p>The argument is that if t=
he Lord was not in every detail of our prudence, then He could not be unive=
rsally present, and that concept is inconsistent with our belief in the Lor=
d. However, this subject raises other issues as well.</p><p>DIVINE FORESIGH=
T</p><p>If the Lord is present in every detail of our prudence, it follows =
also that He leads us continually as well. This can be understood because p=
rudence is the thought deriving from our external affections, which from a =
series of degrees are ruled by our life's love. Only the Lord knows this lo=
ve, and from His government of it, leads us in every detail of life. Thus t=
he Lord leads us on every plane of life, including in our thoughts (DP 202)=
.</p><p>Immediately this raises questions of human freedom: if we are free =
to choose or reject God, how can that be reconciled with the concept that G=
od is present even in our thoughts. Would this not remove our freedom, and =
so defeat the Five Laws of Divine Providence?</p><p>The answer is no. The L=
ord is present in our affections and thought, but still leaves to us the vi=
tal task of decision making. This is where the appearance of prudence comes=
 in: the Lord leads people every "fraction of a moment" (DP 202).</p><p>"Th=
is the Lord does in accordance with the laws of His Divine Providence; and =
it is accordance with these laws that it should appear to a person that he =
leads himself; but the Lord foresees how he leads himself, and continually =
makes suitable adaptation" (DP 202).</p><p>The subject of Divine Foresight =
and involvement in human prudence has baffled scholars for centuries. But i=
n Divine Providence we are given a new insight.</p><p>The Lord created each=
 of us to have the appearance of living from ourselves. This is the "as of =
self" principle, and its most external form is human prudence. At the same =
time, the Lord is present within every detail of our lives, including being=
 within our prudence.</p><p>How does this work? The Lord sees the choices a=
 person makes, as he or she makes it. Then He adapts it to serve the ultima=
te good for that person. Thus the Lord sees the persons choice made in free=
dom, and accepts that choice, for preserving freedom is one of the greatest=
 acts of Providence.</p><p>Thus the Lord does not "control" the future - He=
 does not predetermine what a person should do, but rather bends bad choice=
s into good, and strengthens good choices.</p><p>The result is that each pe=
rson is most fulfilled: those who choose a life of evil find a home in hell=
, and those who choose good are taken up into heaven. Our choice.</p><p>HUM=
AN PRUDENCE SEPARATED FROM THE LORD</p><p>We have spoken at length about th=
e origin of prudence, and the book DP has shown us clearly that our prudenc=
e is an appearance. It should be borne in mind that it is a real appearance=
, that is, something not detectable without thought. A similar appearance w=
ould be that of the sun rising in the east and setting in the west - we see=
 it every day, and unless someone had figured out that the world was round,=
 we would still believe it. It is a "real" appearance. The same is true of =
our prudence. We have to have the appearance that our life is our own, for =
this is the foundation of the reciprocal conjunction we have with the Lord.=
</p><p>But what happens when we live only in the appearance? The last secti=
on of this chapter deals with this issue.</p><p>When people are unwilling t=
o ascribe their prudence to the Lord, then they ascribe it to themselves. T=
he result is a denial of the Lord, for if one is unwilling to admit that th=
e Lord is present in one's life, then, by default, one denies Him. The thou=
ghts giving rise to this kind of reasoning is called "man's own prudence," =
as separated from the prudence which involves an acknowledgement of the Lor=
d. A person's own prudence</p><p>"... is from a person's proprium, which is=
 his nature, and is called his soul from his parent. This proprium is the l=
ove of self and the consequent love of the world ... It is the nature of th=
e love of self to regard self only, and to regard others as insignificant o=
r of no account. If it respects some it is only so long as they humor and p=
ay court to it..." (DP 206)</p><p>All prudence will be determined by the lo=
ve with brings it into being. From the description of the unregenerate pers=
on's proprium, one can see that the kind of prudence spawned from it is utt=
erly divorced from concepts of charity, or the willingness to be led by the=
 Lord.</p><p>This human proprium has to be compared to the leadership of th=
e Lord, which "enters with the affections of neighborly love, ... can cause=
s a person to see that there is a heaven..." (DP 207). People who acknowled=
ge the Lord become angelic, while those who acknowledge only their own lead=
ership pervert goodness and truth, and become forms of hell (DP 208).</p><p=
>It is up to the individual to choose which path he or she will pursue, for=
 in the pursuit of heavenly or hellish prudence, the Lord can then be prese=
nt leading the good and lessening the effects of the evil.</p><p>"From this=
 it follows that if a person as from his own prudence did not dispose all t=
hings pertaining to his function and life he could not be led and disposed =
from the Divine Providence; for he would be like one standing with his hand=
s hanging down, his mouth open, his eyes closed and holding his breath awai=
ting influx. He would thus divest himself of the human... without this appe=
arance a person would not have the power to receive and to reciprocate, and=
 thus would not have immortality" (DP 210).</p><p>Thus in designing the hum=
an race, the Lord provided that we should have complete freedom in spiritua=
l matters. His presence in our lives is substantial, but it is also hidden =
from us:</p><p>"The reason why the Divine Providence operates so secretly t=
hat scarcely anyone knows of its existence is that a person may not perish.=
.." (DP 211)</p><p>From heredity we are opposed to the Divine Providence. S=
hould we feel His presence, we would reject it:</p><p>"If a person felt thi=
s he would be enraged and exasperated against god, and would perish; but wh=
ile he does not feel this he may be enraged and exasperated against men, an=
d against himself, and also against fortune, without perishing" (DP 211).</=
p><p>In this way the Lord can lead us in freedom. At times we become aware =
of the Lord's providence, but call it fortune, as if it were something diff=
erent from the Lord. The appearance that we have prudence is so strong that=
 we take it for granted. Yet the wise person will acknowledge the Lord's pr=
esence, leadership and guidance in all things of life.</p><p></p><p></p><di=

</p><p>
&nbsp;Lecture Six - The Divine Point of View</p><p>INTRODUCTION</p><p>In th=
e previous chapter we dealt with the presence of the Divine Providence in o=
ur prudence. Human prudence drawn form the proprium looks downwards towards=
 worldly things. On the other hand, the Divine Providence, which directs an=
d guides our prudence, ignores worldly things, and looks continually upward=
 towards spiritual things. Thus chapter 6 of Divine Providence stresses thi=
s essential difference between our priorities and those of the Lord:</p><p>=
"The Divine Providence regards eternal things, and not temporal things exce=
pt so far as they accord with eternal things" (DP 214 - heading).</p><p>In =
order to understand how the Lord brings about a conjunction of temporal and=
 eternal things, one needs to first understand the terms, and secondly to u=
nderstand the process by which the Lord in His Divine Providence, leads us =
in our freedom and prudence, to the point at which we see the natural thing=
s of this world as serviceable to our spiritual development.</p><p>TEMPORAL=
 THINGS</p><p>Countless people, possibly all of us, spend a great deal of t=
ime and energy gathering up things in this world. We work to get ahead, str=
ive for possessions, long for recognition. Yet all these are temporal thing=
s.</p><p>The word "temporal" comes form the Latin "tempore" which means "in=
 time". We often talk of "temporary" things, and this should give us a clue=
 as to the theological sense of the word. Theologically "temporal" things a=
re those relating to the world of time. Thus the term has come to mean thin=
gs belonging to this world, as opposed to the spiritual world. When we die,=
 we leave the things of this world behind us and enter into a new life. It =
is well known that we "cannot take it with us" thus the things we have acqu=
ired are temporary, belonging to the natural world.</p><p>In the New Testam=
ent the Lord warns us against putting too much stock in temporal things. He=
 says:</p><p>"Do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth a=
nd rust destroy and where thieves break in and steal; but lay up for yourse=
lves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys and where th=
ieves do not break in and steal" (Mat 6:19,20).</p><p>In the book Divine Pr=
ovidence we are given a clear view of the kinds of things which inspire peo=
ple in this world:</p><p>"Temporal things relate to dignities and riches, t=
hus to honors and gain in this world" (DP 215).</p><p>The passage goes on t=
o show us how all things relate in someway or another to either dignity, ri=
ches, honor or gain. But the things themselves are neutral, it is how we us=
e them that is the spiritual problem. If we use them for selfish ends only,=
 then the effect of them will be one thing, and if we use them for the sake=
 of use, the effect will be another. In this chapter these two uses are tre=
ated separately from each other.</p><p>DIGNITY AND RICHES</p><p>The love of=
 dignity and riches has been gradually subverted as the human race turn awa=
y from the Lord. Initially people regarded dignity as an expression of love=
, and riches as a way of serving the family. But in time, the concept of di=
gnity became vested more in the person, as in a king or an emperor, and fro=
m this an abuse crept in: dignity was something to be protected, and to be =
lorded over other people. A similar thing happened to the concept of riches=
. Riches at first served the family, but gradually the importance of wealth=
 for its own sake crept in. Thus a lust of dominion over others, and a lust=
 for possessing other peoples things became dominant in the human race:</p>=
<p>"These two loves are like blood-relations; for he who wishes to rule ove=
r all things wishes also to possess all things; thus all others become serv=
ants, and they alone masters" (DP 215).</p><p>From this we can see how in t=
he subversion of dignity and riches the human race nurtured and fed a viper=
 in its bosom. As the sense of usefulness was lost, so the loves of digniti=
es and riches for their own sakes crept in:</p><p>"The love of dignities an=
d honors for their own sake is the love of self, and this in its essence is=
 the love of ruling from the love of self; and the love of riches and wealt=
h for their own sake is the love of the world, and in its essence is the lo=
ve of possessing the goods of others by any device whatsoever" (DP 215).</p=
><p>Thus we can see that when these loves run rampant, they give rise to ev=
ils of every kind. We can blame our crime rate on these two loves. Instead =
of looking to use, the person looks inward to selfishness and gain, thus gi=
ving his or her proprium an outlet.</p><p>Consider the following passage:</=
p><p>"... in the love of self dwells a love of doing evil. The reason for t=
his is that the person does not love his neighbor but himself only; and he =
who loves himself only sees others as outside himself, or as insignificant =
or of no account, and he despises them in comparison with himself, and thin=
ks nothing of inflicting injuring upon them" (DP 215).</p><p>Love of Dignit=
y and Honor for It's Own Sake:</p><p>*love of self which is the love of rul=
ing over others.</p><p>*love of world which is the love of possessing good =
of others.</p><p>*willingness to take another's possessions by any means. (=
DP 215)</p><p>Love of Dignity and Honor for Sake of Use:</p><p>*love for th=
e sake of and love of uses.</p><p>*love of the neighbor</p><p>*all other lo=
ves are subordinate. (DP 215)</p><p>Thus we can see the quality of the diff=
erence between loving worldly and natural things from a love for them and f=
rom a love for the uses they perform. Loving worldly things is the source o=
f the evils of this world:</p><p>"It is from this cause that he who is in t=
he love of ruling from the love of self thinks nothing of defrauding his ne=
ighbor, committing adultery with his wife, slandering him, breathing reveng=
e against him even to death, treating him cruelly, and similar evil doings"=
 (DP 21).</p><p>Human nature, as it relates to natural and worldly things, =
and divorced from spiritual things, is such that it does not admit the Lord=
's presence. Thus when the Lord looks at our lives, this side of us is clos=
ed off to Him. He can only be present in those things in us which belong to=
 Him, and which receive Him. </p><p>The result is that while riches, dignit=
ies and honors are in themselves neutral, the passion with which they are p=
ursued are not: it derives ultimately from hell or from heaven. One soberin=
g thought about the pursuit of riches, dignity and honor, is that if a pers=
on pursues them from a selfish motive, and yet does not commit the heinous =
acts of self love, nevertheless, those acts are potentially there:</p><p>"I=
 will add, that all who are in the love of ruling from a love of self, whoe=
ver they are, whether great or small, are as to their spirit in hell; and t=
hat all who are in that love are in the love of evils of all kinds, and if =
they do not commit them, still in their spirit they believe them to be allo=
wable, and therefore they commit them in the body when dignity and honor an=
d fear of the law do not stand in the way" (DP 215).</p><p>People who are i=
n love of ruling others, and who put on the facade of goodness, interiorly =
deny God. Their words of piety are on their lips only, and not in their hea=
rts.</p><p>"It is otherwise with the love of dignities and riches for the s=
ake of uses; for this is a heavenly love, because ... it is the same as lov=
e to the neighbor. By uses are meant goods; and therefore by doing uses is =
meant doing goods, and by doing uses or goods is meant serving others and m=
inistering to them. Although those who do so are in the possession of digni=
ty and wealth, still they regard them only as means for performing uses, th=
us for serving and ministering" (DP 215).</p><p>One problem we face is that=
 from our human perspective we cannot know other people's motivations: we d=
on't know if they are accumulating wealth, or running for public office bec=
ause they are in the love of self or the love of ruling, or if they are in =
the love of uses. </p><p>In one sense this gives us great freedom, because =
if we could know a person's motivation, then either all who were evil would=
 succeed, and those in good would be destroyed, or vice versa. It is even d=
ifficult in our own selves to know what our own motivations are:</p><p>"The=
 difference between these loves can hardly be recognized by a person, becau=
se a person does not know whether he is led by the devil or by the Lord. Th=
e person who is led by the devil performs uses for the sake of self and the=
 world; but he that is lead by the Lord performs uses for the sake of the L=
ord and heaven (DP 215).</p><p>Thus we can see how the pursuit of wealth, d=
ignity and honors are things belonging to our external lives, and are only =
touched by spiritual things if we act from a true use. The Lord cannot rega=
rd this part of us, but He does regard the motivations we have in pursuing =
them: if we perform uses, then He is conjoined to us in the uses, if we ind=
ulge our love of self, then He cannot be present in that.</p><p>The Lord do=
esn't care if we are rich and powerful, or poor and alone. His concern is l=
ess with the circumstances of our lives than with what we do under those ci=
rcumstances.</p><p>ETERNAL THINGS</p><p>While the Lord's providence does no=
t regard temporal things, it does regard eternal things. Temporal things ar=
e the things relating to this world, but eternal things relate to our spiri=
tual life: they are the things relating to love and wisdom (DP 216). These =
eternal things are true blessings (DP 216).</p><p>The difficulty people hav=
e in this world is telling the difference between spiritual and natural ble=
ssings. For many people natural riches, dignities and honors are blessings.=
 </p><p>"The natural man, however, unless enlightened by the spiritual man,=
 that is, unless he is at the same time spiritual, does not see that honors=
 and wealth may be blessings and may also be curses, and that when they are=
 blessings they are from God, and when they are curses they are from the de=
vil" (DP 216).</p><p>Blessings and Curses</p><p>CURSES</p><p>*Can't keep a =
person out of hell.</p><p>*They are curses when people set their heart on t=
hem.</p><p>*They lead people astray.</p><p>*They excite the proprium.</p><p=
>*They are fleeting.</p><p>*They perish.</p><p>BLESSINGS</p><p>*People do n=
ot set their hearts on them.</p><p>*Lead to love of uses, not of self.</p><=
p>*They lead to heaven.</p><p>*They are permanent.</p><p>*They focus on use=
, not on person. </p><p>*They attribute honor to the Lord.</p><p>From this =
brief comparison between eternal and temporal things, we can see that tempo=
ral things tend to lead downward, while spiritual things lead us upward tow=
ards heaven and the Lord. If we study DP 217 carefully, we find that the ma=
in point of difference between temporal things being blessings or curses is=
 the attitude we have towards them. If a person thinks that the work revolv=
es around him or her, that the dignity and honor pertains to him or herself=
, and that the riches rightly belong to him or herself, then that person co=
nfuses him or herself with the work being done. That person then takes the =
goodness of the use as his own.</p><p>This is very different from a person =
doing the same tasks who does not confuse him or herself with the work at h=
and. In these instances, the person attributes the ability to do the work t=
o the Lord, and gives glory to the Lord. The wealth brought in is not consi=
dered as the primary motivating factor, rather, the use performed is the ma=
in motivator.</p><p>Thus we see two people doing the same work, but from di=
fferent points of view: form one point of view the work done actually leads=
 the person away from the Lord, and is thus a curse. From the other, it lea=
ds the person to the Lord, and so is a blessing.</p><p>TEMPORAL AND ETERNAL=
 THINGS ARE SEPARATED IN A PERSON, JOINED BY THE LORD</p><p>We have alluded=
 several times to the fact that the Lord looks at those things in us which =
are eternal, and not those which are temporal. The temporal side of us is t=
hat relating to this world, and things in time and space. But the Lord does=
 not regard these things: He looks at the eternal. This, however, raises a =
question in our minds, because everything pertaining to us is temporal:</p>=
<p>"Temporal and eternal things are separated by a person, but are conjoine=
d by the Lord. This is so because all things pertaining to a person are tem=
poral, and from these a person may be called temporal; while all things per=
taining to the Lord are eternal, and from the Lord is called Eternal" (DP 2=
18).</p><p>We have already seen that temporal things are perishable, and it=
 can be argued that all things we do are perishable, because we are finite.=
 On the other hand, the Lord is infinite, and the infinite cannot be joined=
 with the finite.</p><p>How then does this reconcile this with the concept =
of God whose providence is universal, and is present in most minute details=
 - as we saw in the last chapter? The answer is that the Lord, in His provi=
dence is able to bring these together.</p><p>To understand this, let us rev=
isit the concept of temporal and eternal things:</p><p>1. Temporal things a=
re proper to nature, time and space, and have an end. They also find a plac=
e in the things belonging to people which belong to his own will and unders=
tanding, thus to the proprium (DP 219).</p><p>2. Eternal things are things =
proper to God, and in a person are things which appear to belong to a perso=
n, but really belong to God. They are beyond time and space, thus without l=
imit or end. They are devoid of the proprium (DP 219).</p><p>As far as our =
proprium is concerned, we are temporal, and since the proprium can produce =
nothing that is not temporal, therefore said that "nothing can proceed from=
 a person but what is temporal" (DP 219). Nothing truly good, derived from =
the Lord can be produced by our proprium:</p><p>"For the infinite [or etern=
al] cannot proceed from the finite [or temporal - ex. proprium]: it is a co=
ntradiction to say that it can. Still, the infinite can proceed from the fi=
nite - not from the finite but from the infinite through the finite. On the=
 other hand, the finite cannot proceed from the infinite; and to say that i=
t can is also a contradiction. The finite, however, can e produced from the=
 infinite, but this is a creating, not a proceeding."</p><p>So we are lead =
to understand that the Lord's presence in our lives is not present in the p=
roprium, but rather in the passage of the infinite through the finite. Thus=
 when we lift our minds above temporal things, and above the lusts of our p=
roprium, we are able to lift it into the level of heaven, and so the infini=
te can pass through us, coming forth into uses. </p><p>If this were not so,=
 then no one would be able to perform uses, yet uses in themselves are not,=
 cannot be, performed from the proprium, they are only performed from the p=
resence of the Lord in our lives.</p><p>Our pursuit of temporal things, esp=
ecially of riches, dignity and honor, leads us away from spiritual things, =
for, as we have seen, they open our proprial love of self and our delight i=
n ruling over other people. Thus we are told that left to themselves, "Temp=
oral things separate eternal things from themselves" (DP 219). In a sense w=
e cannot help doing this, because our proprial loves are in opposition to t=
he Lord, thus turning from Him to other loves within us which feed the love=
 of self and dominion.</p><p>But because we all incline towards evils of ev=
ery kind, and because from ourselves we have no ability to shun evil, it fo=
llows that the Lord leads us out of temporal states by means of His Divine =
Providence. The first is the appearance the Lord gives us that goodness is =
our own. </p><p>"The Lord conjoins a person to Himself by means of appearan=
ces. For it is an appearance that a person from himself loves the neighbor,=
 does good and speaks the truth, and unless these things appeared to a pers=
on as from himself he would not love the neighbor, do good and speak truth,=
 and therefore would not be conjoined to the Lord.</p><p>The second through=
 the Word, for the Word teaches us about the Lord, shows us the nature of e=
vil, and instructs us how to rise above the proprium and thus, from the Lor=
d's power, subdue it.</p><p>Thus the Lord shows us how to put off temporal =
things, where He cannot be, and come into eternal things, where He is. He d=
oes this:</p><p>1. AT DEATH a person puts off the temporal things taken on =
in this world, and is introduced into interior and higher things. He retain=
s "only the interior natural things which are suitable and in harmony with =
spiritual and celestial things, and which serve as containent. This is effe=
cted by the rejection of temporal and natural ultimates, which is the death=
 of the body" (DP 220).</p><p>2. THE LORD CONJOINS HIMSELF TO TEMPORAL THIN=
GS BY MEANS OF USES: as a person leaves this world, he leaves behind the na=
tural things he did, but retains the uses he performed, these are "spiritua=
l things that are similar in their external aspect or appearance, but not i=
n their internal aspect or essential nature" (DP 220).</p><p>3. THE LORD CO=
NJOINS HIMSELF TO USES BY MEANS OF CORRESPONDENCES. </p><p>The whole of the=
 Divine Providence is geared to this goal, of bringing a person into heaven=
 through the implantation of eternal things. If we only spend our lives in =
this world in pursuit of riches, dignity or honor for its own sake, without=
 consideration of the uses we perform, we close ourselves off from heaven. =
But, if in the pursuit of uses we achieve riches, dignity and honor, and se=
e these only as external trappings of use, then still we open heaven to our=
selves.</p><p>The Lord can conjoin Himself to us within this sphere of uses=
, and in doing this He fulfils the goal and aim of creation: a heaven from =
the Human Race. Each person is created for no other reason to go to heaven,=
 yet by creating us with freedom to accept or reject the Lord, we can choos=
e the fleeting glory of temporal things, closing heaven to ourselves, or we=
 can choose the permanence of Divine blessings. The choice is our own.</p><=

&nbsp;Lecture Seven - The Problem of Reception</p><p>INTRODUCTION</p><p>The=
 entire thrust of the work Divine Providence is that the Lord created the h=
uman race in order for them to populate the heavens. All the laws of provid=
ence work towards this end. If the Lord has His way, each one of us would b=
e an angel in heaven. However, He created us free to accept or reject Him, =
free to turn to good or evil. He protects this freedom with the entire forc=
e of His Divine love and wisdom. Thus we are told:</p><p>"It is well known =
in the Christina world that the Lord wills the salvation of all, and also t=
hat He is Almighty. Therefore many conclude from this that He is able to sa=
ve everyone, and that He saves those who implore His mercy..." (DP 221)</p>=
<p>The Lord has no greater wish than to save each and every person. But it =
is not true that He can save each of us. The reason lies in the freedom He =
has given us: freedom to accept or reject. This freedom is what makes us hu=
man, it is what establishes the reciprocal conjunction between people and t=
he Lord. In a sense it is what establishes heaven.</p><p>It also establishe=
s hell. Hell is the unfortunate result of the process of salvation for thos=
e who turn away from the Lord. It is the flip side of the coin.</p><p>SALVA=
TION ACCORDING TO MEANS</p><p>It is often thought that the Lord saves peopl=
e who simply pray to Him. One occasionally encounters people who attempt to=
 get one to sign a form committing themselves to the Lord. The signature on=
 that form, then, is "proof" of salvation. In the book Divine Providence, w=
e are shown how a mere verbal commitment is not sufficient. The Lord's salv=
ation is more complex than that.</p><p>Consider the following passage from =
New Jerusalem and Its Heavenly Doctrines:</p><p>"To repent with one's lips =
but not in one's life is no repentance. Sins are not forgiven by repentance=
 with the lips, but by repentance in life. A person's sins are continually =
being forgiven by the Lord, for He is absolute mercy. But the sins cling to=
 a person, however much he thinks they are forgiven, and the only way to ha=
ve them taken away is to live in accordance with the commandments of true f=
aith. The more he lives thus, the more his sins are taken away, and the fur=
ther they are taken away, the more they are forgiven" (NJHD 165).</p><p>The=
 point here is that the Lord saves people by "means", and the "means" are t=
he Laws of Providence. He cannot and will not override these - no matter ho=
w loudly we implore Him. </p><p>A person is led to heaven by a process in w=
hich he or she learns truth from the Word, and then, through a life of repe=
ntance and use, turns away from sin and incorporates the truth into life. T=
he truth as a guide to life becomes the good of life, replacing the previou=
sly held evils. Thus a person is purified and renewed, and lead into heaven=
. The Lord does not work apart from this process.</p><p>Individual people, =
however, try to circumvent this process. People learn truth, and instead of=
 incorporating it into their lives, they turn their backs on it. Understand=
ing this helps us to understand properly the process of salvation, but it i=
s only by living the Word in our lives that brings us into heaven. It is th=
e process of living truth which gives the Lord the means to save us:</p><p>=
"The means by which a person is led by the Lord are what are called the Law=
s of Divine Providence; and among these is that a person is admitted interi=
orly into the truths of wisdom only so far as he can be kept in them right =
on to the end of life" (DP 221).</p><p>WISDOM DOES NOT SAVE</p><p>If it wer=
e possible for the Lord to save us simply by having us learn a formula, the=
n certainly He would, because it would be so simple. However, we know from =
experience, that we can know many things which we do not love, and from whi=
ch we often turn. Thus while the Lord allows us to learn His Word, He prote=
cts us by making sure that it does not penetrate to the interiors of our mi=
nds until we can be kept in that truth to eternity.</p><p>Part of the proce=
ss of protecting us from profanation is to build a protective barrier in ou=
r minds so that we cannot truly acknowledge truth the moment we hear it, fo=
r if we did, and later turned from it, then we would profane the truth. Thu=
s we can see in the light of angels, but not feel the heat of their love un=
til we are sure to stay in it to eternity:</p><p>"A person may be admitted =
into the wisdom of spiritual things, and also into the love of them, and ye=
t not be reformed" (DP 222).</p><p>Our minds are created in such a way that=
 we can learn the very things known by the angels, as in fact we are doing =
now. But this knowledge does not necessarily change our lives. It is only w=
hen from a love of truth that we change, and live according to that truth, =
that the Lord can give us a lasting spiritual love of goodness and truth.</=
p><p>Truth itself does not change us: there are many people who read the Wo=
rd, know it by heart, and are yet unaffected by it. It is possible for us t=
o model ourselves according to the truth in external forms, and not change =
from our proprial loves in inward form. When this happens </p><p>"the inter=
nal in its essence is infernal, and the external in its form appears spirit=
ual, and yet, as has been said, the external derives its essence from the i=
nternal [which is hellish]" (DP 224).</p><p>When the person dies, the exter=
nal falls away, and the hellish internal is left. Thus the learning, the ex=
ternal acknowledgment of truth amounts to nothing. The person is shown to h=
ave been a hypocrite.</p><p>"From these considerations it is now clear that=
 while a person lives in the natural world he can be admitted into the wisd=
om of spiritual things, and also into the love of them; and that this happe=
ns and can happen both with those who are wholly natural, and with those wh=
o are spiritual; but with this difference, that the spiritual are thereby r=
eformed but the nature by the same means are not" (DP 225).</p><p>Thus the =
Lord protects us from the power of His truth. If He foresees that we will b=
e kept in His truth to eternity, He allows the truth to affect us internall=
y, but if He foresees that we will not remain constant in his truth, then w=
e do not receive truth internally. This protection is very important, for i=
f we learned truth, and it becomes spiritually our own, and later turn from=
 it, we commit profanation, which destroys our ability to enter heaven. And=
, since the Lord's goal in creation is a heaven from the human race, He pro=
tects us from this profanation at all costs.</p><p>PROFANATION</p><p>The re=
ason for this protection is profanation: a spiritual disease in which a per=
son, by turning away from the Word, actually closes heaven to him or hersel=
f. The worst kind of profanation is that of a person who is admitted into t=
he interior things of truth, and then departs from them:</p><p>"If a person=
 afterwards departs from these and turns aside into what is contrary, he pr=
ofanes holy things. There are many kinds of profanation... but this kind is=
 the most grievous of all; for profaners of this kind after death come to b=
e no longer men" (DP 226).</p><p>PROFANERS AFTER DEATH</p><p>The descriptio=
n of profaners after death shows us the Lord's real mercy in trying to prot=
ect us from this fate worse than death:</p><p>*they are no longer people</p=
><p>*they have fantastic hallucinations</p><p>*they are sexless</p><p>*they=
 appear like skeletons</p><p>"The real cause [of profanation] is that when =
a person at first acknowledges Divine things and believes in them and after=
wards departs from them and denies them, he mingles what is holy with what =
is profane, and when these have been mingled together, they cannot be separ=
ated without destroying the whole" (DP 226)</p><p>As one can see, profanati=
on is the total reversal for the Lord's goal for the human race - it is the=
 opposite of the life of fulfillment and happiness found in heaven. Because=
 of this the Lord goes to great lengths to protect us from it - although if=
 we choose to profane, the Lord will not prevent it.</p><p>How does profana=
tion arise? DP 227 gives a step by step account drawn largely from principl=
es taught earlier in the book. Let us examine the highlights:</p><p>1. What=
 ever a person things, speaks and does form the will, whether good or evil,=
 belongs to him and remains to eternity. (This principle was dealt with in =
#78 - 81 "What ever a person does form freedom according to his through is =
appropriated to him as his own and remains with him.)</p><p>2. The Lord by =
His Divine Providence continually foresees and disposes, that evil may be b=
y itself and good by itself, and thus that they may be separated. (see # 14=
 - 16 "The Lord does not suffer that anything should be divided; therefore =
it must be either in good and at the same time in truth, or in evil and at =
the same time in falsity.")</p><p>3. This cannot be done if a person first =
acknowledges truths of faith and lives according to them, and afterwards de=
parts fro them and denies them. When this happens goodness and evil cannot =
be separated, for they are joined together in the person.</p><p>4. He then =
mingles good and evil to such a degree that they cannot be separated: "if t=
he evil cannot be separated from the good and the good from the evil the pe=
rson can be neither in heaven nor in hell." (DP 227)</p><p>This is where th=
e problem of profanation then arises: for where shall the person be?</p><p>=
"Every one must be either in one or in the other; he cannot be in both, for=
 in that case he would be now in heaven and now in hell; and while in heave=
n he would be acting in favor of hell, and while in hell he might be acting=
 in favor of heaven" (DP 227).</p><p>As one can imagine, this would raise g=
reat difficulties for the person - it would lead to great spiritual pain an=
d distress. But the greatest problem is that the humanity of the person wou=
ld be destroyed:</p><p>"Since the good and the evil in every one must be se=
parated, and in such a person they cannot be separated, therefore he is des=
troyed as to everything that is truly human" (DP 227).</p><p>The person end=
s up with no freedom to choose between good and evil, and no reason. Thus t=
here is nothing left in the person which makes him or her truly human.</p><=
p>Because this is such a dire spiritual peril, the Lord protects people aga=
inst it at all costs. There are certain protections built into ignorance, e=
specially that a person cannot profane holy things if he/she does not know =
them. This kind of not knowing truth, however, is not a matter of not knowi=
ng details, but rather a matter of not knowing the full import of the truth=
s one has learned. </p><p>If ignorance itself was a protection, then there =
would be no point in learning truth at all. Profanation comes from mingling=
 holy things with "what is profane," and this is done by those who receive =
and acknowledge, and then turn away.</p><p>There are greater and lesser deg=
rees of profanation:</p><p>SEVEN TYPES OF PROFANATION<br>Type of Profanatio=

</p><p>
&nbsp;Lecture Eight - The Laws of Permission</p><p>INTRODUCTION</p><p>Begin=
ning in Chapter Eight, the book, Divine Providence, takes a different cours=
e than chartered before. Having laid the groundwork of why and how the Lord=
 created us, and having considered the things the Lord regards in us, the t=
hrust of Divine Providence now turns to the concept of human evil.</p><p>Th=
e issue of human evil has plagued Christianity almost from its inception. M=
any explanations have been offered, but these in turn bring up the question=
 of why and how evil came into being. It is sometimes implied that the Lord=
 created evil, or that He is in someway responsible for it. Reading Divine =
Providence so far, however, shows us that the Lord never created evil. Each=
 and every thing in creation, and in His government of it, is orderly, beca=
use the Lord is order itself. But, if the Lord did not create evil, where d=
id it come from?</p><p>The answer lies in the way of creation. While the Lo=
rd did not create evil, He did create each of us with a potential for evil.=
 He did this by creating us with a free will. The first law of Divine Provi=
dence is that people should act from freedom according to reason. The Lord =
does everything in His power to protect this freedom, including making prov=
ision for times when people exercise freedom for evil ends. People have the=
 freedom to turn towards Him or away from Him. By turning from Him, we embr=
ace a godless state, which, by definition is evil. Since the potential for =
evil is present in creation, it followed that as a part of the Divine Const=
itution, the Lord provided for the treatment of those who choose evil. Thes=
e laws are the Laws of Permission. </p><p>There are no laws of permission b=
y themselves or separate from the laws of the Divine Providence: they are i=
ndeed the same. When, therefore, it is said that God permits, this does not=
 mean that He wills, but that He cannot avert on account of the end, which =
is salvation (DP 234).</p><p>Evil comes into being because the Lord does no=
t prevent people, who, acting according to the freedom instilled in them, c=
hoose a life of evil. If He does prevent evils, then the entire concept of =
freedom is undermined, consequently the entire structure of Providence coll=
apses.</p><p>The aim of Providence is a heaven from the Human Race, and thi=
s aim is so powerful that the Lord never turns from it. By allowing people =
freedom, the Lord allows, or permits the abuse of freedom. However, when pe=
ople chose to act in evil ways, the entire power of providence then comes i=
nto action to maintain the individual's true freedom, with the aim of leadi=
ng him or her back to a heavenly life:</p><p>Therefore, as every moment of =
its operation or at every step of its progress, when it perceives a person =
to deviate from its end, it [i.e. providence] directs, bends and disposes h=
im in accordance with its laws by withdrawing him from evil and leading him=
 to good...this cannot be done without permitting evil (DP 234).</p><p>This=
 introductory passage ends with the following, and important, reminder:</p>=
<p>Moreover, nothing can be permitted without a cause, such a cause is only=
 to be found in some law of the Divine Providence which explains why it is =
permitted (DP 234).</p><p>Misunderstanding of the nature of the laws of Per=
mission has lead a great many people away from believing in God, and, if a =
person wished to, as unfortunately some do, one could deny God altogether. =
Consider the following reasons in Divine Providence # 236 and 237 why peopl=
e, when they see evil, conclude that Providence does not exist. We should n=
ote in advance that the reasons people give for not believing in God or Pro=
vidence are based on external things, thus the effects of certain things. A=
 belief in providence can lead one to see that each of these objections can=
 be explained:</p><p>Biblical Reasons</p><p>*&nbsp;Adam and Eve lead astray=
.</p><p>*&nbsp;Cain killing Abel.</p><p>*&nbsp;Worshipping the Golden Calf.=
</p><p>*&nbsp;David's sins.</p><p>*&nbsp;Solomon establishing idolatry.</p>=
<p>*&nbsp;The profanation of the kings of Israel.</p><p>*&nbsp;Crucifixion =
of the Lord.</p><p>Observations from the World</p><p>*&nbsp;The sight of wi=
cked people who are not punished.</p><p>*&nbsp;The triumph of evil over goo=
d in business.</p><p>*&nbsp;Wicked people being granted honor, wealth and p=
ower.</p><p>*&nbsp;Murder of innocent people.</p><p>*&nbsp;The character of=
 some esteemed leaders.</p><p>Observations of Different Religions</p><p>*&n=
bsp;Many people are ignorant of God.</p><p>*&nbsp;Islam is very strong.</p>=
<p>*&nbsp;Christianity is comparatively small.</p><p>*&nbsp;People claim to=
 be gods.</p><p>*&nbsp;People make salvation consist of certain phrases or =
actions.</p><p>*&nbsp;There are many heresies, and Judaism exists.</p><p>In=
 addition to the above things, which draw people away from believing in Pro=
vidence, there are several important theological things generally unknown w=
hich would help understand why there are so many apparent paradoxes in the =
world. However, since these things are unknown, the ignorance of spiritual =
truths leads further away from belief. The following passage gives four exa=
mples of areas where the Christian Church is generally ignorant of the Lord=
's teaching: </p><p>1. The whole Christian world has acknowledged three God=
s, not knowing that God is one in Person and in Essence, and that He is the=
 Lord.</p><p>2. It has not been known that in every particular of the Word =
there is a spiritual sense from which is derives its holiness.</p><p>3. It =
has not been known that to shun evils as sins is the Christian religion its=
elf.</p><p>4. It has not been known that a person lives as a person after d=
eath. For people say to themselves, and to one another, Why does the Divine=
 Providence, if there is any, now reveal such things for the first time? (D=
P 239)</p><p>From the combination of observation of the teachings in the le=
tter of the Word, from the world around us, and from generally not knowing =
the truth, we can see the dilemma of many people in the world around us. Be=
cause they do not understand the spiritual origins of things, they can only=
 judge by external things, and from this, when they see good and evil mixed=
 together, and evil often triumphing over good, they are led to question wh=
ether providence actually exists.</p><p>In a sense the questions people ask=
 are quite natural - we can only judge things from our personal knowledge. =
Similarly, we can also only judge things on the grounds of personal experie=
nce. If a person learns that God is just, but sees an obvious lack of justi=
ce in the world, then that person is likely to question the justice of God,=
 and perhaps even the existence of God.</p><p>It is to answer some of these=
 questions that the book, Divine Providence, having established the aim and=
 purpose of creation, and having stressed that God created people with spir=
itual freedom, now turns to address some of the questions raised by those w=
hose ignorance and circumstances in life have made them question.</p><p>ANS=
WERS TO THOSE WHO USE BIBLICAL ISSUES TO QUESTION THE LORD</p><p>1. Why did=
 God allow the serpent to lead Adam and Eve astray and not intervene?</p><p=
>The answer to this question is that Adam and Eve were not two people. In t=
he Arcana Coelestia we are shown that they represent the Most Ancient Churc=
h, which having been created good, were nevertheless created with spiritual=
 freedom. Unfortunately they used this freedom to turn away from the Lord, =
and thus the Most Ancient Church fell (DP 241).</p><p>2. Their first son, C=
ain, killed his brother Abel, and God did not withheld him at the time by s=
peaking to him, but only after the deed cursed him.</p><p>The answer to thi=
s also lies in understanding the spiritual sense of the Word:</p><p>"Since =
by Adam and his wife is meant the Most Ancient Church,... so by Cain and Ab=
el their first sons, are meant the two essentials of the Church, which are =
love and wisdom, or charity and faith. By Abel is meant love and charity, a=
nd by Cain wisdom and faith, in particular wisdom separated from love, or f=
aith separated from charity; and wisdom as well as faith when separated is =
such that it not only rejects love and charity, but even destroys them and =
kills its own brother..." (DP 242)</p><p>From this perspective we can see t=
hat the Word is not speaking of two brothers, but a state within people. Th=
us to argue that the Lord stood by and let Cain kill Abel is a misunderstan=
ding of the Word. In reality, the Lord does everything in His providence, a=
s we have seen earlier, to unite love and faith within a person. However, b=
ecause we are created with freedom, the Lord allows those who insist to ful=
ly separate faith and charity, thus Cain kills Abel within us. The curse of=
 Cain, involves the spiritual state into which those come after death who s=
eparate faith from charity... (DP 242)</p><p>3. The Israelitish nation wors=
hipped a golden calf in the desert, and acknowledged it as the god which le=
d them out of the land of Egypt. Yet Jehovah saw this from Mount Sinai near=
by, and did not seek to prevent it.</p><p>Again, this story, understood fro=
m the perspective of the internal sense, shows us that the Lord was indeed =
present in His providence. The children of Israel had carried idolatrous id=
eas from Egypt with them, and, in order to deliver them from this, they had=
 to be allowed to see the evil as evil, and suffer because of it. The Lord,=
 however, led them away from this evil, into a state of true worship (DP 24=
3).</p><p>4. David numbered the people, and in consequence a pestilence was=
 sent upon them, by which so many thousands of men perished, and God, not b=
efore but after the deed, sent the prophet Gad to him and announced punishm=
ent on him.</p><p>The answer again rests in the workings of Divine Providen=
ce. Remember two laws of providence:</p><p>a. It is a law of the Divine Pro=
vidence that a person should not be compelled by external means to think an=
d will, and thus to believe and love, the things of religion, but should pe=
rsuade and at times compel himself to do so (DP 129).</p><p>If the Lord had=
 warned David before his actions (which he knew to be wrong) David would ha=
ve lost his freedom. The second law to consider is as follows:</p><p>b. It =
is a law of the Divine Providence that a person should be led and taught by=
 the Lord from heaven by means of the Word, and doctrine and preaching from=
 the word, and this to all appearance as of himself (DP 154).</p><p>David k=
new the teaching of the Word, and yet choose to go against it. Thus he exer=
cised his freedom and reaped the consequences of that action. </p><p>But wh=
at about the seventy thousand who died as a result of David's disobedience?=
 It is sometimes argued that they died innocent. However, DP points out tha=
t their punishment was not because of David's evil, but from their own. Thu=
s each person is the cause of his or her own punishment (DP 244).</p><p>5. =
Solomon was permitted to establish idolatrous worship.</p><p>Again a knowle=
dge of the internal sense shows that Solomon represents the Lord, and that =
his seven hundred wives and concubines represent the many various and diffe=
rent churches which exist in the world which the Lord came to redeem (DP 24=
5).</p><p>6. Many kings after Solomon were permitted to profane the temple =
and the holy things of the church. </p><p>This represents the departure fro=
m and profanation of the church by people who turned from it. </p><p>7. Tha=
t nation was permitted to crucify the Lord.</p><p>This represents the final=
 state of the Jewish church when all goodness and truth had been destroyed.=
 </p><p>In all these above examples, if seem merely from an external, seem =
to show the Lord ignoring people when they were about to commit evil, and t=
hen punish them afterwards. The question, legitimately, is asked why He did=
 not intervene. The answer lies in the common element of each of these thin=
gs: the Lord always acted according to His providence, which stipulates tha=
t if people move outside of the boundaries of good, then certain consequenc=
es would follow. If He had intervened, then those individuals would have lo=
st their freedom, and so their complete humanity. </p><p>The Lord never int=
ervenes in people's lives to the point of removing or preventing evil. To d=
o that would be to deny the essential points of the Laws of Providence, whi=
ch is that a person must act in freedom according to reason, and nothing, i=
ncluding the Lord, will interfere with that.</p><p>It is not correct, there=
fore, to assume that because evil exists in this world that the Lord either=
 created it, or that He does not act against it. As said earlier, the Lord =
permits evils for the sake of an end, which is salvation, and therefore all=
ows evils to happen to the degree that He can bring some sort of good out o=
f it.</p><p>CONFIRMATIONS FROM THE WORLD</p><p>People who choose to questio=
n the Lord and Providence, look beyond the Word for confirmation that the L=
ord either does not care, or does not exist. The world around us offers man=
y examples of people whose lives are evil, and yet who seem to enjoy wealth=
, fame, power and the natural glories of life in this world. Divine Provide=
nce, as before, examines the issues one by one.</p><p>1. Every worshipper o=
f himself and of nature confirms himself against the Divine Providence when=
 he sees in the world so many wicked people, and so many of their impieties=
 in which some of them even glory, and yet no punishment of such by God (DP=
 249).</p><p>This point raises a real issue for many people. One often hear=
s people ask Why doesn't God strike so and so down? How can God let such ev=
il exist? Questions like these, without the guidance of Divine Providence a=
re impossible to answer. But the answer given is clear:</p><p>All impieties=
 and also the glorying in them are permissions, the causes of which are law=
s of the Divine Providence. Every one may freely, indeed very freely, think=
 what he will, both against God and in favor of God. He who thinks against =
God is rarely punished in the natural world, because there he is always in =
a state subject to reformation; but he is punished in the spiritual world a=
fter death, for then he can no longer be reformed (DP 249).</p><p>This pass=
age raises interesting points for us:</p><p>a. Our freedom is inviolate.</p=
><p>b. Punishment would take away our freedom.</p><p>If we think about this=
, we are reminded that human freedom is the Lord's greatest gift to us. It =
is what sets us apart from animals, and also which allows us to have a reci=
procal conjunction with the Lord. If the Lord punished us, He would take aw=
ay that freedom, because He would interfere with our ability to repent and =
be reformed, which can only happen from our own free choice.</p><p>So it se=
ems as if people are getting away with impiety, but in reality that person =
is on one of two roads: either he will reform, or he will not. If he reform=
s he loses the punishment. If not, the punishment is meted out in the spiri=
tual world, because that then becomes the only way in which the person can =
be kept in a state of order.</p><p>Evils as they exist in the world, then, =
do not happen in isolation, but as a part of the general working of Divine =
Providence:</p><p>That the Laws of the Divine Providence are causes of perm=
issions will also be clear from the following: Evils are permitted for the =
sake of an end, which is salvation; and from this: the Divine Providence is=
 continual with the wicked and with the good; and lastly from this: the Lor=
d cannot act contrary to the laws of His Divine Providence, because to act =
contrary to them would be to act contrary to His divine Love and Wisdom, an=
d thus contrary to Himself (DP 249).</p><p>Thus the Lord permits evil, and =
removes it from people by certain procedures or means, also prescribed in p=
rovidence. These means allow the person the maximum of personal freedom to =
think, feel, act and do as he or she wishes.</p><p>The Means of Delivering =
People from Evil</p><p>1. On a spiritual level: the Decalogue.</p><p>2. On =
a moral level: fear of loss of honor, reputation and gain.</p><p>3. On a ci=
vil level: fear of laws, penalty, loss of life. (DP 249)</p><p>2. The worsh=
ipper of himself and of nature confirms himself against the Divine Providen=
ce when he sees the impious advanced to honors and become great in the stat=
e and leaders in the church, and that they abound in riches and live in lux=
ury and magnificence, while he sees the worshippers of God living in contem=
pt and poverty.</p><p>A person who uses this kind of reasoning to turn away=
 from the Lord is one who bases the essence of life in material things. But=
, Divine Providence asks, what then are dignities and wealth to the wicked =
but stumbling blocks? (DP 250)</p><p>A good person, by contrast, does not s=
et his or her mind on these things. In reality, wealth and dignity are illu=
sions that soon loose their ability to uplift a person. In DP 250, some pen=
etrating questions are asked about the relative happiness of people. The co=
nclusion is that wealth, dignity and so on are not in themselves creators o=
f happiness. Happiness can only lie in the Lord's kingdom, which</p><p>"...=
is a kingdom of uses, and where there are but few who perform uses for the =
sake of uses, He causes worshippers of self to be raised to the higher offi=
ces, in which everyone is moved to do good by means of his own love" (DP 25=
0:3).</p><p>Thus we see that the Lord's Divine Providence looks to the grea=
ter good, and, in the absence of any one good, the Lord uses selfish people=
. Wealth and dignity, therefore, is as much a curse as a blessing, it bring=
s no happiness in itself.</p><p>3. The Worshipper of himself and of nature =
confirms himself against the Divine Providence when he reflects that wars a=
re permitted and in them the slaughter of so many people, and the plunderin=
g of their wealth (DP 251).</p><p>Again, people who use this kind of reason=
ing against the Lord, do not understand the true nature of things:</p><p>It=
 is not from the Divine Providence that wars occur, because they involve mu=
rders, plunderings, violence, cruelties and other terrible evils which are =
diametrically opposed to Christian charity (DP 251).</p><p>Wars arise becau=
se people are essentially selfish, and desire to rule over other people. Bo=
th individuals and nations are of this character, and, while individuals ca=
n be kept in a state of order by civil laws, it is often difficult to keep =
nations in order by international law. Therefore the evil burning to be all=
owed out must be permitted to run its course, until people turn away from i=
t.</p><p>There is a further reason why wars are permitted: because all wars=
 in this world correspond to spiritual battles in the next. All wars, both =
natural and spiritual, however, are governed by the Lord's Divine Providenc=
e, which is sometimes described as the fortunes of war. </p><p>NOTE: This p=
assage, DP 251, on war gives a good and clear explanation of the subject of=
 war. There are many other passages in the Writings which expand and elabor=
ate on this. Attached as Appendix A is a brief outline on some of the other=
 teachings about war.</p><p>4. The worshipper of himself and of nature conf=
irms himself against the Divine Providence when he reflects according to hi=
s perception that victories are on the side of prudence and sometimes not o=
n the side of justice, and that it makes no difference whether the general =
is an upright person or not.</p><p>One of the hard facts of life is that th=
e good guys don't always win! Sometimes justice looses out. However, we oft=
en get this perception because we judge from the natural world, and causes =
lie in the spiritual world. The Lord knows both the past and the present, a=
nd so is able to connect things. Remember the statement that the Lord does =
not allow things to happen unless He is able to bring some good out of it. =
</p><p>It makes not difference whether the general is an upright person or =
not, because, as was established above (n. 250) the wicked perform uses as =
well as the good, and the wicked from their own zeal with more ardor than t=
he good (DP 252).</p><p>Therefore there is not point in fretting about the =
spiritual quality of people since we cannot make spiritual judgments anyway=
.</p><p>DIFFERENCES OF RELIGION</p><p>At this point the focus of the chapte=
r changes to considering the many differences in religion. Many people turn=
 away from the concept of Divine Providence because they see many different=
 religions around them:</p><p>"But, I pray you, listen. All human beings th=
at are born, however many and of whatever religion, can be saved, provided =
only that they acknowledge God and live according to the commandments in th=
e decalogue... With such persons there is the fear of God and love of the n=
eighbor... Because such persons have regard to God in their life and do no =
evil to the neighbor, they are led by the Lord..." (DP 253)</p><p>This is o=
ne of the key points of New Church doctrine concerning salvation. In many o=
ther places in the Writings we are shown that people are brought into heave=
n, not because of what they believe, but because of what they do with their=
 belief. However, many churches teach that only Christians, or even only th=
eir particular brand of Christian, is allowed into heaven. Therefore when p=
eople hear these assertions, and yet see a multitude of religions in the wo=
rld, they turn away from the Lord.</p><p>1. The merely natural man confirms=
 himself against the Divine Providence when he regards the religious condit=
ions of the various peoples, observing that there are some who are totally =
ignorant of God, and some who worship the sun and the moon, and some who wo=
rship idols and graven images (DP 254).</p><p>When people put the onus of s=
preading religion in the world entirely on their own shoulders, they make a=
 great mistake: the Lord, in His providence, has provided that religion is =
able to reach all people:</p><p>For a knowledge of religion does not come t=
o a person from himself, but through another who has either learned it hims=
elf from the Word or by tradition from others who have learned it, as that =
there is a God, that there are a heaven and a hell, that there is a life af=
ter death, and that God must be worshipped in order that a person may be ma=
de happy (DP 254).</p><p>Thus religion is present all around the world, in =
a different form in each part of the globe. The diversity of expressions of=
 basic religious truth, however, it may seem a stumbling block to us, is no=
t so to the Lord:</p><p>When once a religion is established in a nation the=
 Lord leads that nation according to the precepts and dogmas of its own rel=
igion; and He has provided that in every region there should be precepts si=
milar to those in the Decalogue... Moreover, most nations remote from the C=
hristian world regard those laws not as civil but as divine and hold them s=
acred (DP 254).</p><p>Heaven is divided into many societies, which provides=
 for the wide diversity of people there.</p><p>There are a few who are tota=
lly ignorant of God. If these have lived a moral life they are instructed b=
y angels after death and receive in their moral life something spiritual (D=
P 254).</p><p>2. The merely natural man confirms himself against the Divine=
 Providence when he sees that the Mohammedan3 religion is accepted by so ma=
ny empires and kingdoms.</p><p>3. It is preferable to use the term ISLAM</p=
><p>Islam is a stumbling block for many people, especially when they consid=
er that there as many, if not more, Muslims than Christians in the world. T=
oday Islam is one of the fastest growing religions in the world.</p><p>The =
stumbling block, however, is removed, when one realizes that the Lord raise=
d up Islam to stamp out idolatry, and to bring truth in an adapted way to p=
eople:</p><p>"By the Divine Providence of the Lord this religion was raised=
 up and adapted to the genius of the Orientals ... to the end that it might=
 destroy the idolatries practiced by so many nations and give the people so=
me knowledge concerning the Lord before they entered the spiritual world. T=
his religion would not have been received by so many kingdoms with power to=
 extirpate idolatries if it had not been suited and adapted to the ideas of=
 thought and life of them all" (DP 255).</p><p>Thus once again we see that =
stumbling blocks to belief in the Lord's Divine Providence are only problem=
s if we look at them from natural and materialist points of view. If we tur=
n to higher causes and reasons, we are shown clearly that the Lord's provid=
ence is in charge of all things, and nothing happens without a reason.</p><=
p>3. The merely natural man confirms himself against the Divine Providence =
when he sees that the Christian religion is accepted only in a smaller part=
 of the habitable globe, called Europe, and is in a state of division there=
 (DP 256).</p><p>Again, this is judgment from external things. It does not =
matter if Christianity itself is small, because on a spiritual level the li=
ght shed from the Word is received in all other religions. The Word is the =
Lord's presence among us, and is received by anyone who believes it is holy=
. The division within Christianity is not of the Lord's making, but arises =
because people interpret the Word differently.</p><p>4. The merely natural =
man confirms himself against the Divine Providence because in many kingdoms=
 where the Christian religion is received there are some who claim for them=
selves Divine power, and desire to be worshipped as gods, and because they =
invoke the dead (DP 257).</p><p>It cannot be denied that He has permitted t=
hem for the sake of the end, which is salvation. For it is known that witho=
ut the Lord there is no salvation; and since this is so it was necessary th=
at the Lord should be preached from the Word and that the Christian Church =
by that means should be established (DP 257).</p><p>Many of the leaders of =
the church, however, turned away from the Lord's teachings, and instituted =
many things in conflict with the Word. The Lord allowed this, because if He=
 had not allowed it, those same people would have profaned Him and the Word=
. Thus He gave them the latitude to focus their minds on things unrelated t=
o Him, and protected them from profanation.</p><p>5. The merely natural man=
 confirms himself against the Divine Providence from the fact that among th=
ose who profess the Christian religion there are some who place salvation i=
n certain phrases which they must think and say and not at all in good work=
s which they must do (DP 258).</p><p>6. The merely natural man confirms him=
self against the Divine Providence by the fact that there by been and still=
 are so many heresies in the Christian world, such as Quakerism, Moravianis=
m, Anabaptism and others.</p><p>These two confirmations are basically simil=
ar, because those who raise them are often raising the question of why the =
Lord does not interfere with people, and put them straight on matters of re=
ligion. Looked at from an external point of view, this may seem a desirable=
 thing. Nevertheless, seen in light of the Laws of Providence, we can see t=
hat the Lord never interferes with people's beliefs, for to do so would be =
to go entirely against His own laws, which the Lord never does.</p><p>Yet i=
t has been provided with everyone, no matter in what heresy he may be with =
respect to his understanding, may still be reformed and saved, if only he s=
huns evils as sins and does not confirm heretical falsities in himself. For=
 by shunning evils as sins the will is reformed, and through the will the u=
nderstanding, which then first emerges out of darkness into light (DP 259).=
</p><p>Even the worst heresy generally does not blot out the essentials of =
religion, which are necessary for salvation. These are:</p><p>1. An acknowl=
edgement of the Divinity of the Lord.</p><p>2. An acknowledgement of the ho=
liness of the Word.</p><p>3. The life of charity (DP 259).</p><p>7. The mer=
ely natural man confirms himself against the Divine Providence by the fact =
that Judaism still continues.</p><p>DP 260 sheds interesting light on this:=
</p><p>"This nation has been preserved and dispersed over a great part of t=
he world for the sake of the Word in its original language, which they more=
 than Christians hold sacred; and in every particular of the Word is the Di=
vinity of the Lord.... This is the end which the Divine Providence has in v=
iew in preserving and dispersing them over a great part of the world" (DP 2=
60).</p><p>THE NATURE OF CHRISTIANITY ITSELF</p><p>One of the greatest stum=
bling blocks to belief in the Lord and Providence is the nature of the Chri=
stian religion itself. In the previous section we look at external aspects =
of Christianity, but now turn to more internal aspects, that is, the nature=
 of the dogmas of Christianity which create problems for many people.</p><p=
>1. A doubt may be raised against the Divine Providence from the fact that =
the whole Christian world worships one God under three Persons, that is, th=
ree Gods, and that hitherto it has not known that God is one in Person and =
in Essence, in whom is a Trinity, and that this God is the Lord (DP 262).</=
p><p>The objection many have to Christianity is over the nature of God: how=
 can one God be three, and three one? Over the centuries, many people have =
tried to answer these questions, and many have turned from the church becau=
se of the inadequacy of the answers given. However, the fault lies not with=
 the Lord but with people themselves (DP 262:7). Read DP 262 carefully and =
try to understand the argument put forward about how and why the separation=
 of the Lord into three came about.</p><p>2. A doubt may be raised against =
the Divine Providence form the fact that hitherto it has not been known tha=
t in every particular of the Word there is a spiritual sense from which it =
derives its holiness.</p><p>This knowledge did not come to the fore for two=
 reasons:</p><p>1. The spiritual sense would have been profaned.</p><p>2. G=
enuine truths could not be revealed until the Last Judgment had come (DP 26=
4).</p><p>The Catholics would have profaned the Word because they came into=
 a love of dominion, centralized in the Pope, and in their system of openin=
g and closing heaven. Protestants, would have profaned it by adapting the i=
nternal sense to the doctrine of faith alone. Thus the Lord protected the W=
ord from profanation, and thereby also protected the people themselves from=
 profaning.</p><p>3. A doubt may be raised against the Divine Providence fr=
om the fact that hitherto it has not been known that to shun evils as sins =
is the Christian religion itself (DP 265).</p><p>The reason this has been u=
nknown is because people have blotted it out of the Word by the doctrine of=
 salvation by faith alone.</p><p>The circumstance that the Christian world =
for the most part did not know this is from the Law of the Divine Providenc=
e that everyone is left to act from freedom according to reason... also fro=
m the law that no one is taught immediately from heaven, but mediately thro=
ugh the Word, and doctrine and preaching from the Word ... and also from al=
l the laws of permission, which are also laws of the Divine Providence (DP =
273).</p><p>4. A doubt may be raised against the Divine Providence from the=
 fact that it has not been known that a person lives as a person after deat=
h, and that this has not been disclosed before (DP 274).</p><p>This has not=
 been disclosed because in those who do not shun evils as sins there lies i=
nteriorly concealed a belief that a person does not live after death; and t=
hat therefore it is a matter of no moment to them whether it is said that a=
 person lives after death or whether it is said that a person will rise aga=
in at the day of the Last Judgment (DP 274).</p><p>CONCLUSION</p><p>From th=
ese considerations it can be seen that there are many reasons why a person =
should confirm him or herself against the Divine Providence. Each of these =
propositions approaches the subject from a different angle, each more inter=
ior than the last. Most of them show that confirming thought against the Di=
vine Providence, is done form an external and materialistic reasoning.</p><=
p>In the first group we examine those who think against the Lord for allowi=
ng the wicked to prosper within biblical settings, the second group turns i=
nwards slightly to the subject of religion, and is disturbed by wickedness =
in daily life. The underlying proposition of these two objections is that t=
he Lord should somehow have intervened and prevented the evil, and, because=
 He did not, they will not believe in Him. The answer, however, is that the=
 Lord allowed these evils to come about because to intervene would have bee=
n to go against His own laws of providence. Thus, rather than take away a p=
erson's freedom, and thus his humanity, the Lord would rather allow that pe=
rson to exercise free choice and take the consequences of it.</p><p>In the =
next groups, we see people who turn away from the Lord for more religious r=
easons: why are there so many religions, why is Christianity so small, and =
why is Christianity so ignorant.</p><p>In answering these accusations, the =
Lord shows us that the externals of religion are by no means a stumbling bl=
ock to a person's spiritual development. It doesn't matter what church a pe=
rson belongs to. In a sense Divine Providence here indicts the questioner b=
ecause of the negativity of his questions. All people can be led to God, an=
d the Laws of Providence work equally well in all religions.</p><p>As to th=
e state of the Christian Church itself, DP has some strong words. The Lord =
did not hold back the internal sense, or higher knowledge about Himself bec=
ause He wanted to keep Christians in a state of darkness. The reason was be=
cause He needed to protect them from themselves and their own propensity to=
wards profanation. Thus what externally seems to be a hard thing on the par=
t of the Lord, is actually an act of great tenderness and mercy.</p><p>Anyo=
ne can, if they wish to, deny the Lord's Divine Providence. There are count=
less reasons one could conjure up to show that the Lord either does not exi=
st, or is unfair, or has no regard for people. But each and every one of th=
ese reasons is based on external thinking. If one thought internally, one w=
ould come to see that the Lord allows evils for the sake of the end, which =
is salvation, and this in itself, is merciful.</p><p></p><p></p><div align=

</p><p>
&nbsp;Lecture Nine - Evils Permitted for a Reason</p><p>INTRODUCTION</p><p>=
In the previous lecture we looked at the concept of Divine Permission. It w=
as said in the opening passage that when the Lord permits,</p><p>"... this =
does not mean that He wills, but that He cannot avert on account of the end=
, which is salvation" (DP 234).</p><p>In this lecture we will explore this =
concept further. For many people the idea that God allows evil for the sake=
 of an ultimate good is hard to understand. But, in order to understand thi=
s, one must come to an understanding of what people are like, and how the L=
ord leads us to salvation. Thus the chapter begins:</p><p>"If a person were=
 born into the love into which he was created he would not be in any evil, =
nor indeed would he know what evil is; for one who has not been in evil, an=
d consequently is not in evil, cannot know what evil is" (DP 275).</p><p>Th=
e only example of people not born into evil is that of the Most Ancient Chu=
rch before their fall. Even the Lord Himself was born into evil, not into a=
ctual evil, but, by inheritance from Mary, into an inclination of evil.</p>=
<p>What would a person be like if he was not born into evil? The passage co=
ntinues:</p><p>"The love into which a person was created is the love of the=
 neighbor, so that he desires his neighbor's welfare as much as his own, ev=
en more than his own, and enjoys the delight which springs from that love w=
hile he acts kindly to him, much the same as a parent feels in acting kindl=
y to his children" (DP 275).</p><p>People in this state could contribute to=
 an ideal world - where would be no crime, nor violence, nor wars. Life wou=
ld be a continual expression of peace.</p><p>But unfortunately, people have=
 turned away from this ideal. "The love of the neighbor was turned into the=
 love of self" (DP 276). Love of self is absolutely opposite loving the Lor=
d and the neighbor. Consider this description from the True Christian Relig=
ion:</p><p>"The love of self consists in wishing well to oneself alone, and=
 to no others except for the sake of self; not even tot he Church, to one's=
 country, to any human society, or to a fellow citizen. This love consists =
also in doing good to these, but only for the sake of one's own reputation,=
 honor and glory; and if one does not see that these will be secured by so =
doing, one says in one's heart, `what does it matter? Why should I do this?=
 What advantage will it be to me?' And then nothing is done. Hence it is ev=
ident that he who is in the love of self does not love the church, his coun=
try, society, his fellow-citizen or anything truly good, but only himself a=
nd what he possesses" (TCR 400).</p><p>People born into the love of self tu=
rn themselves away from the Lord and from heaven. The light of heaven canno=
t penetrate that person's mind (DP 276).</p><p>Why, then, does the Lord peo=
ple to come into this dreadful selfish love? Would it not be better for the=
 Lord to remove some of people's freedom and bring them directly into a sta=
te of loving the neighbor? The answer is that to do that the Lord would vio=
late every principle of creation and providence.</p><p>Thus evils, especial=
ly love of self, are permitted for the sake of an end: that a person may be=
 saved.</p><p>PEOPLE ARE IN EVIL</p><p>One of the things that is most diffi=
cult for people to accept is that they are evil. Not necessarily in active =
evil, but each one of us is evil in our own right. The source of this evil =
is what the Writings call "hereditary evil." The result of it is </p><p>"..=
. that a person cannot do good of himself, for evil does not do good except=
 such good as has evil within it" (DP 277).</p><p>Thus all the good we do, =
to the degree that it arises in ourselves, is polluted with hereditary evil=
. Consider this very similar teaching from the Doctrine of Life:</p><p>"If =
a person wills and does goods before he shuns evils as sins, the goods are =
not good. This is because ... he is not in the Lord before he does so" (Lif=
e 24).</p><p>Where does our evil come from? Hereditary evil. The inclinatio=
n towards evil is passed from one generation to the next, </p><p>"... and i=
n this way it is increased and grows as it were to a great accumulation, an=
d is transmitted to offspring. Hence it is that there is nothing sound in a=
 person, but he is altogether evil" (DP 277).</p><p>It should also be menti=
oned here that there is a difference between "hereditary evil" and "origina=
l sin." The former is a transmission of inclinations towards evil from one =
generation to the next. This inclination can be increased or lessened by re=
generation - thus a regenerating person will hand on a weakened inclination=
, and a degenerating parent a stronger inclination. Original sin, however, =
is an error of thought found in the former church which holds that all peop=
le are born into actual sin, as opposed to an inclination to sin, because o=
f the fall of Adam in Eden. According to standard teachings, original sin w=
ill doom a person to hell unless he is baptized and or reborn. Hereditary s=
in, however, damns no one to hell, we end up there when we make our tendenc=
ies towards evil our own through a life of evil.</p><p>How then, are evils =
removed from a person?</p><p>"That a person must be withdrawn from evil in =
order that he may be reformed is evident without explanation; for he that i=
s in evil in the world is in evil after his departure from the world; and t=
herefore if evil is not removed in the world it cannot be removed afterward=
s" (DP 277).</p><p>HOW EVILS ARE REMOVED</p><p>It is on this point that the=
 teaching concerning the permission of evils hangs: with the acknowledgment=
 that people are born into an inclination of evil, and with the acknowledge=
ment that the evil must be removed before one enters the next world, it fol=
lows that evil cannot be removed unless we are conscious of them.</p><p>Whi=
le it true that we are not damned on account of our hereditary evil, but be=
cause of actual evil, yet it is also true that hereditary evils pollute our=
 actions, preventing us from doing things that are truly good. Therefore he=
reditary evils must be allowed to be exposed, so that we can recognize them=
 as evil and shun them.</p><p>"This does not mean that a person is to do ev=
ils in order that they may appear, but that he is to examine himself, not h=
is actions only, but also his thoughts, and what he would do if he were not=
 afraid of the laws and disgrace; especially what evils he holds in his spi=
rit to be allowable, and does not regard as sins; for these he still commit=
s" (DP 278).</p><p>Self examination is the first step of repentance. In the=
 book The True Christian Religion, we are shown that repentance begins in a=
nd depends on self examination. In this chapter of Divine Providence the ne=
ed and importance of self examination is outlined:</p><p>People are given t=
he ability of understanding in order to examine themselves. </p><p>"In orde=
r that he may see this his understanding has been furnished with higher and=
 lower thought, or interior and exterior thought, to enable him to see from=
 higher or interior thought what his will is doing in the lower or exterior=
 thought" (DP 278).</p><p>This means that we have the ability of rising abo=
ve our feelings, and to examine them in the light of truth. If we did not h=
ave this ability, we would never be able to dissociate ourselves from our e=
vils, with the result that if something felt good, our understanding would =
label it good, and we would not hesitate to commit the act, even though it =
may have been most evil.</p><p>It should also be noted that the task of the=
 understanding is to examine the things we "believe to be allowable." Remem=
ber DP 81, which states:</p><p>"The evils which a person believes to be all=
owable, even though he does not commit them, are also appropriated to him; =
since whatever is allowable in the thought comes from the will, and then th=
ere is consent. When therefore a person believes any evil to be allowable, =
he loosens an internal restraint upon it, and he is withheld from doing it =
only by external restraints, such as fears; and because his spirit favors t=
hat evil, when external restrains are removed he does it as allowable; and =
meanwhile, he continually does it in his spirit" (DP 81).</p><p>Self examin=
ation must be thorough. DP 278 points out some of the many pitfalls people =
fall into in examining themselves:</p><p>1.People who label themselves as s=
inners without any clear idea of what there sin is. A person who does this =
often believes that sins are washed away - but in reality he or she has nev=
er identified a sin in him or herself, and therefore cannot have them remov=
ed (DP 278).</p><p>2. Some religions see no use to self examination or repe=
ntance (DP 278). This is especially true of people who believe in a religio=
us conversion or being born again, who believe in salvation through faith a=
lone.</p><p>3. Some people are so engrossed in the world that they place no=
 importance on spiritual matters (DP 278).</p><p>4. Then there are those wh=
o are in active sin:</p><p>"These are they who acknowledge God and worship =
Him according to the customary ceremonials, and who convince themselves tha=
t any evil which is a sin is not a sin; for they disguise it by fallacies a=
nd appearances, and so hide its enormity" (DP 278).</p><p>With these people=
 the sin is suppressed, and therefore smolders in them like a fire:</p><p>"=
for evil that is denied and outlet increases and does not abate until the w=
hole has been destroyed" (DP 278).</p><p>5. Some evils are unknown, and as =
a result cannot be removed without the person searching himself, and then a=
cknowledging and confessing the sin. We cannot really fight against evils w=
e do not see or recognize. </p><p>Because of self examination, the Lord per=
mits evils so that they can be brought to our view and so shunned. If we ha=
d no measure of sin in our lives, we would never recognize the vast distanc=
e separating us from the angels. Thus the Lord permits evil, not because he=
 wants us to do evil, but so that from seeing evil in others and in ourselv=
es, we can become conscious of them, and search them out in ourselves, and =
shun them.</p><p>The concept of how the Lord removes evil from us is one di=
stinct to the New Church. The Christian world abounds with concepts and the=
ories of how evil is removed. This varies from the sacramental inbalancing =
of evil by performing good works, which, through a balance of good and evil=
 in us, will hopefully tilt towards good, and the evil will loose its power=
 and disappear. In the Protestant world, it is largely believed that one's =
evils are remitted through an act of placing faith in the atonement of Jesu=
s Christ. </p><p>In DP 279 these concepts are examined and refuted:</p><p>1=
. "It is an error of the present age to believe that evils are separated an=
d indeed cast our when they are remitted" (DP 279). Evils are not cast out:=
</p><p>"They all remain, and when after repentance they are remitted, they =
are moved from the centre to the outskirts" (DP 279).</p><p>One way of unde=
rstanding this is to consider that when a person is in actual evil, the evi=
l occupies the centre of his or her mind. It is the focus of thought. Howev=
er, during the process of repentance, the person looses interest in the evi=
l, and they eventually become dormant in the mind. They are still there, bu=
t are as if asleep, they certainly no longer occupy the centre. </p><p>This=
 is quite a different concept from the idea that evils are washed away. We =
cannot never be "washed" of our evils, they are part of us, and indeed, are=
 part of the makeup and definition of our personalities.</p><p>2. "It is an=
 error of the present age to believe that the state of a person's life can =
be changed in a moment, so that from being wicked he can become good, and c=
onsequently can be brought out of hell and straightway transferred to heave=
n, and this from the immediate mercy of the Lord" (DP 279).</p><p>People ca=
nnot be saved in a moment, because the Lord saved people through a system -=
 people must repent and voluntarily turn away from evil. </p><p>This then, =
brings us back to our consideration of why evils are permitted: because dur=
ing our life in this world we are kept in a state of continually turning aw=
ay from evil, and of fighting it. This could not happen if we were unable t=
o see evil, to intellectually and emotionally reject it, and fight against =
it as if from our own power - recognizing that the power is really the Lord=
's.</p><p>3. "Those who entertain this belief do not in the least know what=
 evil is and what good is." For many people evil is some sort of grand evil=
, as perhaps Hitler was evil. Many people do not see evil in their daily ac=
tions, and so know very little about it. Thus the Lord allows evils to appe=
ar, because if He did not, no one would recognize it, and would simply wait=
 for the Lord "to save them", believing themselves washed clean.</p><p>4. "=
Those who believe in instantaneous salvation and immediate mercy do not kno=
w that affections, which belong to the will, are nothing but changes of sta=
te of the purely organic substances of the mind, and that thoughts which be=
long to the understanding, are nothing but changes and variations in the fo=
rm of these substances, and that memory is the permanent record of them" (D=
P 279).</p><p>In other words, those who believe in instant salvation have a=
 very simplistic idea of what spiritual things really are. They don't under=
stand the structure and functions of the mind, nor do they understand the s=
piritual things which occur in the mind, with the result that they believe =
that faith alone will change and save them. Thus the Lord allows evils to s=
urface emerge into people's lives so that by seeing evil they might still b=
e repelled by it and turn from it.</p><p>There are also people, mostly Cath=
olics, who believe that a person is saved through the sacraments of the chu=
rch. These people are also in error, because ultimately they also believe t=
hat the Lord washes away their sins on account of, or as a reward for their=
 belief.</p><p>The Lord can only remit sins when a person through the acts =
of repentance and reformation, actually fights against them. Then the Lord =
breaks the stranglehold the evil has on a person, pushes them to the "edge"=
 of the person's mind, and they cease to be a bother.</p><p>"Thus the permi=
ssion of evil is for the sake of the end, namely salvation" (DP 281).</p><p=
>WHY EVILS APPEAR</p><p>As we look at the world around us, we become very a=
ware of evil: atheism, blasphemy, impious and wicked things abound, such as=
 things fraudulent, lascivious, revengeful and others. The list is long.</p=
><p>Remember that all people are born into evils of many kinds (DP 281). Th=
ese evils greatly influence the way people think, speak and act. Initially =
it might seem a good idea for the Lord to simply impose His will:</p><p>"It=
 will now be shown what a person would be like if he were not permitted to =
think in accordance with the delights of his life's love. He would no longe=
r be a person, for he would loose his two faculties called liberty and rati=
onality, in which humanity itself consists. The delights of these evils wou=
ld occupy the interiors of his mind to such a degree that they would open u=
p that door. Then he would not be able to do otherwise than speak and commi=
t such evils, and thus his insanity would be manifest not only to himself b=
ut also to the world, and he at length would not know how to cover his sham=
e" (DP 281).</p><p>If evils were not permitted by the Lord they would build=
 up such pressure within us that they would burst forth in all their grotes=
queness, and the race would be engulfed.</p><p>To protect us from this stat=
e, the evils are permitted to emerge gradually under more controlled circum=
stances. Society imposes various restraints from without, and faith provide=
s some from within, so that gradually the person is brought to the point wh=
ere he or she rejects that evil, through the process of repentance, and so =
lessens the pressure from within. In this way the Lord allows a person to l=
et of spiritual steam.</p><p>It is interesting to note that the Lord could =
have just changed people, and why He does not:</p><p>"It would have been po=
ssible for the Lord to heal the understanding in every one, and so cause hi=
m to think not evil but good, and this by means of fears of various kinds, =
by miracles, by conversations with the dead, and by visions and miracles" (=
DP 282).</p><p>Note that these means would all have transgressed the Lord's=
 own Divine Laws of Providence - and so to do so would have violated His ow=
n creation. But there is another reason as well:</p><p>"But to heal the und=
erstanding alone is to heal a person outwardly only; for the understanding =
with its thought is the external of a person's life, while the will with it=
s affection is the internal of his life. Therefore, the healing of the unde=
rstanding alone would be like palliative healing, by which the interior mal=
ignity, shut in and prevented from coming out, would destroy first the near=
 and then the remote parts until the whole would become mortified" (DP 282)=
.</p><p>Therefore evils are permitted, because if they were not, no one wou=
ld be able to be saved. By a sight of evil we are shown what goodness is on=
 a spiritual, moral and civil level, and so the Lord heals us of our evils =
- He provides us with an understanding not only of evil, but of the process=
 of rejecting it, and through its rejection He implants a love of goodness =
in a new will, one not polluted with hereditary evil, but one open to Himse=
lf, from which, when we act in accordance with it, we do good.</p><p></p><p=

</p><p>
&nbsp;Lecture Ten - Good and Evil</p><p>INTRODUCTION</p><p>In the past few =
chapters we have examined the relationship of Divine Providence and evil. I=
n chapter 8 we were shown that evil does not have its origin in the Lord's =
will, but because He created us with freewill, the Lord therefore permits e=
vil as an expression of freedom. For Him not to have permitted the existenc=
e of evil would have been to deny human freedom, and thus undercut the enti=
re structure of Divine Laws we call "Providence". </p><p>The permission of =
evil, however, does not mean that the Lord wishes evil - to the contrary. I=
n Chapter 9 it was established that the Lord only permits evil for the sake=
 of an end, or goal, and that goal is human salvation. Thus the Lord permit=
s us to come into evil states in order that our evils might become obvious =
to us, and through seeing them in ourselves or in others, we might become s=
o disgusted with them and their effects, that we turn away from them to the=
 Lord. Thus evil can be used by the Lord to contribute to our salvation.</p=
><p>In continuing with this subject, we are shown that when a person is in =
a state of evil, that is, in a state focused away from the Lord and on self=
, the person is under the Laws of Divine Permission, which are a part of th=
e Laws of Providence. The Lord deals with all people in the same way, but w=
hen a person turns towards evil, the person comes into conflict with the la=
ws of providence, and thus instead of experiencing them as positive or affi=
rmative, the person experiences them negatively or as punishment.</p><p>Thu=
s for every law of providence with the good, there is an opposite for the e=
vil. The change of the law is really a changed perception of the law, for a=
n evil person will feel the Lord's presence differently from a good person.=
 We can get a concept of this from our own behavior in this world: an innoc=
ent law abiding citizen senses the police as a positive presence, maintaini=
ng law and order, and protective of the citizenry. A guilty criminal, howev=
er, has a different concept. He or she views the police as a menace, out to=
 undermine and punish the criminals activities. Thus the police are a threa=
t to criminals.</p><p>This different perspective of Divine Providence comes=
 from the fact that the Lord in creating people made them as full human bei=
ngs:</p><p>DP 285: "In every one, whether good or evil, there are two facul=
ties, one of which constitutes the understanding, and the other the will."<=
/p><p>These two faculties, or abilities represent the Lord's presence in al=
l people</p><p>"... indeed in the most individual, things of a person's und=
erstanding and thought and also of his will and affection, and consequently=
 in the most individual things of his speech and action. If you remove thes=
e faculties from even the most individual thing, you will not be able to th=
ink or say it as a person" (DP 285).</p><p>It is because of these two facul=
ties that a person is human, and because they belong to the Lord, and not t=
o us, they can never be removed. Thus all people, good and evil alike, have=
 the Lord within themselves, present in their ability to think rationally a=
nd act in freedom from that rationality. This is the first of the five laws=
 of Divine Providence, and it is a law that can never be violated.</p><p>Fr=
om this point we can come to the main thrust of this chapter: the fact that=
 the Lord in His Divine Providence is equally with the wicked and with the =
good.</p><p>THE LORD IS NOT IN EVIL</p><p>For many people, the concept that=
 evil is a product of human freedom, plus the fact that human freedom is Di=
vinely given, and most carefully protected, leads to the concept that the L=
ord is the source of evil. Nothing, however, can be further from the truth.=
 The Lord is present with all people from creation. But the process by whic=
h a person takes that presence and twists it into evil is a process entirel=
y human. In the process of turning the Lord's presence into evil, the perso=
n in effect removes him or herself from the Lord. </p><p>How does this proc=
ess work? Remember that "the Divine Providence is in the most individual th=
ings of a person's thoughts and affections" (DP 287). However in recalling =
that Divine Providence is "in the most individual things of a person's thou=
ghts and affections" consider the following:</p><p>a. "the Lord by means of=
 His Divine Providence arranges the affections [of the whole human race] in=
to one form, which is the human form. It will be seen ... that this is the =
universal end of the Divine Providence" (DP 201).</p><p>b. "But reflect wit=
hin yourself what universal providence is when the individual things are ta=
ken away... If it should be said that the Divine Providence is a universal =
government, while nothing is governed, but things are merely maintained in =
connection, and matters pertaining to government are disposed by others, ca=
n this be called a universal government?" (DP 201)</p><p>c. "Providence wit=
h God is called prudence with men... But the case really is that the Divine=
 Providence is in the most individual things of nature and in the most indi=
vidual things of human prudence, and from these it is universal" (DP 201e).=
</p><p>d. "The Divine Providence of the Lord is universal from the most ind=
ividual things because He created the universe in order that there might ex=
ist in it an infinite and eternal creation from Himself; and this creation =
exists that the Lord might form from men a heaven which should appear befor=
e Him as one who should be the image and likeness of Himself" (DP 202).</p>=
<p>e. "Hence it follows that unless a person were led by the Lord every mom=
ent, yea, every minutest fraction of a moment, he would depart from the way=
 of reformation and perish..." (DP 202)</p><p>The Lord is present with a pe=
rson from and by means of creation, for it is by this presence that He is a=
ble to fulfill the end of all creation, that is, a heaven from the human ra=
ce. It is obvious, therefore, that He is present with both the good and the=
 evil.</p><p>Because the Lord is present with us, everything that is us, th=
at is, all our thoughts and feelings, also have their origin in the Lord. I=
f they did not, then we would live from ourselves and not from the Lord. Th=
us we are told "that a person can think and will nothing from himself, but =
that everything he thinks and wills, and consequently says and does, is fro=
m influx" (DP 287). The next passage begins:</p><p>"All the angels of heave=
n confess that no one can think from himself but only from the Lord; while =
all the spirits of hell assert that no one can think from any other than hi=
mself" (DP 288).</p><p>This concept has profound connotations for our sense=
 of selfhood. If all our thoughts and feelings flow into us from the Lord, =
how then do we explain the presence of evil without ascribing it to the Lor=
d Himself? </p><p>The solution to this problem lies in looking not at the o=
rigin of thought and feelings, but at the way in which the influx from the =
Lord is received by people:</p><p>"... all thought and affection, even with=
 spirits of hell, flow in from heaven [the origin of the influx]; but that =
the good with flows in is, in hell [the recipient] turned into evil and the=
 truth into falsity, thus everything into its opposite" (DP 288).</p><p>The=
 freedom to receive or not to receive the Lord's influx is the first law of=
 providence, and so is inviolable. It is up to the individual, therefore, t=
o determine what he or she is going to do with the Lord's influx.</p><p>Peo=
ple, however, do not live in isolation from each other, especially in the s=
piritual world. Influx from the Lord is passed through heaven, through the =
world of spirits, before it reaches us. But influx also passes into and con=
nects the hells together. Thus no one is an island, we are connected by inf=
lux, and therefore we think and feel in agreement with our spiritual associ=
ations. Swedenborg relates:</p><p>"I was told from heaven that, like others=
, I believed that I thought and willed from myself when in fact there was n=
othing from myself, but if there was good it originated from the Lord, and =
if evil it originated from hell" (DP 290).</p><p>The fact of this influx of=
 thought and will is covered with the appearance of self life, for without =
the "as of self" we would have no ability to think rationally, nor to choos=
e in freedom. Thus in order to maintain the integrity of the five laws of P=
rovidence, the Lord shrouds the reality of inflowing thought with the freed=
om of the appearance of self life.</p><p>But to come back to the issue of h=
ow this influx is turned to evil:</p><p>"Everything that a person thinks an=
d wills, and consequently speaks and does, flows in from one sole Fountain =
of life, and yet that one Fountain of life, which is the Lord, is not the c=
ause of a person's thinking what is evil and false" (DP 292).</p><p>The ori=
gin of evil, therefore, is the reception of this influx according to our fr=
eedom, based on the appearance of self life. To explain this concept, Swede=
nborg uses the image of the sun:</p><p>*it flows into good and evil trees.<=
/p><p>*it flows into good seed and also into tares.</p><p>*it warms the egg=
s of both doves and vipers.</p><p>The matter at issue, therefore, is the re=
cipient vessel of the Lord's heat and light. Understanding this principle a=
llows us to understand the following three points:</p><p>1. People are in f=
ault if they do evil. If all thought and feeling flow into us from the Lord=
, and yet we turn it to evil through our reception of it, then we are fault=
y receptors:</p><p>"Nevertheless, the fault is in him who receives, because=
 he receives it as his own; and he neither knows nor desires to know otherw=
ise" (DP 294:2).</p><p>2. It seems that evil originates from the Lord. </p>=
<p>"Anyone can see that evil and falsity do not originate from good and tru=
th, and consequently not from the Lord, but from the recipient subject and =
object which is in evil and falsity and which perverts and inverts that whi=
ch flows in" (DP 294:4).</p><p>3. "the Lord alone causes everyone to think =
and to will in accordance with his own peculiar quality and in accordance w=
ith the laws of His Providence" (DP 294e).</p><p>Thus we can see that the L=
ord is present equally with the evil and with the good. But that does not m=
ean that He supports and encourages the evil. Evil itself is a perversion a=
nd inversion of good. Thus the two are completely opposed to each other, ha=
ving different ends and goals.</p><p>CONFLICT OF GOOD AND EVIL</p><p>Up unt=
il now we have been made aware of the universality of good, because it is t=
he presence of the Lord in all things. In order, however, to understand the=
 conflict between good and evil, it is also necessary to understand somethi=
ng about the nature and quality of evil itself.</p><p>1. Evil is complex: <=
/p><p>"In a person's sight every evil appears as one single thing... and it=
 is not known that in every evil there are innumerable things, exceeding in=
 number the fibres and vessels in a person's body" (DP 296).</p><p>If good =
is an image of heaven, then evil is an image of hell "and hell consists of =
myriads of myriads of spirits, and every one there is in a form like a pers=
on, although a monstrous one..." (DP 296).4 Because, as we have seen earlie=
r, all things in the spiritual world are connected, each evil spirit is con=
nected to the next by bonds of hatred, anger, revenge and so on. Thus one e=
vil spirit represents a whole range of spirits. It is from this fact that o=
ne evil in this world contains within it many evils.</p><p>4. Myriads of my=
riads =3D millions</p><p>For example consider the evils present in a single=
 sin, say the act of adultery:<br>1.adultery itself 2. Lying to ones spouse=
<br>3.cruelty to spouse 4. Pure selfishness <br>5.useless sensation 6. Self=
 delusion of fun</p><p>The list can go on and on. Every evil has a whole su=
b-list of evils contained within each thought, feeling or act. From this we=
 can begin to get some idea of the connectedness of hell.</p><p>In the comb=
at between good and evil, evil has to be fought on all its levels in order =
for good to truly win:</p><p>"Hence it follows that all these in their orde=
r must be restored and changed by the Lord in order that the person may be =
reformed; and this cannot be effected unless by the Divine Providence of th=
e Lord, step by step from the earliest period of a person's life to the las=
t" (DP 296).</p><p>2. Evil multiplies itself: </p><p>"A wicked person from =
himself continually leads himself more and more deeply into his evils... th=
e real reason why the wicked person immerses himself more deeply in evil is=
 that as he wills and commits evil he advances into infernal societies more=
 and more interiorly and also more and more deeply. Hence also the delight =
of evil increases, and so occupies his thoughts that at last he feels nothi=
ng more pleasant" (DP 296:3).</p><p>In a sense, evil is a trap: it lures on=
e into it, and then when the person is caught up in the evil, it strengthen=
s its hold over the person, until eventually the person looses any desire t=
o give it up. One useful comparison to this is the natural vice of smoking:=
 a first time smoker may well not enjoy the experience. But after a while i=
t becomes first a conscious habit, then a deeply engrained habit, and final=
ly the person is hard-pressed to imagine a smoke-free life. There are many =
stories of people battling to give up smoking. Evil follows a similar patte=
rn on a spiritual level, except that evil of life leads a person into a clo=
ser and closer association with hell:</p><p>"It is not known, however, that=
 this increase of delight comes from a person's penetrating into infernal s=
ocieties more and more interiorly and more and more deeply as he commits th=
e evils from will and at the same time from thought" (DP 296).</p><p>In ord=
er for evils to be really binding on us, both the will and thought need to =
be present - will alone does not make one evil. Evil requires both parts of=
 the mind to be active, especially when the thought, from set evil purpose =
puts aside the concepts which should have held the person back. Thus:</p><p=
>"If he then also thinks that the evil is contrary to the precepts of the D=
ecalogue, and considers these precepts as Divine, he commits the evil of se=
t purpose, and thereby plunges to a depth from which he can be led out only=
 by actual repentance" (DP 296:5).</p><p>3. Even so, evil is governed by Di=
vine Providence.</p><p>In spite of the conflict between good and evil withi=
n a person, and apart from the fact that a single evil act, done from inten=
tion, binds us to all hell, the Lord never abandons us. Evil, as we saw ear=
lier, is a permission, that is, the Lord does not will evil, but He allows =
or permits us to be evil as an expression of our free choice. He also allow=
s evil for the sake of and end, which is the salvation of the human race. T=
hus He allows evil in order to withdraw us from it.</p><p>"Now since everyt=
hing that a wicked person wills and thinks is of permission the question ar=
ises, what then is the Divine Providence here, which is said to be in the m=
ost individual things with every one, both wicked and good?" (DP 296:8)</p>=
<p>The Divine Providence is this:</p><p>1. It permits evil for the sake of =
salvation</p><p>2. It keeps evil continually under view</p><p>3. It separat=
es evils from a person and purifies the person</p><p>4. It removes by unkno=
wn ways things which interfere with salvation.</p><p>Thus the Divine Provid=
ence is continually working towards a person's salvation: </p><p>"This is t=
he Lord's continual Providence with the wicked and is, as has been stated, =
a continual permission of evil to the end that there may be an unceasing wi=
thdrawal from it" (DP 296:8e).</p><p>But how do we fit into this picture, a=
fter all, the person in this world is the field upon which this battle is f=
ought: hell in us leads us to twist and pervert Divine influx, leading us d=
eeper and deeper into hell. The Lord, by comparison, allows this to happen =
to enable us to see evil and be repelled from it, thus He is able to gradua=
lly remove the delight of evil from us.</p><p>In one sense the person in th=
is world is caught between these two forces:</p><p>"man knows scarcely anyt=
hing of these operations because he does not perceive them. The chief reaso=
n why he does not perceive them is that the evils pertain to the lusts of h=
is life's love and these evils are not felt as evils but as delights to whi=
ch no one pays attention" (DP 296).</p><p>Would we pay attention, then, to =
our evil thoughts, loves and actions if we did not come to some realization=
 of the evil which is within them? Would we turn from evil if we did not le=
arn the truth, and see the consequences of evil? Thus the Lord provides cou=
ntless ways of ridding us of evil.</p><p>4. The Lord gets rid of evils in u=
s: </p><p>"The withdrawal from evil is effected by the Lord in a thousand w=
ays that are most secret" (DP 296:10).</p><p>A general description of how t=
he Lord purifies a person is outlined:</p><p>a. lusts are introduced into a=
 person's spirit by companies of evil spirits.</p><p>b. these lusts then en=
ter the exterior thought and give the person a degree of satisfaction (i.e.=
 the person enjoys the thoughts or feelings)</p><p>c. the lusts then mingle=
 with sensual delights (i.e. the person then begins to act out the evil)</p=
><p>It is at this point that the person, in bringing evil into act, makes t=
hose evils his or her own. But it is also at this point that the Lord can b=
egin to lead a person away from them. This likewise is a process:</p><p>a. =
a person becomes aware of conflicting thoughts. (Imagine an adulterer who b=
egins to think about the ideals of marriage.)</p><p>b. the person begins to=
 desire the alternative.</p><p>c. thus the person can be led to separate hi=
m or herself from the evil.</p><p>This process, however, only works with th=
ose who are willing to cooperate with the Lord:</p><p>"With a wicked person=
 no separation, purification and removal is possible other than of the more=
 grievous from the less grievous evils. With a good person, however, there =
can be a separation, purification and removal not only of the more grievous=
 but also of the less grievous evils. This is effected by the delights of t=
he affections of the good and true, of the just and of the sincere, into wh=
ich he comes so far as he regards evils as sins, and so shuns and turns awa=
y from them, and still more if he fights against them. These are the means =
by which the Lord cleanses all who are saved" (DP 296:12).</p><p>Throughout=
 this process the Lord ensures that all we are conscious of in this world i=
s the most general view of sin. We are never able to see all the hidden mul=
titudes of spirits, because if we could, we would be overwhelmed and incapa=
ble of being ourselves salvable. Thus the Lord hides the reality of evil fr=
om us, and leaves us to cope with the external sin and its [not inconsidera=
ble] consequences.</p><p>HUMAN COOPERATION WITH THE LORD</p><p>Earlier in t=
his study we were introduced to the concept of the reciprocal conjunction b=
etween people and the Lord. In the treatment of the first law of Providence=
 we were told that</p><p>"The conjunction of the Lord with a person, and th=
e reciprocal conjunction of a person with the Lord, are effected by means o=
f these two faculties [i.e. rationality and liberty]. Conjunction with the =
Lord and regeneration are one, for so far as anyone is conjoined to the Lor=
d he is regenerated..." (DP 92)</p><p>We have also seen that the Lord is pr=
esent in our thoughts and feelings, thus in our understanding and will, and=
 by means of these leads us towards heaven. Our responsibility is to respon=
d to the Lord in this leading. It follows, therefore, that before we can be=
 conjoined to the Lord, and thus regenerated, we need to acknowledge that o=
ur prudence is nothing, that the Lord is the source of all good, and then s=
ubmit our lives to His:</p><p>"The wicked cannot be wholly withdrawn by the=
 Lord from evil and led in good so long as they believe their own intellige=
nce to be everything, and the Divine Providence nothing" (DP 297).</p><p>Su=
bmission to the Lord's Word is the only way one can be freed from evil. The=
re is an appearance that we can do this from ourselves, provided we think a=
nalytically about something. Thus there is an appearance that we do not nee=
d the Lord. However, this is not a true appearance.</p><p>It is true that b=
oth good and evil people can think analytically, examine and see the nature=
 of evil. People from themselves can even denounce evil, and turn away from=
 it. But, they cannot be led out of that evil by their own power. The follo=
wing passage is important to consider in this regard:</p><p>"... A person i=
s not able to withdraw himself from evil; because the faculty of understand=
ing and perceiving things, even abstractly, is given by the Lord to everyon=
e, the wicked as well as the good ... and yet a person cannot by means of t=
his faculty deliver himself from evil; for evil pertains to the will, and t=
he understanding flows into the will with light only, enlightening and teac=
hing. If then the heat of the will, that is, a person's love, is glowing fr=
om the lust of evil it is cold as to the affection of good, and therefore d=
oes not receive the light, but either reflects it or extinguishes it, or by=
 some falsity devised for the purpose turns it into evil" (DP 297).</p><p>I=
n order to understand this, consider the following concepts:</p><p>a. If a =
person's will is evil, the person only sees evil, and has no desire to see =
anything other than evil (DP 298).</p><p>b. If a person from an evil will s=
ees truth, he then turns it away or falsifies it (DP 298:3).</p><p>c. In co=
ntrast to this, the Divine Providence "causes a person to see truth and als=
o gives him the affection of perceiving it and of receiving it" (DP 298:4).=
</p><p>d. The Lord delivers us from evil by means of this affection of trut=
h - this is the only way out of evil:</p><p>"When the Divine Providence gra=
nts the perception of truth and at the same time the affection of it, a per=
son can be withdrawn form evil because truth points out and dictates; and w=
hen the will performs what truth dictates it unites itself with the truth a=
nd within itself it converts the truth into good; and the truth becomes the=
 truth of its love, and what belongs to the love is good. All reformation i=
s effected by means of truth, and not without it; for without truth the wil=
l is continually in its evil, and if it consults the understanding it is no=
t instructed, but the evil is confirmed by falsities" (DP 298:5).</p><p>Thu=
s we can see the continual battle raging within us between the hells trying=
 to drag us down into hell, and the Lord trying to lift us up into heaven. =
The battle is fought according, however, to the laws of Divine Providence. =
Hell is always under the direct oversight of the Lord, and His permission c=
ontrols the entire process.</p><p>THE LORD'S GOVERNMENT OF HELL</p><p>The c=
oncept that the Lord governs hell may come as a surprise to many people who=
 believe that Satan or Lucifer rule hell. But in fact, the Divine Providenc=
e is universal, in all things, even in hell. However, the way the Lord gove=
rns the hell is quite different from the way He rules heaven.</p><p>"The Lo=
rd governs hell by means of opposites and the wicked while in the world He =
governs in hell as to their interiors but not as to their exteriors" (DP 29=
9).</p><p>By doing this the Lord remains true to the laws of providence. By=
 governing a person interiors, He continually works to undermine the evil, =
to lessen its impact and desirability. But by not governing by means of opp=
osites in a persons exteriors, means that He leaves a person in spiritual f=
reedom, to continue to choose between good and evil.</p><p>In order to unde=
rstand how the Lord governs a person in this way, it is necessary to rememb=
er that the Lord created us in such a way that our mind is a miniature form=
 of the spiritual world. Both heaven and hell exist in us, and the laws whi=
ch apply in the spiritual world apply to us on a mental level (cf. DP 299).=
</p><p>CONCLUSION</p><p>Thus we can see how the Lord's Divine Providence is=
 equally with the good and with the evil - but present in different ways. W=
ith the good He is present in the Laws of Providence, continually leading t=
he person to greater and greater states of goodness. With the evil He is pr=
esent in the laws of permission, and His presence with them is a continual =
process of leading them out of evil into a state of good. Thus while the Lo=
rd affirms the good in good people, He also affirms the good in evil, but H=
e does not affirm the evil.</p><p>Form this we see how the Lord, in Provide=
nce created people in order to populate His heavens. His presence affects e=
ach person life, but even so, He never dictates how a person should react t=
o Him. He is not the cause nor the source of evil, and certainly never infl=
icts evil upon anyone. He never punishes, but leads the evil gradually, in =
freedom away from their evil life.</p><p>Ultimately, the person in this wor=
ld has to make a choice between following the Lord or rejecting Him. If the=
y choose to follow, they have the Lord's help every inch of the way. If the=
y choose to reject Him, He still helps them come to good, and if they stead=
fastly refuse, then He permits them to remain in that state and reap the co=
nsequences.</p><p></p><p></p><div align=3D"Right">15</div><hr><p>

</p><p>
&nbsp;Lecture Eleven - The Appropriation of Good and Evil</p><p>INTRODUCTIO=
N</p><p>In everything we have read about the Divine Providence so far, we c=
an see clearly that the Laws of Divine Providence were provided for the sak=
e of the reciprocal conjunction between the Lord and people. To achieve thi=
s, the Lord gave people the appearance of self-life, the "as of self", and =
this appearance is so strong that without doctrine to inform us, we would k=
now no different but that we live, think, and act entirely from ourselves. =
We even have the capacity to become atheists, denying the very source of ou=
r lives. </p><p>Because of the strength of this appearance, the Lord remind=
s us firstly that there is in reality no such thing as human prudence. All =
our thoughts and feelings flow into us from the spiritual world, affecting =
us by placing us into communication with entire societies of angels and spi=
rits. This communication, however, is unconscious, but is nevertheless real=
, having a tremendous influence on our own personalities and on the choices=
 we make.</p><p>The as of self principle is also given to people in order t=
o establish genuine spiritual freedom, without which we would not be able t=
o have the reciprocal conjunction with the Lord. Human freedom, unfortunate=
ly, presupposes the concept that people are free to choose the follow the L=
ord or not. Thus while the Lord Himself is not the creator of evil, evil ca=
me into the world through human choice. </p><p>The concept of human evil an=
d the role it plays in our lives is vitally important in the entire concept=
 of Divine Providence. Not only does it interfere with our relationship wit=
h the Lord and the neighbor, but it also calls into being a response from t=
he Lord.</p><p>Thus we are presented with the entire concept of the Laws of=
 Permission: the Lord does not will evil, but because human freedom conceiv=
ed it, the Lord permits it, but only for the sake of an end, which is salva=
tion. In the permission of the evil, the Lord allows a person, by seeing ev=
il, to be brought to the point at which the person is willing to be led out=
 of the evil, and thus delivered from it. Finally, we are shown how in His =
mercy the Lord never abandons anyone, but works as closely with the evil, t=
o lead him or her to goodness, as He does to strengthen goodness in the goo=
d person. </p><p>The permission of evil, therefore, is a part of the mercy =
of the Lord. It is inconceivable that the Lord would destroy the human race=
 after giving it the freedom to choose not to follow Him. It is entirely co=
nceivable that the Lord would work with the person in evil to bring him or =
her back into the sheepfold.</p><p>Having considered this, one is led to th=
e question of how the Lord regards evil in a person, or, in other words, ho=
w does a person become responsible for evil?</p><p>The answer to this quest=
ion is the main focus of Chapter 11. </p><p>HUMAN PRUDENCE</p><p>That peopl=
e become evil is an inescapable fact of life. Each person, with some self e=
xamination, can become aware of evil loves and feelings, or thoughts, speec=
h and actions. In a sense evil is a part of our make-up. But how does a sma=
ll baby, born in innocence end up a mass murderer, or as a devil driven onl=
y by self concern?</p><p>The answer lies in the way the Lord made people. I=
n creation the Lord gave us, for the sake of human freedom, the appearance =
of self life. As we have seen in previous chapters, self life is an appeara=
nce. During an argument with spirits who believed in the fullness of self l=
ife, Swedenborg says:</p><p>"To this I could only answer that it is absurd =
and insane to believe that a person is life from himself, and that wisdom a=
nd prudence do not flow in from God, but are in a person..." (DP 309)</p><p=
>SPIRITUAL INSANITY</p><p>Causes of Spiritual Insanity:</p><p>1. To only be=
lieve things one can understand (AC 1630)</p><p>2. To think evil and falsit=
y (AC 1914)</p><p>3. To adopt the negative principle (AC 2568:4)</p><p>4. T=
o reject heavenly things (AC 5116e) (Especially conjugial love)</p><p>These=
 are strong words. Spiritual insanity is a condition prevailing in hell wit=
h those who deny the Lord. Why are they insane? Because it is insane to den=
y the obvious. In this world, it is insane to insist that one is Napoleon, =
when obviously one is not. In the spiritual world, where the Lord can be pr=
esent to angels and spirits as the Spiritual Sun, to deny that presence is =
a denial of the obvious.</p><p>The key to understanding spiritual insanity,=
 and thus how one becomes evil, lies in the concept people have of their ow=
n prudence. In an earlier chapter the subject of prudence was discussed, an=
d it was shown that there is no real human prudence, but that all prudence =
is from the Lord Himself. Our prudence is part of the appearance of self li=
fe given to us by the Lord to protect and preserve our spiritual freedom.</=
p><p>There are people, however - and probably ourselves included - who choo=
se to act as if their prudence was truly their own:</p><p>"They are in thei=
r own prudence who confirm appearances in themselves and make them truths, =
especially the appearance that one's own prudence is everything and the div=
ine Providence nothing, unless it is something universal..." (DP 310)</p><p=
>The person in this state has no belief in the Lord and His guidance, excep=
t in a very general way. He or she may think of the Lord as a sort of force=
, generally directing life, but no involved in the details. Truth is what t=
hey decide is true. Thus they believe themselves to be the source and refer=
ence of things in this world. </p><p>The basis of this belief lies in the f=
act that according to the Laws of Providence, no one can feel the Lord's pr=
esence. If we could it would take away our freedom. Therefore no one can pr=
ove that God exists, or that there is a life after death. We cannot really =
prove that something is good or evil. For many people, relying on their own=
 reasoning in solving the questions of life is the only solution.</p><p>The=
 difficulty arises, however, when people base all their judgment only on th=
ings they can sense: if something cannot be seen, touched, tasted, heard or=
 felt, then it has no reality. This effectively rules our spiritual ideas, =
values, morals, and especially theological concepts.</p><p>But, trusting on=
ly in one's sense is spiritually dangerous:</p><p>"... every appearance con=
firmed as a truth becomes a fallacy; and so far as they confirm themselves =
by fallacies they become materialists; and to that extent they believe noth=
ing but what they can at the same time perceive by one of the bodily senses=
... Such persons finally become sensual; and if they confirm themselves in =
favor of nature against God, they close the interiors of the mind..." (DP 3=
10)</p><p>This is the root cause of spiritual insanity - it divorces the mi=
nd from the reality of the Lord, and submerges it in the merely natural thi=
ngs. The end result as described can be quite horrifying.</p><p>This approa=
ch to life is essentially one of denial of spiritual things. Thus a person =
who relies only on his or her prudence for guidance, will find the way of h=
eaven closed off - not because the Lord closes it, but because the person h=
im or her self does so. </p><p>The contrast between a reliance in human pru=
dence and genuine prudence from the Lord is marked. The person who trusts o=
nly in self ends up in spiritual insanity, while the person who rises above=
 the senses, and is willing to put trust and faith in the Lord, ends up in =
a state of angelic wisdom. Placed side by side, the differences between hum=
an and genuine prudence gives a very clear idea of the two:</p><p>Nature of=
 Human Prudence:</p><p>1. Crafty and cunning.</p><p>2. Regard those who wor=
ship the Lord as stupid.</p><p>3. Regard murder, adultery, theft and false =
witness as of no account.</p><p>4. Think people are like animals.</p><p>5. =
Have warped idea of angels and spirits.</p><p>6. Confirm themselves in the =
love of self.</p><p>7. End up in hell. </p><p>(From DP 310)</p><p>Nature of=
 Genuine Prudence:</p><p>1. They think interiorly (and believe others think=
 in the same way).</p><p>2. They perceive evils as sins and shun them.</p><=
p>3. They seek wisdom.</p><p>4. They speak simply and sincerely.</p><p>5. T=
hey are images of heaven.</p><p>(from DP 311)</p><p>"Everyone may know that=
 the character of a person is determined by what he is interiorly; and cons=
equently that he is a person who is interiorly what he wishes to appear to =
be exteriorly, while he is an effigy who is a person only exteriorly and no=
t interiorly. If you think, as you speak, in favor of God and of religion, =
of righteousness and of sincerity, you will be a person, and the Divine Pro=
vidence will then be your prudence, and you will see in others that one's o=
wn prudence is insanity" (DP 311e).</p><p>HOW PRUDENCE IS THE SOURCE OF EVI=
L</p><p>In creating the human race, the Lord, as we have seen, provided for=
 total spiritual freedom, yet He did not create evil. People who choose to =
misuse their human appearance of prudence, and who rejected genuine spiritu=
al freedom, create evil. When people follow this route, they deny themselve=
s the acknowledgment of the reality that they are recipients of life, and t=
herefore they take on the responsibility of both good and evil within thems=
elves:<br>"Man from his own prudence persuades himself and confirms that al=
l good and all truth originate from himself and are in himself; and in like=
 manner all evil and falsity" (DP 312).</p><p>At first this may seem like t=
heological quibbling, but the difference it makes in the reality of life, b=
oth natural and spiritual, is amazing. </p><p>If a person believes good to =
originate within him or herself, then good and evil, truth and falsity ceas=
e being objective things, and become purely subjective. Therefore, instead =
of looking at the use of things, one looks at the impact of things, and, wh=
en one views the world from this latter perspective, the world takes on a v=
ery different series of properties. </p><p>Nevertheless, the fact remains t=
hat whether a person believes in spiritual things or not, the spiritual thi=
ngs continue to exist and impact the mind. The problem is, that with those =
whose thought is based only on the sensual things of this world, the kind o=
f spirits who are present with them, are also in the same frame of mind.</p=
><p>The character of people's thoughts in this state is described in DP 314=
:</p><p>1. They believe that information solely flows into them from their =
senses, and their thoughts are reactions to this information. However, this=
 in inverted, because our senses are governed by our inner thoughts and fee=
lings - the way we see the world around us is largely due to our own inner =
being.</p><p>2. They do not know that thoughts have reality and substance.<=
/p><p>3. They cannot understand the nature of LIFE itself, believing it to =
be something ethereal.</p><p>"These things are set forth that it may be see=
n how a person is infatuated by his own prudence, as he forms all his concl=
usions from appearances and from fallacies based on them" (DP 315).</p><p>A=
 person, therefore, who relies on his or her own prudence to explain issues=
 of life, will end up having a warped perception of reality. Mainly the pro=
blem lies in their self-centered notion that all things begin and stop in t=
heir own reasoning process. This is a very limiting position to hold in lif=
e, because it prevents a person from rising above the mere appearances of t=
hings, to the grander view. By analogy, consider how much we have learned s=
ince Galileo proved that the earth was not the centre of the universe, but =
actually revolved around the sun. The limitation of ancient science would h=
ave limited our ability to explore space and reap the benefits of the wonde=
rful technology developed for that exploration.</p><p>"All who are led by t=
he Divine Providence of the Lord are elevated above their proprium and then=
 they see that all good and truth are from the Lord; indeed, they even see =
that what is in a person originating from the Lord is always the Lord's and=
 never a person's" (DP 316).</p><p>This world view is completely different =
from that of a person who trusts only his or her own prudence - it is the l=
iberating view of reality, bringing life into perspective, giving it meanin=
g and purpose.</p><p>Living only in the appearance of things has an added d=
isadvantage: we determine our spiritual lives by the confirmation of truth =
and its presence in our activities as good. This is the basic application o=
f the first law of Divine Providence, to act from reason in freedom. Unfort=
unately, the corollary is also true: as a person confirms falsity, so it to=
o appears in activity as evil, with the result that the person's reason is =
subverted, and freedom undermined. </p><p>It is a basic principle in the wo=
rk Divine Providence, that anything done in freedom according to reason rem=
ains with a person, even after death. Those who trust in their own prudence=
 are not exempt:</p><p>"Everything of which a person has persuaded himself =
and which he has confirmed in himself remains with him as his own" (DP 317)=
.</p><p>CONFIRMATION</p><p>One of the great issues brought up by those who =
trust in their own prudence is that of confirmation. </p><p>"It is believed=
 by many that no truth can be seen by a person except by proof; but this is=
 false" (DP 317).</p><p>The concept of proof is vital to many people. The m=
edieval theologians, Anselm and Aquinas both created "proofs" of God's exis=
tence - and both fell short. Some things simply cannot be proved, and there=
fore cannot be concluded by human reasoning. Most spiritual values fall int=
o this category.</p><p>When we consider many of the issues facing modern pe=
rson, those who trust in their own prudence often seem to make rational and=
 intelligent choices. But consider the issues: pornography, abortion, marit=
al relationships, freedom and many others. All too often these issues are d=
ebated without spiritual input, on the basis of "proved" statistics.</p><p>=
The problem is wrong answers. Statistics and other "proof" often lead to fa=
lse understanding with devastating results. The problem lies in the general=
 approach, making the solution difficult to achieve.</p><p>In spiritual mat=
ters, one cannot rely on prudence, one must rise above it to a different pl=
ane:</p><p>"... in matters purely rational, moral and spiritual truths are =
apparent in their own light, provided a person has from a right education b=
ecome in some degree rational, moral and spiritual. This is because every o=
ne as to his spirit or that which thinks, is in the spiritual world as one =
among those who are there; and consequently he is in spiritual light which =
enlightens the interiors of his understanding, and as it were dictates. For=
 spiritual light in its essence is the Divine Truth of the Lord's Divine Wi=
sdom" (DP 317).</p><p>In other words, in examining the questions which plag=
ue us, we do not have to think from and rely on our own prudence. The human=
 mind is capable of being lifted up onto another plane of light.</p><p>The =
difficulty many people face, however, is that they do not allow their minds=
 to be lifted up, preferring to stay on the level of their own prudence. In=
 this state is often easier to confirm falsity than truth - especially if f=
alsity appeals to the appearances of the world around us. By analogy, it wa=
s easier to prove the world flat rather than round, or that the sun rotates=
 around the earth than the earth around the sun. It is only when our mind i=
s lifted above mere appearances that we are able to see things as they real=
ly are.</p><p>The person who bases his or her own confirmations simply on s=
ensual data find himself on a slippery slope into a permanent rejection of =
goodness and truth. The descent down this slope is described in DP 318 in t=
he following way:</p><p>1. It is easier to confirm falsity than truth. Conf=
irmation of falsity is the first step downward.</p><p>2. Once the falsity i=
s confirmed, truth will not appear (there is nothing more difficult than pr=
esenting truth to someone with a closed mind!)</p><p>3. The person then bel=
ieves him or herself to be intelligent, but this intelligence is really ing=
enuity (or cunning). </p><p>"None are intelligent but those who perceive tr=
uth to be truth, and confirm truth by individual truths continually perceiv=
ed" (DP 318:8).</p><p>4. At this point the person who confirms falsity is i=
n spiritual danger, because once a person confirms falsity in the understan=
ding, there is pressure to confirm it in the will also. Notice the distinct=
ion laid before us:</p><p>"There is confirmation that is intellectual and n=
ot at the same time voluntary, but all voluntary confirmation is also intel=
lectual" (DP 318:9).</p><p>In explaining this concept we are given the exam=
ple of people who intellectually confirm the concept of faith separated fro=
m charity, and yet lives of charity, with those who confirm that concept an=
d also live lives separated from charity. With the first group, there is st=
ill hope of salvation, but once the falsity has been confirmed in the will,=
 the falsity becomes rooted in the person's being.</p><p>5. The person in t=
his latter state comes to believe that his or her own prudence is everythin=
g, and the Divine is nothing. In other words, "I know best."</p><p>6. This =
final state is the state of hell, because the person completely closes his =
or her mind to the Lord.</p><p>"Everything confirmed by both the will and t=
he understanding remains to eternity because everyone is his own love, and =
love belongs to the will; also because every one is his own good or his own=
 evil..." (DP 319)</p><p>Thus the danger of confirming our own prudence is =
very real. Confirming our own prudence at the expense of Divine wisdom is d=
angerous to our spirit - not only does it fix our thoughts and feelings, bu=
t it actually changes the very physical nature of our minds. </p><p>In DP 3=
19 we are introduced to the concept of spiritual gyres, or spirals, which a=
re physical receptors to our spiritual life. These spirals are affected by =
our habitual thinking patterns:</p><p>"In the good those spiral forms are m=
oved forward but in the wicked backward, and those that are moved forward a=
re turned towards the Lord and receive influx from Him; while those that ar=
e moved backward are turned towards hell and receive influx from hell. It s=
hould be known that in the degree that they are turned backward they are op=
en behind and closed in front; and, on the other hand, in the degree that t=
hey are turned forward they are open in front and closed behind" (DP 319).<=
/p><p>Thus even our physical forms reflect our spiritual state. The greater=
 our confirmation of prudence, the more difficult it is to break that state=
.</p><p>BREAKING THE STATE</p><p>The only real way to break our cycle of co=
nfirmation and thus of evil in our lives is to rise above the appearances o=
f prudence into the reality of spiritual light. On the lower level it appea=
rs as if everything begins and ends in us as individuals. Nothing, however,=
 could be further from the truth.</p><p>"If a person believed, as is the tr=
uth, that all good and truth originate from the Lord, and all evil and fals=
ity from hell, he would not appropriate good to himself and account it meri=
torious, nor would he appropriate evil to himself and account himself respo=
nsible for it" (DP 320).</p><p>Seeing and understanding this proposition re=
quires a series of steps, which, once understood, help a person to understa=
nd not only our relationship to good and evil, but also how the Lord sees u=
s when we are in a state of evil.</p><p>1. If a person believes that all th=
ings originate in him or her, that person ends up separated from the source=
 of all things. The Lord did create us with the appearance of self life. Bu=
t He also gave us the knowledge of reality, that is, that life is from Hims=
elf. </p><p>2. It may seem impossible to believe that good and truth flow i=
nto us from an outside source, but nevertheless it is the truth. The diffic=
ulty some people have with the concept of good and truth, evil and falsity =
flowing into us, is that it appears as if we are then left without anything=
 of our own:</p><p>"Yet a person does think as from himself even though fro=
m hell, because the Lord grants to everyone that thought, whatever its orig=
in, should appear in him as his own. Otherwise a person would not live as a=
 person, nor could he be led out of hell and introduced into heaven, that i=
s, be reformed..." (DP 321:4)</p><p>Thus we are able to think in accordance=
 or in opposition to the good or evil flowing into us. Essentially we have =
the freedom to react to the influx.</p><p>3. It is really only possible to =
understand this if we believe in the Lord.</p><p>4. We are able to see the =
evil with ourselves as originating beyond us, in hell, and so we have the p=
ower from the Lord to shun and reject that evil. When the Lord looks at us,=
 He also sees the reality, and sees that evil present with us is from hell,=
 and is not our own unless we confirm it. </p><p>5. Therefore the Lord does=
 not ascribe evil or good to us, but to its origin. We however, ascribe it =
to ourselves when we confirm it in our lives.</p><p>CONCLUSION</p><p>This p=
rinciple, therefore, has major ramifications in our lives. The Lord, in cre=
ating us granted us freedom, but did not create hell. People created hell w=
hen they turned away from the Lord. On a smaller scale, the Lord sees neith=
er good nor evil in us as if it were our own, for neither are ever ours: we=
 are simply vessels which open our minds to receive good and truth or evil =
and falsity.</p><p>The difficulty people face in this life in coming to gri=
ps with the nature of evil is that we often think of a person as being "evi=
l" or as being "good", as if that quality is intrinsic to the person. These=
 states, however, never become part of the person, they always remain outsi=
de him or her.</p><p>But, by the life we lead in this world, and by the thi=
ngs we choose from either heaven or hell, determine whether we are receptiv=
e to the Lord or not. If a person could truly acknowledge that their goodne=
ss or evil is not their own, then their confirmation will take place on a v=
ery different plane of life - almost as if we could see the very cause of o=
ur being, and react to that, rather than to the mundane appearances.</p><p>=
This knowledge has a very freeing effect on a person, because it puts us in=
to perspective, freeing us from the limitations of relying entirely on our =
own prudence, and gives us instead the freedom to draw on the Lord's power =
to disperse evil and false influences on our lives.</p><p>Thus we see the L=
ord's mercy in the whole subject of evil. He permits it for the sake of hum=
an salvation, constantly working to encourage us towards good. True, He all=
ows us to see and suffer the consequences of our own, and other's evil, but=
 He never punishes nor chastises, only helping us to do what is good and ri=
ght.</p><p></p><p></p><div align=3D"Right">16</div><hr><p>

p>In chapter twelve and thirteen, the Lord's constitution draws to a close.=
 It is in these chapters that the Lord gives His guarantee that His goal of=
 a heaven from the human race can, and will, be fulfilled, within the limit=
ations of human cooperation.</p><p>As the picture of Providence unfolds bef=
ore us, so we are shown how the Lord, having created people for the sake of=
 heaven, endowed them with a complete sense of freedom. This freedom is rea=
l in spiritual matters, and nothing whatever can interfere with it. If free=
dom is to be true, it must be a freedom to choose both good and evil. Thus =
the Lord respects human choice by permitting evil - even though it is not H=
IS choice.</p><p>The subject and issue of human evil is one which has plagu=
ed theologians and philosophers ever since evil began. To avoid ascribing e=
vil to the Lord Himself, various answers have been put forwards, Lucifer be=
ing the most common in the Christian world. </p><p>From a New Church perspe=
ctive, the issue of evil is simple: it is a result of badly managed human f=
reedom, a freedom conferred upon people by the Lord. But evil is not the Lo=
rd's fault, blame belongs to the human race, individually and collectively.=
</p><p>In providing for freedom and the subsequent evil, the Lord's entire =
aim of a heaven can seem to be thwarted. If evil is hereditary, and that he=
reditary cumulative, what mechanism is provided for the deliverance of thos=
e who, having fallen into evil, now wish to reconciled to the Lord.</p><p>I=
n orthodox Christianity the solution offered is the image of Christ on the =
Cross, bearing human sins as an atonement to the Divine Father. But since t=
his concept does not work in New Church doctrine, one needs to look at an a=
lternative which fits into the New Church view of the oneness of God, His g=
race and compassion, and human freedom.</p><p>This is the issue at stake in=
 this chapter. Careful consideration of it will reveal a God of infinite me=
rcy and patience, and yet a God who, in setting out the laws of His governm=
ent is not going to change those laws.</p><p>REFORMATION</p><p>The Lord's L=
ove and Wisdom</p><p>It is an absolute point in Divine Providence that the =
Lord created people to go to heaven, and that nothing, short of a person's =
own free choice will interfere with that. The five laws of Divine Providenc=
e explain this very clearly. There is, however, a further factor preserving=
 our freedom right to the end of life: each person is created into the imag=
e and likeness of the Lord, which can never be destroyed:</p><p>DP 322: It =
is a dictate of sound reason that all are predestined to heaven, and no one=
 to hell; for all are born men, and consequently the image of God is in the=
m.</p><p>What constitutes this image within a person?</p><p>1. To be able t=
o understand truth from Divine Wisdom.</p><p>2. To be able to do good from =
Divine Love (DP 322).</p><p>These two abilities are what make a person a pe=
rson, and separate people from animals.</p><p>No animal is able to rise abo=
ve its natural instincts and reflect on the nature of God. It is true that =
many animals are very clever. They can be trained to do tricks, and some of=
 them even use tools. But they do not have the ability to think rationally =
and to act according to that rationality. Thus no cat, no matter how well t=
rained is able to empathize with a mouse - instinct demands a meal, and a m=
eal it will have.</p><p>People are different. They share, to some degree, t=
he external parts of their minds with animals. To some degree all education=
 is a matter of training. But humans have the ability to moralize, and, eve=
n better, to spiritualize.</p><p>People are taught the laws of the country =
they live in. In obeying these they become civil beings, rather like traine=
d animals. But, to the degree that people make a moral issue about these ci=
vil laws, they become moral, which already puts them on a plateau higher th=
an the animals. Thus a civil law may state that it is illegal to steal. A m=
oral person may add a value judgment to that statement and say "It is WRONG=
 to steal." When he refrains from stealing for that reason, he becomes a mo=
ral person. When, however, he adds a spiritual dimension to the same law, h=
e becomes a spiritual man:</p><p>DP 322: "I will now state how the civil an=
d moral life is a receptacle of the spiritual life: Live these laws not onl=
y as civil and moral laws, but also as Divine Laws, and you will be a spiri=
tual man... Hence it may be evident that every one because he is born such =
that he may become a civil and moral natural man is also born such that he =
can become a civil and moral spiritual man.<br>This is the key to the route=
 back from evil to salvation. By providing us with this ability the Lord ke=
eps open the ability for people, through obedience and submission to Him, t=
o be saved."</p><p>The Lord sends no one to hell, but draws all towards Him=
self in heaven.</p><p>Many people believe in predestination, the concept th=
at the Lord determines some people to heaven and others to hell. This conce=
pt, as we shall see in the following pages, is totally at odds with the tea=
chings of the Doctrines. Thus the Lord does everything in His power to ensu=
re that people are saved.</p><p>THE GOAL OF CREATION</p><p>Sometimes people=
 wonder why the Lord created people, and why He works incessantly to bring =
them into heaven. The answer lies in understanding the Lord's motivations, =
because that understanding not only gives us an answer to the reason for ou=
r existence, but also insight into how much the Lord's love for us determin=
ed the way we are created. </p><p>To explain this in detail, the next secti=
on of this chapter is divided into four sub-headings, each a part of the de=
velopmental theme of how the Lord's love for us is so great that He gives u=
s every means possible to exercise free choice and be delivered from evil.<=
/p><p>1. Every person is created that he may live for ever.</p><p>This firs=
t point is a recapitulation of many similar statements given in this book. =
It bears considerable thought, however. Since we were created to be able to=
 understand and do the things the Lord teaches us, if we are able to rise t=
hrough the degrees of life from being a civil to a moral to a spiritual per=
son, then it follows that we are created to be conjoined to the Lord Himsel=
f. As we saw in an earlier chapter, this conjunction is heaven itself.</p><=
p>The Lord created us in this way from love:</p><p>DP 324: For love desires=
 to communicate its own to another, and even to give from its own as much a=
s it can. What then would the Divine Love which is infinite not give.</p><p=
>In this statement we have the kernel of the truth about salvation. For the=
 Lord, loving people, not for His own sake, but ours, continually gives, an=
d continues to give, even in the face of rejection. The passage quoted abov=
e continues:</p><p>Can that [love] give and take away again? Would not this=
 be giving what is about to perish? Inwardly in itself this is nothing, as =
when anything perishes it comes to naught, that which IS not being in it. B=
ut the Divine Love gives what IS, that is, which does not cease to be, and =
this is eternal (DP 324).</p><p>The gift the Lord gave us, eternal and not =
perishable, is the gift of spiritual life: the ability to see truth and do =
it, protected by human freedom, preserved inviolate by the laws of Divine P=
rovidence. The only part of us which can die is our natural body, "which is=
 taken away by death" (DP 324). All the rest of us, our thoughts and feelin=
gs, our likes and dislikes, our very being, continues to live to eternity, =
for that is the part of us created into the Lord's image.</p><p>In establis=
hing this first point the Lord hammers home to us the reason for our creati=
on. It is only when we forget this first point that people become estranged=
 from the Lord. To remember it is to remember that our life has meaning, th=
at momentary pleasures are transitory - that if we can count to ten and ove=
rcome a temptation, our spirits will be immeasurably enriched by the closer=
 proximity of the Lord. This leads into the second point about why we are c=
reated:</p><p>2. Every one is created to live forever in a state of happine=
ss.</p><p>In a world full of misery this point is sometimes hard to grasp. =
It is hard to imagine people suffering in war zones being happy, or people =
starving hoping for eternal life. In our affluent corners of the world, it =
is sometimes hard to imagine happiness amid the pressures of life, the stre=
ss and taxes and social problems we have to face. Yet the Lord made us to b=
e happy. Divine Providence states this so simply and purely:</p><p>DP 324: =
"He who wills that a person should live forever also wills that he should l=
ive in a state of happiness. What would eternal life be without that?"</p><=
p>What would our eternal life be without happiness? It would be the life of=
 hell. Yet this is the very life so many of us choose for ourselves by exer=
cising human freedom in a perverse way: we choose to be angry, stressed, di=
shonest. We choose to cheat, steal, lie and murder on all planes of life. W=
hen we reap the consequences of misery we blame the Lord.</p><p>Can we real=
ly blame Him? Through out the constitution of His Divine Government He does=
 every thing short of denying our freedom to bring us out of states of evil=
 into states of reconciliation and happiness. There is a surprising stateme=
nt at the end of this paragraph in Divine Providence, which will be discuss=
ed in more detail later:</p><p>DP 324:7: "Hence it is clear that eternal li=
fe is also eternal happiness. This state of a person is the end of creation=
; and it is not the Lord's fault but a person's that only those who enter h=
eaven are in that state. That a person is in fault will be seen in what fol=
lows."</p><p>3. Thus everyone is created to enter heaven.</p><p>DP 324:7: "=
This is the end of creation; but all do not enter heaven because they have =
become imbued with the delights of hell which are opposite to the happiness=
 of heaven; and those who are not in the happiness of heaven cannot enter h=
eaven, for they cannot endure it."</p><p>Heaven is a state of mind, one we =
experience more fully after death than before, but no less real in each wor=
ld. In this world a person's ruling love is often clothed with the external=
s of natural life, with the result that people of various inner qualities l=
ife intermixed. After death, however, that mixing cannot be, for there peop=
le are conscious of each others sphere, exhaled from their ruling love. The=
 result is that different people repel each other. The Writings give severa=
l accounts of people who tried to enter heaven when either their love is in=
compatible with it, or they are not fully prepared.</p><p>This does not alt=
er the fact that the Lord made people to go to heaven, and, as we have seen=
, the Lord gives each and every person the opportunity to come into that st=
ate. Hell only comes about through a person's instrumentality, against the =
wishes of the Lord Himself.</p><p>4. The Divine Love cannot do otherwise th=
an desire this, and the Divine Wisdom cannot do otherwise than provide for =
it (DP 324:11).</p><p>Everything builds up to this conclusion: that people,=
 created to go to heaven, are assisted in every way possible in order for t=
he Lord to fulfill His desire of a heaven from the human race. This concept=
 is the most powerful in all New Church doctrine, for it established beyond=
 any doubt the foundations of the Lord's relationship with us:</p><p>DP 324=
:12: "Now since a person from his birth is endowed with these two faculties=
 by the Lord, and consequently the Lord is in them as in His own with a per=
son, it is clear that His Divine Love cannot but will that a person should =
go to heaven and there enjoy eternal happiness, and also that the Divine Wi=
sdom cannot but provide for this."</p><p>The power of this teaching is most=
 strongly felt when one compares it with other concepts about the Lord draw=
n from the previous church, such as the idea that God is angry, wrathful, v=
engeful. Or that the God required the sacrifice of His "son", or that belie=
f alone will bring a person into harmony with the Lord. All these teachings=
 pale into insignificance in the face of the powerfully true teaching that =
the Lord, who is love itself and wisdom itself works unceasingly, within Hi=
s all embracing laws of Divine Providence, to draw people into heaven.</p><=
p>THE UNIVERSALITY OF THIS GOAL</p><p>With these thoughts in mind one can n=
ow see that while evil, permitted by the Lord, can nevertheless be turned a=
way that good may take its place. The power and force of the Lord's love fo=
r each member of the human race - regardless of the external aspects of the=
ir own religion. The Lord's providence is universal. One of the most beauti=
ful images of the New Church is of the Lord's love and wisdom reaching all =
people. </p><p>DP 325: Some are of the opinion that the Church of the Lord =
is only in the Christian world, because there alone the Lord is known and t=
here alone is the Word. Still, however, many believe that the Church of the=
 Lord is general, that is, spread and dispersed throughout the whole world,=
 thus existing also with some who are ignorant of the Lord and who do not h=
ave the Word. They maintain that it is not the fault of those men that they=
 cannot overcome their ignorance, and that it is contrary to the love and m=
ercy of God that some should be born for hell when yet they also are equall=
y men.</p><p>In this passage we see an example of a phenomenon within the C=
hristian Church: many, especially the laity, do not believe the doctrinal t=
eachings of the church (although many do believe). For many people the teac=
hings of the church are replaced with a kind of inner conviction far closer=
 to reality than many suspect.</p><p>The Lord's effort to salvation is univ=
ersal because it rests on universal principles which cannot restricted by a=
ny particular confession. We saw at the beginning of this lecture that the =
image and likeness of the Lord in us rests on two points: the first is the =
ability to think is accordance with Divine truth, the second the ability to=
 carry those thoughts into action. The First Law of Providence provides tha=
t this image will not, in fact, cannot, be violated within us. </p><p>It al=
so holds true for all religions, for in every religion the individual is ch=
allenged to believe in God, be it Jehovah of the Jews, Allah of the Moslems=
, or the gods of the Hindus. Because a person can conceive of an idea of Go=
d, the person is then able to respond, through that concept, to the Lord's =
presence with them. </p><p>DP 326: The acknowledgement of God brings about =
the conjunction of God with a person and a person with God, and the denial =
of God causes their separation.</p><p>Thought about the Lord, even it seems=
, and imperfect one, brings the presence of the Lord to a person. In the sp=
iritual world</p><p>DP 326: "... when anyone thinks about another and desir=
es to converse with him, the other is immediately present. This is general =
there and never fails. The reason is that in the spiritual world there is n=
o distance as in the natural world, but only an appearance of distance."</p=
><p>Thought about the Lord, therefore, brings the Lord's presence to that p=
erson, thus establishing the image of the Lord within a person:</p><p>DP 32=
6:4: "From this it is clear that so far as one knows the Lord and from this=
 knowledge thinks about Him, so far the Lord is present; and so far as anyo=
ne acknowledges Him from an affection of love, so far the Lord is conjoined=
 to him; but on the other hand, so far as anyone does not know the Lord so =
far the Lord is absent, and so far as anyone denies Him, so far is He separ=
ated from him."</p><p>Consideration of this passage strikes one with the re=
alization that the Lord, pressing and urging to be received, nevertheless l=
eaves it up to the individual to take the next step of accepting or rejecti=
ng. Thus personal freedom in spiritual matters is preserved at all costs.</=
p><p>Thinking about the Lord, however, is not enough: faith has to be coupl=
ed to charity, thought to action. The action seals the thought, making an i=
ndelible part of the person's being. The aim of much religious thought is p=
urification from evil for the sake of a conjunction with the Lord, be it Ch=
ristian, Jewish, Moslem or Hindu.</p><p>DP 326:9: "These are the general pr=
inciples of all religions by which everyone can be saved... It has been pro=
vided by the Lord that almost everywhere there should be some form of relig=
ion, and that in every religion there should be these two principles; and i=
t has also been provided by the Lord that everyone who acknowledges God and=
 refrains from doing evil because it is against God should have a place in =
heaven."</p><p>The human role in salvation</p><p>All this leads up to the i=
nescapable conclusion, mentioned earlier, that since the Lord Himself does =
every single thing possible to bring people to heaven, should a person resi=
st and end up in hell, that conclusion is entirely the individual's fault. =
The following passage puts this bluntly:</p><p>DP 327: "The person himself =
is in fault if he is not saved. Every rational man, as soon as he hears it,=
 acknowledges the truth that evil cannot flow from good nor good from evil,=
 because they are opposites; consequently that from good there flows nothin=
g but good, and from evil nothing but evil. When this truth is acknowledged=
 it is also acknowledged that good can be turned into evil not by a good bu=
t by an evil recipient; for every form concerts into its own quality what f=
lows into it... Now since the Lord is Good in its very essence, or God itse=
lf, it is evident that evil cannot flow from Him or be produced by Him; but=
 that good can be turned into evil by the recipient subject whose form is a=
 form of evil. Such a subject is a person as to his proprium, which continu=
ally receives good from the Lord and continually turns it into the nature o=
f its own form, which is a form of evil. Hence it follows that a person is =
in fault if he is not saved."</p><p>The reason people receive evil is becau=
se there is evil in the world, originating in hell and finding its home in =
people's loves of selfishness and greed. The image of how a person, who is =
born innocent and yet as an adult chooses evil is parallel to the history o=
f churches in this world.</p><p>Churches go though phases of creation, plat=
eauing and finally declining. All church, "in process of time decline and a=
re consummated" (DP 328). While the story of the various churches which hav=
e existed from eternity is important, for the purposes of this study, the r=
eason WHY they turned from the Lord and fell is of paramount importance:</p=
><p>DP 328: "Every religion declines and is consummated by the inversion of=
 the image of God in a person."</p><p>As we have seen, people are created i=
nto the image and likeness of the Lord, and it is this very form of creatio=
n, in all people, which enables a church to be formed within the human brea=
st, and ultimately leads the person to heaven. But, because people are free=
 to abuse the freedom given them by the Lord, the Lord's image itself, thou=
gh it cannot be removed, can be inverted. When that happens the will and un=
derstanding of good and truth seem to be destroyed, for, by turning away fr=
om the Lord, the person turns</p><p>DP 328:6: "... these receptacles away f=
rom God and thus turned them towards himself. Consequently they have become=
 closed above and opened below, or closed in front and opened behind. When =
they have thus been inversely opened and closed, the receptacle of love, th=
at is the will, receives influx from hell or one's own proprium; and so als=
o does the receptacle of wisdom, that is, ones understanding."</p><p>When t=
his happens, the church existing in series on earth perished. The same is t=
rue for the individual, for communication with the Lord is broken off, leav=
ing communication with hell to run rampant.</p><p>The tragedy of this situa=
tion is that it is compounded by generations of hereditary evil accumulatin=
g within the human proprium, reducing the desire of future generations to r=
espond to the Lord. Unless the Lord provided a way out of that conundrum, t=
he human race would be completely overwhelmed by evil, and would be complet=
ely lost to the Lord.&nbsp;</p><p>It is indicative of the Lord's mercy that=
 even after an entire succession of churches, the Lord continues to provide=
 a way out of evil and into heaven. It shows us the quality of His love for=
 the human race, and His desire to bring people into the happiness of His h=
eaven. In the face of human rejection, the Lord provides that "... everyone=
 may be saved" (DP 328:8).</p><p>The means of this provision show clearly h=
ow Divine Love knows no boundaries:</p><p>1. "It is provided by the Lord th=
at there should be a religion everywhere; and that in every religion there =
should be the two essentials of salvation..."</p><p>2. "It is also provided=
 that all who have lived well and have acknowledged God are instructed afte=
r death by angels, and when those who had observed these two essentials of =
religion while in the world accept the truths of the church as they are in =
the Word, and acknowledge the Lord as the God of heaven and the church.</p>=
<p>3. "Further, there is granted to everyone after death the opportunity of=
 amending his life, if that is at all possible..." (DP 328:8,9)</p><p>PREDE=
STINATION</p><p>From all this, we are shown how the Lord, in designing a Di=
vine Constitution to govern the human race, builds into it concepts of merc=
y far beyond our limited understanding. The Lord's desire to save people is=
 unceasing, the powerful draw of His Providence working against inherited a=
nd actual evils in each individual. The Lord uses every means at His dispos=
al to bring people into His heaven.</p><p>In theological terms once calls t=
his force "Predestination":</p><p>DP 329: "Thus all are predestined to heav=
en, and no one to hell."</p><p>A powerful statement in a world where evil, =
sin and misery seem to be the norm, and happiness and peace elusive qualiti=
es.</p><p>The issue of predestination in the Christian religion has been a =
divisive force. In considering the relationship of the Lord and human being=
s, it is impossible to conceive of any other than that of a continual prede=
stination to heaven. This work shows the nature of the Lord, confirming His=
 Divine love and Divine wisdom:</p><p>DP 330:3: "The Divine Love through th=
e Divine Wisdom provides the means by which every one may be saved; and the=
refore to say that there is any predestination except to heaven is to say t=
hat the Divine Love cannot provide the means by which salvation may be effe=
cted."</p><p>The whole thrust of the work Divine Providence, is to show exa=
ctly how the Lord sets about the task of saving the human race. Any concept=
 of predestination to hell makes nonsense of the concept we are given of th=
e Lord. In light of the teachings revealed to us, it is foolish to limit th=
e Lord's salvation to a portion of the race, and cruel to suggest that He s=
ends anyone to hell. Both make a mockery of the Lord Himself.</p><p>DP 330:=
8: "The Lord is every the Creator and Savior of all; and He alone leads all=
 and desires the death of no one. It is therefore cruel to believe and thin=
k that so great a multitude of nations and peoples under His auspices and o=
versight should be handed over as prey to the devil by predestination."</p>=
<p>CONCLUSION</p><p>In this second to last chapter of the book, Divine Prov=
idence, we are shown how the Divine Constitution of the Lord brings us a fu=
ll circle from the way of creating people, through the problem of evil, bac=
k to the Divine goal of a heaven from the human race. In it our relationshi=
p with the Lord is laid bare, and we are challenged to take responsibility =
for our own life.</p><p>There is no place in this theology to sit idle, awa=
iting influx to move us. Nor can there be any excuse for our choices. Each =
of us, as individuals, is called upon to respond to the Lord as we know Him=
, to learn and obey the teachings of our own churches and religions, and th=
rough that come into contact with that powerful salvatory force originating=
 in the Divine Love and carried into being in the Divine Wisdom.&nbsp;</p><=
p>This section of the book draws us inevitably into the realization that wh=
ile the Lord is the creator, while we, although recipients of His love and =
wisdom, nevertheless are called upon to exercise the rationality and freedo=
m as if it originates within ourselves.</p><p>To exercise these abilities t=
o further our own ends will lead us away from the Lord, and ultimately into=
 hell. But to respond affirmatively, to follow from choice the path we are =
shown, leads to conjunction, happiness, wisdom and peace.</p><p></p><p></p>=

</p><p>
&nbsp;Lecture Thirteen - The Lord Keeps His Laws</p><p>INTRODUCTION</p><p>U=
nlike many human governments, the Lord binds Himself absolutely to the Laws=
 of Divine Providence. He never breaks, nor deviates from them, because the=
y are expressions of His Divine Love in the form of Divine Wisdom. Thus the=
y are expressions of Himself, and, because the Lord Himself does not change=
, His laws do not change either. Political governments regularly reassess o=
r re-analyze their constitutions, amendment after amendment is debated and =
either passed or rejected, but the Lord's constitution, because it is perfe=
ct and universal cannot be subject to this kind of process. </p><p>The enti=
re thrust of Divine Providence is to create a heaven from the human race, b=
ut this can only be achieved in a state of order:</p><p>DP 331:2 "... the D=
ivine Providence is the Divine Order primarily with regard to the salvation=
 of men; and as there is no order without laws, for laws constitute order a=
nd every law derives from order that it also is order, it follows that as G=
od is Order He is also the law of His own Order." </p><p>Therefore, for the=
 Lord to act against His own laws, would be for Him to deviate from His own=
 order. </p><p>One always needs to keep in mind the Lord's goal of creating=
 a heaven from the human race. Considering human character, especially sinc=
e the fall of the most ancient church, many people are tempted to believe t=
here is no necessity for the Lord to act in this orderly way. Millions of p=
eople believe in the process of salvation from the Lord's mercy.</p><p>The =
Lord is merciful, and the Laws of Providence, especially perhaps those pert=
aining to permissions of evil, bear this out. For the Lord, however, to act=
 out of pure mercy and drag someone into heaven, would not be an act of mer=
cy at all. In the briefest analysis, such mercy would undermine the entire =
concept of human freedom cultivated by the Lord. </p><p>For many people the=
 concept of salvation through pure mercy arises from a lack of understandin=
g the nature of human beings and human evil. We saw earlier that every evil=
 contains thousands of associated evils, each of which exerts a powerful in=
fluence on the way we feel, think and act. To request pure mercy, is to den=
y these deeper evils, for one asks forgiveness and deliverance from conscio=
us evils. Deliverance from surface evil doesn't solve the deeper evils, the=
y too must be allowed their exposure and be removed according to order.</p>=
<p>Thus the Divine Providence is maintained by the Lord for the sake of cul=
tivating in a person an aversion to evil, with consequent deliverance from =
it. The Lord, at all times, is aware of and protective of, the person's fre=
edom of choice.</p><p>Thus we are told, by way of the heading of this final=
 chapter:</p><p>DP 331: "The Lord cannot act contrary to the Laws of the Di=
vine Providence, because to act contrary to them would be to act contrary t=
o His Divine Love and His Divine Wisdom, thus contrary to Himself."</p><p>B=
y contemplating the order of Providence we are given a glimpse into the nat=
ure of the Lord Himself. The power of His love for the Human race is so gre=
at He will not allow it to be circumvented or disrupted. </p><p>Because the=
 Laws of Providence are so powerfully protected, out of love, we are also g=
iven the wonderful concept that the Lord's love is unchanging, unconditiona=
l and all powerful. The main point of this last chapter, then, is to descri=
be this love in its fullness.</p><p>DIVINE LOVE IS FOREVER</p><p>If one cou=
ld put the concept of Divine love into one time-related word, one would say=
 "unceasing." The Laws of Providence, being salvation centered, play an unc=
easing role in our lives, even when, or maybe especially when, we are not c=
onscious of them. </p><p>DP 332: The operation of the Divine Providence for=
 the salvation of a person beings at his birth and continues right on to th=
e end of his life, and afterwards to eternity.</p><p>Our lives are spend in=
 the embrace of these laws. Nothing can, or will every alter that. If a per=
son chooses to accept the Lord, the Laws of Providence provide and environm=
ent in which that person may grow and develop spiritually. Should one choos=
e evil, the Laws of Permission "which are also laws of the Divine Providenc=
e" work unceasingly to stimulate the conscience, and lead the person either=
 right out of evil, or at least into a milder hell. Consider the following =
passage:</p><p>DP 332:4 "... there must be a constant progression in the re=
formation and regeneration of men..."</p><p>Because the Lord governs and re=
gulates the laws of providence and permission to suit the needs of a partic=
ular person, it follows that the Lord knows each and every individual intim=
ately. He knows what kinds of choices we will make, and how we will use tho=
se choices:</p><p>DP 333: "The Lord foresees a person's state after death, =
and provides for it from his birth right on to the end of his life. With th=
e wicked the Lord provides by permitting and continually withdrawing them f=
rom evils; while with the good He provides by leading them to good. Thus th=
e Divine Providence is unceasing in the work of saving men."</p><p>This for=
esight and leading should not be interpreted as somehow removing individual=
 freedom. The concept of personal choice is the cornerstone upon which the =
Lord's relationship with people rests. To remove freedom is to take away th=
e most essential characteristic of humanity, so freedom is always protected=
.</p><p>The Lord, however, can see our nature. He knows our frame, and on t=
he basis of that knowledge, directs us, in freedom, to our greatest state o=
f goodness. </p><p>DP 333: "... no more can be saved than desire to be save=
d, and only those desire to be saved who acknowledge God and are led by Him=
; but those who do not desire to be saved who do not acknowledge God and wh=
o lead themselves... This the Lord sees and still leads them..."</p><p>Thus=
 the concept of human freedom in no way clashes with the concept that the L=
ord knows our place in heaven or hell. Should He foresee a place in hell fo=
r us, we still have the freedom, and indeed the Divine encouragement, to re=
pent. </p><p>The action of Divine Providence is unceasing because it reflec=
ts the nature of the Lord Himself. While we live in this world, our minds a=
re closely bound to the natural plane of life, and it is easy for us to thi=
nk of Providence as only working towards our ultimate salvation. It is impo=
rtant to remember, however, that the Lord created us to live to eternity. S=
piritual life is equally governed by the laws of providence:</p><p>DP 334: =
"The operation of the Divine Providence is also said to continue to eternit=
y because every angel is being perfected in wisdom to eternity, but each ac=
cording to that degree of affection for good and truth in which he was when=
 he departed from the world."</p><p>MEANS AND MERCY</p><p>A great many peop=
le confuse means and mercy. Mercy in itself implies the Lord's forgiveness =
and salvation. It also implies an immediate forgiveness. Means, on the othe=
r hand, implies a far greater interaction between people and the Lord. It i=
ndicates the need for process in the granting of mercy. For many this is a =
difficult concept.</p><p>If, however, on considers the laws of providence, =
and one pictures the various laws, established by the Lord, maintained with=
in their form and structure, then one can come to see how the Lord's Divine=
 Mercy works: it works through means.</p><p>DP 335: There are means and met=
hods of the Divine Providence. Its means are the things from the exercise o=
f which a person becomes a person and is perfected as to his understanding =
and his will, and its methods are the measures through which such things ar=
e effected.</p><p>In other words, a person is regenerated by various means,=
 and the methods are the ways in which Divine Providence brings those means=
 into act:</p><p>Means</p><p>Means belong to the understanding, and so are:=
</p><p>* truths</p><p>* ideas</p><p>* memories</p><p>* wisdom</p><p>* incre=
ases to eternity</p><p>DP 335: "These means are infinite in number and vari=
ety, and are more or less simple and compound, and also more or less imperf=
ect perfect. There are also means for forming and perfecting ... civil, ...=
 moral ... and spiritual life."</p><p>Methods</p><p>DP 336: "Moreover, the =
methods by which the Divine Providence operates upon the means and through =
these to form a person and to perfect him are also infinite in number and v=
ariety. They are as numerous as the operations of the Divine Wisdom from th=
e Divine Love to save a person, and thus as numerous as the operations of t=
he Divine Providence..."</p><p>The methods are hidden from view.</p><p>The =
means and methods of Divine Providence must be seen in the context of Divin=
e Mercy. The following passage is most important:</p><p>DP 337: "The Divine=
 Providence does all things out of pure Mercy, because the Divine Essence i=
tself is pure Love; and it is this which operates through the Divine Wisdom=
, and this operation is called the Divine Providence. This pure love is pur=
e Mercy because:</p><p>1. It operates with all men throughout the whole wor=
ld, who are such that they can do nothing from themselves.</p><p>2. It oper=
ates equally with the wicked and unjust, and with the good and just.</p><p>=
3. It leads the former in hell and rescues them from it.</p><p>4. It perpet=
ually strives with them there and fights for them against the devil, that i=
s, against the evils of hell.</p><p>5. For that cause it came into the worl=
d, and endured temptations even to the last of them, which was the passion =
of the cross.</p><p>6. It acts continually with the unclean to make them cl=
ean and with the unsound in mind to restore them to sanity; thus it labors =
continually out of pure MERCY."</p><p>MERCY WITHOUT MEANS</p><p>DP 338: "In=
 what has gone before it was shown that the operation of the Divine Provide=
nce for the salvation of a person begins at his birth and continues right o=
n to the end of his life, and afterwards to eternity; also that this operat=
ion is continually effected through means out of pure mercy. Hence it follo=
ws that neither instantaneous salvation nor immediate mercy is possible."</=
p><p>In this statement we are shown how many of the teachings of orthodox C=
hristianity regarding salvation are based on a misconception of the Lord's =
ways of dealing with people. The belief in instantaneous salvation is a bel=
ief that the Lord saves someone purely according to the person's statement =
of faith, and not according to any real state of faith and charity within t=
he individual. Similarly immediate mercy, meaning mercy without means, is a=
 conception of the Lord's forgiveness in which he forgives sins without req=
uiring any participatory action on the person's behalf. Both these concepts=
 are very common in Christianity. However, in terms of the Laws of Providen=
ce, they are untenable. Three reasons for this are given:</p><p>1. The star=
ting point of reason is wrong: many people confuse natural and spiritual jo=
y, believing that spiritual joy is the same as worldly joy, and that someho=
w the Lord can change a person's sense of joy. DP 338:3: "It is therefore b=
elieved that heaven can be granted to the wicked as well as to the good, an=
d that their association is then similar to that of the world, with this di=
fference only that it is full of joy."</p><p>2. This initial viewpoint aris=
es from ignorance: few people are aware of the nature of the life after dea=
th, and especially of the nature and impact of the ruling love. If people d=
id know this difference they would know that DP 338:6 "... no one who is in=
 the delight of hell can be admitted into the delight of heaven, which is c=
ommonly called heavenly joy... Consequently mere admission is not the only =
thing needful, as many in the world suppose; nor is there such a thing as i=
nstantaneous salvation, for this implies immediate mercy."</p><p>3. Interes=
tingly, the official doctrines of the Christian religion recognize this, an=
d "are against instantaneous salvation from immediate mercy, but still it i=
s maintained by the external men in the church" (DP 338:8). The truth of th=
is can be seen if one realizes that all church teach repentance from evil, =
and so teach life.</p><p>DP 338:9: "Now a person's life is not breathed int=
o him in a moment, but is formed gradually, and is reformed as the person s=
huns evils as sins; consequently, as he knows what sin is, and recognizing =
it acknowledges it, and as he does not will it and therefore desists from i=
t, and as he leans also the means which relate to the knowledge of God." </=
p><p>INSTANTANEOUS SALVATION AND IMMEDIATE MERCY DESTROY THE CHURCH</p><p>T=
he very belief that the Lord somehow works apart form the means of His Divi=
ne Providence destroys a true understanding of the Lord, and thus destroys =
the church itself. </p><p>1. By means of it religion is abolished, because =
it makes religion redundant. If the Lord can simply save those who utter a =
formula, what need is there of repentance? What possibility is there of gro=
wing wise? It means that the human being is left in a state of sin, without=
 any need to do anything, for the Lord, in some sort of mercy will save him=
. This state can be compared to a parent who always does things for a child=
, so that the child has no need to learn anything. If one carries this to i=
ts logical conclusion, we can see that such a belief destroys religion.</p>=
<p>2. It induces a state of security. This is a consequence of a belief in =
pure mercy. If the Lord will automatically forgive, then this can be interp=
reted as a license to do any evil one pleases, for why should one avoid evi=
l if forgiveness is automatic and guaranteed. Again it makes a mockery of t=
he Lord.</p><p>3. It ascribes condemnation to the Lord. This final effect o=
f denying the Lords works through the means of His laws, is to deny the mer=
cy of the Lord. If a person lives a life of evil, and goes to hell, it is p=
erceived that the Lord withheld mercy from that person and condemned him or=
 her to hell. Thus the Lord is portrayed in a light entirely contrary to Hi=
s true nature. </p><p>CONCLUSION</p><p>From these things we can see that th=
e Lord, having established the Laws of Divine Providence, ensures that thos=
e laws are never broken. For Him to break them, or set them aside, would be=
 the destruction of His entire being. The Lord's being, or Divine Love, has=
 three qualities: to love others outside of Himself, to wish to be one with=
 them, and to render them happy (TCR 43). However, the only way in which He=
 can achieve this end is through the Laws of Divine Providence.
