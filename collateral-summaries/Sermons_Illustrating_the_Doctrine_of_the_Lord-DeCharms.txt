This collection by Richard De Charms presents a series of sermons designed to illustrate and explain the fundamental doctrines of the New Church, particularly focusing on the doctrine of the Lord and the unity of the Divine Trinity in Jesus Christ. The sermons systematically address the nature of the Trinity, arguing that God is one person consisting of three essential principles (Father, Son, and Holy Spirit) rather than three separate persons, and emphasize that Jesus Christ is the visible God who should be the direct object of Christian worship. De Charms contrasts New Church teachings with traditional Christian views, using rational arguments and scriptural evidence to demonstrate that the Lord's incarnation, glorification, and Divine Human nature are central to true Christian faith. Throughout, the work encourages readers to move beyond literal interpretations of Scripture to understand the spiritual sense revealed in the Writings of Swedenborg, which constitute the Second Coming of the Lord.
