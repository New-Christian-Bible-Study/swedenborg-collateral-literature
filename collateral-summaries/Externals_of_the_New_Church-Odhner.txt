This series of doctrinal classes by Hugo Lj. Odhner explores the relationship between the internal and external aspects of the New Church, emphasizing that true religion requires both inward charity and faith as well as outward forms, rituals, and organization. The work discusses the necessity of external uses, worship, and priesthood, showing how externals serve as vessels for spiritual life and protect the church from degeneration. Odhner addresses the dangers of focusing solely on externals without internal purpose, and the importance of correspondence between inner and outer life for genuine regeneration. The book provides practical and doctrinal guidance for building a church community that harmonizes spiritual intent with visible forms and uses.
