This work by George DeCharms examines the relationship between the New Church and modern Christianity, analyzing how the religious landscape has evolved since Swedenborg's time and how the Writings' teachings about the state of the Christian world remain relevant today. The book argues that while many traditional Christian doctrines have been reinterpreted or abandoned by modern liberal thinkers, the fundamental differences between New Church theology and mainstream Christianity persist, particularly regarding the Divinity of Jesus Christ and the nature of God. DeCharms demonstrates that modern Christianity has increasingly moved toward Arian and Socinian views that deny the Lord's true Divinity, treating Him as merely a human teacher or moral exemplar rather than as God incarnate. The work emphasizes the importance of understanding these differences for New Church members, both to strengthen their own faith and to engage meaningfully with those of other religious backgrounds.
