This comprehensive work by Rev. Harold C. Cranch provides detailed explanations of the Ten Commandments from a New Church perspective, examining both their literal and spiritual meanings as revealed in the Writings of Emanuel Swedenborg. The book emphasizes that the commandments are not merely civil laws but spiritual principles that form the foundation for regeneration, explaining how each commandment addresses both external actions and internal states of mind and heart. Cranch demonstrates that the first commandment about having no other gods is the most fundamental, as it establishes the basis for all other spiritual laws, and that idolatry includes worshiping external things without internal meaning, such as self-love and worldly desires. Throughout, the work stresses that true obedience to the commandments involves acknowledging their Divine origin, shunning evils as sins against God, and allowing the Lord to transform our lives through the truth of His Word.
