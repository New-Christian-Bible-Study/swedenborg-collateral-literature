This work examines the fundamental principle that "All religion is of life, and the life of religion is to do what is good," emphasizing that the New Church teachings are not merely for intellectual understanding but must be practically applied to transform human character and behavior. The author contrasts the New Church understanding of religion with traditional Christian views, arguing that while many religions claim to teach the law of God, the Writings provide a radically new concept of God, Jesus Christ, heaven, and the truly religious life that completely revolutionizes our understanding of what the Bible teaches. The work stresses that the application of doctrine involves more than adopting new rituals, church organization, or social customs, but requires a deeper transformation of the inner life and character that affects how we feel, speak, and act in all aspects of daily living. Throughout the treatise, the author emphasizes that the New Church comes into being only so far as this practical application is actually made, and that the most important thing is not merely knowing or understanding doctrine, but allowing it to guide and mold our lives for regeneration and preparation for the Lord's Kingdom.
