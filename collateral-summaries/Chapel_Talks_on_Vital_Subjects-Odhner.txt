This collection contains fifty-one brief chapel talks originally given to students at the Academy of the New Church, covering vital religious subjects in a clear and accessible manner suitable for family worship and Sunday services. The work begins with a comprehensive series on prayer, explaining that prayer is "talk with God together with some internal view of the subject," emphasizing that while prayers cannot change God's will, they serve to change us by preparing us to receive what the Lord wants to give us. The talks also address worship, ritual, and other fundamental religious concepts, stressing that external forms must have internal meaning to be truly effective, and that preparation for worship involves daily life practices of looking to the Lord, shunning evils, and serving others. Throughout the work, the author emphasizes the importance of understanding the spiritual meaning behind religious practices and the need for genuine internal worship that goes beyond mere external observance.
