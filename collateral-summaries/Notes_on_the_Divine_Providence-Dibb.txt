This series of thirteen lectures by Andy Dibb provides a comprehensive study of the book "Divine Providence" by Emanuel Swedenborg, presenting it as the Lord's constitution for governing the human race and explaining how Divine Love and Wisdom operate together to guide all things toward human salvation. The lectures examine the fundamental principles of Divine Providence, including the inseparable unity of Divine Love and Wisdom, the creation of the spiritual sun as the first proceeding of the Divine, and how all created forms are recipients of the Divine through contiguity rather than continuity. Dibb explains that Divine Providence works through human freedom, allowing people to choose their own path while constantly striving to lead them toward heaven, and that the Lord's government is characterized by absolute freedom that endures forever. The work emphasizes that understanding Divine Providence is essential for good citizenship in the Lord's kingdom and provides a structured approach to comprehending human responsibilities toward the Lord and the nature of His government.
