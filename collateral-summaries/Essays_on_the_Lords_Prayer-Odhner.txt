This volume by Hugo Lj. Odhner offers a series of essays on the Lord's Prayer, exploring its spiritual depth and significance as revealed in the Writings of Emanuel Swedenborg. Each section of the prayer is examined for its doctrinal and practical meaning, emphasizing prayer as a means of communication with the Lord and a guide for spiritual life and regeneration. Odhner highlights the importance of approaching the Lord as the Divine Human, the role of humility and charity in true prayer, and the transformative power of aligning one's will with Divine order. The work serves as both a devotional resource and a doctrinal study, encouraging readers to deepen their understanding and practice of prayer.
