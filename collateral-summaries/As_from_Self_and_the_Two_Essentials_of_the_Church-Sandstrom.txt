This theological work examines the concept of "as from self" in relation to the Lord's operation with man, explaining that while man feels life as if it were his own, both his love and all life forms from it exist solely from the Lord by touch. The document explores the distinction between the Lord's own with man (which can be Divine truths or created things) and the as-from-self principle, emphasizing that true freedom comes from acting according to conscience formed from the Word. It discusses the "image and likeness" of God in man, where likeness refers to man's ability to receive and reproduce what proceeds from the Lord, while image refers to acting and thinking in spiritual things as of oneself. The work concludes that the as-from-self principle is essential for conjunction with the Lord, as man must act freely from the Lord while acknowledging that all good and truth come from Him alone.
