This collection by Rt. Rev. Peter M. Buss contains selected sermons and addresses focusing primarily on marriage and conjugial love, presenting the New Church understanding of true married love as a spiritual journey guided by Divine truth and characterized by innocence, peace, tranquility, and inmost friendship. The work emphasizes that conjugial love is not merely emotional but requires walking in the Lord's paths through learning and applying His truth, and that while the initial passion of marriage may fade, true love develops through friendship, mutual trust, and the practice of charity. Buss explains that marriage serves as a vessel for spiritual growth, where two people can work together to overcome selfishness and develop the qualities necessary for heaven, with friendship acting as a bridge between natural love and spiritual conjugial love. The addresses also discuss the importance of tenderness, communication, and mutual understanding in building lasting relationships that reflect the Lord's love for His church.
