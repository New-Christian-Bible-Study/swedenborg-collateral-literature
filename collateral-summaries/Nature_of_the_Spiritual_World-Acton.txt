This comprehensive theological work by Alfred Acton explores the nature and structure of the spiritual world as revealed in the Writings of Emanuel Swedenborg, examining the relationship between the spiritual and natural worlds and how they are inseparably connected through correspondences. The book explains that the spiritual world is a world of active forces and uses, while the natural world is a world of passive forces and effects, with the human mind serving as the organic vessel that receives life from the Lord and bridges these two realms. Acton discusses the formation of the mind, the degrees of consciousness, the organic seat of spiritual life, and how the human form reflects the Divine order, emphasizing that the spirit is the real person who continues to live after death. The work provides a systematic analysis of spiritual phenomena, including the law of afflux, the nature of spiritual perception, and the reality of the spiritual world, offering readers a rational foundation for understanding the afterlife and the relationship between God and humanity.
