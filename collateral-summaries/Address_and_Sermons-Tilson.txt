This collection contains addresses and sermons by Bishop Robert James Tilson, a prominent figure in the New Church who served as pastor of Michael Church for 46 years and was ordained into the Third Degree of the Priesthood in 1928. The work emphasizes the fundamental principles of the Academy, including the unequivocal acknowledgment that the Theological Writings of Emanuel Swedenborg are the very Word of God to His New Church, and stresses the importance of maintaining the doctrine of the Divine Authority of the Writings. It discusses the priesthood as the first of the church, explaining that priests represent the Lord and should be the heads of churches, with proper order and subordination through consecration and the laying on of hands. The document also addresses New Church education, conjugial love, and evangelization as essential Academy fundamentals, emphasizing the need for the Church to maintain its distinctiveness from the old Christian world while working for the establishment of the Lord's true Church upon earth.
