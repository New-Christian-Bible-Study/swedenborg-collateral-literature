This comprehensive work by Bishop Nathaniel Dandridge Pendleton explores the doctrine of the Lord's glorification, presenting a detailed study of how the Divine Human was formed and perfected through the Lord's life on earth. The book examines the ancient truth contained in Scripture and how the Lord, as the Divine Isaac, reopened the wells of Abraham by revealing the spiritual meaning hidden in the letter of the Word. Pendleton traces the Lord's journey from birth through His various states of humiliation and glorification, showing how He progressively put off the human from the mother and made His Human Divine. The work emphasizes that the Lord's glorification was not only for Himself but for the salvation of the entire human race, establishing a new relationship between God and man that enables direct communication and spiritual regeneration."
