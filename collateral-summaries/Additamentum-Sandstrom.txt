This theological treatise examines the concept of the "Additamentum" - the Divine Natural which the Lord put on in the world, arguing that this Divine Natural is infinite and uncreate despite being "born" in time. The work explores the distinction between the Lord from eternity (who was present with men mediately through angels) and the Lord's incarnation (which made Him immediately present with men through His Divine Natural). It explains that the Lord's coming into the world involved no change in His Divine Substance, but rather a new mode of accommodation to reach men in their natural state, and that the purpose of His glorification was conjunction with the human race. The document emphasizes that the New Church alone worships one Visible God because the Lord in His Divine Natural is now visible to the natural mind of man, enabling full conjunction that embraces the whole man from inmosts to outmosts.
