This collection of doctrinal papers by Karl R. Alden presents foundational teachings of the New Church, addressing topics such as the nature of the New Jerusalem Church, the Trinity, the internal sense of the Word, and life after death. The lectures, originally delivered extemporaneously, explain key doctrines like the unity of God in the Lord Jesus Christ, the spiritual meaning of Scripture, and the importance of personal regeneration and freedom. Alden discusses practical applications of doctrine, including marriage, baptism, and the afterlife, aiming to make complex theological concepts accessible to a broad audience. The work emphasizes the openness of the New Church to all who seek truth, highlighting the many "gates" through which individuals can enter into spiritual understanding and community.
