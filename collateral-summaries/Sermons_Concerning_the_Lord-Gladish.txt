This collection by Willis Lindsay Gladish presents a series of sermons focused on the life, divinity, and redemptive work of the Lord Jesus Christ, as understood in the New Church tradition. The sermons trace the Lord's incarnation, ministry, miracles, and glorification, emphasizing the unity of the Divine and Human in Jesus and the fulfillment of Messianic prophecies. Gladish explores the spiritual significance of key events such as the Annunciation, Advent, and the Lord's temptations, highlighting the importance of the Writings of Swedenborg in revealing the internal sense of Scripture and the doctrine of the Divine Human. Throughout, the work encourages readers to recognize the Lord as the visible God, to seek conjunction with Him, and to understand the Second Coming as the opening of the spiritual sense of the Word.
