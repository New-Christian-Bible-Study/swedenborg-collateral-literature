This series of five lectures by Bishop Willard D. Pendleton explores the formative states of human development from infancy through youth, using the biblical narrative of Abram's journey as a framework to understand the progressive stages of mental and spiritual growth. The work emphasizes that man is not born a man but becomes one through a process of development, beginning with the first mental advertence and progressing through various states represented by different locations in Abram's journey. Pendleton explains that the human mind takes form through knowledges derived from the senses, and that the early affections of infancy (called remains) are the essential foundation from which all later development proceeds. The lectures provide a New Church perspective on education, stressing the importance of understanding these developmental stages for effective teaching and the cultivation of spiritual growth."
