This comprehensive series of addresses by Hugo Lj. Odhner presents the fundamental doctrines of the New Church, systematically covering the essential teachings about God as Creator, the Lord as Redeemer, and the nature of the universe and human life. The work begins with an examination of God's existence, essence, and power, emphasizing that God is Love and Wisdom itself, the infinite Creator who created the universe for the sake of human beings and their eternal happiness. Odhner explains the Lord's incarnation, humiliation, and glorification, showing how the Divine assumed human form to redeem mankind and restore spiritual order in the universe. The addresses provide a thorough foundation for understanding New Church theology, stressing the importance of acknowledging the Lord as the Divine Human and living according to the precepts of the Decalogue as the two essentials of the church."
