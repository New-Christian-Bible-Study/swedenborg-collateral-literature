This doctrinal study examines the status of Swedenborg's Writings in the New Church, tracing the historical debate over whether they should be regarded as the Word of the Lord for the New Church or as divinely inspired commentary. The author reviews arguments for and against calling the Writings "the Word," addressing issues such as their use of correspondences, their role in conjunction with heaven, and their holiness compared to the Old and New Testaments. The work concludes that the Writings are indeed a Divine Revelation and the Word for the New Church, but emphasizes that their acknowledgment as such must come from internal conviction and rational understanding, not from external compulsion or tradition. Throughout, the study highlights the unique nature of the Writings as a rational, unveiled revelation suited to a spiritual-rational church, and explores how their letter differs from previous revelations while still serving as the basis for doctrine and spiritual life.
