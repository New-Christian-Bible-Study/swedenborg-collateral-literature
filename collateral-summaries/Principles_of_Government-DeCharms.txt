This comprehensive work by George DeCharms examines the fundamental principles of government as revealed in the Writings of Emanuel Swedenborg, arguing that all legitimate authority derives from the Lord and that human government should protect individual freedom while serving spiritual ends. The book distinguishes between Divine government (which operates by influx and protects spiritual freedom) and human government (which must acknowledge its derivative nature and serve the common good), explaining how the Lord governs both heaven and hell through different means but with the same ultimate purpose. DeCharms analyzes various forms of government including patriarchal, monarchical, and representative systems, emphasizing that no single form is universally valid and that the best form depends on the spiritual development and needs of the people. The work concludes that democracy, when properly understood as a check on arbitrary power rather than rule by the people, can provide the greatest opportunity for political freedom, but only when combined with individual conscience and character.
