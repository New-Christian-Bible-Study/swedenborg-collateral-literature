This work by William L. Worcester explores the spiritual meaning of the biblical parable of the sower, using the Swedenborgian science of correspondences to interpret the symbolism of seeds, soil, and growth as they relate to the human mind and spiritual development. Worcester explains how the different types of ground in the parable represent various states of human receptivity to Divine truth, and how spiritual growth depends on the love and intention with which one receives and applies the Word. The book emphasizes the importance of self-examination, spiritual effort, and the transformation of knowledge into life, warning against superficial or merely intellectual engagement with spiritual teachings. Throughout, Worcester encourages readers to cultivate a fertile spiritual ground within themselves, so that the truths of the Word may take root, grow, and bear fruit in a life of charity and regeneration.
