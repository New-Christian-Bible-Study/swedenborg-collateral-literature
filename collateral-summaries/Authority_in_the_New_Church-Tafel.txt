This treatise explores the concept of authority in the New Church, arguing that true order and spiritual welfare depend on the acknowledgment of a fixed, divinely revealed authority rather than human or clerical power. The author asserts that the doctrines contained in the theological writings of Emanuel Swedenborg are of Divine authority, constituting the internal sense of Sacred Scripture and forming the law to which both clergy and laity must submit. The work contrasts this principle with the perverted authority found in other churches, emphasizing that the New Church's strength lies in its submission to Divine law rather than to individuals or councils. Throughout, the treatise defends the position that Swedenborg's writings are not merely human interpretations but are divinely inspired, forming the doctrinal foundation and ultimate authority for the New Church.
