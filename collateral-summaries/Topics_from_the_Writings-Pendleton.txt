This comprehensive collection by Bishop W. F. Pendleton presents thirty-six short articles on various topics from the Writings of Emanuel Swedenborg, originally published in New Church Life magazine between 1921 and 1926. The work covers a wide range of subjects including the nature of temptation, the meaning of loving the Lord and neighbor, the importance of use and work, the spiritual world, and many other doctrinal topics that particularly interested the author during his years of study. Pendleton emphasizes practical applications of New Church teachings, explaining concepts such as the need for memorabilia in revelation, the nature of true charity, the importance of avoiding idleness, and the distinction between natural and spiritual understanding. Throughout, the work serves as both a doctrinal reference and a practical guide for living according to New Church principles, with each topic presented in a clear, accessible manner suitable for both study and devotional reading.
