This work by Rev. Dr. Jonathan Bayley presents twelve discourses addressing the controversial "Essays and Reviews" published by seven Oxford clergymen in 1860, which challenged traditional Christian interpretations of Scripture and raised questions about the compatibility of science and religion. Bayley defends the Divine authority of Scripture while arguing that the difficulties arise from interpreting the Bible literally rather than spiritually, particularly in the case of Genesis which he contends describes spiritual creation and regeneration rather than physical cosmology. The discourses cover topics including miracles, the atonement, spiritualism, the inner sense of Scripture, and the nature of the New Church, emphasizing that the Word of God contains both a natural letter for the natural man and a spiritual sense for the spiritual man. Throughout, Bayley demonstrates how the Writings of Swedenborg provide the key to understanding Scripture's true meaning, showing that apparent contradictions with science disappear when the spiritual sense is recognized as the primary purpose of Divine revelation.
