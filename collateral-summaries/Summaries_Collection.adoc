A collection of summaries from the theological writings of the New Church, organized by category.

== DOCTRINAL FOUNDATIONS

=== The_Importance_of_the_Collateral_Work_of_The_New_Church
This document explores the spiritual marriage between natural good and spiritual truth, emphasizing that the doctrine of the spiritual church is formed from acknowledged truths rather than direct perception of Divine truth. It explains that doctrinal things from the Word are not automatically Divine truths, as false doctrines can be derived from the letter, but true doctrine comes from the internal sense discerned by those enlightened by the Lord. The document stresses that the intellectual cannot be enlightened unless love to the Lord and charity toward the neighbor are acknowledged as the principal things of the church, and that those who proceed from this acknowledgment can see innumerable truths and secrets disclosed to them from interior acknowledgment according to the Lord's Divine Providence.

=== As_from_Self_and_the_Two_Essentials_of_the_Church-Sandstrom
This theological work examines the concept of "as from self" in relation to the Lord's operation with man, explaining that while man feels life as if it were his own, both his love and all life forms from it exist solely from the Lord by touch. The document explores the distinction between the Lord's own with man (which can be Divine truths or created things) and the as-from-self principle, emphasizing that true freedom comes from acting according to conscience formed from the Word. It discusses the "image and likeness" of God in man, where likeness refers to man's ability to receive and reproduce what proceeds from the Lord, while image refers to acting and thinking in spiritual things as of oneself. The work concludes that the as-from-self principle is essential for human freedom and spiritual development, and that the two essentials of the church are love to the Lord and charity toward the neighbor.

=== Additamentum-Sandstrom
This theological treatise examines the concept of the "Additamentum" - the Divine Natural which the Lord put on in the world, arguing that this Divine Natural is infinite and uncreate despite being "born" in time. The work explores the distinction between the Lord from eternity (who was present with men mediately through angels) and the Lord's incarnation (which made Him immediately present with men through His Divine Natural). It explains that the Lord's coming into the world involved no change in His Divine Substance, but rather a new mode of accommodation to reach men in their natural state, and that the purpose of His glorification was conjunction with the human race. The document emphasizes that the New Church alone worships one Visible God because the Lord in His Divine Natural is now visible to men, making Him accessible for worship and conjunction.

=== Authority_in_the_New_Church-Tafel
This treatise explores the concept of authority in the New Church, arguing that true order and spiritual welfare depend on the acknowledgment of a fixed, divinely revealed authority rather than human or clerical power. The author asserts that the doctrines contained in the theological writings of Emanuel Swedenborg are of Divine authority, constituting the internal sense of Sacred Scripture and forming the law to which both clergy and laity must submit. The work contrasts this principle with the perverted authority found in other churches, emphasizing that the New Church's strength lies in its submission to Divine law rather than to individuals or councils. Throughout, the treatise defends the position that Swedenborg's writings are not merely human interpretations but are divinely inspired revelations that provide the foundation for true spiritual authority.

=== Crown_of_Revelations-Acton
This doctrinal study examines the status of Swedenborg's Writings in the New Church, tracing the historical debate over whether they should be regarded as the Word of the Lord for the New Church or as divinely inspired commentary. The author reviews arguments for and against calling the Writings "the Word," addressing issues such as their use of correspondences, their role in conjunction with heaven, and their holiness compared to the Old and New Testaments. The work concludes that the Writings are indeed a Divine Revelation and the Word for the New Church, but emphasizes that their acknowledgment as such must come from internal conviction and rational understanding, not from external compulsion or tradition. Throughout, the study highlights the unique nature of the Writings as a rational, universal theology that provides the foundation for the New Church.

=== Visible_God-Sandstrom
This work by Erik Sandstrom provides an introduction to the doctrine of the Lord Jesus Christ as the one visible God of heaven and earth, focusing on the teachings found in the first three chapters of Swedenborg's "True Christian Religion." The book explains that the Lord is a Trine consisting of the Infinite Divine Itself (Father), the Divine Human (Son), and the creative power that goes forth (Holy Spirit), and that through His two advents into the world He has made Himself visible in all aspects of this Trine. Sandstrom emphasizes that the Lord's glorification and redemption were the same act, accomplished visibly before men to restore human freedom and provide choice between the way of the Prince of Peace and the Prince of the world, and that the Holy Spirit is the Lord's operation through the Word, continuing His presence with men after His resurrection. Throughout, the work stresses that the New Church is distinguished by its worship of one visible God in whom is the invisible God, as the soul is in the body, making it the crown of all churches.

== SCRIPTURAL INTERPRETATION

=== Divine_Allegory-Odhner
This work explores the spiritual significance of the peoples and lands described in the Bible, presenting them as part of a Divine allegory whose deeper meaning is revealed through the science of correspondences as taught by Emanuel Swedenborg. The author argues that the literal history and geography of Scripture serve as a symbolic framework for spiritual teachings about the regeneration of the human soul and the relationship between God and humanity. The book emphasizes the importance of understanding the natural context of biblical stories to access their internal sense, and discusses how ancient perspectives, traditions, and even archaeological discoveries can illuminate the spiritual message within the Word. Throughout, the work encourages readers to study both the letter and the spiritual sense of Scripture, showing how the Divine allegory reveals the Lord's presence and guidance throughout human history.

=== Divine_Word_Opened-Bayley
This volume is a collection of sermons by Rev. Jonathan Bayley, aiming to illustrate the spiritual laws and deeper meanings within the Divine Word as revealed in Scripture. The sermons explore key biblical narratives, such as creation, the flood, and the parables, interpreting them through the lens of New Church doctrine and the science of correspondences. Bayley emphasizes the harmony between scientific discoveries and spiritual truths, encouraging readers to seek the internal sense of the Word for personal regeneration and a deeper relationship with the Lord. The work also highlights the importance of education, charity, and practical application of doctrine in daily life, reflecting Bayley's lifelong commitment to ministry and public service.

=== Language_of_Parable-Worcester
This book by William L. Worcester introduces the Swedenborgian concept of correspondences, explaining how the symbolic language of parable unlocks the inner, spiritual meaning of the Bible. Using clear, nontechnical language and practical examples, Worcester shows how natural objects, phenomena, and stories in Scripture correspond to spiritual realities, making the Bible a living guide for personal regeneration and spiritual growth. The work emphasizes that understanding correspondences is essential for grasping the true message of the Word, and provides numerous illustrations from both daily life and biblical passages. Throughout, the book encourages readers to move beyond literal interpretation and discover the deeper wisdom and relevance of Scripture for their own lives.

=== Book_of_Daniel-Hinkley
This work provides a comprehensive interpretation of the Book of Daniel according to the spiritual sense revealed in the Writings of the New Church, treating the book as both historical and prophetic with its primary purpose being to reveal spiritual truths rather than record natural events. The author explains that Daniel represents the Lord as the Divine Prophet, especially in His role as revealer of Divine truths that liberate human souls from the bondage of evil, and that the book's three main subjects are the consummation of the church, the coming of the Lord, and the establishment of the New Church. The work emphasizes that Babylon symbolizes the love of dominion springing from self-love, and that the captivity of the Jews represents the church's fall under this evil influence, while Daniel's visions reveal the Lord's power to overcome these evils and establish His kingdom. Throughout, the interpretation shows how the spiritual sense of Daniel's prophecies provides guidance for understanding the Lord's work in the world and the process of spiritual regeneration.

=== Parables_of_the_Old_Testament_Explained-Mitchell
This comprehensive work by Edward Craig Mitchell provides detailed explanations of Old Testament parables, fables, and visions using the science of correspondences as revealed by Emanuel Swedenborg, treating each narrative as having three levels of meaning: literal, figurative, and spiritual. The book examines stories such as the trees choosing a king, Samson's riddle, and many other biblical narratives, showing how they illustrate spiritual principles operating in the human mind and the process of regeneration. Mitchell demonstrates how these ancient stories contain profound spiritual truths about the relationship between God and humanity, the nature of evil and temptation, and the path to spiritual growth and salvation. The work serves as both a devotional resource and a doctrinal study, helping readers understand the deeper meaning of Scripture and apply its teachings to their spiritual development.

=== Scripture_Paradoxes_-_Their_True_Explanation-Bayley
This work by Rev. Dr. Jonathan Bayley addresses apparent contradictions in Scripture by examining twelve paradoxes that seem to present conflicting teachings, such as the earth both perishing and enduring forever, God's apparent anger versus His real love, and the predestination of all men to heaven versus individual responsibility. Bayley explains that these paradoxes are resolved when Scripture is interpreted spiritually rather than literally, showing how the language of the Bible uses natural objects and events as symbols for spiritual realities and states of the church. The book demonstrates that apparent contradictions in the Word serve to encourage deeper study and spiritual growth, leading readers to discover the internal sense that reveals the true harmony of Divine truth. Throughout, Bayley emphasizes that the spiritual interpretation of Scripture provides the key to understanding God's true nature and His relationship with humanity.

=== Sower-Worcester
This work by William L. Worcester explores the spiritual meaning of the biblical parable of the sower, using the Swedenborgian science of correspondences to interpret the symbolism of seeds, soil, and growth as they relate to the human mind and spiritual development. Worcester explains how the different types of ground in the parable represent various states of human receptivity to Divine truth, and how spiritual growth depends on the love and intention with which one receives and applies the Word. The book emphasizes the importance of self-examination, spiritual effort, and the transformation of knowledge into life, warning against superficial or merely intellectual engagement with spiritual teachings. Throughout, Worcester encourages readers to cultivate the soil of their minds through repentance and spiritual practice, so that the seeds of Divine truth may take root and bear fruit in their lives.

== SPIRITUAL DEVELOPMENT AND REGENERATION

=== Application_of_Doctrine-DeCharms
This work examines the fundamental principle that "All religion is of life, and the life of religion is to do what is good," emphasizing that the New Church teachings are not merely for intellectual understanding but must be practically applied to transform human character and behavior. The author contrasts the New Church understanding of religion with traditional Christian views, arguing that while many religions claim to teach the law of God, the Writings provide a radically new concept of God, Jesus Christ, heaven, and the truly religious life that completely revolutionizes our understanding of what the Bible teaches. The work stresses that the application of doctrine involves more than adopting new rituals, church organization, or social customs, but requires a deeper transformation of the heart and mind through the practice of charity and the shunning of evils as sins. Throughout, DeCharms emphasizes that true religion is a way of life that affects every aspect of human existence, from personal relationships to social responsibilities.

=== Doctrine_of_Reflection-DeCharms
This series of lectures by George de Charms explores the doctrine of reflection as revealed in the Writings of Emanuel Swedenborg, emphasizing its foundational role in consciousness, spiritual growth, and human freedom. The work explains that reflection is the process by which we become aware of sensations, thoughts, and spiritual realities, and that it underlies all mental activity, distinguishing humans from animals. De Charms discusses how reflection enables moral and spiritual choice, shapes our experience of both the natural and spiritual worlds, and is essential for regeneration and the establishment of the Lord's kingdom on earth. The lectures highlight the unique contribution of the New Church in revealing the laws of reflection, offering practical insights for personal development and spiritual understanding.

=== Repentance-Pendleton
This series of six doctrinal classes by Bishop Nathaniel Dandridge Pendleton explores the concept of repentance from a New Church perspective, emphasizing its necessity as the foundation for spiritual reformation and regeneration. Pendleton explains that true repentance involves a conscious turning away from self-love and evil, motivated by faith in the Lord and a desire to "sin no more," and that this process is only possible through the freedom and rationality granted by God. The lectures discuss the structure of the human mind, the interplay between inherited tendencies and spiritual development, and the role of Divine Providence in preparing individuals for repentance throughout their lives. The work encourages readers to engage in continual self-examination and spiritual struggle, highlighting the importance of acknowledging one's evils and turning to the Lord for strength and guidance in the process of regeneration.

=== Formative_States_of_the_Human-Pendleton
This series of five lectures by Bishop Willard D. Pendleton explores the formative states of human development from infancy through youth, using the biblical narrative of Abram's journey as a framework to understand the progressive stages of mental and spiritual growth. The work emphasizes that man is not born a man but becomes one through a process of development, beginning with the first mental advertence and progressing through various states represented by different locations in Abram's journey. Pendleton explains that the human mind takes form through knowledges derived from the senses, and that the early affections of infancy (called remains) are the essential foundation from which all later development proceeds. The lectures provide a New Church perspective on education, stressing the importance of nurturing the spiritual potential within each child and guiding their development according to Divine order.

=== Faith_and_Falsity-Odhner
This comprehensive series of doctrinal classes by Hugo Lj. Odhner examines the nature of true faith versus falsity, arguing that there can be only one true faith - faith in the Lord Jesus Christ as the Divine Human - and that all other religions contain falsities that lead away from salvation. The work explores the origins of falsity, explaining how it arises from both man's evil loves and fallacies of the senses, and discusses why there are many religions despite the existence of only one true faith. Odhner emphasizes that while all men can be saved regardless of their religion if they live according to their conscience, true salvation requires acknowledgment of the Lord as the Divine Human, which is implicit in all genuine good. The classes provide a thorough analysis of how falsities develop, spread, and can be overcome through the acknowledgment of truth and the practice of charity.

== WORSHIP AND CHURCH LIFE

=== Address_and_Sermons-Tilson
This collection contains addresses and sermons by Bishop Robert James Tilson, a prominent figure in the New Church who served as pastor of Michael Church for 46 years and was ordained into the Third Degree of the Priesthood in 1928. The work emphasizes the fundamental principles of the Academy, including the unequivocal acknowledgment that the Theological Writings of Emanuel Swedenborg are the very Word of God to His New Church, and stresses the importance of maintaining the doctrine of the Divine Authority of the Writings. It discusses the priesthood as the first of the church, explaining that priests represent the Lord and should be the heads of churches, with proper order and subordination through consecration and the laying on of hands. The document also addresses New Church education, contrasting it with secular education and emphasizing the importance of teaching children to acknowledge the Lord and live according to His commandments.

=== Chapel_Talks_on_Vital_Subjects-Odhner
This collection contains fifty-one brief chapel talks originally given to students at the Academy of the New Church, covering vital religious subjects in a clear and accessible manner suitable for family worship and Sunday services. The work begins with a comprehensive series on prayer, explaining that prayer is "talk with God together with some internal view of the subject," emphasizing that while prayers cannot change God's will, they serve to change us by preparing us to receive what the Lord wants to give us. The talks also address worship, ritual, and other fundamental religious concepts, stressing that external forms must have internal meaning to be truly effective, and that preparation for worship involves daily life practices of looking to the Lord, shunning evils, and serving the neighbor. Throughout, the work provides practical guidance for spiritual living, encouraging readers to integrate religious principles into their daily lives and relationships.

=== Externals_of_the_New_Church-Odhner
This series of doctrinal classes by Hugo Lj. Odhner explores the relationship between the internal and external aspects of the New Church, emphasizing that true religion requires both inward charity and faith as well as outward forms, rituals, and organization. The work discusses the necessity of external uses, worship, and priesthood, showing how externals serve as vessels for spiritual life and protect the church from degeneration. Odhner addresses the dangers of focusing solely on externals without internal purpose, and the importance of correspondence between inner and outer life for genuine regeneration. The book provides practical and doctrinal guidance for building a church community that harmonizes spiritual intent with visible forms and uses.

=== Essays_on_the_Lords_Prayer-Odhner
This volume by Hugo Lj. Odhner offers a series of essays on the Lord's Prayer, exploring its spiritual depth and significance as revealed in the Writings of Emanuel Swedenborg. Each section of the prayer is examined for its doctrinal and practical meaning, emphasizing prayer as a means of communication with the Lord and a guide for spiritual life and regeneration. Odhner highlights the importance of approaching the Lord as the Divine Human, the role of humility and charity in true prayer, and the transformative power of aligning one's will with Divine order. The work serves as both a devotional resource and a doctrinal study, encouraging readers to deepen their understanding and practice of prayer.

=== Essays_on_the_Ten_Commandments-Odhner
This book by Hugo Lj. Odhner presents a series of essays on the Ten Commandments, examining their natural and spiritual meanings as revealed in the Writings of Emanuel Swedenborg. Each commandment is explored in depth, showing how the Decalogue serves as a summary of all things of religion and provides a foundation for both external conduct and internal spiritual life. Odhner discusses the importance of worshiping the Lord alone, the dangers of idolatry and blasphemy, and the transformative power of living according to Divine law. The work is intended as both a devotional and doctrinal resource, encouraging readers to apply the commandments to their own process of regeneration and relationship with the Lord.

=== Ten_Commandments-Cranch
This comprehensive work by Rev. Harold C. Cranch provides detailed explanations of the Ten Commandments from a New Church perspective, examining both their literal and spiritual meanings as revealed in the Writings of Emanuel Swedenborg. The book emphasizes that the commandments are not merely civil laws but spiritual principles that form the foundation for regeneration, explaining how each commandment addresses both external actions and internal states of mind and heart. Cranch demonstrates that the first commandment about having no other gods is the most fundamental, as it establishes the basis for all other spiritual laws, and that idolatry includes worshiping external things without internal meaning, such as self-love and worldly desires. Throughout, the work stresses that true obedience to the commandments involves acknowledging their Divine origin, shunning evils as sins against God, and allowing the Lord to transform our lives through the truth of His Word.

== SERMONS AND PREACHING

This collection by Rev. W. Bruce presents a series of expository and practical sermons that explore key Christian doctrines and spiritual principles through the lens of New Church theology. The sermons emphasize the importance of following the Lord Jesus Christ as the perfect example of love, humility, and service, and discuss the process of regeneration as a journey from innocence through spiritual struggle to ultimate peace. Bruce addresses topics such as the harmony of Divine attributes, the role of practice in establishing spiritual principles, and the transformation of human nature through the Lord's glorification. Throughout, the work encourages readers to apply spiritual truths in daily life, cultivate humility and charity, and strive for personal and collective regeneration.

=== Sermons_Concerning_the_Lord-Gladish
This collection by Willis Lindsay Gladish presents a series of sermons focused on the life, divinity, and redemptive work of the Lord Jesus Christ, as understood in the New Church tradition. The sermons trace the Lord's incarnation, ministry, miracles, and glorification, emphasizing the unity of the Divine and Human in Jesus and the fulfillment of Messianic prophecies. Gladish explores the spiritual significance of key events such as the Annunciation, Advent, and the Lord's temptations, highlighting the importance of the Writings of Swedenborg in revealing the internal sense of Scripture and the doctrine of the Divine Human. Throughout, the work encourages readers to recognize the Lord as the visible God, to seek conjunction with Him, and to understand the Second Coming as the opening of the internal sense of the Word.

=== Sermons_Illustrating_the_Doctrine_of_the_Lord-DeCharms
This collection by Richard De Charms presents a series of sermons designed to illustrate and explain the fundamental doctrines of the New Church, particularly focusing on the doctrine of the Lord and the unity of the Divine Trinity in Jesus Christ. The sermons systematically address the nature of the Trinity, arguing that God is one person consisting of three essential principles (Father, Son, and Holy Spirit) rather than three separate persons, and emphasize that Jesus Christ is the visible God who should be the direct object of Christian worship. De Charms contrasts New Church teachings with traditional Christian views, using rational arguments and scriptural evidence to demonstrate that the Lord's incarnation, glorification, and Divine Human nature are central to salvation. Throughout, the work emphasizes the practical application of these doctrines in daily life and spiritual growth.

=== Sermons_on_the_Ten_Commandments_Volume_1-Acton
This volume by Alfred Acton presents a series of sermons on the Ten Commandments, written specifically for New Church soldiers during the Great War (1914-1918), focusing on the spiritual interpretation and practical application of the Decalogue in daily life. The sermons begin with an examination of the two great commandments - love to the Lord and love to the neighbor - and then systematically explore each of the Ten Commandments, emphasizing their role in regeneration and spiritual growth. Acton explains that the commandments are not merely civil laws but Divine truths that create and form the human mind when received as the Word of God, and that true obedience involves acknowledging the Lord Jesus Christ as the one God who delivers us from spiritual bondage. Throughout, the work provides practical guidance for applying the commandments in wartime conditions and daily life.

=== Sermons_on_the_Ten_Commandments_Volume_2-Acton
This second volume by Alfred Acton continues the series of sermons on the Ten Commandments, written for New Church soldiers during the Great War, focusing on the deeper spiritual applications of the commandments beyond their literal meaning. The sermons examine the fourth commandment (honoring father and mother) as an intermediate commandment that unites love to God with love to the neighbor, explaining that it encompasses honoring natural parents, teachers, country, and the Church as spiritual parents who provide for our natural and spiritual needs. Acton explores the fifth commandment (thou shalt not kill) in detail, emphasizing that it primarily addresses the spirit of hatred and anger rather than the literal taking of life, and discusses how self-love can be either a servant or a master depending on how it is directed. The work continues to provide practical guidance for spiritual living in challenging circumstances.

=== Sermons_on_the_Word-Hyatt
This collection by Edward S. Hyatt presents two series of sermons on the Word, focusing on the internal sense of Scripture as revealed in the Writings of Emanuel Swedenborg. Hyatt emphasizes that the literal sense of the Word is not the true Light, but testifies concerning the Light, and that genuine doctrine and spiritual life arise from understanding the internal, spiritual meaning. The sermons explore the necessity of Divine Revelation being accommodated to human grasp, the role of correspondences, and the importance of both internal and external forms in worship and church life. Throughout, Hyatt encourages readers to move beyond external rituals and literal interpretations, seeking the Lord's presence and guidance in the internal sense of the Word for true regeneration and conjunction with heaven.

=== Ten_Blessings-Gladish
This work by Rev. Michael Gladish presents a two-part sermon series on the Ten Blessings (Beatitudes) from Matthew 5, exploring the deeper spiritual meaning behind these seemingly paradoxical teachings that appear to bless poverty, mourning, and persecution. Gladish explains that these blessings are not about delayed gratification or future rewards, but describe present spiritual states where acknowledging our needs, limitations, and struggles actually opens us to receive the Lord's help and experience true happiness. The sermons examine how being "poor in spirit" means recognizing our need to learn, "mourning" involves acknowledging our evils and receiving Divine comfort, and "meekness" represents gentleness and kindness in fighting against our own evils rather than weakness. Throughout, Gladish emphasizes that these blessings describe the path to spiritual growth and the qualities that lead to true happiness and peace.

=== Ten_Blessings-Pendleton
This comprehensive series of twelve sermons by Bishop W. F. Pendleton provides an in-depth exploration of the Ten Blessings (Beatitudes) from Matthew 5, examining each blessing through the lens of New Church doctrine and the spiritual sense of Scripture. Pendleton explains that these blessings represent progressive stages in the establishment of the church and the regeneration of the individual, beginning with the reception of Divine doctrine by those who are "poor in spirit" and continuing through various states of spiritual development. The sermons emphasize that the kingdom of heaven is present with those who acknowledge their need for Divine truth, that mourning over spiritual evils leads to comfort, and that meekness involves submission to Divine Providence rather than mere natural gentleness. Throughout, Pendleton stresses that these blessings describe present spiritual states rather than future rewards, and that the Lord's presence and help are most active when we maintain humility of understanding and will, acknowledging that all truth and good come from the Lord alone.

== SPIRITUAL WORLD AND AFTERLIFE

=== Nature_of_the_Spiritual_World-Acton
This comprehensive theological work by Alfred Acton explores the nature and structure of the spiritual world as revealed in the Writings of Emanuel Swedenborg, examining the relationship between the spiritual and natural worlds and how they are inseparably connected through correspondences. The book explains that the spiritual world is a world of active forces and uses, while the natural world is a world of passive forces and effects, with the human mind serving as the organic vessel that receives life from the Lord and bridges these two realms. Acton discusses the formation of the mind, the degrees of consciousness, the organic seat of spiritual life, and how the human form reflects the Divine order, emphasizing that the spirit is the real person who continues to live after death. The work provides a systematic understanding of the spiritual world, showing how it operates according to Divine laws and how human beings are prepared for their eternal life through their experiences in the natural world.

=== Spiritual_World-Odhner
This comprehensive work by Hugo Lj. Odhner presents a detailed exploration of the spiritual world as revealed in the Writings of Emanuel Swedenborg, covering topics from the transition from earthly life to the afterlife, the structure and nature of heaven and hell, and the events of the Last Judgment. The book examines the historical development of beliefs about the afterlife across different religions and cultures, contrasting these with the rational and systematic revelation provided by Swedenborg's spiritual experiences and teachings. Odhner emphasizes that the spiritual world is a real, organized realm with its own laws and structure, where angels and spirits live in societies and perform specific uses, and where the human spirit continues to develop and grow after death. The work serves as both an introduction to the spiritual world for newcomers and a comprehensive reference for those already familiar with the Writings, providing practical insights for understanding the relationship between this world and the next.

=== Effects_of_the_Last_Judgment-Odhner
This series of doctrinal classes by Hugo Odhner examines the spiritual and ecclesiastical consequences of the Last Judgment as revealed in the Writings of Emanuel Swedenborg. The work explains that the Last Judgment has already occurred in the spiritual world, resulting in the formation of a new heaven and the establishment of the New Church, restoring the connection between heaven and humanity. Odhner discusses the historical sequence of churches, the decline and renewal of spiritual communities, and the unique role of the New Church in receiving new revelation and doctrine. The classes emphasize the importance of understanding these spiritual events for the identity, mission, and responsibilities of New Church members.

== CREATION AND DIVINE PROVIDENCE

=== Creation-Odhner
This doctrinal essay explores the New Church understanding of creation, emphasizing that God created the universe out of His own substance, which is Love itself, and that all things in the natural world are effects produced by spiritual causes. The work distinguishes between the literal and spiritual meanings of the Genesis creation story, explaining that the six days of creation symbolize the stages of human regeneration as well as the establishment of the Most Ancient Church. It discusses the philosophical and theological challenges of conceiving how the Infinite could produce the finite, ultimately concluding that creation involves a discrete step from the Divine to the created, mediated by the spiritual world and the spiritual Sun. Throughout, the author stresses that true wisdom comes from understanding the spiritual causes behind natural phenomena and recognizing the Lord's presence in all aspects of creation.

=== Allegories_of_Genesis-King
This work presents an allegorical interpretation of the Genesis creation story as a symbolic representation of the process of human regeneration, where each day of creation corresponds to a stage in the spiritual development of the human mind. The author explains that "heaven and earth" symbolize the spiritual and natural minds respectively, and the six days of creation represent the progressive formation of distinct planes of life within these minds, from the awakening of remains (spiritual deposits from childhood) to the development of rational perception and the establishment of love and faith. The work emphasizes that regeneration is a spiritual creation where the old carnal life is displaced by new life centered on loving the Lord and neighbor, and that this process involves the gradual transformation of the entire human personality through the reception of Divine truth and good. Throughout, the book provides practical guidance for understanding one's own spiritual development and the stages of regeneration.

=== Notes_on_the_Divine_Providence-Dibb
This series of thirteen lectures by Andy Dibb provides a comprehensive study of the book "Divine Providence" by Emanuel Swedenborg, presenting it as the Lord's constitution for governing the human race and explaining how Divine Love and Wisdom operate together to guide all things toward human salvation. The lectures examine the fundamental principles of Divine Providence, including the inseparable unity of Divine Love and Wisdom, the creation of the spiritual sun as the first proceeding of the Divine, and how all created forms are recipients of the Divine through contiguity rather than continuity. Dibb explains that Divine Providence works through human freedom, allowing people to choose their own path while constantly striving to lead them toward heaven, and that the Lord's government is characterized by patience, wisdom, and an infinite respect for human freedom. The work emphasizes that understanding Divine Providence helps us trust in the Lord's guidance and cooperate with His purposes in our lives.

== HISTORICAL AND PROPHETIC INTERPRETATION

=== Saul_David_Solomon-Odhner
This work by Hugo Lj. Odhner presents a spiritual interpretation of the biblical story of the three kings of United Israel - Saul, David, and Solomon - as a parable illustrating the progressive states of spiritual development and the Lord's glorification. The book explains how Saul represents the Divine truth in the literal sense of the Word, David represents spiritual Divine truth that comes from the Lord's second advent, and Solomon represents the wisdom that results from the conjunction of truth and good. Odhner demonstrates how these three kings symbolize the stages of spiritual growth from obedience to tradition (Samuel), through the authority of literal truth (Saul), to the power of spiritual truth (David), and finally to the wisdom of charity (Solomon). The work emphasizes that this progression represents not only the development of the individual soul but also the evolution of the church and the Lord's work in the world, showing how spiritual understanding deepens and matures over time.

=== Magnificent_Scenes-Bayley
This volume by Rev. Dr. Bayley presents a series of sermons interpreting the Book of Revelation through the lens of New Church doctrine, focusing on the symbolic and spiritual meanings behind its vivid imagery. Bayley explains that the magnificent scenes described by John are not literal prophecies but spiritual representations of the states of the church, the workings of Divine Providence, and the nearness of the spiritual world to our own. The sermons emphasize the Lord's glorified humanity as the center of all spiritual blessings, the role of the church as a bearer of divine light, and the ultimate victory of good over evil. Throughout, Bayley encourages readers to look beyond surface interpretations and find personal and collective spiritual lessons in the apocalyptic visions of Revelation.

== FUNDAMENTAL DOCTRINES

=== Fundamentals_of_the_New_Church-Odhner
This comprehensive series of addresses by Hugo Lj. Odhner presents the fundamental doctrines of the New Church, systematically covering the essential teachings about God as Creator, the Lord as Redeemer, and the nature of the universe and human life. The work begins with an examination of God's existence, essence, and power, emphasizing that God is Love and Wisdom itself, the infinite Creator who created the universe for the sake of human beings and their eternal happiness. Odhner explains the Lord's incarnation, humiliation, and glorification, showing how the Divine assumed human form to redeem mankind and restore spiritual order in the universe. The addresses provide a thorough foundation for understanding New Church theology, stressing the importance of acknowledging the Lord as the one God of heaven and earth and living according to His commandments.

=== Glorification-Pendleton
This comprehensive work by Bishop Nathaniel Dandridge Pendleton explores the doctrine of the Lord's glorification, presenting a detailed study of how the Divine Human was formed and perfected through the Lord's life on earth. The book examines the ancient truth contained in Scripture and how the Lord, as the Divine Isaac, reopened the wells of Abraham by revealing the spiritual meaning hidden in the letter of the Word. Pendleton traces the Lord's journey from birth through His various states of humiliation and glorification, showing how He progressively put off the human from the mother and made His Human Divine. The work emphasizes that the Lord's glorification was not only for Himself but for the salvation of the entire human race, establishing a new relationship between God and man that enables true conjunction and spiritual life.

=== Grand_Man-Odhner
This series of doctrinal lectures by Hugo Lj. Odhner explores the concept of the Grand Man (Maximus Homo) - the universal heaven organized in the human form as a representation of the Divine Human. The work explains that heaven is structured as a Grand Man with distinct provinces corresponding to the organs and parts of the human body, where angels perform specific uses that contribute to the overall spiritual organism. Odhner examines both the Divine aspect of the Grand Man (as the infinite complex of uses proceeding from the Lord) and the finite aspect (as constituted by angels who cooperate with Divine purposes), showing how the spiritual world reflects the human form in its organization and functions. The lectures emphasize that the Grand Man concept reveals the unity of creation, where all things correspond to the human form and serve the purpose of human salvation and conjunction with the Lord.

=== Survey_of_the_Arcana-Odhner
This comprehensive work by Hugo Lj. Odhner provides a detailed survey of Swedenborg's "Arcana Coelestia," the most extensive theological work that reveals the internal or spiritual sense of the books of Genesis and Exodus. The book traces the spiritual meaning behind the biblical narrative, showing how the stories of creation, the Garden of Eden, the flood, and the patriarchs represent the progressive states of human regeneration and the Lord's glorification process. Odhner explains that the Arcana reveals how the literal sense of Scripture contains profound heavenly secrets about the Lord, heaven, the church, and religion that can only be understood through the internal sense revealed by Swedenborg. The work serves as both an introduction for those new to the Arcana and a helpful overview for those already familiar with it, providing a systematic guide to understanding the spiritual meaning of the Old Testament.

== SOCIAL AND ETHICAL TEACHINGS

=== Principles_of_Government-DeCharms
This comprehensive work by George DeCharms examines the fundamental principles of government as revealed in the Writings of Emanuel Swedenborg, arguing that all legitimate authority derives from the Lord and that human government should protect individual freedom while serving spiritual ends. The book distinguishes between Divine government (which operates by influx and protects spiritual freedom) and human government (which must acknowledge its derivative nature and serve the common good), explaining how the Lord governs both heaven and hell through different means but with the same ultimate purpose. DeCharms analyzes various forms of government including patriarchal, monarchical, and representative systems, emphasizing that no single form is universally valid and that the best form depends on the spiritual state of the people and their capacity for self-government. Throughout, the work stresses that the purpose of all government is to protect human freedom and enable individuals to pursue their spiritual development according to Divine order.

=== Selected_Papers_and_Addresses-Buss
This collection by Rt. Rev. Peter M. Buss contains selected sermons and addresses focusing primarily on marriage and conjugial love, presenting the New Church understanding of true married love as a spiritual journey guided by Divine truth and characterized by innocence, peace, tranquility, and inmost friendship. The work emphasizes that conjugial love is not merely emotional but requires walking in the Lord's paths through learning and applying His truth, and that while the initial passion of marriage may fade, true love develops through friendship, mutual trust, and the practice of charity. Buss explains that marriage serves as a vessel for spiritual growth, where two people can work together to overcome selfishness and develop the qualities necessary for heaven, with friendship acting as the foundation for deeper spiritual union. Throughout, the work provides practical guidance for building and maintaining healthy, spiritually-oriented relationships.

== CONTEMPORARY APPLICATIONS

=== New_Church_and_Modern_Christianity-DeCharms
This work by George DeCharms examines the relationship between the New Church and modern Christianity, analyzing how the religious landscape has evolved since Swedenborg's time and how the Writings' teachings about the state of the Christian world remain relevant today. The book argues that while many traditional Christian doctrines have been reinterpreted or abandoned by modern liberal thinkers, the fundamental differences between New Church theology and mainstream Christianity persist, particularly regarding the Divinity of Jesus Christ and the nature of God. DeCharms demonstrates that modern Christianity has increasingly moved toward Arian and Socinian views that deny the Lord's true Divinity, treating Him as merely a human teacher or moral exemplar rather than as God incarnate. Throughout, the work emphasizes the unique contribution of the New Church in providing a rational, coherent theology that addresses the spiritual needs of modern humanity while maintaining the essential truths of Christianity.

=== Reflections_on_Some_Popular_Fallacies-Odhner
This series of doctrinal lectures by Hugo Lj. Odhner examines popular fallacies that pervade modern thought, particularly those that have emerged from the consummated Christian Church and continue to influence contemporary society despite the apparent rejection of traditional religious dogmas. The work identifies three main sources of falsities: false church doctrines, fallacies of the senses, and evils of life, arguing that the Christian world's decline was caused not by innocent mistakes but by the increasing prevalence of evil loves that engendered destructive falsities. Odhner demonstrates how modern thinking has not truly rejected the old falsities but has merely stripped them of their religious garb and clothed them with secular authority, creating new forms of the same destructive principles. Throughout, the lectures provide tools for recognizing and overcoming these fallacies, emphasizing the importance of grounding one's thinking in Divine truth and the practice of charity.

=== Twelve_Discourses-Bayley
This work by Rev. Dr. Jonathan Bayley presents twelve discourses addressing the controversial "Essays and Reviews" published by seven Oxford clergymen in 1860, which challenged traditional Christian interpretations of Scripture and raised questions about the compatibility of science and religion. Bayley defends the Divine authority of Scripture while arguing that the difficulties arise from interpreting the Bible literally rather than spiritually, particularly in the case of Genesis which he contends describes spiritual creation and regeneration rather than physical cosmology. The discourses cover topics including miracles, the atonement, spiritualism, the inner sense of Scripture, and the nature of the New Church, emphasizing that the Word of God contains both a natural letter for the natural man and a spiritual sense for the spiritual man. Throughout, Bayley demonstrates how the Writings of Swedenborg provide the key to understanding Scripture's true meaning, showing that apparent contradictions with science disappear when the spiritual sense is recognized as the primary purpose of Divine revelation.

=== Great_Truths_on_Great_Subjects-Bayley
This collection of six lectures by Rev. Dr. Jonathan Bayley presents fundamental New Church doctrines in a clear and accessible manner, addressing key theological topics such as the Divine Unity and Trinity, the Atonement, the Christian life, death and resurrection, judgment, and the Second Coming of the Lord. Bayley emphasizes that the Trinity is not three separate persons but three essential constituents within the one God - the Father as Divine Love, the Son as Divine Truth, and the Holy Spirit as Divine Proceeding - all united in the Lord Jesus Christ as the Divine Human. The work explains that the Lord's incarnation and glorification established a new relationship between God and man, enabling direct communication and salvation through acknowledgment of the Lord as the one true God. Throughout, Bayley stresses the practical application of these doctrines in daily life, showing how understanding the Lord's true nature leads to genuine spiritual growth and happiness.
