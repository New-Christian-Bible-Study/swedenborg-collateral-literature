*This figure 72 probably represents the 72nd year after the captivity. The captivity
lasted 70 years. “The Lord was born 605.” This would mean 605 years after the
captivity. And since the date of the Lord’s birth was 5 B.C., the captivity began in 609
or 610 B.C. according to this computation. In the notes it was stated to be 606 or 605
B.C.
