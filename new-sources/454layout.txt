Judaea was under Persian rule from 530 till about 330 B.C. After the death of Alexander the Great,
the rule over Judaea was disputed by the Seleucids in Syria and the Ptolemies in Egypt till about
the year 175 B.C. when it came wholly under Syrian rule under Antiochus the Great. In 167 B.C.,
the country obtained a quasi independence through the successful revolt of the Maccabees. This
priestly rule continued until Jerusalem was captured by Pompeii in 63 B.C. This established the
Roman power in Judea. Herod the Great was made King of Judaea in 37 B.C. He died in 4 B.C. The
Lord was born of the remnant that same year, or in 5 B.C.
