[arabic]
.. The Lord is the Word because the Word is from Him and treats of Him ...[.text-right](@DP 172)
.. Also because it is the Divine Truth of the Divine Good ...[.text-right](@DP 172)
.. Therefore to be taught from the Word is to be taught from Him ...[.text-right](@DP 172)
.. The fact that this is done mediately through preaching does not destroy its immediate nature ...[.text-right](@DP 172)
. Man is led and taught by the Lord in externals to all appearance as of himself ...[.text-right](@DP 174)

=== Fifth Law: It is a law of the Divine Providence that man should not perceive and feel anything of the operation of the Divine Providence, but still that he should know and acknowledge it ..... (n. 175-190)

[.text-left]
[upperroman]
