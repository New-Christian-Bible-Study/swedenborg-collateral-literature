== THE CREATION - A GENERAL VIEW
Genesis 1; 2: 1-3

The introduction for this first lesson in all classes should be a
few words about the Bible as the book we study in Sunday School.
It is different from all other books in the world. The Lord is its
Author, and in it He tells us about Himself and the things we need
to know so that we may learn to be heavenly people and live in
heaven when we die. So we call it the Word of God. It is made up
of many books written through many men. The first book is called
Genesis, which means "the beginning."

Doctrinal Points
[Summary doctrinal points will be found at the beginning of each lesson.
They are especially recommended for the use of teachers of Intermediate and
Senior classes. Their listing in this way merely brings them together for the
teacher's convenience; they are not meant to be taken up as the main feature
of the lesson, but to be brought in by the way. Each point will be identifiable
as related to one of the four principal doctrines of the Church: the doctrines
of the Lord, the Word, Faith, or Charity.]

The Lord is the beginning of everything. He created heaven and

earth.

The Word is the Lord's revelation to us ofall that we need to know

about our Creator and our relation to Him.

Faith in the Lord means trust in Him and obedience to His com 

mandments even against our own will and judgment.

We cannot do any real good of ourselves. All good is in and from

the Lord.

Notes for Parents

We send our children to school to learn the things they need to
know to find and fill their places in this world. We bring them to
Sunday School to learn the deeper things they need to know in
order to be useful and happy not only in this world but in that
higher world where we shall all live to eternity.

These deeper things can be learned only by studying the Book
in which the Lord has revealed them to us-the Bible, the Word of
God. So in our Sunday School course each year we cover the Bible
story, learning more and more about it from year to year. We hope
very much that you will be interested in what your children are
learning in Sunday School and will help to lay the basis in their
minds for the lesson each week by reading with them the chapters
in the Bible suggested in these notes and by teaching them the
memory verses. The Lord not only speaks to us in His Word; He is
present with us in every verse from the Word which is planted in
our memory. So in helping your children to know the Bible you
are doing for them something more valuable than anything else
you can possibly do.

The Bible begins with the story of creation. Its very first verse
tells us the first and most
important thing every person should
know: "In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth."
If we do not believe that we owe our existence to God, we can
have no true understanding of the purpose and goal of life.

Many people today question the authority of the Bible because
science has proved that the material world was many thousands of
years in the making. Yet when an old person says to us, "In my
day people didn't do that," we know that the speaker does not
mean a day of twenty-four hours. The six days of creation are
merely six stages of development. And, while it is true that in
general the physical world came into being somewhat as the first
chapter of Genesis says, it is not really this physical world about
which the Lord is speaking. We can find out about the physical
world for ourselves, but of the inner world of our souls only the
Lord can tell us.

The first chapter of Genesis really tells us about the creation of
a true human soul from its unconscious beginning in infancy, when
it has only the potential elements of spiritual and natural develop 
ment-the heaven and the earth-through the first dawning of the
light of understanding by means of which one learns both natural
and spiritual truths, to the belief in God and love of Him which 
enable us to come into His image and likeness and to attain the
peace and happiness pictured by the sabbath day.

=== Primary

The teacher, after going through the whole story briefly, should try to see
that rhost of the children are able to answer at least the questions, who made
the world? What book tells us about the Lord? and who wrote the Bible?
and to tell how many days it took the Lord to make the world and what He
did on the seventh day. Do not be afraid of repetition; little children like it,
and that is the way they learn.
In this lesson on Creation a special point can be made very simply of the
origin of the sabbath and how we should use Sunday.

Do you know what book we study in Sunday School? It is the
Bible. It is called the Lord's Book because the Lord was its Author.
It is also called the Word because it was spoken by the Lord. And
finally it is called the Book of Life because it tells us how to live
so that we may be the Lord's children and live in heaven when we
die.

The Bible is made up of many books, the first of which is called
Genesis, which means "the beginning." Let us read the very first
verse of the Bible and see if we can learn it, because it teaches us
something which we must never forget. The Lord made this world
in which we live and everything in it. But He made something else,
too. He made heaven, the beautiful world to which we shall all go
to live sometime if we are good.

What was the world like when it was fIrst created?
What was the Lord's fIrst command?
In how many days was everything created?
These were not twenty-four hour days but long periods of time.
What did the Lord make last?

Our chapter for today tells us the order in which the Lord made
man. Let us read it from the Bible. [Read Genesis 1.] You see the
world had to be prepared for men before men could be created,
but everything in the world was made for the use of man. The
Lord is called our "Heavenly Father" because He made us all and
loves us as His children. He tells us to take good care of everything
and to use everything wisely as He made it to be used.

See if you can remember what the Lord did on the seventh day
[Read Genesis 2:1-3], and try every Sunday when you wake up to
think, "This is the Lord's day; 1 must keep it holy; 1 must think
about
the Lord, and try to make everyone about me happy."
Blessed means made happy, and sanctified means made holy.

Junior

These children should be able to find the lesson in the Bible and to remember
most of it. It is at this age that children especially like to learn facts, and it
is therefore the age at which the literal sense of the Word should be most
thoroughly taught. Be sure that they understand the meaning of any unusual
words in the text. Juniors like to learn new words and to stretch their minds.
They may also be introduced to the idea that all the stories in the Word are
parables, even though mos~ of them are also fact. So the Junior notes will
include from time to time some of the simpler and more obvious correspon 
In the case of the Creation story the correspondence of light and
dences.
darkness is a very easy one to explain because it is so familiar through our
everyday speech.

What book do we study in Sunday School?
What is the first book in the Bible?
What does Genesis mean?
What does the first verse of the Bible tell us?
Who is the Author of the Bible?

The first chapter in the Bible tells us about the creation of the
world. God made both the heavens and the earth in the very begin 
ning, but it took a long time to prepare the earth for man. This
preparation was accomplished in six stages, called "days."

Notice that the very first step in the development of the world
was light. "And God said, Let there be light; and there was light."
Now think whether there is any other kind of light besides physical
light. Do we ever say, "I see," when we don't mean seeing with
our eyes? When we don't understand a thing, it is like darkness,
isn't
it? And light comes when we begin to understand. Then we
can go ahead. So if our minds are to develop we need the light of truth, or knowledge.

After light came, the world moved steadily forward.
First the heavens and the earth could be clearly distinguished

from each other.

Then on the earth the dry land appeared, and grass and grain

and fruit trees began to grow.

Then the clouds broke away so that the sun appeared in the

daytime and the moon and stars at night.

Then the fish were created in the sea and the birds in the air.
Finally, on the sixth day the animals were created and lastly

men and women.

Read verse 27 and see what

tells us about God, and about
it
man. This shows us that man is quite different from the animals.
God gave the whole world to man to use and enjoy and take
care of. If we misuse and spoil the good things the Lord gives us,
we hurt ourselves more than anyone else. If we take good care of
our possessions and use them as they are meant to be used, we
can be trusted with more and more and can have more and more
happiness.

Read verse 3 of chapter 2. Blessed means made happy, and
sanctified or hallowed means made sacred. This tells us what kind
of day Sunday should be. It should be a restful and happy day
not only for us but for all those about us; so we must try to be
especially obedient and helpful at home on that day. And it should
be made sacred by taking time and opportunity to learn about the
Lord and to worship Him.

The first chapter of Genesis seems to be just a story of how the
world and all things in it were created, but it is really a parable.
Inside of this story of the beginning of things on the earth is the
story of how each one of us is born in the darkness of complete
ignorance and develops little by little as his understanding grows
until he is able to bring forth the fruits of good deeds and become
a true man or woman in the image and likeness of his Heavenly
Father, and worships Him in a happy, peaceful heart.

Now, let us see if we can write down the order in which the
chapter tells us everything was created, so that we shall remember
it, for as you grow older, you will learn a great deal more about
what each thing in the story means.

On the first day God created light.
On the second day God created the firmament.
On the third day God created the grass, herbs, and trees.
On the fourth day God created the sun, moon, and stars.
On the fifth day God created the fish and the birds.
On the sixth day God created the animals, and man.
What did God do on the seventh day? He rested.

Intermediate

There should be persistent effort to make clear to the pupils that the Bible
has an intimate personal application and that it describes their own spiritual
life. This group should begin to realize that in its spiritual as well as in its
literal sense the Bible is one continuous story written by the Lord according
to definite patterns and plans. In this lesson the New Church teaching con 
cerning the early chapters of Genesis can be given briefly, and the effect
should be to make the young people feel sorry for those who know so little
of the meaning of these wonderful stories that they doubt and ridicule them.
Most of the class time should be given to the correspondence of the six days
as it relates to their own development from infancy to maturity.

Let us be sure we know the first verse of the Bible by heart.
Other verses in the lesson which are good to learn are verses 3, 27,
and 28. We should also know what progress was made on each of
the six days.

While this seems to be the story of the beginning of the earth,
we should know that the Bible is not given to teach us natural
science. Men can find out things about the earth by their own
efforts, and God would not have to give us a revelation to tell us
such things. The Bible is given to teach us spiritual truths-truths
about God and our souls-which we could not find out for our 
selves. The Lord Himself is the Author of the Word, although He
used many different men to write it down. He put the words into
their minds, and they knew that they must write them down, and
that the words did not come from themselves.

The very first verse tells us that
in the beginning man was
created with a heavenly as well as an earthly nature. He was not
a mere animal. But his earthly nature was rudimentary and his
heavenly nature was clouded with the darkness of ignorance (verse
2). This is also true of each one of us when he is born.

The beginning of man's development-and of ours-was the mo 
ment when God said, "Let there be light." Truth is for the eye
of the mind what light is for the physical eye. When we begin to
understand something, we say, "I see." Then and only then can
we go ahead. See if you can think of any other common sayings
in which light and darkness and sight and blindness are used in
this way.

The six days of creation picture six stages in man's development
into a true human being, in the image and likeness of God, a spiri 
tual being capable of knowing and worshiping God. Read through
the chapter, thinking of each step in this light. Because everything
in nature was made by the Lord, everything expresses something
in Him. So we say that each thing in nature "corresponds" to
something in the world of the spirit, and the Bible is written in
this language of correspondence. Here are some correspondences
to help you in seeing the spiritual meaning within this first chapter
of Genesis:

Waters mean truths.
The firmament-or expanse as it is more accurately translated 
pictures the plane of our thinking. The waters above the firmament
are symbolic of truths about God and heavenly life, those below
the firmament are truths about the world and earthly life.
Dry land means our conscious experience, and seas represent truths
gathered together in the memory.
The vegetable kingdom stands for our thoughts, the fruit for our
deeds. Seeds, spiritually speaking, are new germs of thought which
are capable of producing fruit. We may think of the ,Lord's words:
"By their fruits ye shall know them." And we all remember the
parable of the sower, which is found in Matthew 13: 1-23. The
Lord Himself explained this parable to His disciples, and told them
that the seed represented the Word.

The sun is the symbol of love for the Lord, the moon faith in Him,
and the stars knowledges of heavenly things. The day is a time
when we see clearly, and the night one when everything seems
dark, and we must just trust in what we have been taught about
the Lord and the good life, as a sailor at night is guided by the
stars.
Living creatures represent affections or desires-cold-blooded ones,
like fish, affections for earthly knowledges, the birds affections
for heavenly knowledges, and warm-blooded animals affections for
doing useful things.

Think carefully what verse 27 teaches us about God and our

relation to Him.

The Lord gave us the world in which we live and also all the
thoughts and affections we have, and He tells us to rule over them
wisely. Swedenborg tells us: "The end [purpose] of creation is a
heaven from the human race." So our purpose in life should be
to become the kind of people who can live in heaven.

Read chapter 2, verse 3, and think from it what type of day
Sunday should be for us. It is not intended to be a sad or hard day,
but we ought to spend it in such a way that we and all those about
us may be happy and peaceful together. Happiness does not come
from always "getting our own way," for our own way is often very
selfish and hard on other people. Happiness comes from learning
to love to do the things the Lord would have us do, and we can do
this only by learning what He has told us in the Word and by keep 
ing His commandments. Recall the commandment, "Remember
the sabbath day to keep it holy." Going to church and Sunday
School is an orderly part of the keeping of the sabbath. A good
rule to keep in mind about Sunday is one which the Lord gave the
people when He was in the world: "It is lawful to do good on the
sabbath day."

Senior

Follow the same general lines as for the Intermediates but with proportion 
ately more stress upon doctrine and upon the attitude of the world toward
the things of religion. Solid grounding in the principles underlying the Lord's
operation in the world, given at this age, will do much to prevent the young
people from drifting away from the church when the atmosphere of the world
begins to press upon them.

Probably the first attack on the authenticity of the Bible as the
Word of God centered about the creation story. Since science has
proved that the world was millions of years in the process of for 
mation, it is obvious that the literal statement in Genesis is con 
trary to fact. As a result of this, some men say that the Bible
cannot be the Word of God because it is not true.

But the Bible was not written to teach men natural science or
anything else which they can find out for themselves. It was writ 
ten to teach us about God and His purposes, and about our souls
and their relation to Him.

In the creation story the Lord tells us-in terms of familiar
natural objects which we all understand-the story of how He
created the human soul in the first place and of how He creates
each one of us today. In the New Church view, a human being is
not merely a higher animal, although he has a material body as the
animals have. "In the beginning God created the heavens and the
earth." Man from his creation has not only a natural body fitted
for life on this earth and mental faculties to direct its use, but he
has also a higher spiritual plane capable of knowing God and of
living in the spiritual world.

At first both the spiritual and the natural planes were undevel 
oped, just as our individual minds are at birth. The baby has no
knowledge; he is unable to do anything for himself. But he is not
a little animal-he is a potential man. Let us follow. the story of
creation through briefly, as it applies to the development of the
individual soul, for we are immediately concerned with the process
by which each of us may become the true human being whom the
Lord created him to be.

The first step-or day-is the dawn of consciousness, the ability
to see, to distinguish objects and form associations of pleasure or
pain. The baby begins to "notice," to recognize his parents and
friends, to play, to laugh, to seek what pleases him. The second
day is the dawning of the realization that some things must be
done whether they give pleasure or not, that there is something in
life beside the satisfaction of physical desires. This is the rudimen 
tary differentiation between right and wrong, the basis of heavenly
life.

The third day brings the thirst for knowledge of the world
about us with all the thoughts and activities that spring up from
this knowledge. The fourth day brings the first real concept of
God and desire to learn about Him and to love and serve Him-the
sun, moon, and stars picture love to the Lord, faith in Him, and
knowledges of heavenly things. The fifth day brings abundant
knowledge and understanding of both earthly and heavenly truths.
And finally on the sixth day the strong, warm desires for useful
and happy service-the warm-blooded animals-appear, and man
becomes a truly human being, ordering his life wisely on the basi~
of knowledge of the Lord and His purposes. He is then a mature,
independent, and useful individual, and can know rest-peace of
mind.

This story is developed in detail in the first volume of Sweden 
borg's Arcana Coelestia, from which you will find a quotation at
the end of this lesson. There it is also applied to the development
of the Human nature which the Lord manifested by means of His
life on earth. For within the letter of the Word of God there are
several levels of meaning. The inmost level relates to the Lord and
His nature and life, the next to the individual human soul, and the
next
to the spiritual history of the human race as a whole. So
within every verse there are deeper and deeper ideas and knowl 
edges, each one a subject for study and development. It is this
inner world which the Lord has opened to men in His Second
Coming.

Adult

The teacher should cover the whole lesson briefly and then invite discussion
and develop further the points in which the class is most interested.

It is very important for us to understand that the New church
has teaching concerning the early chapters of Genesis which can be
found nowhere else. For even if we hear no direct attacks upon
the validity of this portion of the Word, we can scarcely escape
hearing slighting references to it, and jokes and songs based upon
the stories of Creation, Adam and Eve and the serpent, and Noah
and the Ark. The prevailing skepticism concerning these early
chapters is like an atmosphere which is breathed unconsciously.
Children who are beginning to pass from complete reliance upon
their parents can be protected against it only by being forewarned
of its existence and by understanding its cause. This is the method
the Lord followed with the race. It is interesting to note that the
first volume of the Arcana, which points out the impossibility of
a literal interpretation of these chapters and gives their internal
sense, appeared several years before the work of Jean Astruc
(1684-1766), the father of modern skepticism.* Thus before doubt
was permitted to attack the Word openly, the truth which could
meet and overcome the doubt was published.

The New Church teaches that the early chapters of Genesis were
copied by Moses from the Ancient Word, which existed before our
Word and which was written entirely in correspondences; that is,
the things of nature were used as symbols to express spiritual
truths, just as the Lord taught His disciples through the various
parables so familiar to us all. The people of the Most Ancient
Church, having open communication with the heavens, understood
the true relation between the two worlds and saw everything in
nature as a mere ultimation of something spiritual. So the earli 
language, both spoken and written, was a beautiful symbol
est
language, the expression of spiritual thought in natural forms. This
language was preserved,in the Ancient Word, and still is preserved
in the first eleven chapters of our Bible. As men turned from the
Lord, however, and became absorbed in themselves and in their
life in the world, they lost communication with the spiritual world
and with it
the understanding of the spiritual realities behind
things in nature. In time they lost even the knowledge that the
early stories of Genesis had a spiritual meaning.

Yet for a time men continued to recognize that these stories
came from God and to believe them to be true. So they could be
helped by them, for even in their letter they teach the great truths
that the Lord is Creator of all things, that man is happy so long as
he obeys the Lord, and that all evil and unhappiness come from
disobedience. But finally men began to doubt the truth of the
stories and with it their Divine origin. Then in order to save man 
kind the Lord restored the knowledge of their inner meaning. This

*The work here referred to was published in 1753 and titled, Conjectures SW'les

is what was done through Swedenborg. To the New Churchman the
early chapters of Genesis, instead of being strange and puzzling,
and stumbling blocks in the way of belief in the Bible, become
wonderful volumes of instruction in the spiritual history of the
race and of our own souls. Our children should be armed with the
knowledge that those who doubt these chapters are simply ignor 
ant of their true meaning, because they either have not found or
have refused to use the key which the Lord has given us.

Swedenborg tells us that the object of creation was "a heaven
from the human race." The first verse of the Word tells us: "In the
beginning God created the heaven and the earth." Heaven symbol 
izes the spiritual nature in man, the earth his lower nature. The
whole story of creation is the account of the development of
man's consciousness of his higher nature, of his understanding of
the proper relation and use of the higher and lower, and finally of
his enjoyment of the full measure of his heavenly possibilities; that
is, of the development of the truly human soul. This is a long pro 
cess, and the history of the individual parallels the history of the
race because the race is composed of individuals, and because each
individual is a new creation.

The great heritage of the New Church is the key to the inner
meaning of the Word:
the knowledge of correspondences. Yet
many New Church people never acquire the ability to use this key
for
themselves. They know perhaps that water corresponds to
truth, fire to love, a lamb to innocence, bread and wine to good
and truth, and other correspondences here and there, but their
information is too scattered to be of any use to them as they read
the Word. The story of creation provides a practical working out 
line for the study of correspondences because it contains the great
generals. Heaven in the first verse of Genesis signifies the internal
part of man, and earth the external part of man (AC 16). The
external part of man does not mean just the body, but all the
natural thoughts and feelings which are connected with our every 
internal
day life in the world. The internal man is the higher,
region of the soul, of which we are unconscious much of the time,
where are our thoughts and feelings about the Lord and spiritual
things. These two are present in every man from the beginning,
but the earth-the external man-is without form and void; that is,
we have no understanding of the purpose or plan of our earthly
life. And darkness is "upon the face of the deep"; that is, we are
altogether ignorant even of the existence of an inner and higher
nature. This condition exists not only when we are infants, but
when we are grown men and women if we have not begun to
regenerate; for when a man or woman does not believe that there
is any higher life than the natural, not only is his internal man in
darkness but everything he knows about this world is empty of
any real good and truth because it is not seen in its proper relation
to spiritual life. Yet always the "spirit of God" moves upon the
face of the waters; the Lord's mercy is always seeking to reach us
through the things which He has stored up-without our knowing
it-in our internal man.

The first beginning of regeneration-the formation of a heavenly
character-is the coming of light. Throughout the Word darkness
pictures a state of ignorance and light a state of knowledge. The
Lord was born while shepherds watched their flocks by night;
when He was crucified there was darkness over the world. And in
the creation story each day-that is, each stage of development 
proceeds from evening to morning, from darkness to light, from
ignorance to knowledge. "And God said, Let there be light; and
there was light." Of this Swedenborg says: "The first state is when
man begins to know that the good and the true are something
higher" (AC 20). The very first thing necessary to regeneration is
to recognize that there is something higher than our mere external
life, something more important than what we can get for ourselves
out of this world. Thus God, working in our minds, divides the
light from the darkness.

Then follows the second day, in which we begin to organize the
knowledges which are in our minds, dividing between those which
concern merely worldly things and those which concern heavenly
and Divine things. This is the beginning of our real awareness
of our internal potential-the firmament-and the dividing of the
from those below the firmament.
waters above the firmament
In the story water first appears as a symbol for truth. To the man
who does not believe in God and a spiritual world the Bible is like
any other book~ and ideas about goodness and truth have no
meaning other than that which arises out of their effects in this
world. But a~ soon as one recognizes the existence of God and of
a higher life, goodness and truth are seen as spiritual realities.

The third day, or stage, brings more definite and permanent
accomplishment. The waters under the firmament are gathered
together into seas. Seas stand for knowledges gathered together
in the memory. Think, for example, of the place the Sea of Galilee
holds in the Gospel story. Then the dry land appears; that is, man
forms a definite idea of what his external nature is and of what its
use should be. And from this time he begins to make his external
perform its proper use. It receives seeds of truth from the Lord
and produces external good works. Here we have our introduction
to the wonderful symbolism of the vegetable kingdom, the basis
for the understanding of the meaning of all the plants and trees
in the Bible story. We are familiar with the parable of the Sower
and with the Lord's explanation of it: the Sower is the Lord~ the
seed truths from the Word, the ground the minds of men, and the
fruit the good and useful things done by a man when the seed of
truth has taken root in his heart and grown up in his life. The
many different plants and I trees represent different truths. Every
plant and tree is a principle grown from a particular truth, and its
is the conduct which results from the application of that
fruit
principle. And as every fruit has seeds of its own kind within itself~
so right conduct in one individual suggests to other people the
truth of the principle behind it, which they may adopt and develop
into right conduct of their own. Notice that there is a progression
in the appearance of vegetable life: first the grass-or more prop 
erly the "tender herb" -then the herb yielding seed and finally the
tree yielding fruit. That is, we first develop minor truths whose
results are perishable, and later more and more important and
fruitful truths.

Now we are ready for another great step forward. The good we
have done so far has been the result of the mere recognition of the
existence of God and spiritual things. But when we have had some
experience in trying to live according to spiritual principles, we
begin to feel the need of more definite knowledge of God and of
His purposes. On the fourth day the sun, moon, and stars appear.
The sun is the symbol of love to the Lord, the moon of faith in
Him, and the stars of knowledges of heavenly things. There are
a great many people who believe that there is a God but think we
cannot know anything about Him. These people try to do right,
but they have only their own judgment to guide them or the judg 
ment of other men ~nd women. They have light but they do not
know where it comes from. They do right from a sense of duty,
or from fear of the consequences of evil, or from a desire to be
respected and to respect themselves. These are all motives in which
there is much of self. Such people are often troubled by the
command to "love the Lord." They say, "What does it mean to
love the Lord? How can we love someone we do not know?"
But it is not true that we cannot know the Lord. He has revealed
Himself to us in His Word and in the person of Jesus Christ,
the "Word made flesh." If we love the divine characteristics so
manifested, we love the Lord. If, instead of clinging to our natural
tastes and desires, we seek to make our characters conform to the
divine standard, then we are acting from love to the Lord and not
from love of self. Then the sun appears in our heavens. But we all
know that even after we have seen this sun, there are times when
our natural desires rise up and darken our sky. Then we must
continue to obey the commandments because we know that they
are the Lord's way. This is faith, which like the moon shines by
reflected light and shows us the way through our temporary dark 
ness until the sun rises again-until the temptation is past. And we
are helped at such times also by all that we have learned from the
Word about the Lord and His ways-the stars guide us. This change
from self-guidance to the Lord's guidance is a distinct step in our
progress and is necessary to our doing any real good; for, as Swe 
denborg tells us many times and as the Lord Himself tells us in
Matthew 19: 17, there is no genuine good except from the Lord's
unselfish love in the heart. This is why the creation of the sun,
moon, and stars comes in between the creation of the vegetable
kingdom and that of the animal kingdom, for animals are warm 
blooded, living things and represent genuine good affections.

At

is evil and false,

the beginning of his explanation of verse 20 Swedenborg
says: "After the great luminaries have been kindled and placed in
the internal man, and the external receives light from them, then
the man first begins to live. Heretofore he can scarcely be said to
have lived, inasmuch as the good which he did he supposed that
he did of himself, and the truth which he spoke that he spoke of
himself; and since man of himself is dead, and there is in him
nothing but what
therefore whatsoever he pro 
duces from himself is not alive" (AC 39). But as soon as one
recognizes that all goodness comes from the Lord and not from
himself, everything in him begins to live. The knowledges of exter 
nal things which he has stored in his memory-the seas-come to
life, as it were, because they become related to the Lord and His
service; these are the "moving creatures that hath life" which the
waters brought forth. And the higher things of his reason are the
birds which fly in the air. The great whales are the general princi 
ples of external knowledge. That is, fishes and birds picture things
of the mind made alive by being related to the Lord as the source
of all wisdom.

On the sixth day the earth brings forth living creatures. These
are no longer things of the mind alone, but things of the will 
good affections. Before we reach this stage we may know what is
right and not do it, or we may even do it against our real desire.
But when we love to do it, then the earth has brought forth the
good animals. Fish and birds always picture thin~s of the mind,
lower and higher, and animals always picture things of the heart or
will. When these good affections are brought forth, when a man
has come to love to do the Lord's will, then he has become truly
a man created in the image and likeness of God both as to his
intellect and as to his will: "Male and female created he them."
Here is another fundamental correspondence which we should
know:
in general throughout the Word men picture the intellect
and women the affections. The regenerate man has dominion or
control over all his thoughts and affections; for when anyone loves
to do the Lord's will, the Lord's power can act in and through him.
The Lord has given each of us a kingdom within himself, which he
must learn to govern wisely. We must try to see that everything
in us serves the Lord and so is really alive, and then we must keep
all the fish and birds and animals of our minds and hearts in order
so that the Lord's power can make us true men and women.

The seventh day-the day of rest-pictures the happy state of
one who is fully established in heavenly character. We have a taste
of this state whenever we have fully conquered a particular temp 
tation so that we no longer want to do the wrong thing against
which we have been struggling, when the Lord's love is in our
hearts instead of the selfish desire which has troubled us. As long
as we are in this world new temptations will soon come upon us.
But when we reach our heavenly home, the time of struggle and
trial will be past and we shall always enjoy the happy state of
willing service. For rest is not inactivity: it is "rest in the Lord" 
living consciously from Him so that nothing which is given us to do
can worry or tire us. For this reason the seventh day was blessed
and sanctified, and the number seven throughout the Word rep 
resents what is holy.

From the Writings of Swedenborg

Arcana Coelestia, nn. 16,20: "The most ancient time is called 'the beginning.'
By the prophets it is in various places called the 'days of old [antiquitatis] '
and also the 'days of eternity.' The 'beginning' also involves the first period
when man is being regenerated, for he is then born anew, and receives life.
Regeneration itself is therefore called a 'new creation' of man. The expressions
to 'create,' to 'form,' to 'make,' in almost all parts of the prophetic writings
signify to regenerate, yet with a difference in the signification.
. That
'heaven' signifies the internal man; and 'earth' the external man before regen 
eration, may be seen from what follows."
"And God said, Let there be light; and there was light. The first state is when
man begins to know that the good and the true are something higher. Men
who are altogether external do not even know what good and truth are; for
they fancy all things to be good that belong to the love of self and the love of
the world; and all things to be true that favor these loves; not being aware
that such goods are veils, and such truths falsities. But when man is conceived
anew, he then begins for the first time to know that his goods are not goods,
and also, as he comes more into the light, that the Lord is, and that He is
good and truth itself."

== THE CREATION - THE FIRST FOUR DAYS
Genesis 1:1-19

In teaching the Creation story we need to keep in mind that this
is not only the beginning of the Bible but the foundation of all
our further teaching. The thought of the Lord as the beginning of
everything, our Heavenly Father, the Creator of everything we see
and know,
is essential to any spiritual understanding and to any
genuinely good life. With all the classes we shall need to point out
that our primary business in Sunday School is to learn of the Lord
and His purposes for us so that we may truly serve Him, and that
the only sure source of such knowledge is His Word which He has
given us so that we may know these things. We are studying the
Word as the Lord has given it to us and as He has opened it for
our deeper understanding. Throughout our year's work we should
frequently remind ourselves as well as our pupils that what we are
studying is the Lord's Book, which is the Book of Life. We are
putting special emphasis on the thought of the first four days in
the Creation story, but
the seven days should first be covered
briefly.

=== Doctrinal Points
The first thing we need to know about the Lord is that He is the
Creator of all things. The Lord's name Jehovah means "I am."
The whole Word is a parable written in the language of correspondences.

Faith is the acceptance of something as true, and the better we

understand anything the more faith we can have in it.

Truth which does not lead to good deeds is like a plant which

bears no fruit.

=== Notes for Parents

Genesis means "beginning." The first words of the Bible are
"In the beginning God." This is the first thing we need to know if
we are to be true human beings and not mere animals. The real
difference between an animal and a human being is that an animal
can know nothing beyond physical things, while a human being
can know God.

If we stop to think, we should be able to see that God would
not be likel"y to waste time telling us things we can find out for
ourselves-things about the world of nature. What He has to tell us
are the things about Himself and about our souls, because these
we cannot find out in any other way. So this first chapter of the
Bible, about which people have disputed so much, really tells us
about the creation of the human soul. It is a wonderful parable,
a symbol story, taken from an Ancient Word written in the time
when men spoke in this symbol language because they saw every 
thing in the world about them to be an expression of something
in God and thus in the soul. Throughout His Word the Lord speaks
to us in this language and if we study it, we can understand more
and more of what He wishes to tell us. The Bible is like Jacob's
ladder with its foot on the ground and its top reaching up to God;
God's thoughts come down to us through it and our thoughts rise
up to Him, like the angels on the ladder. Read this story in Genesis
28: 10-22. We, as well as our children, need to know the Bible
stories well, just as they are given us in the Bible, if we are to find
God in them.

=== Primary

Call the children's attention to your Bible and see if they know what book
it is. Explain to them that it is the Lord's Book, which He has written so that
we may know about Him. Then go on to the Hrst things He tells us about
Himself and the world. Tell them that God is our Heavenly Father to whom
we pray-the same Person who came into the world as the Lord Jesus-and
that He loves us and takes care of us; and that if we try to do what He tells us
is right, we shall be happy. Then talk about light and darkness and about
what the sun, moon, and stars do for us, reminding them that the Lord made
these things for us. This is a good opportunity to point out briefly the two parts of the Word 
the Old and the New Testaments. Speak of the wonderful opportunity the
Lord has given us to learn about Him, of the need of studying the Word all
our lives, and of the reverence we should feel for it.

Did you know that God made the light? Some mornings when
you wake up the sky is blue and the sun is bright and you can play
out-of-doors. Then you are happy. Then some mornings it is rain 
ing and you have to play in the house, but still you can see every 
thing. That is because, although the sky is covered with clouds
from which the rain is coming, the sun is up above the clouds still,
and it gives so much light that it shines right through.

But after you have played all day and had your supper, it is dark
outside, and dark in the house too, unless your mother turns on
the lights. The sun has not stopped shining, but it is around on the
other side of the earth making daytime for little Chinese and Jap 
anese girls and boys.

Have you ever been out-of-doors at night? If you have, you have
seen the stars way up in the sky, and perhaps the moon. God made
those, too. He made the whole sky and the earth, and He made all
the plants and trees, and the birds and fishes and animals, and He
made you and me and everybody.

God made all these things because He loves us and wants us to
be happy. And we can always be happy if we love Him and each
other. When we love people, we try to make them happy. Let us
read our lesson from the Bible.

What did God create on the first day?
What did He create on the second day?
What did He create on the third day?
What two great lights did God make on the fourth day?
What little lights did He make?
Can you think of some of the things the sun does for us?
When can we see the moon and stars?
You know that at night sailors can steer their ships by the stars.
Don't you think we should all thank the Lord for making such a beautiful
world for us to live in?
He made it because He loves us. When we love people, we want to make them
happy. Selfishness is the opposite oflove. It makes everybody unhappy, even
the selftsh people themselves. So we must try not to be selftsh.

=== Junior
Note the suggestions made above in regard to the Lord and the Word, and be
sure the pupils are familiar with these thoughts. Then go on to the Creation
story, calling attention to its true meaning. The Juniors should be introduced
to the idea that the Word has an internal meaning relating to our souls, which
is its important meaning, and told that no one can learn this meaning unless
he knows the literal story well and reads it regularly. Our effort is to give
them glimpses of the internal sense which will show them how much is in
store for them as they grow older, and will form a basis for more detailed
study in the intermediate class. This can be done very well in connection with
the creation of light and of the sun, moon, and stars. The teacher will find
the answer to the last question suggested in their notes by reading the notes
for the older classes. But see if any of the class can ftgure out the answer
before you give it.

What book do we study in Sunday School?
Who is its Author?
By what other names is it called?
What is the name of the ftrst book in the Bible?

Genesis means "beginning." This book tells us about the begin 
ning of everything in the world. The first chapter seems to be
about the creation of the earth and all the plants and animals and
people on it, but this is only the outside meaning.

How many days did this creation take?
What happened on the seventh day?

At the end of this lesson you will find a list of questions. Look
up the answers in your Bible and write them after the questions.
This will help you to remember the "order of creation." We can
also remember that it is because of this story of creation that we
and other people allover the world find it good to work six days
and on the seventh day to rest and worship the Lord. In your Bible
look up Exodus 20:8-11.

Scientists are finding out more and more about the earth all the
time. One of the things they have found out is that it took many
thousands of years to form the earth. This makes some people
doubt the Bible. But we need not be troubled by this, for we know
that the whole Word is a parable. A parable is a story which has
a deeper meaning within it. When you are a little older, you will
study the deeper meaning of this story of creation. It is a wonder 
ful study.

Even now you may be able to see a little of the deeper meaning,
which tells us how our souls are made by the Lord. What does the
first verse say? "In the beginning God created the heavens and the
earth." The Lord did create the sky and the earth, but in each one
of us-in our souls-there are also "the heaven and the earth," a
higher and a lower nature. When you want very much to do some 
thing which your father or mother has told you not to do, there is
a battle within you between your higher and your lower nature.
Your higher nature tells you to do what is right, but your lower
nature wants the thing, which looks pleasant. When you were a
little baby, you did not know enough even to think about right
and wrong. Read the second verse and see how it tells about that
time when your soul was empty and ignorant.

Did you ever, when your father or your mother was explaining
something to you, say all of a sudden, "Oh, I see"? You did not
mean that you saw something with your eyes, did you? You saw
something with your mind. Read verses 3, 4, and 5. When you
were a little child and first began to see things with your mind,
it was like the coming of light. This was the first day in your soul.
Now perhaps you can see that day in this story of creation does
not mean a day like Sunday or Monday or Tuesday. It means a
new state of thinking and feeling. And it may mean a long period
of time, too. Did you ever hear an old person say, "In my day
everybody did so and so"?

So each day in this chapter really describes a new step in our
growing up. When you get into the Intermediate class, you will
study more of these steps, but for now it is enough to remember
that light pictures the understanding of truth, and darkness pic 
tures ignorance. With this knowledge, see if you can figure out
why in our chapter it always says "the evening and the morning"
instead of "the morning and the evening."

What did God create on the first day?
What did God create on the second day?
What did God create on the third day?
What did God create on the fourth day?
What did God create on the fifth day?
What did God create on the sixth day?
What did God do on the seventh day?

=== Intermediate
For this class the teacher will need to study the Senior and Adult notes as
well as the Intermediate notes, in order th,u he may have more to add to
is given in the pupils' notes; but in developing the lesson he should
what
follow the general outline of the pupils' notes. Do not neglect the intro 
duction given at the beginning of this lesson. Try to cover the lesson rapidly
enough to leave time for questions and discussion.

The first chapter of the Bible, like all the rest of the Word, is a
parable. It seems to tell us about the creation of the natural world;
and of course it is true that God created everything in the natural
world, including our physical bodies. But men can find out about
nature for themselves, and the Lord wrote the Word to tell us
things which we cannot find out in this way. That means things
about our souls.

So the Creation story really tells us how our souls were and are
developed by the Lord. When we are born, we have a physical
nature-not just a body, but a mind capable of growing into a
knowledge of all the things we need for life in this world. This is
"the earth" of our souls. And animals have this ,~arth, too. But we
have another nature which the animals do not have: a spiritual
nature capable of learning about God and heavenly things. This is
"the heaven."

In a little baby both of these natures are just in their beginnings.
The state each of us is in as a baby is described in verse 2. The
"darkness" is ignorance. Do you know that people of every
language all over the world say "I see" when they mean "I under 
stand"? This is what is called the language of cOTTespondence 
the correspondence of natural or physical
things with spiritual
or heavenly things.
In the beginning everyone understood this
correspondence and spoke in its language, and many of the ex 
pressions-like "I see"-have come down tO I us, although the general
principle was lost. If you keep this in mind, you will soon notice
some of these expressions in our common speech. All of the Word
of God is written in this language of correspondence.

The first instance of this which we shall consider in this lesson
is the word darkness. It is the opposite of light. If darkness signifies
ignorance, what does light mean? So when the Word tells us (verse
3), "and God said, Let there be light: and there was light," it is
speaking of the time in our earliest childhood when we first begin
to "see" or understand things. The next step-the second day 
is when we begin to be able to understand more than just the
physical things like eating and walking and handling; we learn that
we must obey our parents or be called naughty, that we should be
gentle and kind to others, etc. Water corresponds to truth, and the
waters above the firmament are truths about spiritual or heavenly
things, while those under the firmament are truths about natural
or earthly things.

The dry land which appears on the third day is the character
which we develop as we choose to do right or wrong, and this
character is the ground out of which grow all kinds of thoughts,
just as all sorts of grass and herbs and plants grow out of the earth.
The actions to which these thoughts lead are the fruits.

The fourth day or state is the time when we are old enough to
think about God and come to love Him and believe in Him, and
want to know more and more about Him and about what we can
do to please Him. This love is the sun which warms our hearts and
lights our minds; our belief in God is the moon which shows us
our way even when we cannot understand the "why" of things 
the nighttime. And the stars are all knowledges which our minds
gather about heavenly things, which often seem far away from our
present life and not very helpful, and yet gradually form patterns
in our minds by which we may be guided, just as wise sailors can
find their location and direction from the stars.

The living things which come on the fifth and sixth days are the
affections or tastes we develop as our characters become fully
formed, until finally we are grown-up men and women, ready to
govern our own lives and put all our knowledges to use-to "have
dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air,
and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth" (verse 28).
Psalm 118 begins, "0 give thanks to the Lord, for he is good;
because his mercy endureth forever ," and verses 23 and 24 of the
same Psalm suggest the feeling we ought to have when we reach
the seventh day of rest:

"This is the Lord's doing; it is marvelous in our eyes.
This is the day which the Lord hath made;

we will rejoice and be glad in it."

Basic Correspondences

earth = the natural mind
plants = truths developing in our minds
fruit = good works

birds = thoughts
animals = affections
heaven = the spiritual mind

=== Senior
With this class the introductory material may well be given as a statement of
the difference between the New Church teaching concerning the Lord and
the Word and the teachings of all other churches. It is good for young people
this age to know that their church has clear and definite knowledge con 
at
cerning many points which trouble people, and that even if they themselves
may not yet be ready to discuss these points with others, there are reasonable
answers to all of people's religious questions. Young people discuss religion
and argue about
it among themselves much more frequently than we are
likely to think, and we should take every opportunity to give them a sense of
the wonderful things available to them in the writings of the New Church.
Try to save time each week to read and discuss with the class the quotations
from these writings found at the end of their notes and, if possible, inspire
them to begin reading for themselves. The Creation story, being one most
often challenged, is the best possible beginning for developing this sense of
the unique opportunity offered us by the Lord in His Second Coming.

One of the questions which sooner or later arise in anyone's
mind is, "How did the world as we know it start?" Scientists,
including Swedenborg, have spent years in studying the rocks and
the various remains preserved in their strata, in the effort to answer
this question; and different theories of the origin of the universe
have been developed. Yet no human investigations or man-made
theories can really answer it. The only answer is given us in the
first verse of the Bible: "In the beginning God ...." God is the
beginning of everything we are and everything we know. His name,
as He gave it to Moses at the burning bush (Exodus 3:13-14), is
Jehovah-"I Am"-Life Itself, from Whom everything in the world
receives its life from moment to moment.

The first chapter of Genesis is a wonderful parable in which God
Himself tells us the order of our creation. The world of nature,
about which the chapter seems to speak, is only a picture of the
real world of spirit. The six days of creation are six stages of devel 
opment, not only in the world of nature in a general way, but in
the human race as a whole and in every individual, including you
and me.

Let us think of the story particularly as it applies to our individ 
ual development. We start with two natures, a higher and a lower,
"the heaven and the earth." When we are born, these are only
potential, "without form and void," and we are in "darkness" as
to the mind; but God is at work in us, and presently our conscious 
ness of the world about us begins to develop-the light comes.
Very soon-surprisingly soon-we begin to realize that life is more
than eating and sleeping and play:
there are such things as right
and wrong about which we must learn; the truths or "waters"
of the spiritual nature are separated from those concerned only
with our physical well-being. Then, as we choose the higher or
the lower, the solid ground of our individual character begins to
be formed, and from it develop our own ideas and reasonings,
at first simple and fleeting like the grass, and then more and more
strong and lasting. The permanent affections-our various tastes
and loves-are last to develop, but finally we become full-grown
men and women and can know the peace and rest of established
character.

But in our brief sketch we have left out one day-the fourth 
the central one of the seven. On it, according to the story, God
created the sun, moon, and stars. Psalm 84: 11 tells us "The Lord
God is a sun and shield," and in prophecy (Malachi 4:2) the Lord
Jesus Christ is called "the Sun of righteousness." Somewhere in
our \development, if it is normal and sound, there comes a time
when we really see that the Lord is, and that all our life-the light
of our minds and the warmth of our hearts-comes from Him.
The sun has burst forth through our clouds of ignorance. From
then on the Sun rules our daytimes-the states in which we see
our way clearly and love to do as the Lord wishes us to do. But
these states are not constant. We have nighttimes too, when doubts
and fears arise and we do not see our way. In such states our sun 
our love for the Lord-seems to disappear. But we still have the
belief that the Lord's way is right whether we understand it or not.
This is a reflected light like that of the moon. And we still have
our knowledges of the Lord's truth which,
like the stars, even
though small and scattered and apparently far from our immediate
purpose, still form patterns which can give us direction.

On.e of the criticisms which has been made of the Creation story
is that light appears before the creation of the sun; but we can see
how, in the inner meaning, this is an orderly and beautiful develop 
ment. The Lord is at work in our souls from the beginning, bring 
ing us gradually out of darkness into full sunlight. This order is
seen also in the repeated expression, "and the evening and the
morning were ...." So the Psalmist writes:

"The heavens declare the glory of God;

and the firmament sheweth his handiwork.

Day unto day uttereth speech,

and night unto night sheweth knowledge."

-Psalm 19:1-2

=== Adult
It is suggested that in taking up the Creation story, the teacher refer to the
attack which has been made upon its authenticity, point out that the Bible is
the Lord's revelation to us and is not concerned with things we can ftnd out
for ourselves; and go on from there to the general meaning of the six steps of
creation in their relation to the development of the race and of the individual,
with particular emphasis on the reason why light appears in the story before
the creation of the sun, moon, and stars, and why each day is said to go from
evening to morning.

In Revelation 20: 12 we read, "And I saw the dead, small and
great, stand before God, and the books were opened: and another
book was opened, whiSh is the book of life: and the dead were
judged out of those things which were written in the books,
according to their works." It would be difficult for anyone to read
this verse and fail to understand that by "the books" are meant
the record of the lives of those who are being judged, and that by
"the book of life" is meant the Bible. Throughout the history of
the Christian Church, therefore, the pressing problem of salvation
has been tied inseparably to that of the nature and interpretation
of the Bible. Before the development of natural science, Christians
were for the most part content to accept the Bible as literally true
and to leave its interpretation to the priesthood,
living in the
simple belief that if they did what their priests told them to do,
they were obeying the Lord and would be saved. With the inven 
tion of printing, however, and the consequent wide distribution
of the Bible, men began to read it for themselves and to develop
differences of opinion as to its interpretation, and inevitably dif 
ferences of opinion as to what constituted conduct in accordance
with the Bible teaching. And these differences were aggravated as
the findings of natural science began to cast doubt upon the literal
accuracy of the Bible narrative. Actually the unique character of
the Bible should be evident from the very volume and persistence
of the study which it has produced, to say nothing of the literature
that has been influenced by it. It is significant that even those
today who believe that the Bible is the product of human minds
often confess to feeling its strange power and try in various ways
to account for this power.

It is not the Lord's fault that men refuse to recognize His Word
as a revelation from Him; the refusal is in the individual will. The
Lord has always told men all they needed to know about Himself.
To the two on the way to Emmaus He said: "'0 fools, and slow of
heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken' ... And begin 
ning at Moses and all the prophets, he expounded unto them in all
the scriptures the things concerning himself" (Luke 24:25,27).
And just before He allowed Himself to be taken He said, "I have
yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now"
(John 16:12). This further revelation foretold to the disciples was
given to the world through Emanuel Swedenborg just as soon as
men's minds were ready to receive it, and in time to meet the
humanistic and scientific attacks upon the Bible. As we read the
Arcana Coelestia, we are constantly coming upon statements which
show that Swedenborg, who was one of the most noted scientists
of his day, was fully aware of all the facts which are brought for 
ward to prove that the Bible is the work of men. This is indicated
by many statements like the following from Arcana Coelestia,
n. 2674 concerning the sending away of Hagar and Ishmael: "Every
one can see that these historic statements involve arcana, from the
fact that Abraham, who was rich in flock and herd, and also in
gold and silver, sent away in this manner his handmaid by whom
he had a son, and the boy Ishmael whom he much loved, giving
them only bread and water." And he says repeatedly that only
a knowledge of the internal sense can account for the peculiarities
of the letter of Scripture, and that the Lord revealed the internal
sense for the specific purpose of saving good men from losing their
faith in the Word. It is therefore of supreme importance that we,
and our children as soon as they are old enough, study the internal
sense as well as the letter of the Word.

The Creation story is an outstanding example of this necessity.
Science makes it obvious that it cannot be literally true. Archae 
ology turns up similar stories in other ancient literatures. As Swe 
denborg says, men ask "How can this be Divine?" Yet the Creation
story is the foundation of the Word and the basis of all our under 
standing of the Lord's purpose in our creation and of the working
of His Divine providence in our lives. We are told through Sweden 
borg that the literal sense of the first eleven chapters is not history
in the sense in which- the rest of the Word is history: These eleven
chapters were copied by Moses from the Ancient Word-the Word
which existed before our Word and which was still in existence in
the time of Moses. All the stories of Creation, of the Garden of
Eden, and of the Flood found in literatures other than the Hebrew
had their source in this same account in the Ancient Word, but
they came down in the ..form of tradition and so are not in them 
selves verqally inspired". The Ancient Word was written in the
language of pure symbol, the language in which the people of the
Ancient Church thoUght and wrote. No one in that day misunder 
stood the Creation story or took it for an account of the creation
of the physical universe. There are quotations in other parts of our
Bible from other books of the Ancient Word, and some of these
books are mentioned by name (See Numbers 21:14-16,27-28;
Joshua 10:13; II Samuel 1:18). Swedenborg also tells us that the
book of Job-a book which has puzzled scholars because it has
the language characteristics of a very old Hebrew book and yet
manifests highly developed philosophical concepts-is "a book of
the Ancient Church," lacking an inner sense but written in the
"forms of expression in common use in the Ancient Church"
(Arcana Coelestia, n. 2682).

The Creation story, like the rest of the inspired Word, coming
down as it does from the Lord through the heavens, has within it
several levels of meaning. For us it is primarily the story of the
creation of a human soul. We may see it in its relation to our devel 
opment from infancy to adult life, or, as Swedenborg especially
interprets it in the Arcana, as the process of regeneration. In every
individual there are two natures: a higher or spiritual, and a lower
or natural-the heavens and the earth. So long as he remains,
whether innocently or willfully, in ignorance of spiritual things,
his soul is actually in darkness and undeveloped; but the Lord is
constantly seeking to awaken him. The first response is like the
coming of light, and after that he is able to see that some knowl 
edges relate to spiritual and others to natural things-the waters
above and below the firmament. All life is from the Lord, and man
does not begin really to live until he recognizes God and tries to
learn of Him. At first his knowledge of God is derived from others
and is like a diffused light in his mind, but as he begins to think
and act from the principle of doing what
in the Lord's
sight instead of what is pleasing to himself, living things begin to
appear in his soul and he comes to know from his own experience
what it is to love the Lord and to believe in Him and trust His
guidance-the sun, moon, and stars appear clearly in the sky. The
sun is love to the Lord shining in our states of clear understanding;
the moon is faith and trust showing us our way even when every 
thing seems dark and incomprehensible. The stars are all the knowl 
edges of spiritual things which, as we relate them to each other,
gradually form patterns in our minds and help to direct us. Living
thoughts and affections-the birds, fish, and animals-are then
possible, and one is formed into a true man, in the image and like 
ness of his Creator. Only then can one find rest and peace.

"And the evening and the morning were the first day." In this
lesson we are centering our thought on the first
four days of
Creation. The outstanding characteristic of this part of the story
is the appearance, effect, and increase of light. In the letter of the
inspired Word there is nothing accidental. In our natural activities
we think of a day as beginning with the morning and ending with
the evening, but when we stop to think, we may realize that from
morning to evening there is a decline-a decline in strength,
in
vitality, in mental keenness, in endurance-until we reach the point
when we must stop and wait for the renewal which comes with
sleep. In the writings of Swedenborg we are told that it is during
our periods of sleep that the Lord can do most for us, because
then our concentration on our own affairs and on the natural
world about us is in temporary abeyance, and our souls are open
to heavenly influences. This is why it is provided that children shall
have such long periods of sleep, and why sleep has such curative
value. The physical rebuilding is the least of the values of sleep.
If we are inclined to boast that we do not need so much sleep as
the average person, it is time for us to take serious thought as to
our spiritual state. Actually progress is from evening·to morning 
from a state of ignorance to one of understanding-and this is the
work of the Creator, not of ourselves. Day by day we must seek
continually to learn in order that we may progress.

=== From the Writings of Swedenborg
Arcana Coelestia, n. 22: ''What is meant by 'evening' and what by 'morning'
can now be discerned.
'Evening' means every preceding state, because it is
a state of shade, or of falsity and of no faith; 'morning' is every subsequent
state, being one of light, or of truth and of the knowledges of faith. 'Evening,'
in a general sense, signifies all things that are of man's own; but 'morning'
whatever is of the Lord, as is said through David: 'The spirit of Jehovah spake
in me, and His word was on my tongue; the God of Israel said, the Rock of
Israel spake to me; He is as the light of the morning, when the sun ariseth,
even a morning without clouds, when from brightness, from rain, the tender
herb springeth out of the earth' (II Samuel 23:2-4). As it is 'evening' when
there is no faith, and 'morning' when there is faith, therefore the coming of
the Lord into the world is called 'morning'; and the time when He comes,
because then there is no faith, is called 'evening' ... In like manner 'morning'
is used in the Word to denote every coming of the Lord; consequently it is
an expression of new creation."
Arcana Coelestia, n. 29 1
''When the 'earth,' or man, has been thus prepared
to receive celestial seeds from the Lord, and to produce something of what is
good and true, then the Lord fIrst causes some tender thing to spring forth,
which is called the 'tender herb'; then something more useful, which again
bears seeds in itself, and is called the 'herb yielding seed'; and at length some 
thing good which becomes fruitful, and is called the 'tree bearing fruit, whose
seed is in itself,' each according to its own kind. The man who is being regenerated is at first of such a quality that he supposes the good which he does,
and the truth which he speaks, to be from himself, when in reality all good
and all truth are from the Lord, so that whosoever supposes them to be from
himself has not as yet the life of true faith, which nevertheless he may after 
wards receive; for he cannot as yet believe that they are from the Lord,
because he is only in a state of preparation for the reception of the life of
faith. This state is here represented by things inanimate, and the succeeding
one of the life of faith, by animate things."
True Christian Religion, n.732
: "The laws of or~-::.· prescribed for man, are
that man should acquire for himself truths from the Word, and think of them
naturally, and so far as he can, rationally, and thus procure for himself natural
faith. The laws of order on the part of God then are, that He should approach,
fill the truths with His Divine Light, and thus fill with the Divine Essence
man's natural faith, which is only knowledge and persuasion. Thus, and not
otherwise, is saving faith produced."

== THE CREATION - THE FIFTH AND SIXTH DAYS
Genesis 1: 20-31

The natural introduction to this lesson is to talk about the Bible
as a whole-what it is and why we study it in Sunday school. With
all except
the Primary class, the children's knowledge on these
points should be tested first. Then give a very brief account of the
seven days and what happened on each before developing the work
of the fifth and sixth days.

Doctrinal Points

The Lord as the Creator of all things, the Source and beginning.
The distinction between the natural and the spiritual planes of the

mind.

The difference between man and the animals: Man is made to be

in the image and likeness of God.

The necessity of controlling our natural faculties and desires.

Notes for Parents

A very little thought will show us that the Bible is different from
every other book in the world. It was written by the hands of
many men over a period of more than fifteen hundred years and
yet we think of it as a book written for us. It has been translated
into over six hundred languages and dialects. Year after year it is
the "best seller" of all books in the world. These facts alone should
prove to us that the Bible was not the work of an y man or men,
but is truly the Word of God.

What should we expect of the Word of God? Should we expect
it to teach us things which we can find out for ourselves, things
about the natural world and about the outward history of men
and nations? No, God would tell us about Himself, about our
relation to Him, and about why He created us and what He wants
us to do. And this is the kind of knowledge that people have
always found in the Bible when they really looked for it. Wherever
it has gone it has changed the course of history and transformed
the lives of individuals.

But this meaning of the Bible is seldom found on the surface.
It is hidden within what seem to be mere stories of people and
events, just as we tell children stories which have a moral hidden
within them. For in the Lord's sight we are all children and have
to be given the truth in words we can understand.

So our task in Sunday School and in the home is to teach the
children the literal stories of the Bible and afterward, as they grow
older and are able to understand, to give them something of the
inner meaning of the stories.

Our lesson for today is again the first chapter of the Bible, the
story of creation. It is really a parable telling us how a man or
woman becomes a true human being, formed in the image and
likeness of God. For it is our possibility of knowing and serving
the Lord which makes us human and not merely higher animals.
We want our children to become true men and women. So we must
do all we can to lead them to know and understand the Word of
God.

Primary
Impress the children with the importance and holiness of the Bible as the
Lord's Word. Then speak of the Lord as the Creator of everything and every 
one and tell simply the story of the seven days, going into more detail with
the fifth and sixth. In telling the Creation story try to get the children to
think of the real difference between men and animals and the importance of
trying to be as much like the Lord as we can. This is a good lesson in which to
stress the fact that we ought to take care of all the good things that are given
us and use them as they are meant to be used.

that

You know, don't you,

the Lord Jesus is our Heavenly
Father? He made everything there is in the world. He made you
and me. And long, long ago, He made the very first people. But He
couldn't make them until He had made a world for them to live in.
So first He made the heaven and the earth. Then He made day and
night and then the dry land and the seas. Then He made grass grow
out of the earth and then the grain and the fruit trees. He made
the sun and the moon and the stars.

After that He made all kinds of fish to swim in the sea, and all
kinds of birds to fly in the air, and all kinds of animals to live on
the dry land. And finally He made men and women.

Why did everything else have to be created before men and women?
In whose image and likeness were men and women created?
This makes them very different from animals.
It means that they can study and reason, and can understand who the Lord is
and what He wants them to do.
All animals can know is what makes them comfortable and contented.
Everything in the world is made for some particular use.
What did the Lord say of everything when He had finished?

If you have a puppy, does he tell you what to do or do you tell
to do? When the Lord made men and women, He put
him what
them in charge of everything else in the world. So you see people
have to study and learn a great deal so that they may rule wisely.
We have to learn about the world and everything in it and we have
to learn just what everything is meant for. That is why we go to
school.

But there is something else we have to learn. The Lord gave us
everything we have that is good, and in the Bible He tells us what
He wants us to do with what we have so that we and everyone else
may be happy. So we need to study the Bible. That is why we go
to Sunday School.

Junior
This is the age group with which we need to begin to speak of the letter of
the Word as parable, while still teaching the details of the letter. In your intro 
duction point out that the teaching the Lord gives us in His Word is necessarily
spiritual-about Himself and our relation to Him-and not primarily about
the things in nature which we can fmd out for ourselves. Then in connection
with the Creation story call their attention to the way in which we develop
from the innocence and helplessness of infancy to adult life. In speaking of
the lesson proper suggest that the dominion we are told to exercise is over
OUr lower thoughts and desires.
This year let us first see how much we can tell about the Bible
as a whole:

By what other names do we call it?
Who is its Author?
Into what two main parts is it divided?
Through whom were the first five books given?
What did the Jews call these five books?
What is the first book called?
What does Genesis mean?
What does the first verse in the Bible tell us?
In how many stages or "days" did the Lord finish His creation?
What did He do on the seventh day?

In this lesson we are studying especially what is said about the
fifth and sixth days of creation. We should remember, however,
that on the first day heaven and earth were created and light was
given, on the second day the waters above the firmament were
divided from those below the firmament, on the third day the
waters were gathered together into seas and the dry land appeared
and was made to produce grass and herbs and fruit trees, and on
the fourth day the sun, moon, and stars appeared.

In this way the earth was prepared for habitation. You can easily
see that there had to be an earth before animals and people could
be created.

Why did the plants and trees have to be created before animals and men?
What were created on the fifth day?
What were created first on the sixth day?
What was the final creation?

Do you know that some people think that man is just a higher
kind of animal who developed somehow or other out of the lower
animals? This is not the teaching of the Word. The Word teaches
that the different forms of life on earth were created in a certain
order but not one out of another. Each kind of living being was
a separate creation and only man was created in the image and
likeness of God. And man was told to have dominion over all other
living things.

The things which distinguish men from the animals are the
ability to distinguish right from wrong and the ability to choose
what they will believe and do and be. Animals are governed by
their instincts and never can advance. Their bodies may develop
and change to meet changing conditions in their surroundings, but
they can never make changes themselves. And they can know only
about the things which affect their bodies-food and shelter and
warmth and protection are enough to satisfy them. A human being,
however, has higher thoughts and desires. He not only can under 
stand the earth and everything that belongs to it, but he can know
about God and heaven, because he is made in the image and like 
ness of God. So whenever a person refuses to think about God and
spiritual things and lives only for what he can get for himself out
of the world-food and clothing, possessions and pleasures-he is
reducing himself to a mere animal and cheating himself out of all
that belongs to him as a human being.

Notice in verse 27 that both men and women were created at
the same time. The familiar story in chapter 2 of the creation of
Eve out of the rib of Adam has led people to think that one man
was created first and then a wife was created for him and that all
people came from these two individuals. But the story of Adam
and Eve is a parable which teaches another lesson. When you are
it means. All of the Word is
older, you will understand what
parable-a story which has a deeper meaning within it-although
the greater part of the Word is also true history. Our chapter for
today has a very deep meaning within it which you will study
someday. But perhaps you will like to know that in the original
language, which is Hebrew, the word which in chapter 1 is trans 
lated man is the same word which later is translated Adam. Adam
simply means man, or mankind as a race. So when you see Adam
in chapter 2 and elsewhere, you can remember that it is not really
the name of a person at all. Mankind was created as a race. We have
no way of knowing just how many individuals were placed on the
earth by the Lord to begin with, but we do know that there were
both men and women.

The other lesson which we need particularly to draw from the
account of the fifth and sixth days of creation is that man was
created to have dominion over all the things of the earth. This
means, first,
that everything else was created for the service of
man, but it means more than this. A wise ruler does not use his
power selfishly. He tries to understand all the things over which he
has control, to know what they are for, and to cause them to work
together for the benefit of his whole kingdom. This is what we
should do with all the things of the earth which are given us to
use. We need not only to study hard to understand the things of
nature but to' study also what the Lord made each thing for so that
we may use it wisely. Perhaps we can understand this best if we
take our food as an example. Many good things have been created
by the Lord to nourish and strengthen our bodies so that we can
do our work in the world better, and they have been made pleasant
to our taste so that we will enjoy them. But suppose we like the
taste of some particular thing so much that we forget what it is
meant for and eat more of it than is good for us. Then we are
letting that particular food rule us instead of keeping it under our
control. Whenever you are tempted in this way, it will help if you
remember that we are told to "subdue" the earth.

Intermediate
This. age group should. be given in outline the correspondence of the Creation
story with particular emphasis on the fifth and sixth d.ays. The fact that each
of us has a higher and a lower nature should be stressed, and that it is the
higher nature which makes us human beings, so that the command to "have
dominion" is one we should always have in mind. At this age children begin
to feel that they should be allowed to make their own decisions and they
particularly need to be shown what is the true standard for their decisions.

In beginning our study of the Bible we need to remember several
things. First, it is the Word of God which we are studying, a series
of books dictated by the Lord to teach us the things about Him 
self and about our souls which we could not possibly find out in
any other way. Second, the Word is written in parable or story
form so that we may read it easily and keep it in our memories,
but its real meaning is in the spiritual lessons which are within the
letter. Third, the first eleven chapters of the Bible were from the
Ancient Word, which was written in symbol language; they are
pure symbol stories rather than history. From chapter 12 of Gen 
esis on, the Bible is for the most part truly historic as well as sym 
bolic. Fourth, we need to read the Bible every day throughout our
lives, because it brings us near to heaven and the Lord, and because
the spiritual lessons within it can be opened to us only as we read
its letter. You who are in the Intermediate class have reached the
age at which you can begin to understand the general meaning
within the stories you learn.

The story of creation given in the first chapter of Genesis has
a great deal of truth in its letter. The Lord did create this earth
and everything on it, and He created it by an orderly process of
which the six days give us a good idea. When your grandmother
says, "In my day we weren't allowed to do so and so," you know
that she is not talking about any single day but about a certain
period which was different from our modern "day." Each "day"
in the Creation story was a long period of time. The earth had to
be formed and brought into a certain order before any life could
be created upon it. The dry land had to be established before
plants could grow or animals could live. The seas had to be gath 
ered together before there could be fish. And both plants and
animals had to be created before man could live. This was the
necessary and true order of the natural creation.

But we are men and women not because we have bodies but
because we have souls, and in its inner meaning the story of cre 
ation is the story of how a human soul is formed, from its begin 
ning, when it has both heavenly and earthly possibilities (verse 1)
but no knowledge or understanding even of earthly things (verse 2)
through the gradual dawning of understanding (verse 3) to the
beginning of the formation of character (verses 6-13) and the
beginning of the knowledge and love of God (verses 14-19).

It is only then that really living things can be produced in our
lives, because all life comes from the Lord. You know that when
you were little, you learned a great many things-how to eat, how
to walk, how to talk, how to play, and finally how to study-and
also you learned a great many things about how to please your
parents and how to avoid the things for which you would be
punished, but usually you did not really understand why one thing
was good and another bad. But now you have reached the age
when you begin to understand that it is the Lord's plan and order
which determine what is good and that the most important thing
in the world is to learn what the Lord wants us to do and then to
do it. In other words the sun, moon, and stars-love for the Lord,
belief in Him, and knowledge about Him-have appeared in your
sky and you are ready to make real decisions on the basis of what
you learn about the Lord. From now on you should try to think
not, "What will bring me reward and what punishment?" but,
"What is really right in the Lord's sight?" This is a time of very
important change in your life and you need to know how to go
about it.

And it is just this which is taught us in the story of the fifth and
sixth days of creation. You probably remember from prior lessons
that water "corresponds" to truth. This is because water was cre 
ated by the Lord to perform the same services for the body that
truth performs for the soul. The seas are water gathered together
in quantity, and they picture truth gathered in the memory. Each
of you already has a "sea" of memory. Now that you are trying
more and more to think for -yourself about right and wrong, things
begin to come to life in your memory. The first living creatures
produced were the fish in the seas. Do you remember that the frrst
Apostles called by the Lord when He was on earth were fishermen?
The next things created were the birds. When you really want
to know what you ought to do, and search your memory until you
fmd some bit of knowledge that comes to life for your need, all
so~s of thoughts begin to fly around in your mind. These are the
birds.

Then the next step is the desire to do the thing you have
decided is right. Animals correspond to our affections or desires,
and the animals created by the Lord in our story are all good and
useful desires.

When such good desires have been developed in our hearts, we
are ready to be men and women in the true sense. For the thing
which distinguishes man from all other created things is his ability
to know and love the Lord and to choose freely to do what the
Lord shows him is right. All other things are governed by the fixed
laws of nature and by inborn instinct, but man is created in the
image and likeness of God with the power to learn, to reason, and
to act of his own free will.

We learn from our chapter that man was created as a race, both
men and women. And we learn that mankind was given dominion
over the earth and told to "subdue" it. This means that if we want
to be true men and women, we must keep our bodies and all the
things that belong to them under control. We must not let our
appetites control us. You remember that in each of us at the very
there are "the heaven and the earth." Our "earth" is our
start
bodies and all the thoughts and desires connected with them. Our
"heaven" is the spiritual part of us which can know the Lord and
serve Him, the part of us which we must develop if we are ever to
live in heaven or even if we are to be truly happy in this world.
We cannot develop this "heaven" in our souls unless we learn to
subdue our "earth." Remember this when you are tempted to do
wrong for the sake of getting something you want.

Basic Correspondences

day = any period of activity
fish = affections for memory knowledges

Senior
The nature of the Word and the nature of man are the essential lessons for the
young people. If you can lead them to see that a person who lives for worh;ily
satisfactions is cheating himself out of his birthright, you will have given them
a valuable piece of spiritual armor. They also need to be shown the difference
between deeds done with self in mind and deeds done in the spirit of unselfish
service.
We begin our study of the Bible with the story of creation, and
this is as it should be. For not only does all the rest of the Bible
story depend upon this beginning, but unless we understand how
and why man was created, our lives are aimless and without mean 
mg.

In this lesson we consider especially the verses which describe
the fifth and sixth days of creation,
in which the fishes, birds,
animals, and finally man appear. In the New Church we know
that, while material creation did in general proceed in the order
described in this chapter,
the creation really treated of is the
creation of a human soul into its intended form, the image and
likeness of God.

For man is not merely, as some people choose to think,
the
highest of the animals. The animals are altogether of the earth.
They have no thought or desire beyond the satisfaction of their
physical wants. Man also has his physical nature and as long as he
is in this world must spend much time in maintaining it, but even
while he is in this world, his thoughts and affections may rise
above the things of the body and the world. He has from birth
a spiritual nature as well as a physical nature, and this spiritual
nature must be developed and nourished if he is to become truly
a man. Anyone who lives only for the satisfaction of his bodily
and worldly cravings is living like an animal and not like a man.
When we are born, we have in us both spiritual and natural
potentialities-"heaven" and "earth"-but both arc without form
and void and we are in the darkness of complete ignorance. Very
early in our childhood, however, we begin to have some under 
standing-the light dawns in the mind. We begin to be conscious of
ourselves as individuals, to gather knowledges into our memory, as
the waters were gathered into the seas, and to distinguish between
higher and lower kinds of knowledge. Our character is forming and
we put forth the first little shoots of independent thought and do
our first little deeds of kindness. But in the beginning we think of
these thoughts and deeds as our own and are proud of ourselves
for them. Swedenborg says that many people never get beyondthis third "day" in their spiritual development.

The fourth day-which was the particular subject of our study
in the preceding lesson-marks a great change, for the appearance
of the sun, moon, and stars pictures a turning from self to the
Lord, when we really see that all life and goodness and truth are
from Him and nothing from ourselves. Then for the first
time
we are able to produce genuinely living thoughts and deeds, for
nothing lives except from the Lord's presence in it. This is not so
hard to understand as it may seem. Suppose we were to receive
identical gifts from two different persons. One in giving his gift
makes it clear that he thinks it is very good of him to give it and
that he will expect us to be properly grateful and to do as much
for him someday. The other gives his gift in such a way that we
feel that he is not thinking of himself at all, but is happy in being
able to make us happy. In the first gift there is no real goodness
because there is only self-praise behind it. The second is full of
unselfish love, which is the Lord's love expressing itself through
the giver.

This new life develops in a certain order. On the fifth day the
fish were created in the sea and then the birds in the air. We cannot
produce anything without knowledge. We know that this is true of
material things: we have to learn how to do a thing before we can
do it. But we sometimes forget that this is just as true of our spiri 
tual development. Unless we fill our memories with knowledge
from the Word, we cannot progress in goodness. The faculty of
knowing what is right lives in our "sea" of stored-up knowledge.
You remember that the first Apostles were fishermen. Our knowl 
edges must "come alive" with the realization that they are meant
to serve the Lord. Then our thoughts, like the birds, begin to rise
above the earth into the higher regions of our minds. Learning to
do the Lord's will, to be true men and women, is a challenge to
our highest powers.

The animals picture our affections. We have two basic mental
the will and the understanding. Only when they act
faculties,
together do they accomplish anything. Sometimes we like to thinkabout noble deeds but go no further than the thinking. Our will is
not involved. The affections, which the animals represent, belong
to our will. When they are aroused to carry out our knowledge and
thought about right living, we become true human beings.

There is one further lesson we need to learn from this part of
the chapter. After we have become true spiritual men and women,
serving the Lord as we are meant to do, we must keep order in our
lives. Man was told to have dominion over everything else on earth,
to replenish the earth and subdue it. It is very easy to become self 
satisfied and lazy spiritually and to imagine we can make no mis 
takes once we have become "good" people. But this in itself is
a grave mistake. Read what the Lord said to the people through
Moses in Deuteronomy 6: 10-12. We never reach the state in which
we do not need to be on our guard against letting worldly and
selfish thoughts and desires control us.

Cover the lesson briefly, pointing out the various levels of meaning in the
story. Then discuss the nature of a true man as an image of God, the differ 
ence between natural goodness and spiritual goodness, the necessity of con 
tinually adding knowledges to our memory, and the method by which they
are brought to life and made means of producing genuine goodness.

In paragraph 4 of the Arcana Coelestia we read: "The first chap 
ter of Genesis in the internal sense treats in general of the new
creation of man, or of his regeneration, and specifically of the
Most Ancient Church; and this in such a manner that there is not
the least expression which does not represent, signify, and enfold
within it these things." Of the first verse we are told that "heaven"
signifies the internal man; and "earth" the external man before
regeneration. "

In general this first chapter of the Bible describes truly the order
of rna terial creation. It is strange that the use of the word day has
caused so many to believe that it is contrary to the findings of
science, when we ourselves are quite in the habit of using day toexpress any general period of time: "in that day," "in the day of
the cave dwellers," etc.

In the New Church we are also familiar with the thought that
the development of every individual from infancy to maturity is
pictured in this chapter and also the development of the first
created human race from their primitive state of ignorance into
a true church, the first or Most Ancient Church on earth. But we
do not so often think of it in terms of the change which takes
place in an adult of our own day as he passes from an unregenerate
to a regenerate state. Yet it is true that every individual who has
not come to recognize the Lord and brought his life into order
according to the Lord's commandments from a desire to serve the
Lord is as yet a mere potential man. However learned and cultured
he may be, his mind is "without form and void" and the darkness
of ignorance obscures the deeper possibilities of his nature. He is
not truly a man. For man is man from being formed into the image
and likeness of God.

This change of man from his natural state into his true form is
called regeneration, or rebirth, and it is a gradual process. In some
churches it is believed that a person is "saved" by a single religious
experience called "conversion," but this is not the New Church
belief. Conversion is necessary, but it may perhaps be likened to
the coming of light on the first day and is only a beginning. In
AC 6-13 Swedenborg sums up briefly the meaning of the six days
of creation in their application to the process of regeneration, and
concludes: "Those who are being regenerated do not all arrive at
this [sixth] state. The greatest part, at
this day, attain only the
first state; some only the second; others the third; fourth, or fifth;
few the sixth; and scarcely anyone the seventh."

In the first lesson of this course we took up all seven stages in
a brief general way. In the second we centered our lesson on the
work of the fourth day. of this Swedenborg says: "The fourth
state is when man becomes affected with love, and illuminated by
faith. He indeed previously discoursed piously, and brought forth
goods, but he did so in consequence of the temptations and straitness under which he labored, and not from faith and charity;
wherefore faith and charity are now enkindled in his internal man,
and are called two 'luminaries'" (AC 10). In this lesson we shall
consider a little more fully the meaning of what took place on the
fifth and sixth days.

Swedenborg says (AC 11): "The fifth state is when the man
discourses from faith, and thereby confirms himself in truth and
good; the things ,then produced by him are animate, and are called
the 'fish of the sea,' and the 'birds of the heavens.' " Until true love
and faith (the sun and moon) make their appearance in a person's
life, he believes that the truth he thinks and the good he does are
from himself, and at this stage his grasp of truth and level of good 
ness are not really "living" and are pictured by the "grass, the herb
yielding seed after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit" (Genesis
1:11), but when he comes to acknowledge that all truth and good
are from the Lord alone, the living creatures of the water, air, and
earth appear. These are created in order. We may recall that seas
picture knowledges gathered together in the memory, and that fish
are memory knowledges "which belong to the external man" (AC
40). What then is the difference between the seas and the fish?
All knowledge comes to us first by an external way. Our minds are
full of knowledges which we have gathered throughout our lives.
But there is no life in these knowledges until we begin to draw
them forth for the service of the Lord. Mere worldly and even
intellectual use of them does not make them "fish." This is the
lesson taught in John 21: 3-6, where the net cast by the fishermen
on the left side of the ship-the side of the intellect alone-drew
in no fish, but when at the Lord's bidding it was cast on the right
side-the side of the will or affection-"they were not able to draw
it for the multitude of fishes." We must have the necessary mem 
ory-knowledges before we can make any spiritual progress, but it
is the will to serve the Lord which gives them life.

AC 40 goes on to tell us that "birds" generally signify rational
and intellectual things, "of which the latt~r belong to the internal
man." Once we have a desire to serve the Lord we draw know
edges from our memory to implement the desire. The next step is
thought about them, rising to a higher level than mere worldly or
temporal uses. So on the fifth day "man discourses from faith,
and thereby confirms himself in truth and good."

The final stage, the sixth day, is described in AC 12 as follows:
"The sixth state is when, from faith, and thence from love, he
speaks what is true, and does what is good: the things which he
then brings forth are called the 'living soul' and the 'beast.' And as
he then begins to act at once and together from both faith and
love, he becomes a spiritual man, who is called an 'image.' His
spiritual life is delighted and sustained by such things as belong to
the knowledges of faith, and to works of charity, which are called
his 'food,' and his natural life is delighted and sustained by those
which belong to the body and the senses; whence a combat arises,
until love gains the dominion, and he becomes a celestial man."
In AC 45 we read that "beasts are of two kinds; the evil, so called
because they are hurtful; and the good, which are harmless. Evils
in man are signified by evil beasts, as by bears, wolves, dogs; and
the things which are good and gentle, by beasts of a like nature, as
by heifers, sheep, and lambs. The 'beasts' here referred to are good
and gentle ones, and thus signify affections, because it here treats
of those who are being regenerated."

From this, we learn that in the process of regeneration genuinely
good affections are developed last of all. The writings throughout
make a clear distinction between "natural good" and "spiritual
good." We all inherit from our natural parents good as well as evil
tendencies, but even the good tendencies we inherit are full of self.
They are not spiritual or living. The Lord uses them as first means
toward our reformation, but they are really the opposite of genu 
ine good. We cannot trust our natural good intentions to produce
either knowledge of what we ought to do or good works. Even on
the sixth day, as we note in Swedenborg's explanation, "a combat
arises, until
love gains the dominion." The man created in the
image of God had work to do. He was to be fruitful, and multiply,
and replenish the earth, and subdue it." We never in this world
reach a state in which acquiring new knowledge from the Lord
and overcoming our evils become unnecessary.

From the Writings of Swedenborg
Arcana Coelestia, nn.44-45: "Man, like the earth, can produce nothing of
good unless the knowledges of faith are flrst sown in him, whereby he may
know what is to be believed and done. It is the office of the understanding
to hear the Word, and of the will to do it. To hear the Word and not to do it,
is like saying that we believe when we do not live according to our belief;
in which case we separate hearing and doing, and thus have a divided mind,
and become of those whom the Lord calls 'foolish' in the following passage:
'Whosoever heareth my words, and doeth them, I will liken unto a wise man
who built his house upon a rock: but everyone that heareth my words, and
doeth them not, I liken to a foolish man, who built his house upon the sand'
(Matthew 7:24,26). The things that belong to the understanding are signi 
fied-as before shown-by the 'creeping-things which the waters bring forth,'
and also by the 'fowl upon the earth,' and upon the faces of the expanse;
but those which are of the will are signified here by the 'living soul which the
earth produces,' and by the 'beast' and 'creeping thing,' and also -by the 'wild
animal of that earth.'

== THE CREATION-THE SEVENTH DAY
Genesis 2: 1-7

The lesson in all the classes should begin with some brief dis 
cussion of the nature and purpose of the Bible, followed by em 
phasis on its first book and on its first verse, and then a very brief
review of the first six days of creation. The notes for the various
age groups will suggest the level at which this review should be
carried in each class. Not more than half the lesson time should
be used for this introductory work.

=== Doctrinal Points
The first

thing we should know about the Lord is that He is the

Creator of all things.

The Word begins with the development of man. Regeneration is

a gradual process and follows a certain order.

It is the higher plane of the mind-the ability to know God-which

distinguishes man from the animals.

The sabbath state of rest is attained only through learning the

Lord's truth and obeying it.

=== Notes for Parents

As we have observed before, Genesis means the beginning, and
the first words we read in the Bible are, "In the beginning God."
God is the beginning of everything. Nothing in the world created
itself. And in the very last chapter of the Bible we read, "I am
Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, the first and the
last." The Bible was written through many men over a period of
hundreds of years, but it is one book by one Author. The Lord
is the beginning and the end of it.

The story of creation is a wonderful allegory or parable given us
by the Lord to teach us how we are developed, once "light" dawns
in our minds. We begin in ignorance-"without form and void"-
and pass through the long processes of learning and living the truth
as the Lord gives it to us, receiving ever more and more of His
spirit, until finally, if we are faithful, we come into that happy
state when we trust and obey Him gladly. Then, when our selfish
and worldly desires have been overcome, we no longer have to
struggle with temptations. This is the rest of the sabbath.

The weekly day of rest was ordained by the Lord because we
need it. Our bodies and our minds need regular rest and change,
but our souls need it even more. If we make Sunday merely a day
of idle self-indulgence, our selfish feelings and thoughts-which
cause all our troubles-are just as active then as on any other day.
There is only one place where our souls can find rest, and that is
in the Lord. When the Lord was in the world, He gave us the
perfect example of how to live, and He taught us by His own acts
how we ought to spend the sabbath day. Luke (4:16) tells us that
"as his custom was, he went into the synagogue on the sabbath
day." He taught and healed on the sabbath. He walked through
the fields with His disciples and ate with them. And in Matthew
12: 12 He gives us one simple rule: "It is lawful to do good on the
sabbath." Let us make Sunday the day when we especially try to
"do good," worshiping the Lord, learning from Him, and trying
to forget ourselves and make those about us happy. Then we shall
soon learn why the Lord in the beginning "blessed the seventh day,
and sanctified it."

=== Primary
The lesson should always be read before the children are allowed to begin any
handwork. Then, as the children work, the teacher may repeat and emphasize
any points desired. Stress the fact that happiness comes only from the Lord,
and that He can give it to us only as we try to make others happy.

Do you know what book we read and study in Sunday School?
It is the Holy Bible. It is also called the Word of God, because in it
God speaks to us and tells us about Himself and about heaven and
about how we should live so that He will be able to make us happy
always. So the Bible is the most wonderful book in the world.
It is divided into a great many shorter books which we shall study
one after another, but in all of them the Lord tells us in interesting
stories the things He wants us to know.

The first book in the Bible is called Genesis. Genesis means
the beginning, and it starts with the story of the beginning of the
world. Let us read the first five verses of the first chapter.

Then we are told how the Lord went on creating or making
everything. On the second day He separated the earth and the
heaven by dividing the waters above from the waters below. On
the third day He gathered the lower waters into seas and brought
forth grass and herbs and fruit trees on the earth. On the fourth
day the sun, moon, and stars appeared. On the fifth day the fish
and birds were createa, and on the sixth day the animals and men
and women were created. Now let us go on with our reading.
[Read Genesis 2: 1-7.]
What did the Lord do on the seventh day?
Verse 3 of chapter 2 tells us why every seventh day is set apart as a day
of rest. Blessed means made happy, and sanctified means made holy.
None of us does just the same things on Sunday as on weekdays.
But some people do not use Sunday as it is meant to be used.
It should be a happy day but it should also be a holy day.
We should use part of it to learn about the Lord and to worship Him.
And we should use all of it in ways which will make us better-more nearly
likenesses of the Lord.

=== Junior
The Juniors are old enough to have met and to know the answer to the prob 
lem of Saturday or Sunday as the true sabbath. The greater part of the lesson
period, however, should be given to a discussion of the right use of the sab 
bath. Have them look up the Bible references in their notes.

By what other names do we call the Bible?
Who is its Author?
Why do we study it?
Into what two parts-is it divided?
What is the fIrst book in the Bible?
Why is it called Genesis?
In how many days or periods was the earth created?
On what day were the sun, moon, and stars created?
What was the final creation?
How does man differ from the animals?
Over what was he given dominion?
What did the Lord do on the seventh day?

You know that no one can work day in and day out without
resting. We have to have our rest and sleep every night, but even
this is not enough. Once in a while we need a "break," a change
from our usual activities. Otherwise we lose all pleasure in our
work; our bodies wear out and our minds grow dull. Our bodies
need the regular day of change; our minds need it; and above all
our souls need it. The Lord Himself, as we learn in our lesson for
today, ordained that every seventh day should be set apart as a day
of rest, and the Lord knows what is best for the creatures He has
made.

You probably all know people who think they are not obeying
this command of the Lord unless they set apart Saturday, which
happens to be the seventh day of our calendar week. But we may
remember that our calendar did not come into existence for thou 
sands of years after the Lord gave the first people this law; so the
law has nothing to do with our calendar week. It prescribes six
days of work and then a holy day of rest. The word sabbath means
rest. The Jews observed and still observe Saturday as their sabbath,
but the early Christians chose Sunday, the first day of the calendar
week, because it was "the Lord's Day," the day on which the Lord
arose from the dead.

All of you have probably had some arguments with your parents
as to what you should and should not do on Sunday. This is partly
because people's ideas differ as to what is fitting conduct for the
day which the Lord has sanctified. Sanctified means "made holy."
We learn from the New Testament that the Lord, when He was
on earth, disagreed with the Pharisees as to what it was right to do
on the sabbath day, and He pointed out to them that He was Lord
of the sabbath day.

Since we are all trying to follow the Lord's example, there aresome things which we may know should be done on Sunday. We
should go to church and Sunday School. Look up Luke 4: 16. And
we should do all we can to be helpful to others on Sunday, for the
Lord performed many miracles of healing on the sabbath. His
example also shows us that it is right for us to walk and talk with
our friends and to eat with them on Sunday. Read Matthew 12:1-8.
In Matthew 12: 12 the Lord gives us a general law which we
should learn and always keep in mind on Sunday: "It is lawful
to do good on the sabbath." Our souls need this day of rest-rest
from the selfish struggle to get what we want. One of the things
this may mean for you is that on Sunday more than on any other
day you should be obedient and try to make your parents happy.
You will find that this will make you happier, too, as the day goes
on, for all real happiness comes from unselfishness. If our hearts
are filled up with ourselves and what we want, they are closed to
the Lord, and it is the Lord's love flowing into our hearts which
can make us happy. Sunday should be a day when our hearts and
minds are open to the Lord and eager to learn and do His will.
If on Sunday we go to church and Sunday School, enjoy the com 
pany of our family and friends, and try to think of things to do
which will make those about us happy, we shall be too busy and
too happy ourselves to worry about the things we are not allowed
to do.

=== Intermediate

In this lesson our discussion of the spiritual sense has been general and we
have suggested no additions to the basic correspondences for this class. In 
the meaning of the terms natural, spiritual, and celestial should be
stead,
stressed as a basis for later lessons. The progression may be illustrated by
citing the formation of any good habit-from the ftrst natural resistance,
through enforced practice, to the time when the good habit has become in 
voluntary. So far as this particular good thing is concerned you have reached
the celestial state or sabbath rest. The Intermediates are still young enough
to need also the teaching concerning the proper use of Sunday.

In the literal Creation story the essential things to remember are
that God created all things and that He created them gradually
according to a certain order; that heaven and earth were the first
creations and that the giving of light led to all that followed; that
although grass and fruit trees began to appear as soon as the waters
were gathered into seas leaving the dry land, it was not until after
the appearance of the sun, moon, and stars that living creatures
were created; that the order of the creation of living creatures was
fish, birds, animals, and finally men and women; that man differed
from the animals in that he was created in the image and likeness
of God; and that man was given dominion over all the earth and
its creatures.

In the spiritual sense we need to remember that this story of
creation tells us how the first men and women were developed
into a church, and also how anyone of us from being wholly
n3.tural and worldly may become spiritual and heavenly, a true
human being, formed in the image and likeness of God.

Today's lesson takes us to the final step in this story-the sev 
enth day. In the literal sense we have, in the first three verses of
the second chapter of Genesis,
the account of the ordination of
the sabbath as a holy day of rest, coming every seventh day. There
is a very obvious lesson for us in the letter. The Lord knows the
needs of the people He has created, and if He tells us to observe
every seventh day as a day of rest, it is because we need it. Also if
it is said that the Lord "blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it,"
we know that it is to be not only a day of rest but a holy day.
When the Lord was in the world, He gave us a clear example of
how to use the sabbath day. He went regularly to the synagogue
on that day; He taught and healed on that day; and He walked
through the fields with His disciples and ate with them. That is,
Sunday should be a day when we go to church and Sunday School,
do all we can to be helpful to others, and enjoy the company of
our family and friends. Sunday should be a day when we try to
put our selfish thoughts and feelings aside, learn about the Lord
and worship Him, and practice making other people happy. If we
do this, we shall find ourselves also happy on Sunday. Rememberthat blessed means happy. The Lord gave the Pharisees a simple
rule for the observance of the sabbath which we should learn and
remember. He said (Matthew 12: 12): "It is lawful to do good on
the sabbath."

When we come to the spiritual sense of our lesson, we find that
the seventh day pictures the final creation of the first people into
a "celestial" church, and the final celestial state which it is possible
for anyone of us to attain if he is faithful in trying to learn the
Lord's truth and obey it. In the spiritual sense the rest of the
sabbath day is not rest from work but rest from fear and worry
and from the struggle with temptation. We reach this state of rest
only when we come to trust the Lord wholly and to love to do
His will, that is, when we come really to love the Lord. We need
to know what are meant by the terms celestial and spiritual, for
we shall be using them often. Celestial means a state in which we
do right spontaneously from love to the Lord. Spiritual means a
state in which we do right from love to the neighbor in accordance
with the truths we have learned from the Word.

What we must especially remember from our study of the
Creation story is that we are not born celestial or spiritual, but
natural, and that we cannot become celestial without first becom 
ing spiritual.

We all like to think that if we "mean well," what we do will be
right, or at least that when we do things which actually hurt other
people, we should be forgiven because we meant well. We need to
see that our natural good intentions are not a sufficient guide for
our conduct, but that we must constantly ble studying the Word
to find out what the Lord says is right and to correct our own
ideas accordingly. We are all born natural; that is, our feelings and
ideas are centered about what we see and experience in this world.
If we study the Word and correct our ideas and feelings according
to the truths we learn there, the Lord can regenerate us and make
us spiritual. And if we are faithful in this effort to the very end of
our life in this world, the Lord can fill our hearts with His own
love so that we shall become celestial. Then there is no longer any
struggle between what we "naturally" want to do and what we
know we ought to do, because we have come to love to do what
we ought to do. This is the rest of the sabbath.

The Creation story is summed up for us in the last four verses of
our lesson, beginning again with the Lord's creation of the heavens
and the earth-the heavenly and the earthly things in our souls 
and ending with man's becoming a "living soul" -full from inmost
to outmost with life from the Lord.

=== Senior
The emphasis with this class should be on the importance of continued effort
to learn and do the Lord's will, the lifelong repetition of the six days of cre 
ation and the sabbath of rest. They also need the lesson on the purpose and
use of the sabbath day.

Our lesson for today is centered on the completion of the Cre 
ation story, which is summed up for us in Genesis 2: 4 -7. The
heavens and the earth picture our spiritual and our natural faculties
and the six days of creation the process by which, if we develop
as we should, our natural faculties are educated and brought into
orderly subjection to the spiritual-which is the process of regen 
eration. Verse 7 is a still briefer summary. The Lord forms man of
the "dust of the ground" when our natural faculties are developed;
He "breathes into his nostrils the breath of life" when knowledge
of Him and faith in Him are acquired; and man becomes a "living
soul" when his external life becomes an expression of love to the
Lord.

The Creation story also pictures the development of the first

people into a true "church," the Most Ancient Church.

The rest of the seventh day pictures the final stage 0 f the pro 
cess in both these meanings.
I t is the attainment of the celestial
degree, when there is no longer any sense of labor or conflict
because right action has become happy and spontaneous through
the inflowing love of the Lord. The Most Ancient Church was a
celestial church. Its people were in love to the Lord, and so could
be given a perception of the truth. We know that they afterwarddeclined from this state and that the perception had to be taken
away when their will became perverted. Men on earth have never
since lived in the celestial state. It
the high ideal
toward which we should strive and one which we may attain in
the end if we are sufficiently faithful here.

is, however,

We may see in our own experience small examples of the process
of becoming celestial. We have all acq uired at least some good
habits, habits which are so much a part of us now that we may
forget that they had to be acquired. But in each case our original
natural tendency was contrary. We first had to be taught what was
right. Usually, for some time we had to be forced to do it until
we came to see that it really was right. Then we forced ourselves
to do it until our natural resistance gradually disappeared and the
right action became "second nature." So far as that particular
thing was concerned we had reached the sabbath of rest, the cel 
estial state.

This process must go on little by little all our lives: six days of
labor before the sabbath of rest. Isaiah writes (28:10): "For pre 
cept must be upon precept, precept upon precept: line upon line,
line upon line: here a little, and there a little." We all like to
imagine that, since in general we mean well, something inside us
will always tell us what is right. You will hear people say, "What
a man thinks is right is right for him." This is an attempt to jump
from the first day to the seventh without any of the labor of the
intervening days-and it just can't be done. We really know this.
If we are honest with ourselves, we- know we have made many
mistakes which we might have avoided if we had been willing to
study and think and correct our own judgment by the teachings
of the Word of God.

The sabbath of rest comes from the Lord.

is not, either
literally or spiritually, a day of idle loafing. It is a day and a state
in which selfish thoughts and desires and strivings are put aside
and we give ourselves wholeheartedly to the service of the Lord
and the neighbor. It is natural that we should grow up thinking of
Sunday in terms of what we must not do on that day. The rule of life is "Cease to do evil; learn to do well." But it is not the ceasing
from evil which makes the sabbath blessed and sanctified; it is the
learning to do well.

The Pharisees, you may remember, had made the sabbath a hard
day with their many prohibitions, and the Lord brushed away
these prohibitions with the simple statement, "It is lawful to do
good on the sabbath." The sabbath state is a positive, not a nega 
tive one. Doing good means active effort to learn about the Lord,
to worship Him, and to engage in such works as will make others
happy and ourselves nearer to the ideal given us by the Lord. Such
a use of our Sundays may not seem easy or happy to us at first,
but practice in this, more pe·rhaps than in any other good habit,
will bring great reward.

Adult
After the introductory statement concerning the Bible, and the brief review
of chapter 1, the teacher should touch on the meaning of the seventh day in
the internal historical sense and in the spiritual sense, and then go on to a dis 
cussion of the use of the sabbath. It may be well to mention the reason why
we observe Sunday-instead of Saturday (see Junior notes) especially if there
are young adults in the class. The rest of the discussion may well be based on
the Lord's use of the sabbath, and the teacher should be familiar with the
Gospel passages cited in the Junior notes and with their context.

Every time we reread the story of creation, with which our Bible
begins, we are more impressed with its scope and importance.
From the letter alone we receive the fundamental teachings that
everything with which we are familiar was created by the Lord,
that there is a Divine order in the universe, that man is not merely
a higher animal but a creature with heavenly possibilities, that man
has the responsibility of controlling and using rightly all the lower
forms of creation, and that the ideal state to which he should look
forward is one of heavenly peace and happiness. In the Creation
story nothing appears which is not good and useful. "And God
saw everything that he had made, and, behold, it was very good."
The Lord is the Source of all good and nothing but good proceedsfrom Him.

When we read this story with a knowledge of its spiritual sense,
it is still more impressive. Everything that is in man's soul appears
here in its original orderly form. Throughout it is the story of the
formation of man-as a race and as an individual-into the image
and likeness of God, his highest possible attainment.

In the three previous lessons we have considered the first six
days of creation in some detail, and we now center our attention
on the seventh day.

Limiting our thought for the moment to the letter, we rightly
think of Genesis 2: 2-3 as the Divine institution of the sabbath day.
The commandment regarding the sabbath given through Moses
from Sinai was not a new commandment. The sabbath was a part
of the order of the Most Ancient Church. The Lord, who made
man, knew man's needs. Even physically we need one day out of
seven of rest and change from our regular work. Our minds need
this same rest and change. And above all spiritually we need one
day in seven in which we may lift our thoughts above our worldly
concerns and renew our inner strength through worship, instruc 
tion, and meditation.

In this simple statement of the Divine ordination of the sabbath
there is nothing harsh-nothing suggestive of prohibition: "And
God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that in it
he had rested from all his work which God created and made."
If we developed in an orderly way as children of our Heavenly
Father, we should have no problems concerning the sabbath. We
should, as Isaiah suggests (58: 13), "call the sabbath a delight." The
reason why the breaking and profaning of the sabbath is connected
with such severe denunciation later in the Word is that men de 
parted from their true order and that without the regular observ 
ance of the sabbath men become immersed in worldliness and
selfishness,
lose their touch with God, and die spiritually. Our
Puritan forefathers were mistaken in making the sabbath a hard
and burdensome day, just as the Pharisees were mistaken in adding
their own interpretations to the simple law. We recall how many
times in the Gospel story the Pharisees accused the Lord of break 
ing the sabbath and how He told them that He Himself was Lord
of the sabbath. He gave us our example specifically in attending
the synagogue on the sabbath day, teaching, healing, and walking
with his disciples, and He summed up the law in the simple state 
ment (Matthew 12: 12): "It is lawful to do good on the sabbath."
Turning to the inner meaning of our lesson, we find this in AC
83, 84: "The 'heavens and earth and all the army of them' are said
to be 'finished,' when man has become the 'sixth day,' for then
faith and love make a one. When they do this, love, and not faith,
or in other words the celestial principle, and not the spiritual,
begins to be the principal, and this is to be a celestial man....
The celestial man is the 'seventh day,' which, as the Lord has
worked during the six days, is called 'His work'; and as all combat
then ceases, the Lord is said to 'rest from all His work.' "

The Most Ancient C}mrch, whose development is described in
the internal historical sense of our lesson, was a celestial church,
in which love to the Lord ruled in the heart and truth could be
given by perception-in an internal rather than in an external way.
We forget sometimes that this first church had to be developed 
that even the first men had to grow into it through the various
stages pictured in the Creation story, and had to become spiritual
men before they became celestial.

In its application to our own regeneration this is also true.
Although it is certainly possible for us, if we are faithful, to attain
the celestial degree, we do not attain it before the end of our life
in this world. But we all may have foretastes of it. For example,
whenever we recognize a particular evil in ourselves, fight it with
the Lord's help, and reach the point where it no longer has any
appeal for us, we have-with regard to that particular evil-reached
the sabbath of rest. But as long as we are in this world there are
always further evils in us to recognize and fight. And we recognize
and fight these only if we are constantly trying to learn new truth
from the Word. In this world we never reach a state in which the
knowledge of what is right comes to us by an internal way. Thewntmgs are very clear on this point. Our conscience is never a
perfect guide. It must be continually corrected, educated, and
developed throughout our lives here. Without this process we make
no spiritual progress and never attain the true sabbath of rest.

This rest of the sabbath is not idleness. It is rest from struggle
with temptation. It is said that the Lord blessed and sanctified the
seventh day, that is, pronounced it happy and holy. We know that
happiness comes only from forgetting self, and that only as we
learn about the Lord and seek to serve Him and the neighbor is it
possible for us to make a place in our hearts for the influx of His
unselfish love. If we regularly use the sabbath for worship, instruc 
tion, and unselfish service, we shall find it our best aid in attaining
the celestial state of rest. Let us use it to "do good" and make it
a happy and a holy day.

From, the Writings of Swedenborg

Arcana Coelestia, nn.82-83: "And the heavens and the earth were finished,
and all the army of them. By these words is meant that man is now rendered
so far spiritual as to have become the 'sixth day'; 'heaven' is his internal man,
and 'earth' his external; 'the army of them' are love, faith, and the knowledges
thereof, which were previously signified by the great luminaries and the stars.
. . . Both 'heaven' and 'earth' are predicated of man; for although they refer
primarily to the Most Ancient Church, yet the interiors of the Word are of
such a nature that whatever is said of the church may also be said of every
individual member of it, who, unless he were a church, could not possibly be
a part of the church, just as he who is not a temple of the Lord cannot be
what is signified by the temple, namely, the church and heaven. It is for this
reason that the Most Ancient Church is called 'man,' in the singular number.
"The 'heavens and the earth and all the army of them' are said to be
'finished,' when man has become the 'sixth day,' for then faith and love make
a one. When they do this, love, and not faith, or in other words the celestial
principle, and not the spiritual, begins to be the principal, and this is to be
a celestial man."

== THE GARDEN OF EDEN
Genesis 2:8-25

The first seven chapters of Genesis were copied verbatim from
the Ancient Word and are in the language of pure symbol in which
that Word was written (see SS 103, TCR 27ge, SD 5605). They are
especially adapted to the teaching of young children, who love the
simple, beautiful pictures they present and retain them deep in
their memories. They should be taught with a feeling of wonder
and reverence.

Doctrinal Points
In the Word truth from the Lord is adapted to all the different

planes of the soul.

We are given freedom to choose good or evil, but we must always
look to the Lord and not to selffor both knowledge and power.

Notes for Parents

The beautiful parable of the Garden of Eden shows us the happy,
innocent state of the first people on earth after they had devel 
oped-through the stages described in the Creation story-into a
church. At the center of this church was worship of the Lord as
the Source of all goodness and truth-the tree of life. The river
which watered the garden was truth from the Lord flowing into
every plane of life. It was an ideal state.

Do we wonder why it did not last? It was because of that other
tree in the garden, the tree of knowledge of good and evil. Man 
kind, we remember, was created in the image and likeness of God.
Man was not to be a mere automaton, carrying out the will of God
by instinct like the animals. He was to h?-ve the feeling that he was
an independent being, and the freedom to choose whether he
would serve God or himself. This was the tree of knowledge of
good and evil. The Lord warned man not to eat of its fruit, that is,
not to believe that he was really wise apart from the Lord's truth,
but he was left free to disobey.

The story of the creation of woman from Adam's rib is, of
course, a parable too. The first seven chapters of Genesis were
copied by Moses from an Ancient Word which existed before our
Bible and which was written in an old style of pure symbolism.
We should know that Adam and Eve were not two individuals, for
we have already been told that both men and women had been
created. Adam is the Hebrew word for "man" or "mankind," and
Eve means "life." The story of the creation of Eve gives us a
picture of the Lord's mercy in permitting mankind to see how the
lifeless framework which he really is can be brought to life and
clothed with beauty by the Lord's spirit. Of ourselves we are
nothing, but if we turn to the Lord and obey Him, He can make us
angels. And this story also gives us the basis of true marriage, for
is only obedience to the Lord and unselfish devotion to one
it
another that can make a marriage happy.

Primary

Teachers will have no difficulty in talking to young children about the beauti 
ful Garden of Eden. The river, the trees, the fruit, and the animals all connect
with the children's own experience. Tell them that the Lord made this beauti 
ful garden on purpose for men to live in long ago when He first created them.
He told them to take good care of it-"to dress it and keep it." He told them
that they might enjoy all the fruit except the fruit of one tree. If they had
obeyed the Lord, they would have been able to go on living in the garden
always. In this way prepare the children for the fact that men lost the garden
because they did not obey the Lord. When we are selfish with our things and
misuse and spoil them, we are spoiling our "garden."

When the Lord created the first people, He gave them a beauti 
ful place to live in. It is called the G¥den of Eden, and in our
chapter for today the first people are called Adam. Let us read the
story from the Bible. [Read Genesis 2:8-25 ..]

You see these first people were taken care of by the Lord just as
you are taken care of by your parents. The Lord provided their
food and gave them everything they needed, and they were grate 
ful to Him and loved Him. They had not begun to be selfish or
to want their own way. They obeyed the Lord and took care of
everything in the garden just as He told them to do.

Where did the Lord put the first people?
Eden means "delight."
How was the Garden of Eden watered?
Into how many streams did the river divide?
What tree was in the midst of the garden?
What were the first people to do in the garden?

Can you remember what was the one thing the Lord told them
not to do? You know that when your parents tell you not to do
something, you are likely to think about just that particular thing,
and pretty soon it begins to seem just the one thing you most want
to do. That is what is called temptation. If we are wise, we do not
disobey, but all of us sometimes are foolish instead of wise.

Junior
The details of the story should be impressed on the children with the under 
standing that this is a wonderful parable which they will understand bcttcr
and better as they grow older. The correspondence of the Garden of Edcll,
the river, and the two trees can be given. Be sure to have the class look up
and read the references in Ezekiel and in Revelation, and in connection with
the tree of life refer again to Revelation 22:2.

What is the name of the first book in the Bible?
What does Genesis mean?
What is the first chapter about?
In how many days was everything created?
What did the Lord say which started the development of everything?
What was the last thing created?
What happened on the seventh day?

Our lesson for today is another beautiful parable. A parable is

a story which has another meaning within it.

What is our chapter about?
How was the Garden of Eden watered?
Into how many streams did the river divide?
Who lived in the garden?
What was Adam to do in the garden?

Adam is a Hebrew word which means "man." It is the same
word that is used in verse 26 of the first chapter. So you see that
this chapter is not about one man and woman but about the
human race after it had developed far enough to know and serve
the Lord. It was the first church which existed on earth-the Most
Ancient Church-and the Garden of Eden is a picture of the beauti 
ful, peaceful state in which its people lived. Eden means "delight."
They depended on the Lord for everything, and He could give
them all they needed freely because they obeyed Him. You know
that when you obey your parents, they can do many more pleasant
things for you than they can when you are disobedient.

Last week we learned that light

is a symbol of truth. In our
lesson today we have another symbol for truth-that is, water.
Perhaps you have heard people say of some wise man that he
always had "a thirst for knowledge." Look up and read Ezekiel
47: 1-5 and Revelation 22: 1-2. These describe the same river that
watered the Garden of Eden-that of truth from the Lord. Now
read John 4: 5-14.

What tree was in the midst of the garden?
What other tree is mentioned?

What one thing was Adam told not to do?

The early people were innocent and happy because they under 
stood that everything they had came from the Lord, and they
loved and trusted Him and did not want to have their own way.
This happy state is the beautiful garden and the tree of life in the
center is the thought that everything comes from the Lord. As
long as men obeyed the Lord and took care of all His gifts and
used them as they were meant to be used, they could go on living
in the happy garden.

The other tree, of whose fruit

they were not to eat, is the
thought that we can know what is good and wise from ourselves,
without learning from the Lord. Very soon we shall learn what
happened when they disobeyed the Lord and ate of the fruit of
this tree.

What did the Lord do when Adam was asleep?
What did He make from the rib?

The story of the creation of woman out of the rib of man is
a parable, too. One of the things it teaches us is that "it is not good
for man to be alone." Men and women were created by the Lord
to help each other. Marriage is a holy state ordained by the Lord
from the beginning. You will learn much more about this p'rt of
the story and its meaning when you are older.

Intermediate
Begin by reminding the young people of the correspondence of the vegetable
kingdom, and take up the correspondence of the river and the tree of life
to account for the beauty and fruitfulness of the life of the people of the
Most Ancient Church. This is a good lesson in which to point out the value of
knowing the meaning of the Hebrew names. Take up the creation of woman
in a general way, stressing the principle that the Lord provided the marriage
relation to promote unselfishness. If we were allowed to feel complete in our 
selves, it would be very much harder for us to be unselfish.

In studying the story of the Garden of Eden we should know
that Adam and Eve were not two individuals but symbol
first
figures, representing the people of the first "church" on earth 
the Most Ancient Church. Adam is merely the Hebrew word for
"man," and is the same word that is translated "man" in Genesis
1:26. Eve means "life." Eden means "delight." The garden is said
to have been "eastward" in Eden because east represents nearness
to the Lord. The four quarters-east, west, north, and south 
represent states of nearness to or withdrawal from the Lord. The
Lord, because He is represented by the sun which rises in the east,
is identified with the east. Eastward, therefore, pictures a state of
closeness to the Lord, and westward pictures a lessening of this
closeness. South,
the area which receives light during the greater
part of the year, pictures greater understanding of the Lord's truth,
and north pictures less understanding.

The river which divides into four heads represents the truth as
it comes from the Lord into our minds, and its four "heads" or
divisions are the different planes or levels of thought and feeling
which divine truth supplies. Pison means "overflowing," and this
quality applies to truths relating to the Lord's Divine love. In the
land watered by this river there is gold, the mineral which rep 
resents love. The Gihon, or river which "bursts forth," describes
life. The Hiddekel (rapid)
the quality of truths about spiritual
portrays the characteristics of the reasoning plane of our minds.
And the Euphrates (fruitful) pictures truths as they apply to our
outward conduct. As you study the Bible, you will find that it
contains truth which satisfies the needs of all four of these areas.
This river of Eden is the same river seen in vision by Ezekiel
(47:1-5, 12) and John (Revelation 22:1-2).

The vegetable kingdom represents our thinking. Trees, the lar 
gest and loftiest things in this kingdom, express the ruling thoughts
or principles by which we live. The tree of life is the thought or
principle that all things come from the Lord. It was in the midst of
the Garden of Eden because the people then lived by this principle.
The tree of knowledge of good and evil represents the thought
that we can be good and wise in and of ourselves without looking
to the Lord for guidance and strength. This is the tree whose fruit
Adam was commanded not to eat, and the same command applies
to us as well.

When we give something a name, it means that we know what
the thing is, its nature and uses. The early people saw ~verything
in nature truly, each thing as a particular expression of the Lord's
love for them. So in the parable Adam was able to give names to
everything.

The story of the creation of woman from the rib of man is a
parable, too. As man developed, he was not content to "live alone"
with God in his heart. He wanted to feel independent, just as a
little child does very early in his development. Then he had to be
taught to love something outside himself in the world, to keep him
from being wholly selfish. In true' marriage husband and wife love
each other more than self. Verse 24 is often used in marriage
services, for it tells us that marriage is a holy state, ordained by
the Lord from the beginning, and to be cherished above all other
human relations. Notice that in the parable a deep sleep fell upon
Adam. This is a picture of a time in the development of the human
race when men began to be so interested in the natural world
around them that they forgot that their souls were more important
than their bodies. We are likely to forget this, too. The rib which
the Lord took from Adam showed how lifeless man is in himself.
It is only as the Lord's spirit enters into us that we become really
alive and lovely.

Senior

Give attention to the suggestions in the Intermediate section, but use more of
the class time for the discussion of the creation of woman. This lesson is our
first opportunity for a discussion of marriage, which is so important with this
class.
Even among those who know nothing of the language of corre 
spondences the Garden of Eden has always been a symbol of a
state of innocence and happiness. This is because it is in fact the
Lord's own picture of such a state.

The Garden of Eden was not a material garden. But the spiritual
state which it pictures was actually the state of the men and
women of the earliest church on earth, which Swedenborg calls
the Most Ancient or the Adamic Church. These people knew that
they lived from the Lord. That was the central principle of their
though t, the tree of life in the midst of the garden. Because they
knew this the Lord could cause to spring up in the "ground" of
their minds "every tree that is pleasant to the sight and good for
food," and because of it the people of this church-called Adam 
could "name" or distinguish the true character of all their experi 
ences, both natural and spiritual. They did not have to study and
learn as we do. Their hearts were open to the Lord and He could
instruct them by an inner influx-the river of truth, whose four
streams watered the four divisions or planes of their minds. We
sometimes like to think that we have such inner influx, that we
can trust the impulses of our hearts to tell us what is right; but
this is not so. We shall see why in our next lesson.

Swedenborg says that the people of this first church had open
vision into the spiritual world and scarcely thought about their
natural surroundings. This is a very different concept from his 
torians'
ideas of the crude and savage beginnings of the human
race. Instead, it supports the idea of the "Golden Age" handed
down through mythology. It was indeed a "golden" age, the age
when men were led by the Lord through love, which gold rep 
resents.

But men were not animals, to be governed by unchanging in 
stincts. They were to be free to choose their own way, because
only in freedom could they really respond to the Lord's love and
be happy. Because they were made in the image and likeness of
they must be able to think of themselves as independent
God,
beings free to choose what they would think and do. The dawning
of this sense of individual independence-the proprium, as Sweden 
borg calls it-is pictured in the story of the creation of Eve. This
proprium was a part of the original structure of the human soul,
one of the "bones" which protected the very life of the human
will and understanding, as the ribs protect the hearts and lungs of
the physical body. But man must become conscious of it, and see
it as beautiful and necessary to his happiness and usefulness. It is
the feeling of our own separate existence as individuals, of our
own independence, which is the basis of our free choice of right
or wrong. We must be able to look at ourselves objectively, to see
ourselves in relation to other men and to the Lord. We must feel
our thoughts and decisions to be our own. So, if we think justly
and choose rightly, we can come more and more into the image
and likeness of our heavenly Father. In the story Eve was created
in the Garden of Eden because this faculty is part of our true
human nature and capable of heavenly usefulness.

There is also, of course,

the lesson in this story that

true
marriage is ordained by the Lord for the purpose of taking our
thoughts out of ourselves and centering them on another. The
Lord saw that it was "not good that the man should be alone."
The complete "man," as Swedenborg saw in the other world, is not
a man or woman but a married pair. Marriage is the highest and
most sacred relationship into which we can enter. But the basis of
a happy marriage is belief in the Lord and the desire and effort to
learn His will and do it together. And a true marriage is eternal.
We should all want such a marriage and be careful to do nothing
which will unfit us for one.

=== Adult
The interpretation of the creation of woman from the rib of man is perhaps
the best discussion topic for this class, although the general correspondences
of the Garden of Eden should be covered first.

We have seen that
the Creation story is the account of the
orderly development of the race or of the individual. The first
people did in general develop in this way, so that the first church
on earth-the Most Ancient Church-was composed of a very high
type of people, "celestial people," who loved the Lord supremely,
had open communication with the heavens, and cared for the
things of this world only as they were related to and could serve
spiritual things. The Lord instructed them directly through their
affections. We know that we cannot trust our desires to tell us
is true and good because so many of our desires are evil.
what
But the early people had only good and innocent desires because
they were content to be led entirely by the Lord and did not care
to guide themselves or to imagine that they knew anything apart
from the Lord's teaching. In various parts of the writings Sweden 
borg tells us many things about
these people, of their simple,
their high ideal of marriage, their love for each other
happy life,
and for children,
their worship. Love was the keynote of every 
thing, and for this reason the traditions of this period have come
down to us-aside from the symbolic stories of the early chapters
of Genesis-in the myths of the "Golden Age," for gold has always
been recognized as the symbol of love. The Word describes this
civilization as a garden which the Lord planted "eastward in Eden;'
Eden meaning pleasure or delight, and eastward always meaning
near the Lord. The garden was watered by the river of wisdom
from the Lord's love, and in it were all trees "pleasant to the sight
and good for food," which mean all the knowledge necessary to
make men happy and useful. And in the center was the tree of life,
which is the knowledge that man lives from the Lord alone. Man
was placed in this garden "to dress it and keep it"; that is, he
realized that all the good things he had belonged to the Lord and
were to be used in His service.

Everyone loves a little baby because of the beautiful sphere of
innocence and trust which surrounds him. The infancy of the indi 
vidual is like the infancy of the race, before the development of
self-consciousness and self-seek.ing. He is close to the Lord and the
angels, and is without anxiety or fear. In this sense the life story
of the individual begins in the Garden of Eden. The four heads
into which the river was divided picture the Lord's provision for
the enlightenment of all the planes of the mind: the Pison is sym 
bolic of the highest intelligence, which is from love; so there was
gold in the land compassed by that river. The Gihon pictures "the
knowledge of all things that belong to the good and the true" (AC
116). The Hiddekel stands for "reason, or the clear-sightedness of
reason" (AC 118), that plane or faculty which connects the internal
with the external mind and enables us to relate the two. And the
Euphrates represents memory knowledge, all that we learn of the
externals of things, which serves as a basis for the higher planes.
All good and useful knowledge is open to us, and all good things
are given us to use and enjoy. To eat of every tree is "to know
from perception what is good and true" (AC 125). As long as men
were content to be led solely by the Lord, they had this percep 
tion. Very little children retain something akin to such perception;
they are given to sense the quality of those about them, feeling
"instinctively" whether a person is really kind and loving or merely
pretending an affection he does not feel.

But there is another tree in the garden of which the man in the
story was commanded not to eat-the "tree ofknowledge of good
and evil." In reading this story people sometimes wonder why the
Lord put anything in the garden which men should not eat, and
they sometimes even feel that the Lord must have put it there on
purpose to tempt men, just as people sometimes blame the Lord
for their troubles and say, "How can the Lord be a God of love
when He permits people to be unhappy?" The tree of knowledge
of good and evil was man's ability to think of himself as indepen 
dent of the Lord. The presence of this ability in the garden of the
human soul is necessary to man's being man. The Lord created
man to make him happy, but happiness can come only from love
freely given; so man could not be a mere mechanical agent of the
Lord's love as other created things are. He must have a type of
independence, the power to decide for himself whether he wishes
to return the Lord's love or not. Therefore, although all life and
power actually come to man moment by moment from the Lord,
man is allowed to feel this life and power as his own and to use it
as he pleases. This tree had to be in the garden, but the Lord
warned man not to eat of its fruit, that is, not to depend on him 
self for knowledge of what is good and true, because if he did he
would be cutting himself off from the real source of goodness and
wisdom and would become spiritually dead. As Swedenborg puts
it (AC 126), "We are not to inquire into the mysteries of faith by
means of the things of sense and of the memory, for in this case
the celestial of faith is destroyed." In one of our New Church
Books of Worship this prohibition is put in the form of simple
doctrine to be acknowledged by those who wish to be confirmed
in the New Church: "In abstaining from evil and doing good we
are to act as of ourselves; at the same time believing and acknowl 
edging that the will,
the understanding, and the power to do so
are of the Lord alone."

The last part of our chapter treats of the first step in the descent
of man from this high state, the awakening of the desire for inde 
pendent life, and of the way in which the Lord's providence recog 
nizes and meets this desire. Swedenborg tells us (AC 139) that
throughout the Word "to dwell alone" signifies to live wholly from
the Lord and so not to be subject to the influence of mere exter 
nals, which are the source of evils. The first men dwelt alone in
this sense, and so does a little baby. But when the Lord sees that
man is beginning to be more consciously interested in external
things, He provides a way by which man may, if he will, develop
this external consciousness and still not become absorbed in self.
First He shows us all the things which are within us and teaches us
their character. This is described by the Lord's bringing all the
living creatures to Adam to see what he would call them. So a little
child, in the course of his everyday experience, learns a great many
things about himself and the world about him. Then comes a time
this knowledge he develops a feeling of self 
when through all
importance which dulls his interest
in higher things. This is the
deep sleep which fell upon Adam. The rib which the Lord took
is the picture of this selfhood-the Own, or proprium-of each one
of us as it really is, merely the dead framework of a human being.
Only when this selfhood is seen in its true relation to the Lord
and the Lord's spirit is allowed to work through it does it become
clothed with flesh and living. There is a deep psychology in this
lesson. To make progress in character we must be able to "get out 
side of ourselves," to "see ourselves as others see us," and especially
as the Lord and the angels see us. Then we begin to look at our
selfhood as a tool given us to fashion for the Lord's service, and to
love ourselves only for the use we can be to the neighbor. In this
way our dead selfhood becomes a beautiful living thing, like the
woman fashioned by the Lord from the rib of the man. The
writings say: "The Own of man, when viewed from heaven, ap 
pears like something which is wholly bony, inanimate, and very
ugly, consequently as being in itself dead, but when vivified by
the Lord it looks like flesh" (AC 149). Only the Lord's Own was
living; so He said: "A spirit hath not flesh and bones as ye see me
have" (Luke 24:39).

From the Writings of Swedenborg
Arcana Coelestia, n. 129: "Everyone may know that man is governed by the
principles he assumes, be they ever so false, and that all his knowledge and
reasoning favor his principles; for innumerable considerations tending to sup 
port them present themselves to his mind, and thus he is confirmed in what is
false. He therefore who assumes as a principle that nothing is to be believed
until it is seen and understood, can never believe, because spiritual and celes 
tial things cannot be seen with the eyes, or conceived by the imagination. But
the true order is for man to be wise from the Lord, that is, from His Word,
and then all things follow, and he is enlightened even in matters of reason and
of memory knowledge.... For it is by no means forbidden to learn the sci:
ences, since they are useful to his life and delightful; nor is he who is in faith
prohibited from thinking and speaking as do the learned of the world; but it
must be from this principle-to believe the Word of the Lord, and, so far as
possible, confirm spiritual and celestial truths by natural truths, in terms fam 
iliar to the learned world. Thus his starting point must be the Lord, and not
himself; for the former is life, but the latter is death."

== A WIFE FOR ADAM
Genesis 2: 8-25

This in the letter is a very short and striking story. In aJl classes
it might be well to start by rereading the entire assignment from
the Word. Only the very youngest children will be likely to accept
the literal story without question, and questions should be wel 
comed; for the more children question, the more interested they
are. Swedenborg says (AC 155): "The words 'a rib was built into
a woman,' have more things inmostly concealed in them than it is
possible for anyone ever to discover from the letter; for the Word
is such that its inmost contents regard the Lord Himself and His
kingdom, and from this comes all the life of the Word."

Notes for Parents

The story of the creation of Eve from the rib of Adam, which
has puzzled many lovers of the Bible and has been pointed to by
the unbelieving in support of their lack of faith, is another symbol
story with a deep lesson hidden within it. You have seen your
children pass from babyhood to the age when they wanted their
own way. This is a natural development, and none of us would
want our children to remain babies forever. The human race passed
through this same change. In the beginning they were innocent and
trustful and depended upon the Lord as a little baby depends on
its mother. They were not savages, as some would have us think,
but lived in harmony and peace and looked to the Lord for every 
thing. This was the state of the first church which developed on
earth, which is called the Most Ancient Church. It was the Golden
is described in symbol
Age of mythology, and in the Bible it
language as the Garden of Eden. Eden means "delight."

But

the race had to grow up just as a child does. Men and
women had to begin to think of themselves as independent human
beings who could make their own decisions. They had to become
self-conscious. There are two kinds of self-consciousness, a good
and a bad. We sometimes say a child or a grown person is "too self 
conscious," meaning that he is never able to forget himself. This is
a form of selfishness, and is to be avoided. But we must all recog 
nize that every individual is important. Each of us has certain abili 
ties, a particular use to perform, and a particular place to fill in the
world. The difference between the selfish person and the helpful,
outgoing person is like the difference between Adam's rib when it
was a mere lifeless bone inside of him and the same rib after the
Lord had drawn it out and breathed His life into it. Children
they will find their highest happiness in
should be taught
serving the Lord and helping other people. It is only selfishness
which makes us unhappy. This is the real lesson of our story. We
should know that the word Adam is merely the Hebrew word for
mankind. It is the same word which is used in Genesis 1: 27 near
the end of the Creation story: "So God created man in his own
image ... male and female created he them."

that

Primary

Here the lesson to emphasize is that Adam needed a help meet (i.e., suitable)
for him. The need of companionship and the right attitude among playmates 
one of helpfulness and happiness and sharing-is a good lesson for this age.
Anything deeper in the story should be given only in response to questions,
and should be kept as simple as possible.

We have learned that God made everything in the world: the
heavens and the earth, the oceans, the wonderful sun that gives us
light all day and warms the earth so that the seeds can grow to give
us grain and fruit,
the moon which gives light at night, and the
stars which help the sailors at sea to guide their ships.

God is our Heavenly Father who made us, too, and put us in
the beautiful world He had prepared for us, and that we should
always be thankful to Him and try to please Him by doing what
He says is right.

Now we shall read about something else the Lord did for people
after He had made them. He had given them a beautiful garden
to live in called the Garden of Eden, and He had put everything in
the garden which they would need, but there was still something
more they wanted.

Have you ever been lonely? Has there, perhaps, been a morning
when the day was beautiful and you could play outdoors, you had
just the kind of breakfast you liked, and you had some fine new
toys to play with, and still you were not quite satisfied because
you were all by yourself? Then you know how Adam felt in our
story.

The Lord knew just how Adam felt, and planned to give him
that one thing he wanted. First He brought to Adam all the ani 
mals and birds in the garden and let Adam give them names. "And
whatsoever Adam called every living creature, that was the name
thereof." But none of the animals or birds was just the companion
Adam wanted. He wanted a help "meet" for him: that means a
companion who just suited him.
Read verses 21, 22, and 23 and see how the Lord provided the helper
suitable for Adam.
Because of this story a wife is sometimes called a "helpmeet."
Every good wife is a helper for her husband.
Men and women were created to help each other.
Helping each other takes practice; so we should begin helping each other
when we are very young.
When you are older, you will learn what the deeper meaning of this story is.

And do you know something else? In heaven a man and his true
wife, when they are a little way off from other angels, look to
other people like one angel instead of two.

=== Junior
It would be impossible to teach this lesson to children of this age without
giving them something of the internal meaning. Their inquiring minds would
not stop in the literal sense. In their notes the effort has been made to give
them the simplest interpretation applicable to their age, and there are also
lessons there which should be helpful to any Junior group, but the teacher
may find further lessons in the other notes which he feels his class could
understand.

What is the first chapter of the Bible about?
Who made the world and everything in it?
Who is God?
Did the Lord write this first chapter of the Bible to teach us about the
creation of the natural world?
What does it really teach us?

In a past lesson we thought about how our souls develop, and es 
pecially about
the part which the light of understanding plays in
this development. But there is another meaning with that story
which we need to think about today. It is the story of how the
human race developed. The human race in the beginning was ,in
very much the same condition as a little baby. The people were
simple and trustful and ignorant, and the Lord had to take care of
them-just as we have to take care of a little baby-until He could
teach them gradually to take care of themselves. Then they learned
about their Heavenly Father, just as children do, and began to try
to live as He taught them; and those who continued to look to
Him for guidance became a very good and happy race of people.
Their life was like a beautiful garden in which they could live in
peace and happiness with everything they needed provided for
them by the Lord. In the Bible story this is called the Garden of
Eden, which means "the garden 0f delight." Mythology calls this
beautiful early state the Golden Age. Swedenborg calls it the Most
Ancient Church.

But men had, you remember, an "earth" side to their natures,
and they could choose between serving God and serving them 
selves, just as we can today. We can be selfish or unselfish about
everything we think and do, and no one makes us be one or the
other, although we often have to behave as if we were unselfish
when we do not really feel that way. The Lord, however, knows
just what our temptations are, and always tries to help us choose
the unselfish way. Our story for today about Adam (Adam is the
Hebrew word for man) in the Garden of Eden is another parable.
It seems to be about the creation of woman, but you remember
that in verse 27 of the first chapter of Genesis we read: "So God
created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him;
male and female created he them." The story of the creation of
woman out of the rib of man must
therefore have some inner
meaning. It is given in the Bible to tell us how the Lord always
provides that each of us shall have someone outside of himself to
love, so that his thoughts will be taken away from himself and he
will have the opportunity of becoming a really unselfish person.
Men and women were made to help each other. They need each
other all through their lives. You know that your father has certain
responsibilities in providing for his family and taking care of it,
and your mother has different things to do. Both are needed, and
neither one is comfortable or happy without the other, and you
need both of them to take good care of you. Men and women,
boys and girls, are different-but neither is better than the other,
and if they are both willing to help each other, the family will be
a happy one.

If this story seems to you a strange way for the Lord to choose
to teach such a simple lesson, remember that there are still deeper
meanings in it which you will learn when you are older. In every
story in the Word there are deeper and deeper lessons wrapped up
within waiting for us to grow old enough to understand them, and
if we continue to study the Word, we shall never stop growing,
even after we go from this world into the spiritual world. The Lord
always has something for us to look forward to. But unless we
know the story, as He gives it to us, we shall not be able to find
the deeper meanings.

Another reason why we need to read and reread these chapters
in the beginning of the Bible is that they are so often referred to
later in the Word. Read what the Lord said to the Pharisees in
Matthew 19:3-8. You see that in order to understand what the
Lord was telling them you need to know the lesson we are study 
ing today, and you also need to know about Moses and the laws
given to the Jews through him. And because we cannot any of us
learn too much at once, we need to be reading the Bible all through
our lives.

Intermediate

The Intermediates, as usual, should be given at least the outline of the spiri 
tual sense, and there are a number of correspondences, suggested in these
notes, which should be especially developed. They are just at the age when
they are wishing to be independent; so the lesson about the wrong and the
right kind of independence should be valuable-and also helpful to their
parents.

The Creation story is a picture of how our lives develop from
infancy to adulthood. Swedenborg tells us that the human race
developed in this same order from the darkness of ignorance to
knowledge of the Lord and the love of doing His will, which is
true manhood and womanhood. The Garden of Eden, of which
the second chapter of Genesis tells us, is a picture of the happy,
peaceful state of these people after they had learned enough to
become a church-the Most Ancient Church. Their lives were like
a fruitful garden, full of beautiful thoughts and good affections.
Swedenborg says they had open communication with the heavens,
and that they thought very little about the earthly part of their
lives, but lived close to the Lord and knew that everything they
had came from Him. He calls them "celestial" people. As our chap 
ter tells, the garden was watered by four rivers, truth for all planes
of man's mind; and in the center was the tree of life, the percep 
tion that all life, knowledge, and power are from the Lord.

But we remember that these people did have an earthly side as
well as a heavenly side. It was natural that as time went on they
should think more and more about
themselves as independent
human beings and want to decide things for themselves instead of
accepting all their ideas from the Lord. This is also a stage in our
own development. You know that you are approaching the time
when you will have to "live your own lives"-to make your own
decisions, no longer depending on your parents to guide you. In
fact, you already sometimes want to do this, don't you? The Lord
knew just how these early people felt, and He knows just how you
feel. You don't mean to be bad. You mean to be good-to obey the
Lord-but you want to decide things for yourselves. Your parents
know this, too, and they try to let you make your own decisions
in matters in which you are wise enough to do so.

This is what is meant in our story by the words, "And the Lord
God said, It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make
him an help meet for him." To understand how this can be, we
must know that in the Word "to be alone" means to be led entirely
by the Lord instead of being what we mean when we use the ex 
pression "a man among men." (Cf. Num. 23:9, Deut. 33:28, Jer.
49:31, AC 139.) To be alone with the Lord in that sense is the
highest state of which we are capable-what Swedenborg calls the
"celestial" state-and those who, through obedience to the Lord,
come to love Him Il)ore than everything else, reach that state in
heaven. But we must- choose by our own wills to serve the Lord,
and we cannot do that without at least thinking of ourselves as
individuals. So the Lord made provision that men
independent
could so think of themselves.

But there are two kinds of independence-a right and a wrong
kind. When you decide something for yourself, trying to decide on
what is really right according to all you have been taught of right
and wrong. you are using your independence as it should be used.
But when you forget about right and wrong and decide to do what
you think will give you the most pleasure at the moment, you are
using your independence in the wrong way. Our story this week
gives us the picture of the right kind of independence.

First we read that the Lord brought to Adam all the animals and
birds to see what he would call them, and that Adam gave names
to them all. The animals and birds in the garden are pictures of
our affections and thoughts. The Lord shows us just what affec 
tions and thoughts are in us and asks us to think about them and
judge them. That is what we are doing in Sunday School and what
your parents try to help you to do as you grow up. Giving a name
to something is deciding just what it really is and trying to describe
it. You probably call several of your friends by names which are
not the ones they were given by their parents. Their "nicknames"
frequently describe some quality which their friends see in them.
Then we are told that a deep sleep fell upon Adam. When these
early people decided that they wanted to be independent, their
minds were closed to the open vision they had had of the heavens,
and this new state was like a sleep. And we are told that the Lord
took one of Adam's own ribs and made it into a woman to be a
help "meet" or fit for him. P.leet means exactly suited to his needs.
We know that our bones have very little life in them and yet are
very necessary to us. They compose the structure which gives us
our form, and they support and protect the more important and
living parts of the body. So the bones picture what really belongs
to us as individuals. Swedenborg calls them man's Own, or pTO 
prium. Without life constantly flowing in from the Lord, this self 
hood or proprium is as dead as a skeleton. But the Lord can give it
life and make. it beautiful and useful. Do you see now what is
meant by the creation of Eve out of the rib taken from Adam?
When we know and believe that everything that is one's own is
really dead apart from the Lord, and when we look to the Lord
for life and guidance and try to make our proprium serve Him,
then our individuality becomes a beautiful and useful thing and
helps us and the world. This is the right kind of independence
which does good instead of harm. So these people, even though
they had declined from their first celestial state, could still be
innocent, and this is pictured in the last verse of our chapter. If
you remember your Bible story, you will recall that after the temp 
tation of the serpent (discussed in our next lesson), Adam and Eve
were ashamed of their nakedness.

We should not leave this story without thinking of it in another
connection-as it relates to marriage. A married pair should be per 
fectly united to each other in their thought and feeling, as Adam
and Eve were in the story. Read what the Lord has to say about
this in Matthew 19:3-9. Marriage comes from the Lord and is holy,
and a true marriage is the most desirable thing in life. But many
marriages, which have been entered into without sufficient knowl 
edge and preparation, are not true marriages, and lead to disaster.
Remember this, and never let yourselves be deceived by the carc 
less and foolish talk of people who have never had the great happi 
ness of a true marriage.

information given us through
Two aspects of the story should be stressed:
Swedenborg about the primitive state of mankind, and the lesson in regard to
marriage. The teacher should develop the latter as fully as he feels the class is
able to receive it. Boy and girl relations at the senior high school level are a
crucial problem, and our young people should be helped as much as possible
to keep their ideals high and their thought and speech and conduct pure.
They are very well aware. of some of the actual difficulties which arise from
improper relations between boys and girls, but they need to understand the
underlying reasons for keeping themselves strong and clean in this respect.
They should be impressed with the thought that their influence among their
schoolmates can be important.

In Arcana Coelestia, n. 152 Swedenborg says: "It requires but
little attention in anyone to discern that woman was not formed
out of the rib of a man, and that deeper arcana are here implied
than any person has heretofore been aware of."

Our story for today is a very familiar one, and one which has
puzzled those people who wish to believe in the Bible but cannot
close their eyes to facts. That Swedenborg was such a man is evi 
dent from the quotation above. He was constantly finding things
in the letter of Scripture which did not seem sensible; yet, knowing
the power and effect of the Bible, he recognized that it must be
from God and, instead of rejecting it, as some do, he went to work
with his scientific mind to study it more deeply in an effort to
find out its true meaning. In time this meaning was revealed to
him. The wonderful content of a story such as this one today is
in itself proof of the validity of Swedenhorg's illumination.

We have previously considered the Creation story particularly as
it applies to us as individuals. But we said that it also had its appli 
cation to the race as a whole. In six general stages the Lord devel 
oped the race of men He had placed on the earth until they were
capable of being a "church." The church is wherever the Lord's
love and wisdom are accepted and responded to by men. We are
told that an individual is a church in its least form, and that a
group of such individuals constitutes the church in its larger form.
Swedenborg tells us that there is but one true church on earth at a
time-that group which has accepted the Lord's truth as He has
given it for that particular age and state of the race,-and that from
this church, as from the heart and lungs of a man, the life-blood
goes forth throughout
the rest of the body of good men and
women in the world. The first three chapters of Genesis treat of
the first church on earth, the Most Ancient Church: its rise (chap 
ter 1), its time of flourishing (chapter 2), and its decline (chapter
3). The description of the Garden of Eden is a description of the
beautiful state in which the people of this first church lived. It
was a celestial church:
that is, a church in which men could be
governed by their hearts because the desire of their hearts was only
to know and serve the Lord. They had open communication with
the heavens, and thought very little about their earthly condition
and life.

But man was created to be a free agent, since only by choosing
freely the way of unselfish love, which is the Divine way, could he
be happy; and the Lord's desire was to give him happiness. So man
had an earthly as well as a heavenly side to his nature, and as time
went on he naturally began to think more of himself and his
earthly possibilities, and was no longer willing to live "alone" with
the Lord. As Swedenborg states it, "This posterity of the Most
Ancient Church was not disposed to dwell alone, that is, to be a
celestial man, or to be led by the Lord as a celestial man, but, like
the Jewish Church, desired to be among the nations. And because
'it is not good that the man should be
they desired this, it is said,
alone,' for he who desires is already in evil, and it is granted him"
(AC 139). We all know the feeling,
the desire to be like other
people. The Lord knew all that was in man, and that he would
decline from the celestial state, just as He knows that we shall not
always be innocent,
trustful little babies, but will grow up and
want to make our own decisions. So He makes provision for this
change in us, and in this story He tells us how we can become
independent and still remain good; for independence, in the sense
of going our own way, often leads to sin and unhappiness.

First the Lord brought to Adam all the beasts and fowl of the
Garden of Eden and told him to give them names. To give a name
to something is to describe it as to its quality, and the beasts and
fowl are our affections and thoughts. It is our duty to examine
ourselves and study our affections and thoughts with a view to
understanding them and their possibilities for good or evil. This
prepares us to use our independence rightly.

But when the change was actually to be made, a "deep sleep"
fell upon Adam. Swedenborg says: "By a 'deep sleep' is meant the
state into which he was let so that he might seem to himself to
have what is his own, which state resembles sleep" (AC 147). The
rib which was taken from Adam, we are told, represents man's
"Own" or selfhood, of which he now wished to be especially con 
scious. Of itself it is nothin~ but a dead bone; yet if the Lord's
is breathed into it, it can become a beautiful living thing,
spirit
with the help of which he can live a useful, happy, spiritual life.
(See the quotation from the Arcana Coelestia at the end of this
lesson.)

This story is usually considered in its relation to the subject of
marriage, and the Lord Himself so uses it in Matthew 19: 3-9. The
doctrines of the New Church teach that true marriage on earth is
the ultimation of the union of the Divine Love and Wisdom in the
Lord; and the vivification of Eve by the Lord's spirit is a picture of
this, also. If you look about you in the world, you cannot fail to
see that
true marriage is the happiest and most desirable state
which a man and woman can experience, and you can see also that
the deepest sorrows, the ugliest states, and even the most horrible
crimes are the fruits of the perversions of the true relation between
men and women. A true marriage comes from the Lord. It exists
only when husband and wife are seeking to serve the Lord together
and so are true helpmeets. Each desires the other's happiness more
than his own, and both are in the effort to learn the Lord's will
and do it. Marriage is eternal. The true husband and wife in the
other world are reckoned as one angel, and are even so seen from
a little distance. One who wishes such a true marriage will keep his
ideal of marriage sacred, avoiding everything which might tarnish
or spoil it, even if he never in this world finds his true mate. This
world is only the beginning of life, and it is the character formed
here which counts to eternity.

Adult
There is so much in this lesson that the teacher has a wide range of possible
emphases. He should perhaps read to the class first the summary of the spiri 
tual meaning of this lesson found in AC 131-136, and then let the class decide
what particular phase of the subject they would like to discuss.

Of our lesson for today Swedenborg says (AC 137): "The first
three chapters of Genesis treat
in general of the Most Ancient
Church which is called 'Man' (homo), from its first period to its
last, when it perished: the preceding part of this chapter treats of
its most flourishing state, when it was a celestial man; here it now
treats of those who inclined to their Own, and of their posterity."
We have considered the Creation story in its relation to the re 
generation of the individual, but it also treats of the development
of the first people into a church-the Most Ancient Church. Of
these first people, when they were placed on the earth, Sweden 
borg said (many years before Darwin) that their posture was not
erect and that they lived an animal-like existence, but they were
from the beginning men and not animals. It is interesting to com 
pare the speculations of anthropologists with this statement from
The Divine Providence (nn. 275-276): "The love into which man
was created is love of the neighbor, to the end that he may wish
as well to the neighbor as to himself and even better, and may be
in the delight of that love when he is doing good to the neighbor;
nearly the same' as a parent's love for his children. This love is truly
human, for there is in it a spiritual [element] that distinguishes it
from the natural love that belongs to brute animals. If man were
born into that love he could not be born into the thick darkness
of ignorance, as every man now is, but into a certain light of
knowledge and intelligence therefrom; and into these he would
quickly come. At first, of course, he would creep like a quadruped,
but with an inherent endeavor to raise himself up upon his feet;
for however much like a quadruped he would not turn his face
downward to the earth but forwards towards heaven, and would
so raise himself up as to be able to look upwards. But when love of
the neighbor was turned into love of self, and this love increased,
human love was turned into animal love, and man from being a
man became a beast, with the difference that he was able to think
about what he felt in the body, and could rationally discriminate
one thing from another, and could be taught, and could become a
civil and moral man, and finally a spiritual man." If is important
to see the distinction between this idea-that the human race be 
gan as man and descended to the level of the beast in the period
before our commonly accepted records begin-and the assumption
of some evolutionists that the race began as an animal and worked
itself up to its present state.

Our story for today"one of the best-known and perhaps most
frequently ridiculed of the early stories of the Bible, treats of the
beginning of the decline of the Most Ancient Church. The reason
for this decline is stated very clearly in AC 139: "In ancient times
those were said to 'dwell alone' who were under the Lord's guid 
ance as celestial men, because such were no longer infested by
evils, or evil spirits." But the Lord foresaw that men would not be
content to "dwell alone" with Him. All along the way of the first
development
there were those who chose not to accept what the
Lord taught them. But at this point in the story even the posterity
wishing to be led by self was still in the desire to obey the Lord;
therefore the Lord could Vivify and enlighten the self to which
these men looked for guidance. "That by 'a help as with him'
(a helper suitable for him) is signified man's Own, is evident both
from the nature of this Own, and from what follows. As however
the man of the church who is here treated of was well disposed,
an Own was granted him, but of such a kind that it appeared as it
were his own, and therefore it is said 'a help as with him'" (AC
140). The Hebrew word here translated "as with" and in the King
James version "meet for" actually means "opposite" or "comp-
lementary to." In the relation of this story to the doctrine of
marriage (see Matthew 19: 3-9), this word indicates what husband
and wife should be to each other. We know that a true human
marriage is the highest ultimation among men of the union of the
Divine Love and Wisdom in the Lord. We should therefore seek in
marriage nothing less than a perfect mating of hearts and minds,
and we should hold this ideal before our children. This does not
mean that there will never be differences of opinion between hus 
band and wife, but that as both look to the Lord for guidance and
hold the same basic principles, differences will be resolved ami 
cably and with satisfaction to both. In AC 155 Swedenborg points
out that inmostly this passage treats of the heavenly marriage be 
tween the Lord and His kingdom, which can be called the "bride
and wife" of the Lord.

But the part of the story on which we perhaps need most to
dwell is that which shows the nature of man's Own or proprium
and why it was taken out of him and made by the Lord into a liv 
ing thing which he could love without harm. The Garden of Eden
represents the state of the men of the Most Ancient Church. The
four rivers represent truth from the Lord flowing into the various
planes of the mind. The tree of life in the midst is the perception
that all life, knowledge, and power are from the Lord, and the tree
of knowledge of good and evil man's power to choose between
God and self. We note that first the Lord brought to Adam all the
beasts and fowl of the garden that he might give them names. The
beasts and fowl are men's affections and thoughts. Thus Adam is
asked to examine his affections and thoughts and determine their
quality. "That to 'call by name' signifies to know the quality, is
because the ancients, by the 'name' understood the essence of a
thing, and by 'seeing and calling by name,' they understood to
know the quality" (AC 144). We all, before we take any important
step in life, need such self-examination.

AC 147 gives in very simple terms the outline of the spiritual
meaning of the crucial verse 21: "By a 'rib' which is a bone of the
chest, is meant man's Own, in which there is but little vitality, and
indeed an Own which is dear to him; by 'flesh in the place of a rib,'
is meant an Own in which there is vitality; by a 'deep sleep' is
meant the state into which he was let so that he might seem to
himself to have what is his own, which state resembles sleep, be 
cause while in it he knows not but that he lives, thinks, speaks,
and acts from himself. But when he begins to know that this is
false, he is roused as it were out of sleep, and becomes awake."
The bones, in which there is little life and yet which support
and give form to the whole body and protect the delicate internal
organs, naturally represent man's Own,
the proprium, by which
each individual is distinguished from every other. We need to see
this Own as it really is and then to see it as it can be when filled
with the Lord's spirit. "The Own of man, when viewed from
heaven, appears like a something that is wholly bony, inanimate,
and very ugly, consequently as being in itself dead, but when vivi 
fied by the Lord it 100kB like flesh. For man's Own is a mere dead
thing, although to him it appears as something, indeed as every 
thing. Whatever lives in him is from the Lord's life, and if this were
withdrawn he would fall down as dead as a stone; for man is only
an organ of life, and such as is the organ, such is the life's affec 
tion" (AC 1492
). "But truly the things of man's Own that have
been vivified by the Lord appear beautiful and lovely, with variety
according to the life to which the celestial of the Lord can be
applied" (AC 154).

The fact that the Lord Himself (Matthew 19:3-12) used a por 
tion of today's lesson to point out to the Pharisees the true nature
of marriage should help us to realize that the basis of a true mar 
riage must be a oneness of thought and purpose. We should bring
up our children from the start to feel that marriage is a holy thing,
that the Lord's spirit must be in it in order that the married pair
may respect and love each other and may stand before the world
as one. It is very important that parents exhibit this oneness to
their children, by forming their judgments on the basis of the same
spiritual principles and by coming into agreement as to what they
will and will not allow their children to do. Neither parent should
rule the other; rather, differences of opinion should be resolved by
serious consideration from the common ground of their spiritual
beliefs. And the children should be educated from the start in
these spiritual beliefs.

From the Writings of Swedenborg
Arcana Coelestia, n. 154: "Nothing evil and false is ever possible which is not
man's Own, and from man's Own, for the Own of man is evil itself, and con 
sequently man is nothing but evil and falsity. This has been evident to me
from the fact that when the things of man's Own are presented to view in the
world of spirits, they appear so deformed that it is impossible to depict any 
thing more ugly, yet with a difference according to the nature of the Own,
so that he to whom the things of the Own are visibly exhibited is struck with
horror, and desires to flee from himself as from a devil. But truly the things
of man's Own that have been vivified by the Lord appear beautiful and lovely,
with variety according to the life to which the celestial of the Lord can be
applied; and indeed those who have been endowed with charity, or vivified
by it, appear like boys and girls with most beautiful countenances; and those
who are in innocence, like naked infants, variously adorned with garlands of
flowers encircling their bosoms, and diadems upon their heads, living and
sporting in a diamond-like aura, and having a perception of happiness from
the very inmost."

== THE SERPENT
Genesis 3

In all classes the connection with past material may be made
by reviewing the order of creation, pointing out the difference
between men and animals, and then speaking of the Garden of
Eden as the beautiful state in which men came to dwell and in
which they might have remained if they had been obedient and
had not begun to trust in self instead of in the Lord. Speak of the
two trees and of the Lord's command with regard to the tree of
knowledge of good and evil.

Doctrinal Points
The two opposing central principles: trust in the Lprd and trust in

self

The doctrine of "appearances"-in connection with the statement

that the Lord "cursed" Adam and Eve and the serpent.

Notes for Parents

The story of the Garden of Eden is familiar to everyone. Before
the development of natural science men accepted it as literally
true, and the doctrine of "original sin"-the teaching that the sin
of Adam was inherited by all his descendants-grew out of this
literal acceptance. With greater knowledge of the natural world,
however, men began to doubt the early chapters of Genesis. Some
discarded them altogether and came to believe that everyone is
born good and that a child's early environment is responsible for
the bad things that appear in him. Others closed their minds to
the findings of science and clung to their belief in the literal stories
and in original sin.

But if we see that in these chapters, as we said last week, the
Lord is not telling us about the natural history of the world and
of man, but about spiritual development, we can understand that
these stories are not literal fact and yet are true stories-stories of
how the character of the human race developed and changed and
how our individual characters develop and change.

If God is pure love and wisdom, as we believe Him to be, how
themselves by
did evil come into the world? Men introduced it
choosing to trust in their own wisdom instead of in the Lord's.
Trust in themselves was the tree of knowledge of good and evil
whose fruit they had been commanded not to eat. And what made
them disobey? The promptings of their own sensuous desires, the
same serpent which tempts us today and leads us to sacrifice our
higher natures for the sake of the worldly satisfactions we think
we want right now. How many times a week do we think-and
even say-"I know I shouldn't, but ..."? The story of Adam and
Eve and the serpent is as true today as when it was written thou 
sands of years ago.

But why were men created in such a way that they could choose
to serve themselves and so become evil? Because freedom to choose
is essentially what makes them men and not mere animals. They
were made "in the image of God" and must be able to choose
freely what they will love and learn and do. There would be no
virtue or happiness in doing right if we could do nothing else. We
know what happens to a child if his parents never give him an
opportunity to learn to use his own judgment. The Lord is a wise
parent.

Primary
Read the story to the children from the Word (Genesis 3:1-13). If they are
old enough to ask whether the story is true, they should be told that it is a
parable and that its truth is in its inner meaning. Then remind them that man
was told to rule over the lower creatures. Eve let the serpent rule over her
instead. Finally talk about the ways in which the children often behave as
Adam and Eve did.

We have learned about how the Lord made everything in the
the seas, the dry land, the
beginning:
sun, moon, and stars, the fish, birds, and animals, and finally men and women. He gave the men and women a beautiful garden to
live in called the Garden of Eden, which was full of all sorts of
trees and fruits. In the beginning men and women did not wear
clothes at all, because they were just like innocent little babies.
There were two principal trees in the garden. The one in the
very center of the garden was called the tree of life, and the other
was called the tree of knowledge of good and eviL There \yas just
one thing the Lord told men and women they must not do: they
must not eat the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and eviL
They could eat any of the other fruit they wanted.

Now you know that when your mother tells you there is some
one thing you just must not do, very often something inside you
starts right in urging you to do it. In our chapter for today the
Lord tells us a story about what the first men and women did.
He calls the men Adam and the women Eve. As you listen to the
story, you will see that the thing which makes people want to do
what they know they should not do is called the serpent. A serpent
is a snake. Did you ever see a snake creep out from where it had
been hiding? Our desire to do as we please instead of thinking
what
like a snake always hiding in our hearts.
[Read Genesis 3: 1-13.]

is right

is just

Don't you think the first people were very foolish to disobey
the Lord when He had given them all that they could possibly
need to make them happy? They had to leave the beautiful garden,
and they could never be happy in the same way again.
But we are just as foolish when we do things we have been told not to do.
We know that everything goes better for us when we are good and obedient.
But deep inside each of us that same serpent is hiding, waiting for a chance
to tempt us to disobey, and he is very clever at arguments.
Adam and Eve had to leave the beautiful garden.
When we insist on having our own way, we lose many good things we might
have had.
How did the Lord guard the way to the garden afterward?

THE SERPENT

symbol stories telling us in figurative terms the great truths which the Lord
wants us to know about the beginning of mankind and about how evil came
into the world, and also about our own development and how we allow evil
to come into our minds and hearts. Study the notes below for suggestions as
to how the lesson may be developed.

What is the first chapter of the Bible about?
What did the Lord create first?
What did He create last?
In whose image and likeness was man created?
What powers does this give him which animals do not have?
What was man told to do with regard to the earth and everything on it?
What does the word Adam mean?

In the next few chapters of the Bible the first people are spoken
of as if they were just one man and woman-Adam and Eve. Eve is
it means "living." Read verse 20 of our
another Hebrew word;
chapter. These first people developed gradually until they became
a church, which is called the Most Ancient Church. They were
good and innocent, trusting the Lord for everything just as a little
baby depends on its parents. The state in which they lived is
described in chapter 2 as a beautiful garden called the Garden of
Eden, which means the garden of delight. Now read verses 15 to
17 of chapter 2.

What were Adam and Eve to do in the garden?
What was the one thing they must not do?

Do you always obey your parents? Can you tell why not? You
know that they love you and that what they tell you to do or not
to do is always for your good. And you know that when you dis 
obey, you always get into trouble. And yet there just seems to be
something in you that always tempts you to do the very thing you
have been told not to do. In the story of Adam and Eve this selfish
desire to have one's own way is pictured by the serpent.

What did the serpent tell Eve?
What did Eve do?
What did Adam do?

Read Revelation 3: 17-18. When the Lord in these verses tells
the people that they are naked and need to buy white raiment of
Him, He is not speaking of clothing for their physical bodies but
of true ideas to clothe their minds. Adam and Eve had listened to
the serpent instead of to the Lord. Before that they had known
that only the Lord can give us the truth. This is why they are said
to have been naked. After they had eaten of the forbidden fruit,
they suddenly realized how wrong they had been to disobey the
Lord who gave them everything; and they were ashamed, just as
you are ashamed after you have disobeyed your parents. And they
tried to hide from the Lord just as you try to keep out of your
parents' sight for fear they will find out what you have been doing.
Sometimes you can hide things from other people but none of us
can hide anything from the Lord, because He sees our thoughts
and our hearts.

When you are a little older, you will study the meaning of the
"curses" on the serpent, the woman, and the man which were pro 
nounced because of their disobedience, but you can understand
now that these curses did not really come from the Lord, except
in the sense that the Lord in His wisdom created an orderly world
in which we may be sure what the results of good or evil actions
will be. The curses were the natural results of the disobedience
itself. We learned previously that man is made in the image and
likeness of God, with the power to reason and to choose what he
will do and be. The Lord does everything He can to show us the
way to happiness, but He will not make us follow it, because that
would take away our human powers. When we choose to disobey,
trouble always follows because we are going against
the way of
happiness. And we are very likely to blame other people instead of
ourselves, just as Adam and Eve did.

In the story Adam and Eve had to leave the beautiful garden
and work for their food instead of receiving it from the Lord.
This means that once men had disobeyed, it began to be harder
and harder for them to do right. You know how this is, too. One
wrong thing leads to another and you form bad habits which are
hard to break. From the time pictured in our story mankind as a
whole grew worse and worse, although, as we shall see in an up-

THE SERPENT

coming lesson, there were always a few people who tried to do
right.

There are two verses in our lesson which you should notice even
though you will not understand them until later. One is verse 15.
This is the first "prophecy of the Advent" which appears in the
Word. This means that it foretells that someday a child would be
born who would always refuse to do what the serpent suggested
and so would stop the long downward trend of mankind. Only the
Lord Himself could do this. Then read the last verse of the chapter.
You will hear of the cherubim again and you want to remember
where in the Bible they first appeared and what they were doing.
They are symbolic figures, not actual creatures or people, and they
stand for the power of the Lord to protect goodness.

Now let us see if you can think why our desire to do wrong is
described as a serpent. What do you mean when you call a person
a pig? When you call him a fox? When you call him a lion? All the
animals have special characteristics for which they are known. The
most ancient people knew what everything in nature represented
and they spoke in the language of "correspondences," naming the
animal or thing when they meant its special quality. You know
how the serpent or snake just slides along the ground and how it
slips in and out of hiding, how snakes can "charm" their prey so
that it cannot run away, and how a poisonous snake can bite even
before you see it. This is just what our lower or "sense" nature
does. It clings to the things of the world, not looking up to heaven
and the Lord;
it holds our attention so that we do not try to
escape its reasoning, and it is always hiding in us, trying to "bite"
us-to make us believe that the most important thing in the world
is to have our own way and get what we want right now. Every
time you are tempted to do what you know is wrong, your lower
nature is arguing with your higher nature just as the serpent argued
with Eve. Eve did not have to listen to the serpent, and neither do you.

=== Intermediate

The special lesson for this age group is the general correspondence of the Gar 
den of Eden, the two trees, and the serpent. Point out to the class that these
first chapters of the Bible treat of the early spiritual history of the human race
and also of our individual spiritual development.

plants represent thoughts, or things of the mind, and animals
things of the heart or will. Trees represent great general principles.
After the first people had been developed into a church, according
to the process we studied in the first chapter of Genesis, their state
is described as the beautiful Garden of Eden about which chapter 2
tells us. There were all kinds of trees in this garden, but there were
two principar ones, the tree of life and the tree of knowledge of
good and evil. The tree of life pictures the great general principle
that everything lives from the Lord and that all wisdom and good 
ness come from Him. Read verses 9 and 17 of chapter 2 and then
verse 3 of chapter 3 to see what change had taken place in the
state of mankind by the time of the beginning of our lesson for
today. The tree of life is no longer in the center of the garden.
This means that people were losing their feeling that all they had
came from the Lord. The tree of knowledge of good and evil is the
principle that we of ourselves know what is right and wrong and
do not need to look to the Lord for knowledge. We often hear
people say, "If I do what I think is right, that is all that can be
expected of me."
The serpent,

like all other members of the animal kingdom,
represents an affection. It is the affection for sense pleasures, eat 
ing, drinking, dressing well, dancing, movies, sports, having fun.
It is a good and useful affection in its place, but it may easily lead
us astray.

Things we have been told not to do often look pleasant and
harmless. We tell ourselves that we know what is good for us better
than our parents-or even the Lord-and that we can do these
things without any harm. This is the serpent saying to Eve, "Ye
shall not surely die." He spoke to Eve because Eve pictures our
will, and it is our will which is tempted. Later we think out argu-

THE SERPENT

ments to prove that we are right; this is Adam receiving the fruit
from Eve and eating it. We soon find out how little we really know.
This is Adam and Eve discovering that they are naked. [Read Rev 
elation 3: 17-18.1 But instead of turning back to trust in the Lord,
we excuse ourselves by pointing to our good deeds. The fig leaves
are such thoughts about our natural goodness. We say, "After all,
no one can be expected to be perfect, and I'm pretty good most
of the time."

Once we have begun to believe that we can decide for ourselves
without the Lord, we have lost the beautiful inner life of innocence
and trust with which we started life. This is the death of which
the Lord had warned Adam and Eve, and it is pictured by their
being driven out of the garden. When we begin to look to self
instead of to the Lord, we get into all kinds of trouble. The thorns
and thistles of false thoughts spring up in our minds and we have
to work hard {or what goodness we can acquire. The Lord, when
He was in the world, said, "My yoke is easy, and my burden is
light." His way is really always the easy way, if we would only
believe it. The curses on Adam and Eve picture the natural result
of trying to go our own way-it becomes harder and harder for us
to do right even when we see what is right.

Read carefully the serpent's punishment (verse 14) and see how
true a picture it is of our love of the pleasures of the senses. They
never really rise higher than the things of this world and they live
on "dust."

Only one Person, the Lord Himself, has ever wholly overcome
the temptations pictured by the serpent. Verse 15 is the first
prophecy of His coming. It means that a time would come when
a child would be born into the world who would feel all the temp 
tations of the senses-the serpent would bite his heel-but would
always say no to them-He would bruise the serpent's head. The
head is the governing principle of a thing, and the Lord put the
principle of pleasure-seeking under His foot, where it, belongs.
Read the story of Moses and the bronze serpent in Numbers 21:
4-9 and the reference to it in John 3: 14-15. The serpents which bit
the children of Israel in the wilderness were their appetites for
sense satisfaction. The serpent of bronze pictures the right use of
these appetites. The Lord used His sense life rightly and so lifted it
up into a means of saving people. Our senses, like everything else,
are given us as means of being useful to the Lord and the neighbor.
they lead us further and
further astray. The serpent of our chapter for today becomes the
dragon in the Book of Revelation. If we try to fight our temp 
tations, the Lord and the angels fight with us and help us to over 
come them. Read Revelation 12:7-9 and 20: 1-3.

When our senses are made a guide,

Now read verse 24. The cherubim are symbolic figures represent 
ing the Lord's protecting power, and the flaming sword is truth
inspired by love which protects the good and checks the evil. This
is why the sword is two-edged. Read Exodus 25: 16-21. The Ten
Commandments-which were kept
in the ark-are our first and
most powerful means of fighting temptation.

Basic Correspondences

the trees = general principles

the fig tree = the principle of natural goodness
the serpent = the affection for the things of

the senses

cherubim = the Lord's providence protecting

true goodness

Senior
The problem of the origin of evil in the race and in the individual is the center
of this lesson. The Seniors need to be shown clearly the nature of trust in self
and the mistakes and suffering to which it leads. They are about to pass from
under parental and home influence, and they should be led to feel the need
of the Lord's guidance.

We have studied the Creation story as it applies to the spiritual
development of any individual. This spiritual development is known
as regeneration. The inner state of the regenerate man or woman
is described in chapter 2 as a garden, the garden of Eden or "de 
light." The regenerate person is happy because he is not always

THE SERPENT

thinking about himself but trusts wholly in the Lord, knowing that
all goodness and truth come from Him alone and that if he obeys
the Lord, whatever happens to him will be for his eternal welfare.
This principle is pictured by the tree of life which was in the midst
of the garden. As we have seen, however, man was to dress and
keep the garden and to have dominion over all things in it. That is,
the regenerate man must choose to continue to live the spiritual
life, keeping his lower desires under control. The first men did not
do this, just as none of us fully does it. They developed into a
church-the Most Ancient Church-with a very high degree of spiri 
tuallife, and then they began to trust in themselves instead of in
the Lord. Just in this manner it sometimes happens that a man or
woman who has come to believe in the Lord, has set his life in
order and perhaps joined the church, begins to think that he has
learned enough and can henceforth decide for himself what is right
and wrong, true and false.

The chapter we have for today treats of the decline of the Most
Ancient Church and of the way in which evil entered the world.
From verse 3 we learn that an important change has taken place
in the garden. The tree of knowledge of good and evil has taken
the place of the tree of life in the center. This tree is the principle
that we can distinguish between right and wrong without looking
to the Lord for guidance~ When once we begin to think of our 
selves as independent of. the Lord, we tend to believe ourselves to
be the source of goodness and truth. The Lord cannot prevent our
developing this belief without taking away our freedom; He can
only warn us against it. When He says of the tree of knowledge of
good and evil, "Ve shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it,
lest ye die," He is saying, "Never for a moment admit into your
mind the thought that you have goodness and wisdom in yourself,
for that is spiritual death."

What is it that tempts us to choose our own guidance? It is first
some desire for external satisfaction-the serpent of sense pleasure.
It seduces our will-Eve. Here is something I want very much to
do. I have been taught that it is wrong and dangerous, but it looks
just the opposite to me. I cannot believe that anything so attract 
ive can really be bad. Someone is just trying to keep me from
enjoying myself. So our desire, like Eve, passes on the tempting
fruit to our reasoning faculty, and both yield.

The immediate result is a sense of our own wrongdoing and an
attempt to cover it up with excuses-the fig leaves are thoughts
about our own natural goodness. But we are driven out of the
garden. We have lost our innocence and trust and all the delights
that went with it. Doing right will now be harder for us and we
shall constantly have to fight the thorns and thistles of selfish and
worldly thinking.

We should note particularly the guard set at the gate of the
garden "to keep the way of the tree of life." Throughout the
Scriptures cherubim are symbolic figures picturing the protecting
power of Divine Providence. The sword is the symbol of truth
fighting-the flaming sword the truth from Divine Love-one edge
condemning evil and the other defending good.
Once our will has developed selfish feelings,

the Lord can no
longer guide us by means of it. We cannot go back to the garden.
We must learn "the hard way." That is, we must come to see for
ourselves the unhappy effects of disobedience and make ourselves
do right against our will. You may sometimes hear people say of
an innocent baby, "I wish he could always stay like this." They do
not really mean it, of course, but they dread for their children the
hard lessons they must learn. And there is no other way now to
spiritual progress. Even though we often choose evil
instead of
good and suffer for it, we cannot become truly human beings
without developing our independent reason and exercising our
free choice.

The curses on the serpent, the woman, and the man picture the
inevitable results of self-trust and disobedience to the Lord. The
story of the human race as we follow it from chapter 2 of Genesis
through the Old Testament is one of decline and constant struggle.
In the New Church we do not believe in "original sin" in the sense
that the sin of Adam and Eve made all people thereafter guilty.

THE SERPENT

No one is ever born guilty of sin. But tendencies to evil are handed
down and, if not checked, increase. Mankind declined spiritually
until the time came when no merely human being could resist its
temptations. Then the Lord Himself had to come into the world
to bruise the serpent's head and turn the tide for us. Verse 15 of
our chapter is the first prophecy of the Advent.

Adult

The question of the origin of evil and the decline of the human race will fur 
nish ample discussion material. The temptation of the serpent in our modern
world is a powerful force for evil.

The serpent is the symbol of the sensuous part of man. If we
think a little, we can see that there is a mental as well as a physical
basis in each of the five senses. For example, when we are absorbed
in a book, someone may speak to us several times without being
heard. There is nothing the matter with our ears, but our conscious 
ness is temporarily withdrawn from the sense plane. We are living
in another world. The sensuous plane of our mind is closed for the
time being. So we may walk along the street thinking so hard that
we pass a close friend without seeing him, although we look right
at him. In times of great excitement people can injure themselves
severely and feel no pain until the excitement is past. So we can
see that there is actually a distinct plane of our mind that is in
contact with the natural world through the five senses. This is what
Swedenborg calls the "sensuous" part of man (meaning simply that
which pertains to sense impressions rather than thoughts) and what
is signified by the serpent. The sensuous part is necessary to us.
We could not live in this world without it. But it is meant to be
merely the servant of the higher planes of our minds. The serpent
has a good as well as an evil correspondence. The Lord said to His
apostles, "Be ye therefore wise as serpents, and harmless as doves"
(Matthew 10: 16). This means to take advantage of all the knowl 
edge which comes to us through our senses, but to use it always
for good and never for harm to ourselves or anyone else. And we remember that when the children of Israel were going through the
wilderness and were plagued by fiery serpents because of their lust
and disobedience, Moses was told to make a serpent of bronze and
raise it up on a pole, and those who looked at it were healed. The
serpent of bronze was the symbol of sensuous things turned to
good use. Later, when this bronze serpent became an object of
worship in itself, Hezekiah destroyed it because it was leading
people away from the worship of the Lord, as today the doctrine
that goodness is in external good works leads people to think it is
not particularly important to go to church or to learn about the
Lord. When the Lord was in the world, He likened His own human
nature to this serpent of bronze lifted up.
But the serpent, as our lesson says,

is "more subtle than any
beast of the field." Our senses are constantly bringing us im 
pressions and appealing to us in many ways at once. Many of the
things they bring us are delightful-the beauties of nature, music,
odors, flavors, caresses. It is very easy to come to depend upon
them and to refuse to believe anything which our senses do not
confirm, and thus to look to ourselves for knowledge and power
instead of to the Lord. This is the temptation of the serpent, first
to the woman-our affections-and then through the woman to the
man-our intellect. Pleasures of the senses first appeal to us because
they are delightful, and then our minds begin to think up reasons
why we should indulge in them; and if there is a command of the
Lord which forbids them, we refuse to believe the Lord or that
any evil can come because of our indulgence. So in the story the
serpent first put doubt in the woman's mind of the truth of the
Lord's words. This is the beginning of all evil-the temptation to
reason and judge according to what our senses tell us instead of
according to what the Lord has revealed through His Word.

This thought is stated very clearly in AC 196: "In ancient times
those were called 'serpents' who had more confidence in sensuous
things than in revealed ones. But it is still worse at the present day,
for now there are persons who not only disbelieve everything they
cannot see and feel, but who also confirm themselves in such

THE SERPENT

incredulity by knowledges [scientifica] unknown to the ancients,
and thus occasion in themselves a far greater degree of blindness."
If we think of our sense life as the important thing, we shall lose
sight of the true meaning which only knowledge of the Lord and
of heavenly things can give to it. That the ancient people began to
reason from nature to God instead of from God to nature and to
refuse to believe what they could not confirm by their senses is
meant by their eating of the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good
and evil. In this way they gradually lost that immediate perception
of the truth which the celestial people had, but they did not lose it
all at once. They retained enough of it to know that they were
doing wrong-to recognize their evil state. This is pictured by verse
7, the fact
that they knew that they were naked. Here is intro 
the fig,
duced another correspondence which we should note:
symbolic of "natural goodness," the kindly feelings and thoughts
which even the most worldly people may have. How often when
we recognize some serious fault in ourselves, we try to cover it up
in our own minds by recalling our "good deeds." These thoughts
about natural goodness are the fig leaves with which Adam and
Eve tried to cover themselves. Garments correspond to truths and
nakedness to lack of truth. We may recall here that Hezekiah's boil
was cured by a lump of figs and th~t the Lord condemned a fig
tree which bore no fruit. These are stories which teach the necess 
ity of kind, neighborly living. But we must not think that natural
kindliness will excuse a lack of acceptance of truth from the Lord.
Without a desire for truth from the Lord natural kindliness and
good works are self-righteous and not genuinely good at all. Read
Revelation 3: 14-18.

In the study of the punishment meted out to the serpent, the
woman, and the man, we have our first introduction to the "doc 
trine of appearances." The Lord is perfect love. He never punishes.
Yet throughout the Word He is frequently said to be angry, to be
jealous~ to take revenge, to curse, to punish, etc. This is because
the Lord had to write the Word by means of men and in terms
which they would understand, and so the truth often takes the
form in which it appears to men, and when men are in evil states,
the truth appears to punish them. In the same way, to a child bent
on having his own way his parents' efforts to turn him into the
right way seem harsh and cruel. The punishments which the Lord
is said to mete out are inherent
in the evils committed. So the
sensuous part of man, when it leads man away from the Lord, is
condemned to go on its belly and eat dust-th.at is, to see only the
things of the earth and to feed on dead things. This is just what
our senses do when we trust
in them instead of in the Lord's
revealed truth. The woman is told: "In sorrow thou shalt bring
forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall
rule over thee." We remember that the woman pictures our own
will and that the first people, whose affections were centered in
the Lord, could be taught immediately through them. But when
the affections became centered in the world and in self, they could
not bring forth any truth or good except by bitter experience of
evil and punishment. The birth of children in the Word always
pictures in a good sense the bringing forth of truths and goods.
And the man is told that the ground is cursed for his sake and will
bring forth thorns and thistles. The mind of the self-centered man
is full of false ideas which plague him and make it difficult for him
to find the truth, and so he finds it hard to nourish his soul: "In
the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread." Finally they are cast
out of the garden, and cherubim with a flaming sword are placed
at its entrance "to keep the way of the tree of life." The cherubim
throughout
the Word are the symbol of the Divine Providence
protecting-in this case protecting men from profaning the highest
things of their nature. The sword in the Scriptures is either truth
or falsity used as a weapon. When a person persistently refuses to
live according to a truth which he knows, the belief that it is the
truth is finally taken away from him so that he may not go further
into a state of willful disobedience.

THE SERPENT

From the Writings of Swedenborg

Arcana Coelestia, nn. 194-195: "By the 'serpene is here meant the sensuous
part of man in which he trusts; by the 'wild animal of the field,' here, as
before, every affection of the external man; by the 'woman,' man's Own; by
the serpent's saying, 'Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree?' that
they began to doubt. The subject here treated of is the third posterity of the
Most Ancient Church, which began not to believe in things revealed unless
they saw and felt that they were so. Their first state, that it was one of doubt,
is described in this and the next following verse. The most ancient people did
not compare all things in man to beasts and birds, but so denominated them;
and this their customary manner of speaking remained even in the Ancient
Church after the flood, and preserved among the prophets. The sensuous
things in man they called 'serpents,' because as serpents live close to the earth,
so sensuous things are those next to the body. Hence also reasonings concern 
ing the mysteries of faith, founded on the evidence of the senses, were called
by them the 'poison of a serpent,' and the reasoners themselves 'serpents';
and because such persons reason much from the sensuous, that is, from visible
things (such as are things terrestrial, corporeal, mundane, and natural), it is
said that 'the serpent was more subtle than any wild animal of the field.'"

After the review of the last lesson the teacher in each class will
need to cover briefly the story of the Garden of Eden. The em 
phasis should be on the disobedience,
the reason for it, and the
resultant expulsion from the garden, treated in each case according
to the level of understanding of the class.

=== Doctrinal Points

The Lord knows the future and makes provision for 'it.
The early people knew the correspondence of everything in nature.
Worship of the Lord has no goodness in it unless there is love in

the heart.

All true love comes from the Lord as we learn of Him and obey

Him.

Notes for Parents

When the first people created upon the earth had reached the
stage of development pictured by the seventh day, they became
the first great "church," the Most Ancient Church. They were very
different from people today. They cared little for the things of this
world and lived in close touch with heaven, trusting the Lord and
depending upon Him for guidance and care, just as a little baby
depends on his parents. In the Bible the beautiful state in which
they lived is pictured as a garden-the Garden of Eden. Mythology
calls this the Golden Age.

But we all remember that there was one tree in the garden of
whose fruit
the Lord had commanded them not to eat, and that
the serpent tempted them to doubt the Lord's wisdom and to try
the forbidden fruit. The tree of knowledge of good and evil pic 
tures the belief that we ourselves are able to decide what is right

116
and wrong, and the serpent is our five natural senses, which show
us only the things of this material world.

When Adam and Eve listened to the serpent instead of to the
Lord and ate of the forbidden fruit, they were driven out of the
garden. As soon as a child yields to the promptings of his physical
nature and his natural
inheritance and begins to think that he
knows better than his parents, he loses the happy, trustful state of
infancy. As soon as a man decides that this world is all-important
and that he does not need the Lord to tell him how to live, he has
started on the downward path away from heavenly happiness.

After Adam and Eve were driven out of the garden, two sons
were born to them. Cain and Abel represent faith and charity.
Faith is recognition of the Lord in the mind and charity is love of
the Lord and the neighbor in the heart. They are brothers, meant
to work together and help each other in the service of the Lord.
these two
But when men think that they can guide themselves,
brothers are separated. Then faith in the Lord becomes mere "lip
service"-Cain's offering-and all genuine love is killed; for true,
unselfish love comes only from the Lord as we learn of Him and
obey Him.

The Lord did not allow Cain to be destroyed even after he had
killed his brother, because as long as we even say we believe in the
Lord and go through the outward forms of worship, there is hope
that we may read or hear something which will make us stop to
think and change our ways.

Primary

The notes suggest a simple approach to the lesson and a practical way of
connecting it with the children's experience. Stress the point of willful dis 
obedience and its results rather than going into detail about the garden and
the serpent. Cain's disposition can then be discussed as one of the conse 
quences of the original turning to self-will.

.

In the Bible, after the story of ,the creation of the earth and
the Lord tells us a story about the beautiful

everything on it,
Garden of Eden which He gave to men to live in. They had every 
thing they could possibly want. There was only one thing He told
them not to do, and that was to eat of the fruit of one particular
tree, the tree of knowledge of good and evil.

But the first people, who in the story are called Adam and Eve,
wanted to try this fruit and so they disobeyed the Lord, just as
you sometimes make up your mind to do the very thing your
father and mother have told you not to do, even though you have
been told plainly that something bad will happen if you do it.
Adam and Eve, because they wanted to have their own way instead
of obeying the Lord, had to leave the beautiful garden and go out
and work very hard for their living.

After a while Adam and Eve had two sons. Let us read the story

about them. [Read Genesis 4: 1-15.]

Who was the first son of Adam and Eve?
Who was the second?
What was Cain's occupation?
What was Abel's?
What offerings did they bring to the Lord?
Why did the Lord not accept Cain's offering?
The Lord is never deceived when we only pretend to be good.
He knows our hearts.
How did Cain show that the Lord had judged him correctly?
What did he say when the Lord asked him where Abel was?
Really each one of us is his brother's keeper.
Each of us should do all he can to help others.

When we listen to the first part of this story, it seems to us,
doesn't it, that both brothers were tiying to please the Lord, and
that Cain's offering was just as good as Abel's. But the Lord knows
what
is in our hearts, and He saw that Cain was only pretending
to be good. Cain did not really love the Lord. The kind of feelings
he had in his heart were the kind which led him to kill his brother.
If there is love in our hearts, we will show it by trying never to
hurt other people but instead always to help them and make them
happy.
Junior

This class should have a thorough review of the story of the Garden of Eden.
They should have the details of the story fixed in their minds, but should also
understand that it is a Divine allegory which teaches us about the spiritual
history of mankind and about developments in our own souls.

In how many days or stages was the world created?
What was the final creation?
How does man differ from the animals?
What is his proper relation to the other things in the world?
What did the Lord do on the seventh day?
How did He set the seventh day apart?
When the Lord was in the world, what did He do on the sabbath day?
What simple rule did He give for it?

You all know the story of Adam and Eve and the Garden of
Eden which follows the story of creation. Let us see how many of
the details we remember.

How was the Garden of Eden watered?
Into how many branches did the river divide?
What tree was in the midst of the garden?
What other tree is mentioned?
What were Adam and Eve told about this second tree?
What did the Lord say would happen if they ate of its fruit?
Who persuaded them to disobey the Lord?
How were they punished?

We know that this story is an allegory, a kind of parable,
in
which the Lord is describing for us-under the figure of the beauti 
ful, fruitful garden and the man Adam and his wife Eve-the happy,
peaceful state of the people of the Most Ancient Church, the first
church formed among men after they had been instructed and
developed by the Lord. Over and over again in the Bible the Lord
tells us that if we will only learn the true way of life from Him and
follow it, He will give us freely everything we need and will make
us happy. The trouble with us-just as with Adam and Eve in the
story-is that we think we know better than the Lord what is good
for us. So we disobey first our parents and teachers and afterward
the Lord Himself, and then we have to learn "the hard way."

CAIN AND ABEL

And our story goes on to show us that one disobedience leads
to others. After they were driven out of the garden we learn that
Adam and Eve had two sons.

What were their names?
Which was the older?
What was his occupation?
What was Abel's occupation?
What offering did Cain bring to the Lord?
What offering did Abel bring?
Which offering did the Lord accept?

When we first read this story, we sometimes think the Lord was
unfair. The two offerings were different but apparently each man
brought the best he had. When you are a little older, you will learn
what each of these offerings really represents, but even in the lit 
eral story you can find the explanation of the Lord's rejection of
Cain's offering if you 10G>k for it. Read verse 7 and remember what
kind of person Cain afterward showed himself to be.

You know that we sometimes pretend to be good when we are
not, but the Lord always sees our hearts. Cain pretended to be
worshiping the Lord when he brought his offering, but his heart
was selfish. He was really just
trying to buy the Lord's favor.
People today may do the same thing. They may pretend to believe
in the Lord and may go to church regularly and give money to the
church and for charity when there is no love for the L9rd or the
neighbor in their hearts. Like Cain, they are just trying to win
favor and honor, and when they do not get what they want, they
become angry and try to hurt other people, just as Cain in the
story rose up and slew his brother Abel. Cain's character was just
a further development of the wrong turning which Adam and Eve
took when they chose to follow their own judgment instead of
obeying the Lord. Cain did not want to acknowledge his obligation
to love the Lord and cherish his brother. If we obey the Lord,
each one of us sees that he must be his brother's keeper, helping
those about him in every possible way.

You can see how this story pictures for us the difference be-
tween genuine love for the Lord and a declaration of belief in Him
which has no real love in it. Love and faith are two brothers who
must live and work together. When either one is destroyed, unhap 
piness follows. Cain became "a fugitive and a vagabond in the
earth." He would always have to live in fear and he would never
have a settled home. Selfish and evil people are always in this
unhappy state inside, even when they seem to be prosperous out 
wardly.

The Lord did not permit Cain to be killed. Cain represents faith,
and faith is necessary. For as long as we even profess to believe in
the Lord, there is always a chance that we may see our selfishness
and turn from it and begin to do better. Read Ezekiel 18: 23.

Intermediate

The emphasis should be on the use the people of the Most Ancient Church
made of their freedom of choice, and on its direct result in the separation of
faith and charity. Clear instruction should be given as to the meaning of faith
and charity and the necessity of both in our lives.

We are all familiar with the story of the Garden of Eden, and
you have perhaps learned that it is an allegory given us by the Lord
to hold in our minds as a picture of the peaceful, happy state in
which the man lives who is in genuine love to the Lord, trusting
the Lord completely and looking to Him for guidance and support
in all things. This was the state of the people of the Most Ancient
Church and is the state of the celestial angels. The picture given us
of the Garden of Eden is a more detailed development of the state
described by the seventh day-the goal of creation.

But we know that the people of the Most Ancient Church did
not remain in this happy state. They were men and women-not
mere automatic recipients of the Lord's blessings. They had their
own reasoning faculty and they had freedom of choice, just as we
have today. In time they became restless under the Lord's direc 
tion and wanted to lead themselves. This is represented in the story
of the temptation of Eve by the serpent and the eating of the for-

CAl N AND ABEL

bidden fruit. Then they were driven out of the garden to "till the
ground" from which they were taken. They had chosen to lead
themselves, and the happy,
innocent, peaceful state was gone.
From that time on they had to work for their spiritual bread.

Now in the story Adam and Eve have two sons. All through the
Word the birth of children pictures new developments of goodness
and truth or of evil and falsity-depending on the spiritual state of
the parents. When the first people were driven out of the garden,
they had taken a downward step spiritually, but they were by no
means evil. They still recognized the Lord and intended to serve
Him. But their desire to decide for themselves led to a divided
mind, because they were resisting the Lord's guidance. In the Word
when two sons are born, one always represents truth or faith, and
the other goodness or charity. Faith is belief in the Lord in our
minds. Charity is love for the Lord in our hearts. Both are necess 
ary, because we have to learn what is right and we have to want to
do it. The two "brothers" should always be each other's "keepers."
But we know that sometimes people have good intentions but
do not make the effort to learn what is right, and also that some 
times people who know the truth and acknowledge it with their
minds do not want to live according to it. In our story Cain rep 
resents faith. He was a tiller of the ground, and the ground rep 
resents the mind. Abel represents charity. He was a keeper of
sheep, and sheep represent innocent good affections.

Each brought to the Lord an offering of the fruit of his own toil
and the Lord accepted Abel's offering and rejected Cain's. Does
this mean that the Lord wants our hearts but not our minds? That
He wants us to love Him without trying to understand Him? The
Lord said, "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart,
and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind. This is the first and
great commandment." In our religion we must use our minds as
well as our hearts. And in the story the Lord says to Cain, "If thou
doest well, shalt thou not be accepted?" It was not Cain's offering
that was at fault but what was behind it in Cain's heart. For the
Lord knows our hearts. Do people ever profess to believe in God,
go to church, and support the church because it will make them
better pleased with themselves and more respected in the com 
munity in which they live?

When people try to appear religious for selfish reasons, charity 
true love of the Lord and the neighbor-is killed. Cain's jealous
rage in the story is repeated again and again with all self-centered
people. His question, "Am I my brother's keeper?" is answered by
the Lord Himself in John 13: 34, an answer which is incorporated
in our own Statement of Faith. We should all know this verse, for
it is a bulwark against selfish passions.

When faith is separated from charity-that is, when people think
it is enough to know what is right without doing it-their minds
have no firm foundation. A good, kindly life is the true home of
the soul. Selfish people are driven from this home and wander
about from one disappointment to another, a prey to falsity and
evil. So Cain became a fugitive and a vagabond. But the Lord pro 
tected Cain so that he should not be killed. Faith-the study and
acceptance of the truth-is absolutely necessary to us, for without
it we have only our own ideas to guide us. So the Lord always
preserves faith in the world somewhere.

Senior

The young people should be led to think seriously of the practical effects of
the separation of faith and charity in the individual and in the history of the
church and the world. The quotation from AC 362 at the end of the lesson
should be read and discussed, as it describes a tendency to which we all are
subject and which is the cause of many conflicts.

Cain and Abel are the first of several pairs of brothers in the
Bible. When our desire and our thought unite-which all marriages

CAIN AND ABEL

in the Word picture-they produce results in our hearts and in our
minds. These are the children. Usually new desires are pictured by
daughters and new thoughts by sons. But as our desires come to
our consciousness in our minds, things of the will may also be pic 
tured by sons. So two brothers always picture the will and the
t.hought side of a new development.

We say that Cain and Abel picture faith and charity: mental
acceptance of a truth and the will to do it. The two are brothers.
They belong together. For truth is of no use to us if we do not live
according to it, and the desire to do right comes to nothing if we
do not know what is right.

Cain, who represents faith, is born first because every new step
in our progress through life comes to us first through some new
knowledge or idea entering the mind. But Swedenborg tells us that
into each truth that we learn the Lord insinuates the feeling that
to live according to it. This is the birth of Abel, or
we ought
charity. And it is the basis of what we call conscience.

Cain's offering of the fruit of the ground is our acceptance of
truth with our minds. This is necessary and right, but it is worth 
less unless our will is to live according to the truth. Abel's offering
represents this acceptance by the will. The Lord said to Cain, "If
thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted?" Goodness is nothing
else than living according to the truth from a desire to serve the
Lord. When we see the truth but do not try to live according to it,
the Cain in us kills his "brother" Abel. His punishment is that he
becomes a fugitive and a vagabond, When we do not apply to our
conduct the truths that we learn, we live in constant fear of dis 
grace or punishment and our minds have no settled abiding place.
One common idea of faith is that it is blind belief in something
we cannot understand, and a widespread idea of charity is that it
is giving to the poor. The New Church regards them quite differ 
ently. Faith is belief in what we have found to be true, belief
which actually directs our thought and action. And charity is the
desire of the will to serve the Lord and the neighbor instead of
self. Faith is not really faith unless we act according to it, and
charity is not really charity unless it looks to the Lord for guidance
and recognizes Him as the giver of all good.

From our lesson for today we learn that the separation of faith
and charity-which is something we find in ourselves as well as in
the life of the world about us-began long ago in the Most Ancient
Church. You may remember from our last lesson that the serpent's
words to Eve (Genesis 3: 1-5) picture the first inclination of men
to question the truth as it came to them from the Lord and to rely
on their own judgment based on what they saw about them in the
world, and that this was the beginning of the decline of the Most
Ancient Church. The separation of faith and charity is the inevi 
table result of the choice of self as a guide in place of the Lord.
The quotations at the end of this lesson show how this separation
affected all later history.

Adult
Since this lesson on the Ancient Church will be centered on the end rather
than on the beginning of that church, it will be better to point out the differ 
ence between the two "churches" in this lesson. Discussion should also bring
out the fact that "faith alone" is a doctrine still common in some churches
and that as individuals we are all believers in that doctrine to the extent that
we take it for granted that we shall get to heaven just because we go to church.

We have seen that the seventh day of creation-in addition to its
meaning for our individual lives-pictured the celestial state of the
people of the Most Ancient Church, a state in which, because they
loved the Lord and trusted Him wholly, they could be instructed
in His truth by an inner way. This beautiful state is further pic 
tured by the description of the Garden of Eden.

But we remember that men were not content to remain in this
state. Self-consciousness developed in them-represented by the
creation of Eve-and through it the temptation to reason from the
evidence of their physical senses-the serpent-instead of trusting
the inner dictate of truth from the Lord. So they were driven out
of the garden. Man, once he begins to develop self-consciousness
and to assert himself, loses the innocent, trustful state of his early

CAIN AND ABEL

infancy and comes into the hard necessity of learning from experi 
ence. We think of the development of a child as an advance from
infancy to maturity, and on the external plane it is; but spiritually
it is a decline, a progression downward from the celestial to the
natural state.

it

In the internal historical sense of the Word we see this decline
clearly in the description of the character of the successive churches.
The story of the birth of Cain and Abel and the slaying of Abel by
Cain is the basis of our understanding of this decline. Swedenborg
says of it: "As this chapter treats of the degeneration of the Most
Ancient Church, or the falsification of its doctrine, and conse 
quently of its heresies and sects, under the names of Cain and his
descendants,
is to be observed that there is no possibility of
understanding how doctrine was falsified, or what was the nature
of the heresies and sects of that church, unless the nature of the
true church be rightly .understood. Enough has been said above
concerning the Most Ancient Church, showing that it was a celes 
tial man, and that it acknowledged no other faith than that which
was of love to the Lord and toward the neighbor. Through this
love they had faith from the Lord, or a perception of all the things
that belonged to faith ... But the case is far different at this day,
for now faith takes precedence of charity, but still through faith
charity is give.n by the Lord, and then charity becomes the princi 
pal. It follows from this that in the most ancient time d~ctrine was
falsified when they made confession of faith, and thus separated it
from love. Those who falsified doctrine in this way, or separated
faith from love, or made confession of faith alone, were then called
'Cain.' "

The name Cain means "possession." Cain represents faith, a faith
of the mind, believed to be self-derived and so separated from
charity. Abel represents charity, love to the Lord and the neighbor
in the heart. Abel was a keeper of·sheep. Sheep, we know, rep 
resent innocent affections. Cain was a tiller of the ground. The
ground is the mind in its natural state. We are told (AC 345) that
the ground' who look to bodily and
"Those were said to 'till
earthly things." Both Cain and Abel brought offerings to the Lord,
the offerings representing worship. Of Cain's offering Swedenborg
says: "That by the 'fruit of the ground' are meant the works of
faith without charity, appears also from what follows; for the
works of faith devoid of charity are works of no faith, being in
themselves dead, for they are solely of the external man" (AC 348).
Abel's offering of the firstlings of the flock and of the fat thereof
represents love and the faith thence derived, the fat representing
"the celestial itself."

Even in the letter we are not left in doubt as to the reason why
Cain's offering was not accepted. The Lord looks upon the heart,
and in the Lord's sight Cain did not "do well." The state of his
heart became evident when he slew his brother. Of this, as it ap 
plies to the later state of the church, Swedenborg says (AC 369):
". . . while both faith and charity were from the doctrine of faith,
yet faith separate from love could not but disregard and thereby
extinguish charity; as is the case at the present day with those who
maintain that faith alone saves, without any work of charity, for
in this very supposition they extinguish charity." Cain's attitude is
also clearly expressed in his question, "Am I my brother's keeper?"
Nevertheless, the Lord does not permit Cain to be destroyed.
The killing of Abel represented the destruction of the innocent
love in the heart through which, up to that time, the Lord had
been able to instruct and guide mankind. The Lord had foreseen
that man would develop in this direction and was providing a new
means of reaching him and saving him from himself. of the suc 
cessive churches on the earth only the Most Ancient Church was
type. In AC 393 we read: "The Most Ancient
of the celestial
Church was of such a character as to acknowledge no faith except
that which is of love, insomuch that they were unwilling even to
mention faith, for through love from the Lord they perceived all
things that belong to faith. Such also are the celestial angels of
whom we have spoken above. But as it was foreseen that the
human race could not continue to be of this character, but would
separate faith from love to the Lord, and would make faith a

CAIN AND ABEL

it was provided that

doctrine by itself,
they should indeed be
separated, but in such a way that through faith-that is, through
the knowledges of faith-men might receive from the Lord charity,
so that knowledge or hearing should come first, and then through
knowledge or hearing, charity-that is, love toward the neighbor,
and mercy-might be given by the Lord, which charity should not
only be inseparable from faith, but should also constitute the prin 
cipal of faith. And then instead of the perception they had in
the Most Ancient Church, there succeeded conscience, acquired
through faith joined to charity, which dictated not what is true,
" but that it is true, and this because the Lord has so said in the
Word." Faith-even faith without charity-is better than no faith
at all. So long as a man recognizes God with his mind there is a
possibility that something in the Word may strike home to his
heart and that he may "come to himself," as we read of the prodi 
gal son (Luke 15: 17-191: "And when he came to himself, he said,
How many hired servants of my father's have bread enough and
to spare, and I perish with hunger! I will arise and go to my father,
and will say unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and
before thee, And am no more worthy to be called thy son: make
me as one of thy hired servants."

From the Writings of Swedenborg
Arcana Coelestia, n. 340: "With such as are called 'Cain' faith i~ recognized
and acknowledged as a thing by itself ... Previously, they had been as it were
ignorant of what faith is, because they had a perception of all the things of
faith. But when they began to make a distinct doctrine of faith, they took
the things they had a perception of and reduced them into doctrine, calling it
'I have gotten a man, Jehovah,' as if they had found out something new; and
thus what was before inscribed on the heart became a mere matter of know 
ing."

Arcana Coelestia, n. 362: "The doctrine of faith called 'Cain' is here described,
which in consequence of separating faith from love, separated it also from
charity, the offspring of love. Wherever there is any church, there arise her 
esies, because while men are intent on some particular article of faith they
make that the main thing; for such is the nature of man's thought that while
intent on some one thing he sets it before any other, especially when his
imagination claims it as a discovery of his own, and when the love of self and
of the world puff him up. Everything then seems to agree with and confirm
it, until at last he will swear that it is so, even if it is false. Just in this way
those called 'Cain' made faith more essential than love, and as they conse 
quently lived without love, both the love of self and the phantasy thence
derived conspired to confrrm them in it."

== NOAH BUILDS AN ARK
Genesis 6

In the internal sense, the stories of the serpent and of Cain and
Abel tell of the origin of evil in man's turning from the Lord to
self, of the consequent loss of the innocent, celestial state, and of
the loss of charity as men became more and more confirmed in
self-esteem and self-will. It will be easy in all the classes to intro 
duce the story of Noah by a question concerning the tree of knowl 
edge of good and evil and a brief statement concerning man's first
disobedience and its results.

=== Doctrinal Points
Since the time described by the story of Noah men have been of
the ('spiritual" instead of the ((celestial" nature. This means that
we all have to learn what is true and obey it until we come to
love it. We cannot trust our natural affections to tell us what is
right.

Notes for Parents

Today we have another of the wonderful symbol stories from
the Ancient Word. If we realize its nature and meaning, we do not
worry about the size of the ark or about how so many animals
could be crowded into it and get along together and have enough
to eat for a year (cf. Gen. 7:11, 8:13) .

. The first people used their freedom to disobey the Lord. The
tree of knowledge of good and evil-a symbol of their own desires
and reasonings-was more attractive to them than the tree of life.
This was the beginning of evil in the world, as it is the beginning
of evil in each one of us, when we allow ourselves to think that we
know better than the Lord what is good for us. Once we start on
that path of reasoning we stray further and further from the right
way. The early people eventually became monsters of selfishness.
The flood which destroyed them was not a flood of water but a
flood of falsity and evil.

The few who still recognized their need of the Lord and tried to
obey Him are pictured by Noah, and the ark in which he and his
family rode out the flood is the character he was able. to build by
obeying the divine commands. Every detail of the story is full of
meaning if we have the key. The pitch with which the ark was
covered within and without is our natural selfishness which the
Lord makes use of to deter us from doing many wrong things. The
three stories in the ark are the three planes of our intellect: knowl 
edge, reason, and understanding. The door in the side is our means
of receiving from others and giving to others in our daily lives.
The window above is our willingness to look to the Lord for
guidance and strength. The animals are all our various affections
and thoughts.

Your younger children will be interested in this story as a story.
The Lord gave it in this form so that it would be read and remem 
bered. But as you read on in the Bible, keep some of this inner
meaning in mind, and you will soon realize what a truly wonderful
book the Bible is and how much more it has to say to us than we
at first suspect.

Primary
Even young children can get the idea that disobedience always leads to trouble.
The fact that people got so bad that they had to be destroyed is the introduc 
tion for the lesson today. But Noah was good, and the Lord always takes care
of us when we are good. The children will enjoy hearing about the ark and the
people and animals in it. They should learn the name Noah, and, if possible,
also Shem, Ham, and japheth.

You remember how kindly the Lord took care of the first people
in the beautiful Garden of Eden. Do you remember what was the
one thing He told them not to do? They began to think about this
tree, and its fruit
looked very good to them, and so finally they
disobeyed the Lord and ate of the fruit. They thought the Lord
would not know, but He did. The Lord knows everything we do
and He knows our thoughts and feelings, too.

So the first people had to leave the beautiful garden and go out
and work for their food. The Lord cannot give us things if we do
not use them as they are meant to be used.

When we once begin to disobey our parents, we are very likely
to begin to do more and more wrong things. So the early people,
after they were sent out of the Garden of Eden, went from bad to
worse until finally they became so bad that the Lord had to get rid
of them altogether. They were destroyed by a great flood.

But there were a few people who still wanted to obey the Lord,
and the Lord made plans to save them from the flood. Let us read
the story of Noah and what
the Lord told him to do. [Read
Genesis 6:7-22.]

~

Who were Noah's three sons?
What did the Lord tell him to make?
An ark is a box or chest made to hold something and keep it safe.
What was Noah's ark made of?
How was it divided inside?
Where was the window?
Where was the door?
What people went into the ark?
What else was Noah told to take into the ark?
When the flood came, the ark floated on top of the water,
and so they were saved.

Junior
The Juniors can easily understand the general meaning of this story, the grad 
ual decline once selfishness creeps in, until the whole life is flooded with
wrong thoughts. The lesson offers a good chance to point out that everything
may have either a good or a bad correspondence because when a good thing
is misused, it becomes bad. So water, which pictures truth, can become a
destructive flood and picture falsity instead of truth. Have the children look
up ar.d read Matthew 7:24-29.

Where were the first people placed by the Lord?
How was the Garden of Eden watered?
What tree was in the midst of the garden?
What other tree was in the garden?
What did the Lord tell Adam and Eve not to do?

You have become familiar with the story of the disobedience of
Adam and Eve, the story of Eve's yielding to the temptation of
the serpent. After they, ~isobeyed, they did not die physically, but
something which hacf b~~n in them died: the beautiful, innocent
state in which they had lived was lost. They were driven out of
the garden.

Did you ever do something naughty and have it lead to other
things that were we>rse and worse? Sometimes a boy disobeys his
mother and then lies about it and gets angry and even hurts some 
one rather than own up and say he is sorry. Did you ever think
that every thief and murderer was once an innocent baby? How
did he become so bad? It wasn't all at once, you may be sure, b1,1t
little by little. So in the early tim~s, after the Garden of Eden state
was closed, people gradually became worse and worse, until most
of them were so bad that the Lord could no longer make any
impression on their hearts and minds. They could not even think
anything but selfish thoughts, and this selfishness and false think 
ing is pictured in the Bible by a great flood which increased until
it drowned them all.

But there were still some good people, and the Lord saved them

in a wonderful way.

In the Bible story who is the person whom the Lord saved?
who were saved with him?

We always think of Noah's ark as a sort of houseboat, don't we?
But that is because it floated on the water. An ark is really just a
box or chest, big or little, made to keep something safe. There are
two other famous arks mentioned in the Bible. Look up Exodus
2: 3 and 25: 10. Noah's ark is a picture of something we can all
have to keep us safe from the flood ef wrong thoughts and feelings
which our natural selfishness brings upon us.- This ark is a strong
character, built according to the Lord's directions. When you are
older, you will be able to understand just what each part of the ark
pictures, but first you must fix in your minds the description of it

NOAH BUILDS AN ARK

as it is given in our chapter, and this is something you can do now.

What was it made of?
Gopher wood was some kind of pine or cedar, containing pitch.
How was it made watertight?
How many stories did it have?
What other inside divisions are mentioned?
Where was the door?
Where was the window?

Perhaps even now you can see what the door and window pic 
ture. Can you say our Sunday School benediction? As we live with
other people in the world, we are always coming in or going out
from the house of our character, and we want the Lord to be with
our thoughts and acts to keep them always pure and kind. This is
the "door" in the side of the ark. And we need to have a "window"
in our minds always open towat:d heaven. That is, we want always
to be conscious that
the Lord is seeing us and always learning
more and more of what He is saying to us in His Word.

Do you know what the birds and animals picture which Noah
was told to take with him int., the ark? They are all the thoughts
and feelings-some good and some bad-which make us what we
are.

When everyone was in the ark, who shut them in?

Have you ever watched the people boarding a large airliner at an
airport? When everyone is on the plane, someone on the outside
closes and bolts the door. Do you know why? It is the only way
to be sure that no one can jump or fall out of the plane until it is
safely back on the ground. So you can see why the Lord Himself
shut the ark.

The size of the ark is given us in cubits. The word cubit first
meant a "bending," and so it came to mean the bending in the
arm, or the elbow. In the early days, before people learned to
measure things with the carefulness that scientists must use today,
a man's measuring stick was his own arm. A cubit was the distance
from the tips of a man's fingers to his elbow. We may think of
a cubit as a little over a foot and a half. Thus the ark is pictured
as being more than 450 feet long, 75 feet wide, and 45 feet high.
In other words the ark was very large indeed. Be sure, however,
to learn its dimensions in cubits-300 cubits long, 50 cubits wide,
and 30 cubits high-because, as you will learn later, numbers in the
Bible all have meanings which help us to understand the lessons
which the Lord is trying to teach us.

Do you know how many days it rained after Noah entered the ark?

Intermediate
The most important thing to impress on the young people is that while the
story of Noah and the flood is not historical fact, it is nevertheless a true
story, a far more important story than if it had been mere historical fact.
This lesson should be used to make clear in the minds of the young people
the distinction between the terms celestial and spiritual, celestial always hav 
ing to do with the will or love, and spiritual with the understanding or truth.
The correspondence of the ark and its details should be carefully taught.

We all know the story of Eve and the serpent. It is a story of
disobedience which led to the loss of the beautiful garden of inno 
cent happiness. Eating the forbidden fruit led to great evil. So love
of self and trust in self led men further and further from the Lord,
until they became so evil that their wickedness was like a great
flood, drowning out all spiritual life, all good affections, and all
true thoughts, and leading finally to physical self-destruction.

The river in the Garden of Eden represents truth from the Lord,
which makes everything live. But when people look to themselves
for truth, they find only false ideas, which cause their destruction.
Everyone, however, did not become so bad. Noah and his family
picture the people in whom enough good remained so that they
could be saved. The ark, in which they were able to ride out the
flood, symbolizes the character which they formed by obeying the
Lord. It had three stories, the three planes of the mind. It had a
window above, meaning that their minds were open to receive light
from the Lord. And it had a door in the side, which is a picture of
their coming and going in obedience to the Lord's commandments.
You remember our Sunday School benediction: "The Lord keep

NOAH BUILDS AN ARK

our going out and our coming in, from this time forth and even
forevermore. "

But it is also said that the ark had "rooms." This means that
now the will and the understanding in man were separated. People
were now to be able to keep their thoughts and their desires sep 
arate so that even when they wanted to do wrong, their minds
could be shown the truth and they could obey it and afterwards
learn to love it. So they could be saved. That is the way we are
saved, too-by learning what is right and doing it, even when we
do not want to. The first people were a "celestial" people: knowl 
edge from the Lord flowed directly into their wills, and they could
not think anything they did not also will. This was why, when
their wills became selfish, they could no longer receive truth from
the Lord. But the people called Noah, the people of the Ancient
Church, were a "spiritual" people: truth from the Lord was first
received into their understanding, and then,
if they obeyed it,
could enter their wills.

In working out the meaning of passages in the Word, it is helpful
to know the meaning of some of the names used. Often the spiri 
tual background of a story is given in a brief genealogy, and one
who does not know the meaning of the names thinks it has no
importance and wonders why it is a part of Scripture. The gen 
ealogy leading up to Noah is too long to detail here, but in general
it pictures successive stages of departure from pure love to the
Lord, each stage leading to further perversions, and each succeed 
ing stage being more external than the last.

Noah means "rest," and pictures that point at which the Lord
intervened in the downward course of human nature and "shut in"
the remaining good qualities from further temptation by closing
off the direct contact which men had previously had with the
spiritual world.

Noah had three sons: Shem, Ham, and ]apheth. These three
represent three approaches to the truth which the new state of life
possessed. Shem, which means "name," recalls Adam's naming of
the animals; he represents the neW ability to recognize the quality
not of affections but of truths. Ham means "warm." There is an
affection for the truth with this church or stage which is further
pictured by the gopher wood used in the ark-gopher means "burn 
ing," and refers to the trees which contain pitch. ]apheth means
"extension." When we first begin to explore the realm of truth,
our curiosity leads us into wide fields of knowledge. These three
abilities were preserved from destruction, together with the affec 
tions (the wives) properly related to them, the good affections
(animals) which supported them, and the truths (food) which in
turn supported both man and beast.

After Noah and his family had entered the ark, it is recorded
(Genesis 7:16) that "the Lord shut him in." So in our lives, when we
are trying to do what is right, the.Lord shuts us in-that is, He provides
that we shall not be faced with any temptation which we are not strong
enough to fight. Divine providence continues to stand between us and
such temptations until the" ark" of our character comes to rest on firm
ground where we can establish enough of a foothold to resist temp 
tation. It rained forty days and nights.

Basic Correspondences

a flood (water in a bad sense) = truth turned into falsity

by selfishness

three = completeness on the three planes
of will, thought, and act

forty = a state of temptation

Senior
The Seniors will be interested in the fact
that the tradition of the Most
Ancient Church and the Ancient Church has come down in mythology in the
stories of the Golden and Silver Ages, quite rightly named, since gold corre 
sponds to love and silver to truth. Impress upon them the fact that since the
time pictured by the story of the flood there has been no return on earth of

NOAH BUILDS AN ARK

the celestial state; that is, we never 'just naturally" know what is right. Our
wills are inherently selfish and we have to learn what is right and make our 
selves do it. And we never reach the stage when we know enough. We must be
constantly learning more.

After men were cast out of the Garden of Eden, they became
worse and worse. Once we start on a willful and selfish path, we are
liable to stray further and further. You know from reading, if not
from experience, how rapidly a boy or girl can drift away from
good and orderly habits if he is allowed to go his own way. Every
criminal started life as an innocent baby.

The river in the Garden of Eden stands for truth from the Lord.
But when men look to themsel,ves for truth, they get only falsity,
and this falsity grows until it is a flood which destroys their spiri 
tuallife. With the Most Ancient people this destruction resulted in
the destruction of physical life also. Swedenborg tells us why in
one of the quotations which you will find at the end of this lesson.
Even today men sometimes die from the violence of their own
passions. So the flood in our story, though symbolic, pictures a
very real and terrible time in the history of the human race.

Men, however, were not all evil. Some, although they had lost
their first happy state, remained in general obedient to the Lord.
These people are represented in the Bible story by Noah and his
family. The character which they developed through obedience to
the Lord is the ark, in which they were enabled to ride out the
terrible period of temptation. Forty signifies fullness of temptation
which is about to be overcome; so it rained forty days and forty
nights. You remember also the forty years of wandering in the
wilderness, and the Lord's forty days of temptation.

Every detail of the ark is significant. It was made of gopher
wood, a wood containing pitch. Wood represents natural goodness
and pitch selfishness. So these people were partly good and partly
bad. The measurements of the ark have a meaning, as all numbers
do, but we have not time to go into this detail. Its three stories
picture the three planes of the mind; its window above, the fact
that the mind was open to instruction by the Lord; its door in the side, the fact that in their daily life their coming and going was
regulated by obedience to the Lord: "The Lord keep our going
out and our coming in, from this time forth and even forever 
more."

Two details are especially interesting. The ark was pitched within
and without with pitch, the symbol of self-love. We shall find it as
the "slime" in the story of the Tower of Babel, and the wicked
cities of Sodom and Gomorrah were built in a valley of slime-pits.
But the Lord makes even our self-love serve as a protection, if we
are trying to obey Him, as we can see if we think how many times
we refrain from doing wrong for fear of punishment or of what
people will say or think of us, or from hope of reward.

Also the ark was made with "rooms." The earliest people were
not "divided" in their minds. The Lord spoke directly to their
hearts, and they thought and acted as they felt. So when their
hearts became evil, the Lord could no longer reach them, and for
the good remnant who survived, it was necessary that He separate
the will and the understanding in order that even when their de 
sires were selfish, they could see the truth with their minds and by
learn to love it. Men have been so constructed ever
obeying it
since. We know how often we have to make ourselves do what we
know is right even though we do not want to do it.

The animals and birds taken into the ark picture all the affec 
tions, both good and evil, which went to make up the character of
those people, and the food the ideas which fed those affections.
The fact that they were taken in by twos means that they were
the affections in which thought had been "married" to will. But
we notice in Genesis 7: 2 that a distinction was made among the
animals, in that seven pair of each "clean" beast were to be saved
and only one pair of each unclean beast. In these people the good
was stronger than the evil.

The civilization called Adam is known in the New Church as the
Most Ancient Church and in mythology as the Golden Age. It was
of the affectional or "celestial" type because in it men were led
by their affections. The civilization called Noah was of a different

NOAH BUILDS AN ARK

intellectual or "spiritual," because in it men were led by

type:
their thoughts. It was the Ancient Church, or the Silver Age.

Adult
The nature of the Ancient Church with the reason for the separation of the
will and the understanding in man is very important. Let it lead into a dis 
cussion of the nature of conscience and the fact that it must be developed
through constant study of the Word, and must often be corrected.

We have seen how the first created people were 'developed by
the Lord into a church-the Most Ancient Church-and how they
lived an innocent, happy life led directly by the Lord and caring
for the things of this world only as they taught of spiritual things 
the state pictured by the Garden of Eden with the tree of life in
the midst. Temptation crept in through their desire to be led by
themselves instead of by the Lord, and to reason from what their
senses told them instead of from what the Lord told them. This
turning of their hearts away from the Lord made it impossible for
the Lord any longer to teach them through their hearts, and so
they lost the perception of truth which they had had and the abil 
ity to communicate directly with the spiritual world. They finally
came to think only of themselves and of their life -in this world,
and they used the knowledge of heavenly things which had been
handed down to them to excuse and confirm their selfish desires.
This is pictured in our lesson today by the marriages between the
sons of God and the daughters of men, the sons of God being the
heavenly truths handed down to them, and the daughters of men
the evil affections which had sprung from their self-love. The result
was a race of giants; that is, they became very great in their own
eyes and thought of themselves as gods. That this spiritual con 
dition actually worked itself out in material ways we know from
the mention of remIlants of the giants in later portions of the
Scriptures (Numbers 13:33; Deuteronomy 3:11). Goliath ofGath
was one of the last of these physical giants. They were giants in
body because of their monstrous perversions of heavenly things
and exaltation of themselves. These perversions-or falsities-ulti 
mately destroyed them both soul and body, stifling all spiritual
life within them and causing them to destroy each other. This is
the flood which covered the tops of the mountains-a flood of
false persuasions burying all points of approach to the Lord.

In our chapter for today we come to a statement of an apparent
truth, when it is said that the Lord repented that He had made
man and determined to destroy him. The destruction of the Most
Ancient Church was not the work of the Lord, but of the evils
and falsities which men had chosen themselves. Nor does the Lord
change His mind. He foresees all things and makes provision for
them. His love and wisdom are constant, but
their working out
in human affairs necessarily changes with the changes in men's
states. So a fa~her's love for his child does not change, but it can 
not express itself in the same way when the child is bent on wrong 
doing as when the child is good. When men became so evil that
the Lord, He per 
they had closed all ways of approach against
mitted them to destroy themselves in order that a new church
could spring up and develop among those few who had retained
some desire to do right.

Those few among whom the new church could be developed
are represented by Noah. They were by no means wholly good;
they were so far perverted that they could not possibly
indeed,
be restored to the original state of the celestial church. The Lord
had to take them as they were and provide a new means of ap 
proach to them. This is pictured in the building of the ark. It was
made of gopher wood. Wood is the symbol of natural goodness 
the only goodness that was left in the people of that time-and
Swedenborg tells us (AC 643) that gopher wood is a highly inflam 
mable wood; so it pictures natural goodness full of selfishness. The
ark was to be made, as our translation gives it, with "rooms." This
pictures a change which the Lord wrought in man's very nature
in order to save him. We have seen that the people of the Most
their
Ancient Church were taught
thoughts were the direct result of their desires. So long as their

through their wills;

that

is,

NOAH BUILDS AN ARK

inmost desire was to serve the Lord, they could think nothing but
what was true; but when their desires became selfish, they could
think only what was false. So it was necessary for the Lord to
separate man's will from his understanding, in order that his mind
could see what was true even when he did not wish to do right;
then he could learn the truth and be led to make himself live
according to it until he was so confirmed in right action that the
Lord could give him a new will. Thus the people of the Ancient
Church-as the church described by Noah and his descendants is
called-were led to do right by conscience instead of by percep 
tion. This separation of the will and the understanding is what is
pictured by the ark's being divided into rooms. The three stories
picture the three planes of the mind: knowledge, reason, and un 
derstanding, comparable to act, thought, and will, through which
the man of this church could be led to do right. The window open
above pictures the mind open to receive truth from the Lord, and
the door in the side, hearing and obedience to the truth. (AC 651 
658) It is by obedience to the commandments that we open the
door to the Lord's entrance into our lives (cf. Revelation 3:20).
So the ark in every detail is a picture of the character of the people
who constituted the remnant from the Most Ancient Church after
they had been put into a new order by the Lord so that they
might again receive a knowledge of the truth and by obeying it
learn to love it. The first church was a celestial church because it
was led by love of the Lord in the heart. The second, the Ancient
Church, was a spiritual church because it was led by truth from
the Lord in the understanding. This newly ordered mind enabled
the good remnant to survive the flood of falsity which destroyed
the rest of mankind.

But the story has an application to our individual lives as well as
to the history of the race. We have compared our infancy'to the
Garden of Eden state, and we have seen how evil creeps in as soon
as we begin to have enough self-consciousness to want to choose
our own ~ay. Have we not all seen spoiled children-children who
have been allowed to have their' own way? Are they not welldescribed by the picture of the giants of old, very great and im 
portant in their own estimation, and bending all their efforts and
reasoning to the satisfying of their selfish desires, even to the point
of violence against those who try to control or thwart them and
even sometimes violence toward themselves when they cannot get
what they want? Each one of us has an inheritance of evil which,
if indulged and confirmed, would lead him to complete spiritual
in very early childhood we
and even physical destruction. But
become conscious of the division which the Lord has provided
between our will and our understanding. We are taught what is
right and, if our parents are wise, we are made to do it even against
our will; and so we gradually form good habits and develop a con 
science which helps us to direct our conduct. The life of a little
child so taught and directed is also pictured by the story of Noah
and the ark. The animals taken into the ark are all his affections,
good and bad, which form the basis of his personality and must be
dealt with in the course of his regeneration. The flood is the long
series of temptations to which his selfish desires and reasonings
subject him. Noah and his wife are his recognition of the Lord and
his desire to do what is right. Their sons and daughters-in-~aware
the thoughts and affections which grow out of this recognition and
desire. And if he keeps these alive in the ark, the time will come
when his ark will rest on the top of the mountain and the flood
will subside; he will have acquired fixed habits of right conduct
which he is no longer tempted to break; his mind will have come
to rest in the Lord's will and he will be ready to go forth to his
work in the world in freedom - "freedom is to be led by the Lord."

From the Writings of Swedenborg
Arcana Coelestia, nne 607, 608: "But what is yet unknown in the world, and
is perhaps difficult to believe, is that the men of the Most Ancient Church
had internal respiration, and only tacit external respiration. Thus they spoke
not so much by words, as afterwards and as at this day, but by ideas, as angels
do; and these they could express by innumerable changes of the looks and
face, especially of the lips. In the lips there a.re countless series of muscular

.

fibres which at this day are not set free, but being free with the men of that
time, they could so present, signify, and represent ideas by them as to express
in a minute's time what at this day it would require an hour to say by articu 
late sounds and words, and they could do this more fully and clearly to the
apprehension and understanding of those present than is possible by words,
. But in their posterity this internal

respiration little by little came to an end; and with these it became such that
they could no longer present any idea of thought except the most debased,
the effect of which was that they could not survive, and therefore all became
extinct.
. When internal respiration ceased, external respiration gradually
succeeded, almost like that of the present day; and with external respiration
a language of words, or of articulate sound into which the ideas of thought
were determined. Thus the state of man was entirely changed, and became
such that he could no longer have similar perception, but instead of percep 
tion another kind of dictate which may be called conscience, for it was like
conscience, though a kind of intermediate between perception and the con 
science known to some at this day."

Arcana Coelestia, n. 639: "If the ark with its coating of pitch, its measure 
ment, and its construction, and the flood also, signified nothing more than the
letter expresses, there would be nothing at all spiritual and celestial in the
account ot it, but only something historical, which would be of no more use
to the human race than any similar thing described by secular writers. But be 
cause the Word of the Lord everywhere in its bosom or interiors involves and
contains spiritual and celestial things, it is very evident that by the ark and
all the things said about the ark, are signified hidden things not yet revealed."

== THE END OF THE FLOOD
Genesis 8

Every teacher should read for background the chapters which
have been omitted, chapters 5 and 7 of Genesis, and should study
the brief explanations of this transition period in the notes for
the various age levels. From the Junior level up, emphasis should
be placed on the difference between the Most Ancient Church and
the Ancient Church as to the nature of the people. Throughout
our study of the Bible there will be many references to these two
churches and to the "celestial" and "spiritual" types, and the chil 
dren should become familiar with them. The simplest illustrations
come from their knowledge of the difference between a baby and
an older child.

Doctrinal Points
When a church perverts the truth given it, the Lord always prepares

the way for the reception of truth in a new form.

The Ancient Word, which preceded our Word, was given for the

instruction of the Ancient Church.

After man's will became wholly perverted, the Lord separated the
will and the understanding so that a new will could be formed
in man's understanding through the development of conscience.
We must form the habit of doing right before the Lord can give us

a love for doing it.

Notes for Parents

Have your children ever asked you, or have you ever wondered
yourself, how so many human beings and animals and food enough
to last them several months could have been crowded into a boat
only about 450 feet long, 75 feet wide, and 45 feet high? Or, for
that matter, have you asked yourself how it was possible for it
to rain so much-even in forty days-that the flood covered the

146mountains? Many people have asked these questions. The truth is
that this story is in that part of the Bible which was taken from
the Ancient Word; it is written entirely in symbol language and
not meant to be taken as literal history.

Sometimes when a person yields to a very severe temptation,
we say of him: "It was too much for him to stand up to; he was
just swept off his feet." And we often speak of the storms of life.
The people of the Most Ancient Church did not always use their
independence in an unselfish way. Neither do we. And we know
that when our children want their own way, it is very often not
a good way. It is all too likely to be selfish, injuring other people
rather than helping them. The descendants of these early people
yielded more and more to the temptation to use their indepen 
dence selfishly, and these tendencies were inherited from gener 
ation to generation and grew until the people became monsters
of selfishness. The stories of the serpent and of Cain and Abel
describe this decline. The genealogies recorded in chapters 4 and 5
do not really tell of the birth of individual men but of the suc 
cession of whole generations of people. In time their selfish desires
and false thoughts became so great that they were "swept away"
as by a flood.

But always some few people continued to try to be good. These
are described in the symbol story of Noah; and because they built
their lives according to the Lord's commands, as Noah built the
they could ride out the flood of evil and falsity. Read Mat 
ark,
thew 7: 24-27. When we are tempted to do what we know is wrong,
our only way of safety is to ask the Lord for help and stick fast to
the commandments. It may seem hard at first-we may feel like
Noah shut up in the ark and tossed about on the flood-but if we
are steadfast,
the time will come when the temptation will no
longer trouble us and we shall be able to step out into a fuller and
freer life. This is the lesson of our story today, but we should also
know that each detail in the story has a particular meaning.

=== Primary
The literal story is easy to tell. Read as much as possible of it from the Word,
and be careful not to add imaginary details. Tell the whole story but dwell
particularly on the incidents in chapter 8. If the children are familiar with toy
Noah's arks, try to take their minds away from the idea of the ark as a play 
thing by telling them what a wonderful thing it was that the Lord saved Noah
in this way so that the whole human race would not die.

Do you know what a flood is? It is what happens when the
water in a river or lake rises far above its usual level and flows over
the land. Sometimes even now there are floods which sweep away
houses and cattle and people and do all sorts of destructive things.
Our Bible story tells us about the worst flood ever known. You
remember the story about Adam and Eve and the beautiful Garden
of Eden in which they lived. The Lord gave them everything they
needed to make them happy. And there was only one thing He
told them not to do-that was to eat of the fruit of a certain tree,
called the tree of knowledge of good and evil. When your mother
tells you not to do a certain thing, are you ever tempted to go
right away and do it? That is what happened to Adam and Eve,
and they disobeyed the Lord.

And you know how bad things have a way of piling up. Some 
times when you have done wrong, you find yourself telling a lie
so that your mother will not know you did it, and one lie is apt to
lead to another, and each makes things worse. And finally you are
found out and punished and you are very unhappy. Adam and Eve
were sent away from the beautiful garden and had to work for
their living. Their children did wrong things,
too, and in time
people became so bad that they had to be destroyed by a great
flood-so great that the water even covered the tops of the moun 
tains.

But one man and his family had remained good. His name was
Noah. Just before the flood came, the Lord told Noah to build
himself an ark. This was a sort of wooden houseboat big enough
to hold him and his wife and his three sons and their wives and
a great many animals and birds, and food enough for all of them.The ark had rooms in it and was built with three stories. There was
a door on the side and a window in the roof. When the flood came,
the ark floated on the water and everything in it was saved.

I t rained forty days and forty nights, and the water rose and
rose. Finally the rain stopped and the flood began to go down.
Let us read what Noah did then. [Read Genesis 8:6-12.]

What two birds did he send out to see if the waters had gone down?
What did' the raven do?
What did the dove do the fIrst time?
What did the dove bring back the second time?
What happened the third time?
What did this show Noah?

You see that the raven which Noah sent out just flew around and
accomplished nothing, as we sometimes do when we are not trying
to find the right way to behave; but the dove was able to help
Noah.

Finally the Lord told Noah that he might go out from the ark
to live again on the dry ground. The first thing Noah did when he
went out was to build an altar to the Lord so that he could thank
the Lord for saving him. Almost every church today has an altar
in it, and it is put there for the same purpose for which Noah built
his altar-to worship the Lord. Do you know where the altar is
in your church?

And do you know what we in the New Church always have on
the altar? It ~s a copy of the Bible, the Word of God, from which
we learn all we know about the Lord and what He wants us to do.

Junior
The general signillcance of the flood can be taught to children at this age, and
the knowledge will save them from being affected by the many light remarks
they are likely to hear about Noah and the flood. The lesson suggested in the
third paragraph of their notes is one they especially need. They should also be
introduced to the thought that the story of Noah pictures the development of
a new church in the world. Be guided by their interest and their questions.

What does the Bible call the beautiful state in which the people of the
Most Ancient Church lived?

THE END OF THE FLOOD

Why are the people of this church called "Adam"?
What was the one thing Adam wanted which was not in the Garden?
How did the Lord provide this helper?

In the story of the Garden of Eden we are told that the "tree of
life" was in the midst of the garden, and that there was also there
the "tree of the knowledge of good and evil." Look back at the
Creation story in chapter 1 and see when the trees first appeared.
It was after the creation of light and after the waters above and be 
low the firmament had been separated and the dry land appeared.
The dry land is 'a picture of our character after we begin to learn
the truth (the light) and to distinguish between heavenly and
worldly things. It is then that we first begin really to think, and
our thoughts are pictured by the plants that spring up out of the
earth. The trees are the big general ideas that tower above all the
others. We need to know this to understand how it came about
that the descendants oCthe people who had known the beautiful
Garden of Eden state could become so evil that they had to be
destroyed by the flood. In the garden, the tree of life stands for
the thought that all goodness and all truth come from the Lord
alone and that we must learn them from Him. The tree of the
knowledge of good and evil stands for the thought that we are
smart enough to know what is right and wrong without learning
from the Lord. In the story Adam and Eve were commanded not
to eat of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil 
but they disobeyed. And when they disobeyed, they were driven
out of the garden. The thought that we do not need to learn of the
Lord is the beginning of all our mistakes and all our wrongdoing.
The descendants of Adam and Eve became worse and worse.
Their false ideas grew until they swallowed up all their spiritual
life. This is pictured by the flood which covered even the moun 
tains and destroyed all life from the earth. The flood was not a
flood of water, but a flood of false ideas. There were always, how 
ever, some people who chose to follow the Lord instead of their
own ideas; and these people are described in the story of Noah
and his family. They did not have an easy time, but because theyobeyed the Lord He was able to save them and to build up among
their descendants a new church, called by Swedenborg the Ancient
Church. Mythology calls this period the Silver Age.

Did you ever find yourself among a group of boys and girls who
were bent on doing something you knew was wrong? Perhaps you
tried to argue with them, and they were able to answer all your
arguments and make you feel foolish for objecting; but you still
in your heart knew that you ought not to join them. It was not
an easy or a comfortable position to be in. It was very much like
Noah in the ark, tossed about on the flood. The flood pictures
a great temptation, and Noah was saved only by staying in the ark
until the waters had gone down. When you are tempted to do what
you know is wrong, stick to your principles through thick and thin,
and you will come through safely.

Mter the rain had stopped, it is said that Noah opened the win 
dow which was in the top of the ark. This is a picture of opening
our minds to instruction from the heavens; and the birds Noah sent
out were his thoughts going out over the earth to see whether the
temptation was over. There were two birds: one black and one
white. There were a great many false ideas in the minds of even
these good people, as there are in the minds of all of us, and these
are pictured by the raven. And you notice that the raven did
nothing but fly around. False ideas do not accomplish anything
for us. But Noah also had the dove, which pictures a true thought.
This did not bring him at once the information he wanted, but it
went out again and again until Noah could be satisfied. If we go at
a thing in the right way, looking for help to those who know more
than we-as the people called "Noah" looked to the Lord-we shall
succeed in time.

And the first thing Noah did when he and his family came out
of the ark onto dry land again, was to build an altar and make
sacrifices to the Lord. Whenever we are saved from yielding to
temptation and brought again into a peaceful and happy state of
mind, we should thank the Lord for His help: for it is the Lord
who watches over us all the time and leads us safely, if we are will-

THE END OF THE FLOOD

ing to obey Him.

Sometime you will learn a great deal more about the meaning of
this story. It tells of how the Lord saved the whole human race
from destroying itself by evils, and found a new way to reach their
minds and teach them after they had closed their hearts against
Him. One thing you may remember is that the church which grew
up from this beginning-the Ancient Church-knew a great deal
about correspondences (the relation between spiritual and natural
things) of which you are beginning to learn a little now as you
learn of the meaning of light and of trees and of the flood and the
raven and the dove. They understood these things and loved to
study them, and they even wrote in the language of correspon 
dences. The Ancient Word (the Bible which existed before our
Bible and from which the first seven chapters of Genesis were
taken by Moses) was written in the days of this church. In time
this church also declined, as we shall soon learn; but its people
spread all over the earth and many of the religions of the Orient
and of other parts of the world are remnants of the knowledge
of the people of the Ancient Church, remnants perverted because
they have been handed down by tradition instead of in a written
form dictated by the Lord.

How long did the rain last?
What was the first bird Noah sent out?
What other bird did he send out?
What is the difference between the raven and the dove?

What promise did the Lord make after this?

Intermediate

This group should have a running account of the spiritual meaning of the
story of the fall and of Noah and the flood, particularly as it relates to the
change from celestial to spiritual in the race and applies to o~ present nature
and possibilities. They should know clearly what are meant by the Most
Ancient and Ancient Churches and what the distinction is between "celestial"and "spiritual." Stress the nature of temptation and the way in which we
should meet it.

The decision of the people of the Most Ancient Church to try
to think from themselves was, as we have seen, a step-the first
step-away from the celestial state, which is the highest and hap 
piest state men can enjoy. So it was the beginning of a long down 
ward trend. In the Bible story the next step was the temptation
by the serpent, and this was followed by the expulsion from the
garden and the killing of Abel by his brother Cain. The meaning
of these stories is dealt with elsewhere, and may be guessed from
what is said in verses 5 to 8 of chapter 6 of Genesis. When we
use our independence in the wrong way, forgetting what the Lord
has told us is right and trying to please ourselves instead of Him,
our natural desires lead us further and further on the path to spiri 
tual destruction.

The celestial church was a church in which people were governed
by their hearts, and when their hearts became evil, the Lord could
no longer reach them because their thoughts were wholly con 
trolled by their desires. If you stop to think, you can see that we
are not just like that now. We may want very much to do some self 
ish thing and yet our minds can see that it is wrong, and through
our minds the Lord can lead us to refuse to do it. We have, through
education in the knowledge of what is right, something called our
conscience. That is, we are really governed through our minds and
through our hearts. This is a spiritual instead of a celestial
not
state. If we try to build our conscience on the Lord's teachings
and choose to obey them,
the Lord can form in us gradually an
unselfish instead of a selfish will. This is called regeneration or
rebirth. For we are all-ever since the first people turned from the
Lord-born selfish, and we must be made over by the Lord if we
are to become good and happy people. This is not something that
can happen all at once. It is a lifelong work. But you can see from
your own experience how it is done. Remember some naughty
thing you used to do when you were a little child: First your
parents told you it was wrong and you learned to stop doing it

THE END OF THE FLOOD

when they said "no" so that you would not be punished, although
perhaps you still did it when no one was looking; then you began
to be ashamed of it and tried to stop for your own sake; gradually
you stopped altogether, and in time found that you no longer had
any desire to do it; and finally it seemed so unpleasant to you that
you wondered how you could ever have wanted to do it. You had,
in regard to that particular thing, a new will which was the very
opposite of your first desire. The Lord gives us the new will, but
we have to prepare the way by resisting the temptation to do
wrong and persevering until we have formed a new good habit in
place of the old bad one.

What the Lord had to do in order to save the few good people
at the end of the Most Ancient Church-the few represented by
Noah-was to separate their minds from their wills so that they
could see what was right even when they did not want to do it.
like the story of the Garden of Eden,
The story of the flood is,
a symbol story. The flood was not a flood of water, but a flood of
falsity developing in the minds of the people as their wills became
more and more evil, until they could no longer receive the inflow 
ing life from the Lord and destroyed each other and themselves.
Only a few survived the change. The good who were saved are
described in the story of Noah, and the evil who managed to go on
living were the giants who appear for a short while in the historical
part of the Bible: the Anakim (Numbers 13:22), etc. Two who are
familiar to us all are Goliath of Gath (I Samuel 17:4) and Og, king
of Bashan (Numbers 21:33).

In the story, Noah and his family were saved by building an ark
which would serve as a boat, according to the Lord's directions,
and staying shut up in it until the waters of the flood subsided.
This is a picture of living within the limits set by the Lord's com 
mandments until the temptation to disobey has passed. The part
of the story we read in chapter 8 tells of the gradual subsiding of
the temptation and the way in which we begin to live a new life.
First Noah opens the window in the top of the ark. This is a pic 
ture of opening our minds to instruction from the Lord. Then hesends out two birds-a raven and a dove-to see if the waters have
dried up. You remember that birds picture our thoughts which fly
around in our minds. Some are good and some are bad. The raven
pictures our false thoughts. Our first idea of the new life is, per 
haps, that it will be more profitable for us. The raven flew about
and accomplished nothing. But
that we
ought to be grateful to the Lord and look to Him for guidance 
did eventually bring back the news that the new life could be good
and happy. Technically the olive corresponds to "the good of
charity" (the love of serving the Lord), and the olive leaf to "the
truth of charity" (the knowledge of how to serve Him).

the dove-the thought

When Noah finally went out of the ark, the first thing he did
was to build an altar and make sacrifices to the Lord; and this was
the first worship of the Ancient Church. How did Noah know
about building altars and making sacrifices? Swedenborg tells us
that the people of the Most Ancient Church knew "from percep 
tion" the correspondence of everything in the natural world to the
things of spiritual life, and that this knowledge was handed down
by tradition to the Ancient Church. The people of the Ancient
Church-with whom, as we have said,
the things of the intellect
came first-cultivated this knowledge of correspondence and loved
it more than anything else they learned, forming their way of life
and their worship according to correspondences. I t was in the time
of the Ancient Church that the Ancient Word was written, from
which the first seven chapters of Genesis were copied by Moses.
The last verses of our chapter, in which the Lord promises that
man shall never again be destroyed by his evils and falsities, tell us
the Lord has now provided in man a permanent structure
that
(the separation of the will and the understanding) through which
it would always be possible for Him to reach those who were will 
ing to be saved. We shall find that each church raised up on earth
had its decline, but that before its end the Lord began to prepare
the way for a new church among those not wholly perverted. This
repeated succession of new growths is described in the last verse
of the chapter.

THE END OF THE FLOOD

Basic Correspondences

the raven = a false idea
the dove = a true idea concerning God
the olive = the good of charity
the olive leaf = the truth of charity

Senior
The separation of the will and the understanding and its effect on the race
and on the individual are important for this age group. It is not true that we
"can't help" yielding to temptation. The Lord will give us strength if we obey
the commandments. Such obedience may seem a hardship for a time, but this
is a necessary step to greater strength and happiness. They know that we do
not gain physical strength by doing easy things. The same is true of spiritual
strength.

In Genesis 6: 1-8 we have the key to the meaning of the story of
Noah and the flood. The daughters of men are the affections which
sprang from the selfish will of the degenerating race in the Most
Ancient Church. The sons of God are the truths which they re 
ceived by tradition and which had originally come from the Lord.
We recall that the first people were governed through their hearts 
the characteristic of the celestial type. This meant that when their
hearts became evil, all the truths they knew were twisted to con 
form to their evil desires, and there was no possibility of change
for them. They assumed credit to themselves for all truth, and
became great in their own eyes: "there were giants in the earth in
those days:' In fact, their opinion of themselves eventually resulted
in actual physical overgrowth, so that they were giants physically,
also. A few of these ancient giants survived the destruction of the
race pictured by the flood, and we find them mentioned in the
historical parts of the Word as the Anakim, etc., and as individuals
such as Goliath of Gath, and Og, king of Bashan. "And God saw
that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every
imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually."
We see an analogy to this today in the case of a self-exalted man
who twists everything he sees to suit his own ambition. But todaythere is always the possibility of reform for such a man because his
mind and his will are still actually separate: that is, he can, if he
will, admit some truth which is contrary to his desire. The longer
one persists in selfishness, the harder this is; but it never becomes
impossible as it was with the Most Ancient people. Swedenborg
tells us that at the end of the Most Ancient Church,
the great
majority of the people were actually suffocated because of their
own fantasies; but that in those pictured by Noah in whom there
still remained some desire to serve the Lord,
the Lord wrought
a change by separating the will and the understanding so that He
could reach them through their minds. This is pictured in the letter
by the fact that the ark had "rooms" in it. The ark is the character
of the man of that time who was willing to obey the Lord. The
heart was prevailingly evil; but through obedience to the Lord it
could remain safe from destruction during the temptation rep 
resented by the flood. The animals and birds shut up in the ark
with Noah picture his affections and thoughts, both good and bad.
The pitch with which the ark was covered inside and out is the mo 
tive of self-preservation. The door in the side which was kept shut
throughout the flood is his normal communication with others.
The window toward heaven, which was also shut during the temp 
tation but was opened immediately after the flood, represents the
mode of access for truths from heaven.

Many people think of the Christian life as a life of restraint, and
so it may be for a time to the man who has formed bad habits.
This is Noah shut up in the ark. But when temptation ceases to
tempt him-when he has formed new habits which he finds he
likes better than the old-he comes to live the Christian life freely
and with happiness. This is Noah coming out of the ark to repeople
the earth. The raven and the dove which he first sent forth to see
if the waters were abated, are his natural, false ideas and his true
thoughts. The raven flew about and accomplished nothing, but the
dove persisted until it found the olive, a symbol of goodness and
truth in the new life. (The olive fruit represents the good of charity
and its leaf the truth of charity.) If this seems obscure, let us think

THE END OF THE FLOOD

of our own experience in trying a new way of life. Even after the
strong temptation to "backslide" is over, we are a little shy of the
new life, trying it out here and there to see if it is really all that
was claimed for it. This is like sending out the raven and the dove.
The raven says, "will
this new way really get me anywhere?"
The dove says, "Is it really the good and useful way?"

Noah's building the altar and making sacrifices thereon of clean
beasts and birds, pictures a new type of worship of the Lord which
developed in the second or Ancient Church. We recall that the
people of the Most Ancient Church had open communication with
the heavens and were instructed by the Lord by a direct impulse
of the heart. This was the celestial state. But after the will and
understanding were separated, ideas of God had to be formed in
the mind; truth had to be presented there, and considered, and so
chosen as a way of life. The people of the Most Ancient Church
had seen in everything e,.bout them in the world, representations
of spiritual things. This knowledge was passed on by tradition to
their descendants, who formed the Ancient Church, cherished it,
and made it their greatest study and delight. The altar and the
sacrifices represented worship of the Lord and the dedication of
their affections and thoughts to His service. In this way forms of
worship arose whose meaning was at first fully understood. Also
the symbol teachings were written down, under inspiration from
the Lord, and formed what Swedenborg calls the Ancient Word.
The nature of this Word we can know from the first seven chapters
of Genesis, which we are told were copied from it; and some of its
books are mentioned by name in our Word. Swedenborg said that
in his day the Ancient Word might still be in existence in Great
Tartary.

Our first desire after we have passed through a severe tern p 
tation and find ourselves moving freely in a new life should be,
like Noah's, to thank the Lord for our deliverance, and to offer to
Him the service of our hearts and minds. And as we do this, our
lives begin to fall into a new and lasting order, governed by the
Lord. This is what is meant by the last verses of our chapter. TheLord takes care of His church in the world, and sees to it that it
shall never be destroyed. When one dispensation perverts its revel 
ation and declines, He prepares the good remnant of its people
to form a new church: "seedtime and harvest" never fail. We shall
have more to say about this in a future lesson.

Adult
In regard to the individual experience, note that our chapter covers all three
stages of the man who regenerates: his preparation for regeneration, his state
during the process of regeneration, and his regenerate state. The difference
between perception and conscience, the origin of representative worship, and
the difference between the doctrine of "original sin" and Swedenborg's teach 
ing concerning hereditary evil are all good topics for discussion.

We have seen that the people of the Most Ancient Church were
"celestial" in character: that is, this man "was so constituted that
the will and the understanding with him formed one mind, or that
with him love was implanted in his will part, and thus at the same
time faith, which filled the other or intellectual part of his mind"
(AC 927). He had open communication with the heavens and lived,
so long as he was content to be led by the Lord alone, in a beauti 
ful, childlike state of innocence and trust-the Garden of Edep.
His first downward step was taken when he began to be dissatisfied
with this state and to desire to be independent. Because the Lord
had foreseen this desire and immediately provided for him a good
way to satisfy it (the story of the creation of Eve), man was still
for a time maintained in the Garden of Eden state. Gradually,
however, his selfhood asserted itself more and more, his senses
and their pleasures (the serpent) misled him, and he turned from
the Lord, lost his innocence, and was driven out of the Garden.
The final state of the people of that church is described in the first
seven verses of chapter 6. AC 927 continues as follows: "Their
posterity inherited the condition that the will and the understand 
ing made a one; and therefore when the love of self and the conse 
quent insane cupidities began to take possession of their will part
(where previously there had been love to the Lord and charity

THE END OF THE FLOOD

toward the neighbor), not only did their will part or will become
utterly perverted, but so also together with it did their intellectual
part or understanding, and this was still more the case when the
last posterity immersed their falsities in their cupidities, and so
became 'Nephilim,' for thereby they became of such a nature that
they could not be restored, because both parts of the mind (that is,
the whole mind) had been ruined." The giants mentioned in Gen 
esis 6:4 were men who had acquired tremendous importance in
their own eyes; but this also in time affected their physical struc 
ture. The Nephilim, Anakim, etc., were some of these giants who
survived the general destruction of the Most Ancient Church; indi 
vidual giants were Goliath of Gath and Og, king of Bashan. The
giants were not finally exterminated until David's time. Sweden 
borg tells us that the insane evils of those people were so great that
the hells of the Most Ancient Church have been closed by the Lord
so that spirits from those hells cannot influence others.

Near the end of that church, however, there were still some who
desired to serve the Lord, and in these the Lord wrought an actual
constitutional change so that they might be regenerated and built
into a new church. AC 597 states: "By 'Noah' is signified a new
or second church dispensation, which is to be called the Ancient
Church, for the sake of distinction between the Most Ancient
Church which was before the flood, and that which was after the
flood. The state of the Most Ancient Church was such that they
had from the Lord a perception of good and the derivative truth.
The state of the Ancient Church. or 'Noah,' became such that they
had a conscience of good and truth. Such as is the difference be 
tween having perception and -having conscience, such was the dif 
ference of state of the Most Ancient and the Ancient Churches.
Perception is not conscience:
the celestial have perception; the
spiritual have conscience. The Most Ancient Church was celestial,
the Ancient was spiritual." We are also told that the people of the
Most Ancient Church, because they were in communication with
the heavens, had internal rather than external respiration, and that
when the communication ceased, many of them actually died ofa kind of suffocation, so that the flood is a realistic picture of their
end. But in the good remnant-and in the others who survived 
the Lord set up external respiration. Internal respiration, for short
periods,
is not unknown even today. It is practiced by some of
the Indian Yogis, and has the effect of making them practically
unconscious of their material surroundings. Swedenborg also had
this experience.

The most important change made in man at this time was the
separation of the will and the understanding, so that man could
see the truth of thoughts which were contrary to his desires. Men
ever since have been of this nature. We know this from the fact
that we ourselves often wish very much to do things which our
minds tell us are not right, and that we are capable of making
decisions contrary to our desires. This new character set up in the
good remnant is pictured by the ark, the separation being indicated
by its "rooms." There was much falsity in the minds of these
the ark was pitched
people and much selfishness in their hearts:
"within and without with pitch"; and all the animals and birds
both clean and unclean were within it. But it had a window toward
heaven, and because it was built according to the commandment
of the Lord, and because the Lord "shut him in," it could ride out
the flood. We know in our own experience that there have been
times when we were sorely tempted to yield to worldly and sensual
desires and have been kept safe only by our knowledge of the right
way and a dogged determination to stick to it. The Lord's provi 
dence shuts us in, also. Noah, tossed about in the ark throughout
the flood, pictures this period in our experience.

But the time comes, if we remain shut up in the ark, when the
rain ceases and the flood begins to abate. We realize that our temp 
tation is losing strength and we begin to reach out tentatively for
a new and freer way of life which shall yet be good and righteous.
This is the particular time described in our chapter for today.
There are in our minds both false and true thoughts-the raven and
the dove-with which we explore our condition. Rest and peace
in the new way do not come immediately, but presently the dove

THE END OF THE FLOOD

brings back tokens of promise. The olive leaf represents "the truth
of charity." Finally the flood is over and we can open the door
and go out freely to build up a new life. This whole process is a
common Christian experience, the duration of the flood represent 
ing the period of temptation which must follow the decision to
lead a new life,
if we are to lead that life with assurance and
strength.

In AC 920 Swedenborg describes the origin of representative
worship, pointing out that in the Most Ancient Church worship
was internal, as it is in heaven, but that men saw in the things
of the outward world representatives of internal things. As the
internal perception was gradually lost, the knowledge of the rep 
resentatives was more cherished, and this knowledge was handed
down to the posterity of that church and became the basis of the
representative worship of the Ancient Church. The altar which
Noah is said to have built after he came forth from the ark is the
first altar mentioned in the Word. The altar is the representative
of worship of the Lord and the offerings made upon it picture
the desire that our affections and thoughts shall be such as to serve
Him. This recognition that the Lord is the Source of all goodness
and truth is essential to anyone's salvation.

The New Church does not hold the doctrine of "original sin"
in the sense in which this is accepted in many churches, but neither
does it teach that we are "born good" and acquire all our evils
through our environment. Our natural inheritance is selfish, and
this selfishness remains with us to eternity. Regeneration does not
destroy it (cf. AC 868). But if we look to the Lord, obey Him, and
become regenerate men and women,
the Lord holds our natural
self in subjection and permits us to enjoy the peace and happiness
which are the result of unselfish love-the Lord's love acting in and
through us. The Lord's promise in the last verse of our chapter
describes the order of this change called regeneration, which under
the Divine Providence is and always will be possible for anyone
who seeks it.From the Writings of Swedenborg

Arcana Coelestia, n.927:
"It has been shown that the man of the Most
Ancient Church was so constituted that the will and the understanding with
him formed one mind, or that with him love was implanted in his will part,
and thus at the same time faith, which filled the other or intellectual part of
his mind. From this their posterity inherited the condition that the will and
the understanding made a one; and therefore when the love of self and the
consequent insane cupidities began to take possession of their will part (where
previously there had been love to the Lord and charity toward the neighbor),
not only did their will part or will become utterly perverted, but so also to 
gether with it did their intellectual part or understanding, and this was still
more the case when the last posterity immersed their falsities in their cupidi 
ties, and so became 'Nephilim,' for thereby they became of such a nature that
they could not be restored, because both parts of the mind (that is, the whole
mind) had been ruined. But as this had been foreseen by the Lord, He had
alsc provided for man's upbuilding, in this way, that he might be reformed
and regenerated in respect to the second or intellectual part of the mind, in
which there might be implanted a new will which is conscience, and through
which the Lord might work the good of love (that is, of charity), and the
truth of faith. Thus of the Lord's Divine mercy has man been restored."

The review of the temptation by the serpent leads directly into
the story of the decline of the Most Ancient Church and the
necessity of the Lord's stepping in to save the remnant of good
people from destruction. The story of the ark and the flood can
be told briefly with the emphasis this time on the Lord's new
promise and on the rainbow as the token of it.

Notes for Parents

Often when we are driving through new country, we come to
a fork in the road. A sign-post tells us plainly which way we ought
to go. If we obey it, we know we shall reach our destination. The
other fork is not marked but it seems to be going in about the
same direction and looks like a more pleasant road, and we take
a chance; we think, "It may take us a little out of the way but it
will certainly get us to the same place in time." So we go off on
the wrong fork and it swings gradually away from the right road
and takes us farther and farther astray. How often in our own per 
sonal lives we take this kind of chance! The Lord has marked the
right road for us plainly, but we think we know better. And one
wrong step leads to another. "Because wide is the gate, and broad
is the way, that leadeth to destruction, and many there be which
go in thereat" (Matthew 7:13).

The first people, after they listened to the serpent and chose to
follow their own judgment, continued on the downward path until
they had gone so far from the Lord's way that their evil passions
and false ideas actually destroyed them, just as they destroy some
people today. This destruction is pictured for us in the Bible story
of the flood.

But there are always some who stand up in the face of temp 
tation and refuse to follow the crowd. These good people are pic 
tured by Noah. By obeying the Lord they are enabled to ride out
the storm and begin a new and better life.

When we have had a heavy storm and the sun suddenly breaks
through the clouds, we see against the darkest part of the sky a
beautiful arch of colors-a rainbow. It is the same-if we are of
those who try to obey the Lord-when we have passed successfully
through a severe temptation. He is able to light up for us the bits
of truth from His Word which we have in our minds and make
them suddenly beautiful with new meaning. What a perfect symbol
is the rainbow of the Lord's power to protect and bless us no
matter how dark life may seem!

Primary
Some children may never have seen a rainbow; so the teacher may have to
explain what it is and when it is usually seen. The children can be encouraged
to watch for one and to think of it as a sign of the Lord's care over us. Stress
the fact that the Lord takes care of us if we are good, even when life seems
dark. Even the Primary children can get the idea that the sun in this world is
like the Lord in our souls.

You remember how the first people disobeyed the Lord and let
the serpent persuade them to eat the fruit of the tree of knowledge
of good and evil. Then they had to leave the beautiful Garden of
Eden and go out and earn their living by hard labor.

You know that when one child does wrong, he is very likely to
lead other children who are with him to do wrong, too. So the
first people, once they had started to disobey the Lord, became
worse and worse. Finally most of them became so bad that the
Lord could not let them live any longer. They were destroyed in
a great flood.
But there were a few good people left. Noah and his family were
told by the Lord how to save themselves by building a boat, called
an "ark," and gathering into it a pair of every kind of bird and
animal
that had been created. The great rain which caused the
flood lasted forty days and forty nights, and the waters rose until
they covered the tops of the mountains; but the ark rode safely on
top of the water. When the rain stopped and the waters began to
go down, the ark rested on top of a mountain called Ararat.

When the earth was dry again, Noah and his family and all the
animals came out of the ark, and a new race of people began on
the earth. Did your mother ever show you something very fine and
say, "See, I am going to put this up on the mantel where you can
see it, and if you are good all day, you shall have it before you go
to bed"? She made an agreement with you, and the thing she put
on the mantel was a sign or token to you that she would keep
her part of the agreement if you would keep yours. Another word
for agreement is "covenant." Now let us read our story for today.
[Read Genesis 9:8-17.J

Did you ever see a rainbow? Sometimes when it has been raining
the sun comes out suddenly and
and the clouds are very black,
a beautiful bow of bright colors appears against the dark clouds.
Whenever you see one, remember that it is a sign from the Lord
the sun is still there and
that no matter how dark things look,
ready to shine again, and the Lord is taking care of you. If you are
good, no trouble will last very long.

Junior

See how much the children already know of the story of Noah and the flood
and fill in any gaps. The Juniors are old enough to be interested in the history
of mankind, and it is a good thing to get into their minds the thought that
man was not created evil or even a savage, but by his own selfish choice de 
clined spiritually until the Lord had to come into the world to save the human
race from destroying itself. In connection with the rainbow, if possible, show
the children by means of a prism how the white light is broken up into its
colors.

THE RAINBOW

In the story of the Garden of Eden, by what names are the first men and
women called?
What two special trees were in the garden?
What were Adam and Eve told not to do?
Who tempted them to disobey?
What was their punishment?

When we disobey, our disobedience often leads us into doing
other wrong things, and it is likely to get other people into trouble
too. After the first people began to think they knew better than
the Lord what they should do, they grew worse and worse. Each
generation became more selfish and evil until they could not be
allowed to live any longer. Their evils destroyed them. This is
described in the Bible by the story of the flood. In this story Noah
and his family picture the few good people who had resisted temp 
tation and so could be saved. You are all familiar with the story of
the flood. Let us see how accurately we remember it. If you do
not know the answers, you may look up the Bible verses.

Who went into the ark with Noah? (Genesis 7:7)
What else did Noah take into the ark? (Genesis 7:8-9)
How long did the rain last? (Genesis 7: 12)
When the flood abated, where did the ark rest? (Genesis 8:4)

The word Ararat means "high land." This is why the mountain
in the story is given that name. In the previous lesson we had the
story of how Noah sent out first a raven and then a dove to see if
the waters were dried up from off the earth. Then, when he and
his family came out of the ark, the first thing he did was to build
an altar and worship the Lord. An altar is a symbol of worship;
so in our churches we keep a copy of the Word on the altar. In the
Bible people often built an altar to the Lord when they were grate 
ful for something. We can build an altar in our minds by remember 
ing always to thank the Lord for our blessings.

Now comes our lesson for today.

What did the Lord promise Noah?
What sign did He give?
When do we usually' see a rainbow?
Sometimes, too, we see a rainbow in the spray of a fountain.
A rainbow is formed when the sunlight strikes drops of water and
is reflected back into our eyes. The white light is broken up into
beautiful colors. A prism does the same thing.

You have heard that water is a symbol or picture of truth. And
light is also a symbol of truth. That is why, when we suddenly
understand something, we say, "I see!" Every verse from the Bible
which you store away in your mind is like a drop of water, and
when the Lord sees that you need to understand it, the light seems
to shine into it suddenly and bring out all the beautiful things in it
like the colors in the rainbow.

Of what was the rainbow to be a sign?

Just as the rainbow usually appears against the background of a
dark cloud, so it
is in times of trouble and temptation that we
most need truth from the Lord and are most likely to ask Him for
help. That is why the rainbow is the sign of the Lord's nearness to
us whenever we need Him. The Lord's promise meant also that
He would never again allow the human race to reach such a state
of wickedness that it would be destroyed. I t almost reached this
state once in the course of history and then the Lord Himself came
into the world and showed men the way back to safety.

Intermediate

The doctrine of the different churches which have been on the earth should
be introduced at this age, and this lesson of the flood and the sign of the
rainbow makes the best possible opportunity. Stress our need of learning the
truth and making ourselves obey it, and the meaning of the rainbow with
reference to our knowledge of the Word.

The story of Noah and the flood is a picture of the end of
the Most Ancient Church-the first church which existed on the
earth-and the beginning of the second or Ancient Church. It is
also a picture of a change which takes place very early in our lives.
The people of the Most Ancient Church were as innocent and
trustful as little babies are, although in some ways they were much

THE RAINBOW

wiser than we are today because they knew that the things of
nature were important only as they teach us of heavenly things.
They talked with spirits and angels. and their thoughts and actions
came from their hearts. They could not even think anything which
they did not will. We know that a baby always shows his feelings
immediately and that his little life is governed by them.

But we know that it is not long before a little child learns that
what he wants is not always right, and so his mind begins to judge
his feelings and to control them. This helps us to see what the
change was which the Lord had to make in mankind after they
began to want to go their own way instead of His. For people who
had to think and do just what their hearts wanted could not be
"taught better" after their hearts became bad. Their thoughts and
actions became bad, too, and in the end they destroyed themselves.
You may hear it said today of someone who is letting bad habits
get control of him that he is "going to destruction." The flood is
the Bible picture of this destruction of the people of the Most
Ancient Church.

Before all the people had reached this point, however, the Lord
made a change in the very nature of the few who still wanted to
be good-the "remnant"-who are pictured in the story by Noah
and his family. He separated their understanding from their will so
that they could think the truth even when they did not want to
live according to it. All people since that time have been of this
nature. So they could be taught what was right and could make
themselves do it until it became a habit and they learned again to
like to do it. We know that this is the way we all learn. We are self 
ish to begin with, just as the people at the end of the Most Ancient
Church had come to be, but we can learn what the Lord wants and
be shown that it is best for us, and make ourselves obey Him until
we come to love to obey Him. This is the process of "reformation
and regeneration" about which we shall speak a good deal as our
study goes on.

The story of Noah's building the ark, tak~ng his family and all
the animals into it, and riding out the flood is a picture of how the
Lord protected the good remnant of the people while this great
change was taking place in them. Perhaps you remember that the
rain lasted forty days and forty nights. All numbers in the Word
have a correspondence, and the number forty corresponds to temp 
tation. In our own lives the flood pictures the time when the Lord
is showing us by means of our own selfishness that it is better to
do right than wrong, so that we may develop the habit of doing
right. That is the way we all learn in the beginning: We try to do
what our parents say is right, not because we want to, but because
we know we shall be punished for doing wrong and rewarded for
doing right.

It takes a long time for good habits to become so established in
us that our hearts can be changed. Even after the rain stopped, it
was a hundred and fifty days before the flood began to subside
and several months after that before Noah could come out of the
ark and move about freely and reestablish his life on the earth.
Read Genesis 8: 20-22. An altar is always the symbol of worship,
and Noah's building the altar pictures the establishment of a new
church on the earth which is called the Ancient Church. The
people of the Most Ancient Church had not had a Bible. The Lord
had instructed them by an inner way, through their innocent and
good hearts and by visions and dreams. Near the end of that church
good people, realizing that selfishness was closing this inner door,
had begun to write down the teachings that had been received in
this way so that they should not be lost. So when the Ancient
Church was established, it had a set of sacred writings-the Ancient
Word. This has been lost, but we know something of what it was
like because the first seven chapters of our Bible were drawn from
it. It was written in the symbol language in which the people of
that time spoke because they understood the spiritual correspon 
dence of everything in nature.

The Lord made a new covenant with this new church. A cov 
enant is an agreement. In the letter the Lord promised protection
to all who would obey Him. He promised that never again would
He allow a time to come when people would have to be destroyed

THE RAINBOW

as the people of the Most Ancient Church had been. The sign or
token of this covenant was the rainbow. This does not mean that
there had never been a rainbow in the natural world before, but
that the Lord showed them that the rainbow had a special mean 
ing for them. The rainbow is very beautiful. It is caused by the
breaking up of the sun's rays into their colors when the rays are
reflected from the raindrops. This is a perfect picture of the new
state in which men were to live from that time on. As we have
seen, in the time of the people called Adam-the Golden Age or
Most Ancient Church-the Lord spoke directly to pe'opIe in their
hearts. This was like the direct light of the sun. But in the time
of the people called Noah-the Silver Age or Ancient Church 
men had to learn truths from the Word-the drops of water from
heaven-and then the Lord could enlighten their minds to see how
these truths were to be used in their daily lives; the different appli 
cations of the truth are like the beautiful colors of the rainbow.
So we today learn stories and verses from the Word and the Lord
enlightens us to see their meaning and how they can guide and
help us.

The rainbow, which comes against the dark clouds as a storm
passes away, is a beautiful symbol of the Lord's truth leading us
through temptation and trouble into happiness and peace.

Basic Correspondences
forty = temptation

the flood = falsities destroying the life

the rainbow = truths from the Word in our mind
used by the Lord to enlighten us

Senior
The important lesson for the Seniors is the way in which the Lord leads us to
goodness by making use of our own states, and the fact that we never know
truth instinctively but have to learn it from the Word.

We noted previously that once the people of the Most Ancient
Church began to look to themselves and their natural senses for
guidance, they declined steadily in spirituality. They became pos 
sessed by their passions and by the falsities associated with them,
which grew until they swallowed up all truly human life and every
spiritual aspiration. This is pictured in the Bible by the flood which
destroyed all living things and covered even the mountain tops.
You will remember that the preservation of Noah and his family in
the ark pictures the way in which the Lord saved the "remnant" 
the few people who still recognized the Lord and wished to obey
Him-during this time of the final devastation of the Most Ancient
Church. In our own lives it pictures the way in which the Lord,
leads us by means of our
as we corne out of babyhood, at first
very selfishness, by showing us that we get along better when we
obey our parents. So we form good habits and eventually can
come to love doing right.

In the Bible story the drying up of the ground is the subsiding of
the monstrous falsities of the past age. When this was accomplished
the good remnant could be free in the earth again. We may perhaps
think of an analogy to this in the dissipation of the idea of the
"super-race" in middle Europe after the close of the Second World
War. Noah's first act was to build an altar to the Lord and bring
sacrifices. This is the first mention in the Word of "burnt offer 
ings" of animals, but Swedenborg tells us that the people called
Noah merely presented the animals at
the altar and did not kill
them. They knew that to present the animals before the fire on
the altar meant making their affections sacred to the service of the
Lord. In later times, when knowledge of this meaning had been
lost, people began to burn the animals themselves, and the Lord
permitted it in order to keep them from sacrificing their children
as the idolatrous nations did.

Then in the Bible story the Lord makes a covenant with Noah,
promising that He will protect men henceforth from being over 
whelmed by their own evils and falsities, and He gives the rainbow
as a sign.

The rainbow, we know, is caused by the breaking up of the
white light from the sun as it is reflected from minute drops of

THE RAINBOW

water. This is a perfect picture of man's new state. The light from
the Lord no longer shone directly into his affections as it had in
the time of Adam, but shone into the truths from the Word which
he had received in his mind, and from these enlightened him ac 
cording to his particular need. This application of the truth to
particular states and needs is pictured in the beautiful colors, all
harmonious. The rainbow always appears against the dark clouds
when the storm is almost over; so it is a symbol of the Lord's
protecting and enlightening presence with us in times of trouble
and temptation. The Lord is actually nearer to us when we are in
temptation than at any other time.

We can understand this story if we think how the verses which
we have learned from the Word are brought up in our minds just
when we most need them, and filled with new meaning. The more
raindrops of truth we have and the darker the background of
trouble or temptation, the brighter and more beautiful the rain 
bow.

The people pictured by Adam formed what we call the Most
Ancient Church, which was an "affectional" or "celestial" church,
and so came down in mythology as the "Golden Age" because
among the metals gold is the symbol of love. The people called
Noah formed the Ancient Church, an intellectual or "spiritual"
church, termed the "Silver Age" in mythology because silver is the
symbol of truth. Mythology is not an invention of the peoples
of historic times to account for their origins, but old traditions
handed down from the early people who talked in the language of
correspondence.

Adult

Two main lines of discussion may be pursued: the significance of the philos 
ophy of history found in the A rcana, and the difference between the people
of the Mo~t Ancient Church and all later people-including ourselves. We have
a strong tendency to imagine that individually-if we learn the truths of the
church in childhood-we arrive at a point when we no longer need to think
truth but somehow do good instinctively. There is nothing in the
about
writings of the New Church to support such an idea.

The New Church teaching with regard to history is like a power 
ful searchlight bringing into clear view an area which has previously
been dark and uncertain. History as we study it in school is some 
thing which has been compiled from material remains of past ages
and from man-made documents, both sources necessarily fragmen 
tary. Studied in this way, history is inevitably regarded as a process
of human achievement-man's gradual conquest of his environment
and the dealings of man with man. God has no part in it except as
to have developed one religious concept after
men are thought
another and in spreading their ideas to have affected external
events. But the Word teaches us that "In the beginning God cre 
ated the heaven and the earth" and that God's revelation of Him 
self to man has governed and directed all history. And the writings
of Swedenborg teach us that in every age the church has been the
"heart and lungs" of the social body, the center from which the
life and thought of the age has sprung.

The character of the ancient people, as these writings reveal it
to us in the interpretation of the early chapters of Genesis, is very
different from the theories concerning it which men have formed
from the study of material remains, and is much closer to the
stories of the Golden and Silver Ages handed down through myth 
ology. Our lesson today covers the period of the flood-the tran 
sition from the Most Ancient to the Ancient Church. In AC 605
we read: "The subject now treated of is the formation of a new
church, which is called 'Noah'; and its formation is described by
the ark into which living things of every kind were received. But as
is wont to be the case, before that new church could arise it was
necessary that the man of the church should suffer many temp 
tations, which are described by the lifting up of the ark, its fluctu 
ation, and its delay upon the waters of the flood. And finally, that
he became a true spiritual man and was set free, is described by
the cessation of the waters, and the many things that follow."

Here we have clearly stated the way in which the Lord raised up
a new church-the Ancient Church-from the "remnant" who were

THE RAINBOW

such that
they could be regenerated. We are familiar with the
thought that Noah and his sons picture this remnant. The change
was not sudden. It took place gradually over a long period of time.
The events described in chapter 7 of Genesis treat in their internal
sense of the preservation of the remnant and their preparation for
the new type of life to be developed, and chapter 8 treats of the
development of the new church in them.

Finally in our chapter for today the state of the regenerate man
of that church is described, and this is summed up in the "token"
of the new covenant, the rainbow. We should note that this cov 
enant was to be a perpetual one. That is, although the Ancient
Church was to decline and perish and its knowledges to be lost,
the character of man as to his means of regeneration .would not
again be changed. The human race on earth will not go back to
the state of the man of the Most Ancient Church, although the
regeneration of any individual may, if he is faithful, progress to
the celestial degree. We are told that since the period of the flood
no one has been added to the heavens of the Most Ancient Church,
and the hells of that church have been closed. The succeeding
churches have their celestial heavens but
they are not reached
except by the process described by the sign of the rainbow. Each
of us is born natural and must learn truths and become spiritual
before he can become celestial.

Swedenborg tells us (AC 1043) that the cloud pictures the ob 
scurity in which our minds are as a result of the evil in our natural
wills. But when we introduce truths from the Word into our minds
and try to live according to them, light from the Lord shining in
those truths-like the rays of the sun reflected in the drops of
water against the dark cloud-can so modify our darkness as to
produce beautiful appearances of truth in our minds,
like the
colors of the rainbow, teaching us that the Lord is always present
with His love and protection however dark our surroundings may
seem, and that if we are faithful to the truth, He will keep us safe
and finally remove our temptations and "create in us a clean
heart." This is the covenant which He makes with all the human
race. Because the will with which we are born is evil, we cannot
see truth directly by perception as the people of the Most Ancient
Church did, but truth can be reflected from the knowledge of the
letter of the Word which we have in our minds and so "reform" us
that the Lord can come into our hearts and give us a new will.
This is the method of regeneration with all people since the flood,
and the rainbow is consequently the correspondential sign of re 
generation with the "spiritual" as distinguished from the "celestial"
type of man.

Swedenborg says (AC 1042): "Spiritual angels, who have all
been regenerated men of the spiritual church, when presented to
sight as such in the other life, appear with as it were a rainbow
about the head." He also tells us that the character of the rainbow
is different with each, according to the particular way in which he
has allowed the truth to modify the natural obscurity of his mind.
The "white" light is broken up into colors by the absorption of
some of its elements by darkness of one sort or another. All the
colors of the rainbow are harmonious and all are present in the
white beam. The particular content of our minds determines the
colors which can be reflected there and which ones will be blotted
out by persistent falsities. "Many are regenerated by the Lord in
every dogma, and when they have been regenerated they do not
receive any immediate revelation, but only what is insinuated into
them through the Word and the preaching of the Word. But be 
cause they receive charity, the Lord works through charity upon
their cloud, from which there springs light, as when the sun strikes
a cloud, which then becomes more luminous and is variegated with
colors. Thus also there arises in the cloud the likeness of a bow.
The thinner the cloud, that is, the more numerous are the inter 
mingled truths of faith of which it consists, the more beautiful is
the bow. But the denser the cloud, that is, the fewer the truths of
faith of which it consists, the less beautiful is the bow. Innocence
adds much to its beauty, giving as it were a living brightness to the
colors" (AC 1043). This gives us one clear answer to the question
often asked, "If people of all religions can be saved, why is one

THE RAINBOW

religion better than another?" We should all wish to have our cloud
of falsities as thin as possible so that our characters may reflect
more of the beautiful variations of the Lord's light. But we must
remember that there can be no rainbow whatever if charity is not
found in us. We must wish to serve the Lord and the neighbor
instead of oursel~es or we can have no enlightenment.

From the Writings of Swedenborg

Arcana Coelestia, n. 1042: "I have set my bow in the cloud. This signifies the
state of the regenerated spiritual man, which is like a rainbow. Anyone may
wonder that the 'bow in the cloud,' or the rainbow, is taken in the Word for
a token of the covenant, seeing that the rainbow is nothing but an appearance
arising from the modification of the rays of sunlight in raindrops, and thus
only something natural ... And that the 'bow in the cloud' represents regen 
eration, and signifies the state of the regenerated spiritual man, cannot be
known to anyone unless it be given him to see and hence to know how the
case is. Spiritual angels, who have all been regenerated men of the spiritual
church, when presented to sight as such in the other life, appear with as it
were a rainbow about the head. But the rainbows seen are in accordance with
their state, and thus from them their quality is known in heaven and in the
world of spirits. The reason that the appearance of a rainbow is seen is that
their natural things corresponding to their spiritual present such an appear 
ance. It is a modification of spiritual light from the Lord in their natural
things. These angels are those who are said to be regenerated 'of water and
the spirit,' but the celestial angels are said to be regenerated 'with fire.'''

== THE TOWER OF BABEL
Genesis 11: 1-9

With all classes above Primary the teacher will need to prepare
in his mind a brief summary of the story of the flood and of Noah.
Present the flood as the inevitable end of those who turn away
from the Lord and rely on their own judgment, and the saving of
Noah as the Lord's provision for the preservation of the race He
had created. Then show how history repeated itself because of
human conceit and folly and so introduce the lesson for today.
The teacher should have in mind an exam pIe of a modern building
of a Tower of Babel which will come close to the experience of
his particular class.

Doctrinal Points
In the Bible the East is a symbol of nearness to the Lord.
The first seven chapters of the Bible were taken from the Ancient

Word and are pure symbol stories.

If we build on our own ideas instead of on truth from the Word,

we are always in a state of confusion.

The desire to set ourselves above others is destructive.

Notes for Parents

The story of the flood is the symbolic description of the end of
the first great "church" on the earth. Most of its people were
swallowed up by the wrong ways of living which they developed
as they became more and more selfish. Those who still wanted to
serve the Lord are pictured by Noah and his family. The Lord gave
them a new revelation of truth-the Ancient Word, which existed
before our Bible and is referred to and quoted here and there in
our Bible. From this they learned the truths which the earlier
church, as long as its people remained simple and innocent, had
been given by an inner perception~

180
The people of the Ancient Church-this second church-became
very wise from their study of the Ancient Word, much wiser than
we are today, but gradually they began to be proud of their wis 
dom, as learned people sometimes are, and to forget that the Lord
was the source of all their knowledge and that none of it was the
product of their own minds. So they,
too, separated faith from
charity and strayed further and further from true worship of the
Lord and true goodness.

The story of the Tower of Babel is the description of the end
of this second church. Spiritually its people came to live in a low
valley-a low, worldly plane of thought-and built their lives ac 
cording to their own selfish ideas-the brick and slime-instead of
with the stone of truths from the Lord cemented together by
mortar-charity in the heart. This was because their object was to
make a name for themselves.

When people are seeking only their own advantage, they cannot
live together in harmony or work effectively together. Each one
speaks his own language and they do not understand each other.
They have to go their separate ways.

We know that the earliest historical records find men actually
scattered over the surface of the earth, practicing many forms of
idolatry, many of them at war with each other, and many in savage
states. This is not the original state of mankind, as some historians
assume. It is the condition which followed the breaking up of the
Ancient Church. Mythology tells us of the Golden and Silver Ages
before recorded history, and most peoples have such traditions,
handed down by word of mouth through the centuries. The Lord
Himself gives us this knowledge in the first seven chapters of our
Bible, wonderful symbolic accounts of the two great civilizations
which had risen, flourished, and died before written records began.

Primary

At this age level the desire to make a name for oneself appears in the childish
tendency to "show off." The story may be made the beginning of developing
in the children an objective attitude toward their own conduct which we all
need to cultivate as early as possible.
These children can see in a simple way the meaning of the confusion of
tongues. Be sure they learn the name Babel and its meaning.

This story took place long after the time of Cain and Abel.
Many generations of people had come and gone, but people were
still living in the same part of the world in which the Lord had
put them in the beginning. They had learned a great deal since the
first simple times, and they had come to think themselves very
wise. But you know that people who think themselves wise are
sometimes not wise at all, because wisdom is not in having a great
deal of knowledge but in using the knowledge we have as the Lord
wants us to use it.

Let us read a story about these people, and as we read it, see if
you can find some things in it which show how foolish they really
were. [Read Genesis 11:,1-9.]

In the first place, they were foolish to imagine that they could
build something that would reach heaven, weren't they? Then they
were foolish to begin in a low valley instead of on a mo~ntain
top. And finally they were foolish to use anything but the best
materials.

What did they use to build the tower?
Of what should they have built it?

They were very silly, weren't they? But you see they were not
trying to do something good and useful, but just to make a name
for themselves; that is, they were trying to "show off," as we say.
Do you ever try to show off? People who do are apt to do things
which are very foolish. Instead of making other people admire
them, they usually get into trouble.

How did the Lord stop them?
Today we use the word Babel to mean confusion.
When people are thinking only about themselves, they cannot work together.
They do not understand each other.
Selftshness and conceit separate people just as the Lord scattered the people
of Babel.
Something like this happens to you sometimes. When you are
playing with another child and each of you wants to have his own
way, neither of you can understand why the other does not agree
with him. You fall to quarreling and go off home. The pleasure
you might have had together is spoiled. This is what always comes
of thinking we are wiser than everyone else.

Junior
Something can be done in this class with the real meaning of the successive
churches, the reason for their decline, and the general correspondence of the
Tower of Babel story. The last statement in the Junior notes should interest
the children.

who were the first two sons of Adam and Eve?
What was Cain's occupation?
What was Abel's occupation?
What offering did Abel bring to the Lord?
What offering did Cain bring?
Why was Cain's offering not accepted?
What did Cain do to Abel?
What was his punishment?
How did the Lord save him from destruction?
What do Cain and Abel represent?

The Bible story tells us that the early people, after they once
decided to depend on their own judgment instead of obeying the
Lord wholly, became worse and worse. This is what always hap 
pens when anyone decides that he does not need to obey the Lord.
Their selfishness and their false ideas finally became so great that
they were destroyed by their own evils, just as a criminal event 
ually "comes to a bad end." Their destruction is pictured in the
story of the flood.

But you remember in the story of the flood that some people

who still wanted to obey the Lord were saved.

What were these people called in the story?
How was Noah saved?
What sign was given to him after he came out of the ark?

THE TOWER OF BABEL

What promise did the Lord make?

Do you suppose that all the people after Noah kept the covenant
the Lord had made with them? No, people again began to think
selfishly and to forget that they owed everything to the Lord. This
made them feel very important. They were not giants of selfish 
ness like the last people before the flood, but they thought a great
deal of themselves and of their own ideas. They gave themselves
credit for their knowledge. They even thought they could reach
heaven by their own way and be like God.

In the story we have today how did they try to reach heaven?
What was their purpose in building the tower?

Read the lesson and see if you can find three great mistakes they
made to begin with. People who think themselves wise are always
really foolish.

Where did they begin to build their tower?
What building material did they use?
What did they use instead of mortar?
What did the Lord decide to do?
Why did they have to stop building the tower when their language was
"confounded"?

You would find it hard to work with anyone who could not speak
English. But sometimes you do not understand other people even
when they are speaking English, because they use words you don't
know, or because they are talking about things you are not old
enough to understand, or because you are not paying attention.
And sometimes you don't understand because you don't want to
understand. Selfish people are never interested in anything other
people want. So selfish people never really understand each other.
And people who "know it all" don't even listen to other people.
So you see why it is said that the Lord "confounded" the language
of the people in the story. They were so selfish and conceited that
they could not work together at ail.

What was the name of the tower?
Babel today is a synonym for "confusion."
What happened to the people after their language was confounded?

The people described in the story of the Garden of Eden were
the first great church upon the earth. This is called the Most
Ancient Church. The people described in the story of Noah were
the second great church, the Ancient Church. When this church
departed from the Lord, it was really scattered all over the world,
the religions in the world today except the Jewish, the
and all
Christian, and the Mohammedan are based on traditions handed
down from this Ancient Church.

Intermediate
In its application to our own lives the lesson is very easy to illustrate for this
age group. Its correspondences are simple and clear. Because of its brevity the
lesson lends itself to verse by verse interpretation, and it may be a good thing
to take advantage of this method, as we do not often have time for it in a
Sunday School period. The class should also be given specific teaching con 
cerning the character of the Ancient Church, why it declined, and how it
ended, as there will be further references to it during the year.

In past lessons we have studied the stories which immediately
follow the story of Cain and Abel-the stories of the flood and of
Noah and the ark. These are such familiar stories that we need
only speak of their spiritual meaning. The flood was a flood of
falsity and evil which finally overwhelmed the people of the Most
Ancient Church once they had turned from the Lord to self. Even
an innocent child, once he determines to close his ears to instruc 
tion and advice, is likely to become worse and worse until finally
he may actually become a criminal. A criminal is not made all at
once, but little by little by accepting and acting upon false ideas in 
stead of true ones. But all the people of the Most Ancient Church
did not reach the state represented by the destruction in the flood.
Some, even though they were in false ideas and had yielded to
some evils, still recognized the Lord and meant to obey Him; so
the Lord could save them. This good remnant is represented by
Noah and his family, and their character is represented by the ark.
And you will remember that when the flood subsided and they

THE TOWER OF BABEL

came out of the ark, Noah built an altar and worshiped the Lord,
and the Lord made a new covenant with him, the sign of which was
the rainbow. This was the beginning of the second great church,
the Ancient Church.

The Ancient Church was of a different character from the Most
Ancient, in that its people were no longer instructed by the Lord
through an inner perception of truth, but had to learn truth by an
outward way, just as we do, before the Lord could enlighten their
minds. The very fact that they had to study and learn gave these
people a great respect for knowledge. Their particular study was
the study of correspondences, which they developed into a science.
At first, of course, they studied the correspondence of the world
about them for the purpose of learning how the Lord wanted them
to live. But after a while they began to forget the purpose and to
study just for the sake of knowing more than other people. You
can see how this might happen. A boy, for instance, may decide
that he wants to be a doctor because he feels that as a doctor he
can help a great many people. But by the time he has completed
his long years of training, he may have fallen in love with his sci 
ence and want to go on with it just in order to make a great name
for himself, regardless of whether or not what he is doing is really
helping people. You see we are getting close to our lesson for
today,
the story of the Tower of Babel; for the people in that
story were working to make themselves a name-not with any
thought of serving the Lord and the neighbor.

This story-like the story of the flood-describes the end of a
church,
this time of the second or Ancient Church. Let us think
for a moment of the particular correspondences in it. Up to this
time "the whole earth was of one language, and of one speech."
This means that in general and in particular people agreed as to the
doctrines of their religion. But now they were journeying "from
the east." This means away from the Lord, for the East, where
the sun rises, corresponds to the Lord and the love and truth that
come from Him. And they went down into a valley, a low state of
life, and there they decided to build a city and a tower whose top
should reach to heaven, for the purpose of making a name for
themselves. A city represents doctrine and a tower the worship of
self. We are building just such a city and tower when we think of
ourselves as the most important thing in the world and form our
ideas according to what we think will be most to our own advan 
tage, so that people will admire us and do what we want.

The builders of the Tower of Babel had brick for stone. Stone,
you remember, represents truth. Brick represents man-made ideas,
and these bricks were burned thoroughly in the fire of self-love.
And they had slime or pitch instead of mortar. Mortar, which
binds stones together, represents true charity; but pitch, which
melts when heated, represents self-love.

We can see from all this why it is said that the Lord confounded
their language and scattered them abroad over all the face of the
earth. When each person in a group is thinking of himself, each is
unwilling to hear and accept any ideas which are not to his ad 
vantage. So they do not understand each other and cannot work
together. Sometimes two boys or girls are friends for a while when
they are looking for the same kind of pleasure, but it takes very
little to break up such a friendship.

The Ancient Church actually did break up and scatter all over
the earth. Some of its knowledges were handed down by tradition
and appear in the Greek and Roman myths and in the hieroglyph 
ics of Egypt and the magic of India. But the Lord was no longer
in that church.

Senior

In addition to the general lesson on the folly of setting up human intelligence

THE TOWER OF BABEL

above revelation from the Lord, stress the different interpretation of history
which the knowledge about the Most Ancient and Ancient Churches makes
possible for us, and the many things in the modern world which this interpret 
ation explains.

The people of the Most Ancient Church, after the separation
of faith and charity and the consequent destruction of charity as
pictured in the story of Cain and Abel, developed more and more
monstrous evils. This is what is meant by Genesis 6:4. The "sons
of God" are the truths handed down in that church, the "daugh 
ters of men" are selfish loves, and their marriage pictures the falsi 
fication of truth when it is used selfishly. That this process actually
developed physical giants we know from later history in the Word.
All the giants-including the well-known Og, king of Bashan, and
Goliath of Gath-were evil remnants of the Most Ancient Church.
The destruction of the Most Ancient Church is pictured, as we
know, by the story of the flood, and the establishment of a second
great church-the Ancient Church-by the story of the salvation of
Noah and his family in the ark, and the covenant of the rainbow.
This church was of a new character, having lost the inner percep 
tion of truth by which the good in the Most Ancient Church were
led. The will and the understanding in man had been separated,
and men now had to acquire truth in the memory by an outward
way-as we do-before they could be enlightened by the Lord.
In its best days this was a church of great wisdom, delighting in
the study of correspondences and developing varied and beautiful
forms of worship according to correspondences.

But gradually pride in their own wisdom undermined the purity
of their life and worship. The history of the decline of the Ancient
Church is covered by a long chapter of genealogy (Genesis 10),
each successive generation picturing some new development. Such
a chapter may seem to us a mere tiresome succession of names,
but Swedenborg tells us that it is nevertheless very useful for us
to read it, for as we read, the angels who are with us are under 
standing the inner meaning.

The story of the Tower of Babel describes the end of the
Ancient Church. In only nine verses we have a wonderful picture.
The people were journeying "from the east"-away from the Lord
-and they came finally to dwell in the plain of Shinar, a low
valley, representing a state far from the Lord. Read Isaiah 55:9.
There they decided to build a tower whose top should reach to
heaven in order to make a name for themselves. Their ambition
was to become great by their own unaided efforts. We hear people
boast of being "self-made." An understanding of the folly of such
an idea is expressed in the taunt, "He is trying to pull himself up
by his own bootstraps." Reason tells us that in order to rise a
person must
take hold of something higher than himself; yet we
are always trying to exalt our own ideas and our own powers.

"They had brick for stone, and slime had they for mortar."
Stone represents truth. It is God-given; no man can make it. Brick
is man-made and represents our own ideas used as a substitute for
the Divine truth. The slime or pitch (the word in the Hebrew is
bitumen) symbolizes self-love. Self-love will hold people together
for a time, as long as their interests coincide, but a very little heat
of angry passion will melt the bond. Every man-made philosophy
of life is a tower of Babel, begun in the valley and built up of
brick and slime in an effort to reach heaven-to "make a name"
for oneself.

"And the Lord said, Behold, the people is one, and they have
all one language." This pictures the fact that up to this time the
people had had but one doctrine of truth. Now this state was to
be broken up. When men look to themselves for truth, there is no
fixed standard. Men's ideas differ. Each follows his own selfish line
of thought. They begin to argue and quarrel and cease to under 
stand each other because each is interested only in his own ideas.
So the Ancient Church broke up in a "confusion of tongues," or
conflicting religious ideas, and as a result actually was "scattered
abroad upon the face of all the earth." Babel has become a syn 
onym for "confusion."

Historians make the mistake of assuming that the state of men
at the beginning of history was but a step in a constant upward

THE TOWER OF BABEL

development of civilization. So they believe that men started as
godless wild beasts. Instead of this, the state of the world at the
opening of recorded history was the end of a great civilization, the
second great civilization since the beginning. Mythology, with its
golden and silver ages, is really much nearer the truth than the
modern naturalistic interpretation of history. The Greek and Ro 
man myths are full of true correspondences, and the hieroglyphics
of Egypt, as well as the magic practiced there and later in India,
are based on the knowledges of correspondence handed down by
tradition among the scattered remnants of the Ancient Church. In
the Bible story itself we have Balaam's use of correspondence in
his effort to curse Israel and-on the good side-we have the corre 
spondential gifts brought to the infant Lord by the wise men of
the East. All the pagan religions of the world have their roots in
the Ancient Church. This is why in all of them there is enough
genuine truth to form the basis of a good life, so that those who
choose to believe in God and to live in love to the neighbor may
reach heaven.

Adult
The reasons for the decline of the Ancient church and the picture given of it
in the series Noah, Ham, Cush, Nimrod, Babel are important for the Adults,
especially in connection with the modern approach to Bible study. We might
note that the First Christian Church followed the same historic pattern of
decline which the Ancient Church presents.

The decline of the Most Ancient Church is described in Genesis
5 in the genealogy from Adam to Noah, and its final state of gross
self-love in Genesis 6: 1-7. The destruction of the people of the
Most Ancient Church had to be permitted because they were so
constituted that all their knowledge of truth came by perception
through the will, and when the will became wholly selfish, they
could think no'thing but what was false. We are familiar with the
general meaning of the story of the flood, the salvation of Noah
and his family in the ark, and the new covenant whose sign was
the rainbow. With the people of the Ancient Church which was
founded on this covenant,
the will and the understanding were
separated so that men could receive knowledge of divine truth by
an external way, as all men have received it since that time.

Because of the brevity and simplicity of these early Bible stories
we are apt to forget that, like the six days of creation, each of
them describes a development which took centuries. The world
does not pass suddenly from one state to another any more than
an individual does. The germs of evil as well as the remains of good
are often unnoticed for a long time and grow little by little. So the
tremendous pride of self-intelligence which brought about the end
of the Ancient Church was the culmination of a long, slow process
of decline.

In our lesson for today we find them journeying "from the
east"-away from the Lord-and they have come to a plain in the
land of Shinar. There they build a city and a tower, which is called
Babel. Babel
is first mentioned in Genesis 10: 10 as one of the
productions of Nimrod, who was a son of Cush and a grandson
of Ham. Of the three sons of Noah-the three different branches
of the Ancient Church-Ham represents external worship without
internal, or faith without charity. Cush represents the "interior
knowledges of the Word, whereby such men [men who are in faith
without charity] confirm false principles." Nimrod represents the
external worship of those who place religion in externals and not
in internals. Nimrod was a "mighty hunter" and Swedenborg tells
us that this is because the greater part of mankind do not know
what internal things are, but only external things; and most men
abide in things of sense,
in pleasures and in cupidities, and have
in view themselves and the world; and therefore they are easily
captivated by such a religion." (AC 1178) This gives us a back 
ground for our thought concerning the Tower of Babel.

In Isaiah 14: 13-14 it is said of the king of Babylon: "For thou
hast said in thine heart, I will ascend into heaven, I will exalt my
throne above the stars of God: I will sit also upon the mount of
the congregation, in the sides of the north: I will ascend above the
heights of the clouds; I will be like the Most High." The word

THE TOWER OF BABEL

Babylon is merely the Greek form of Babel; by a play on words
they are both connected with a Hebrew root (balal) which signi 
fies confusion. The state which causes spiritual confusion is the
exaltation of self. The pride of the king of Babylon and the pride
of the people of the degenerate Ancient Church are both described
in the Bible in similar terms, but the older story, being part of the
Ancient Word, uses the picture of the actual building of a tower
"whose top may reach unto heaven." "And they had brick for
stone, and slime had they for mortar." Stone is one of the symbols
of truth, standing particularly for the fundamental truths upon
which we build our lives. So the Lord Himself is called the "Cor 
nerstone," and many times the "Rock." Bricks are made by man
out of the earth itself to take the place of stone. They picture
principles which man makes up out of his own mind to take the
place of the Lord's truths;
the fire with which he burns them
"thoroughly" is the fire of self-love; and self-interest is the slime
or bitumen with which he sticks them together, in place of the
enduring mortar of neighborly love.

A businessman who believes that "the first duty of each of us
is to look after himself" has definite principles upon which he
carries on his business; he makes these up with the best of his
understanding so that he may succeed. He may not lie or steal or
cheat because he can see that "honesty is the best policy," but his
principles have nothing to hold them together except self-interest,
and as soon as he is convinced that some other practice would
the structure that he has made falls to pieces,
serve him better,
like the house founded on the sand: his "slime" has melted away.
Every life that is built from the motive of self-love is a tower of
Babel.

The people of the Ancient Church had a wealth of knowledges
concerning spiritual
things and how they work out in the sub 
stances of the material world. When they turned from the Lord to
self, they began to use their knowledges and their worship to get
power and fame for themselves, and if the Lord had not again
interfered, they would have destroyed themselves as the people of
the Most Ancient Church had done. They would have become
monstrous forms of falsity, just as the Most Ancients became
giants of evil: "And now nothing will be restrained from them,
which they have imagined to do." So the Lord took away from
them the understanding of the spiritual meaning of material things,
so that they could no longer pervert and profane the holy things
which are within all external effects. The Word says that the Lord
"did there confound the language of all the earth." That is, when
the internal harmony which came from dependence on the Lord
was destroyed through self-conceit, all the varieties of thought and
worship, which had been like the harmonious colors of the rain 
bow, became sources of discord and division. So the people of the
Ancient Church were divided and scattered, each group following
its own form of worship from tradition instead of from any under 
standing of its spiritual significance.

This, we are told, was the origin of all the forms of idolatry in
which the nations were found at the dawn of recorded history.
Nature worship, ancestor worship, idol worship-instead of being
the beginnings of religion as a prevailing modern theory holds-are
the degenerate remains of the beautiful correspondential worship
of the people of the Silver Age, the Ancient Church. Mythology is
a corrupt survival of true correspondential accounts of the early
peoples. Hieroglyphic writing has its basis in correspondence. The
accounts of the flood found in the traditions of certain nations are
corruptions of the original account in the Ancient Word which
Moses copied from that Word for us. A very clear illustration of
the building of a Tower of Babel is the "natural history" concept
of the development of religion, which is made up by men from
their knowledge of existing historical remains without any belief
in Divine revelation or in spiritual causes. A knowledge of the
spiritual meaning of the story of the Tower of Babel with refer 
ence to the Ancient Church should protect the minds of New
Churchmen from infection by this "natural history" concept and
its conclusions. Modern scholarship is so bound up with this con 
cept that in examining its findings it is almost impossible to sep-

THE TOWER OF BABEL

arate fact from imagination. When one starts with the premise that
the Bible is merely the product of men, one's conclusions are un 
sound, no matter how painstaking and conscientious the research.
It makes a vital difference whether we approach the Bible as God's
Word to men or as man's "ascending search for God." The latter
study builds a Tower of Babel. The former builds a church.

From the Writings of Swedenborg

Arcana Coelestia, n. 1304: "The church is of such a nature thit when charity
toward the neighbor departs, and the love of self succeeds in its place, the
doctrine of faith is of no account except in so far as it can be turned into the
worship of self; and nothing whatever is accounted holy in worship unless it
is for the sake of self, and thus unless it is self-worship. All love of self is
attended with this; for he who loves himself more than others, not only hates
all who are not subservient to him, and shows them no favor except when
they have become subservient, but also, in so far as he is not under restraint,
he rushes on even until he exalts himself above God. That this is the nature
of the love of self when the reins are given to it, has been shown me to the
life. This is what is signified by 'a city and a tower.' The love of self and every
derivative cupidity is of all things the most ftlthy and the most profane, and is
the veriest infernalism; and from this anyone may conclude what the quality
of that worship must be which contains within it an infernalism sO absolute."

== THE CALL OF ABRAM
Genesis 11: 2 7-32; 12: 1-1 0

Noah's descendants,
like the descendants of Adam and Eve,
turned away from the Lord and wanted to go their own way, until
finally they became so selfish that they could not live peaceably
together and had to be scattered over the face of the earth. There
is a good moral lesson for small children here because they know
that when even one child in a group is selfish,
there is always
quarreling and trouble.

Doctrinal Points
/11 the Bible the first eleven chapters were taken from the Ancient
H'ord and are not literal history. Literal history begins with
chapter 12.

Notes for Parents

With the story of Abram we enter historic times. Abram and his
family were real people who actually did the things recorded in
the Bible. But the Lord chose them and so directed their lives that
the record, just like the great symbol stories in the first few chap 
ters, could contain within it deep spiritual lessons for all men in
all tiples.

The second great church, pictured by Noah and his descendants,
declined just as the first had through the increasing selfishness and
pride of its members. The Old Testament story is a long series of
beginnings, declines, and new beginnings. Isn't this true also of the
history of the world and of the lives of individuals? Whenever a
nation becomes so corrupt that there is no longer anything in it
to which the Lord can appeal, the Lord steps in and draws out of
it whatever individuals He can find who are still willing to obey
Him, and forms of them a new beginning. And when an individual
becomes corrupt and forsakes all that he has been taught of the right way of life, he is lost unless the Lord can find within him
something to which He can appeal as the basis for a new upward
trend.

Abram and his family were called to leave their native place and
go to the land of Canaan. Life is a journey, and all who wish to
obey the Lord are called to make this journey of Abram. We all
recognize the land of Canaan-the Holy Land-as a symbol of
heaven or a heavenly character. The land of our nativity is our
selfish natural state. The journey is long, but the Lord promises us
as He promised Abram that if we will take the way He points out
to us, He will be with us and bless us and protect us and bring us
at last into possession of our heavenly home.

Everyone-even among those who mean to obey the Lord-docs
not go all the way. Abram's old father and his brother Nahor and
his family stopped at Haran, a place to the northeast of Canaan.
They prospered there and kept their contact with Abram and his
descendants. In fact, Abram's son Isaac and grandson Jacob mar 
ried wives from Haran. All people who believe in God and try to
be good are the Lord's "sheep," cared for by Him; but all do not
attain the same spiritual stature.

We should not be satisfied with doing less than our best in the
Lord's service. We should want to go all the way, as Abram did.
And this will bring us to a state of wanting to know more and
the Lord and what He wants us to do-as Abram
more about
experienced a famine and went down to Egypt,
the great store 
house of the ancient world, and brought back to the Holy Land
the riches he acquired there. The happiness which the Lord can
give us is necessarily measured by the degree to which we arc will 
ing to apply ourselves to learning the truth which He has revealed
to us in His Word and the effort we make to live according to it.

Primary

This is the children's introduction to Abraham (who was first called Abramj,
someone they will hear a great deal about. Be sure they learn his name. It is
also their introduction to the Holy Land. They will also be interested in hear 
ing about Abram's long journey and about the members of the family who
started with him and those who did not go all the way. The group should
remember Abraham, Sarah, and Lot, and should be told about the place called
Haran or the city of Nahor. They should also learn the names of the two
places in the Holy Land where Abram first stopped: Shechem and Bethel.
Tell them about the building of the altars and what an altar stands for, and
call their attention to the altar in the church and to the fact that a copy of
the Word is kept on it. Impress upon them Abraham's obedience to the Lord
and his gratitude to the Lord, as expressed in the building of the altars.

When the early people became so wicked that they had to be destroyed,
who was saved?
How was he saved from the flood?
What can you tell about the ark?
Who were saved with Noah?
What else was saved in the ark?

After the flood was over, Noah and his family and all the ani 

mals came out of the ark to begin a new life on earth.

The first thing Noah did was to build an altar and worship the
Lord. An altar is a sign of worship. In Noah's time most of the
altars were built of large stones piled one on top of another. We
too, but most of them are made of
have altars in our churches,
wood. Your Sunday School teacher will show you the one in your
church. We always keep the Bible on our altars. That is because the
Bible is the Word of God in which the Lord speaks to us and tells
us what to do.

The Lord promised Noah that He would never again destroy
mankind, and Noah promised always to obey the Lord. A two-way
promise of this kind is called a "covanant." And the Lord gave
Noah a beautiful sign of this covenant. Do you know what this
sign was? It was the rainbow.

But Noah's descendants did not always keep the promise Noah
had made to the Lord. They began to think that they could be
wise without worshiping the Lord, and finally they became so
conceited and selfish that they could not even get along with each
other.
Do you remember the story of the Tower of Babel?
This time, instead of destroying the people, the Lord scattered them over the
face of the earth.
But again He found one family who were still willing to obey Him.
This family lived in Dr in the country of Chaldea, far to the east of Canaan.
The father of this family was Terah, and he had three sons, Abram, Nahor,
and Haran.
The Lord told them to leave their home and go to the land of Canaan.
It was a long, hard journey, and they did not all go all the way.
They stopped at a place northwest of Canaan and Nahor decided to stay
there. He named the place for his brother Haran, who had died before they
left Dr, but it is also the city of Nahor. The old father Terah died there.
Who went on to the land of Canaan? Lot was Haran's son.
What did the Lord promise Abram?
Where did they stop fIrst in the land of Canaan?
What was their second stop?
What did Abram build in each place?
Why did they go down into Egypt?

Junior

The details of the story, with names and places, should be mastered. The
Juniors will be interested in knowing that an h, one of the letters from the
name Jehovah, was later put into Abram's name to indicate his closer relation
to the Lord after he settled in the Holy Land. On account of later lessons
special emphasis should be put on the settling of Nahor and his family in
Haran, also called the city of Nahor. Be sure to have the children locate all
the places on the map, and point out the great desert which caused them to
go so far north instead of straight across. The meaning of the Holy Land, of
Abram's call to go there, of the altars, and of going down into Egypt may also
be touched on.

What finally happened to most of the people of the Most Ancient Church?
Who were saved?
How were they saved?
What did Noah take into the ark besides his family?
How long did the rain last?

After the flood the descendants of Noah repeopled the earth.
At first they were good, but after a while they began again to want
their own way and to think that their own ideas were better than
the truth they received from the Lord. The story of the Tower of

THE CALL OF ABRAM

Babel (Genesis 11:1-9) is a picture of how they tried to set them 
selves up, and had to be scattered to prevent them from destroying
each other.

The rest of the eleventh chapter of Genesis is a genealogy. This
means that it is a list of the sons and grandsons and great grand 
sons and so on of someone. In this case the someone is Shem.

Who was Shem?
Who were his brothers?

that

The men in these old lists seem to live much longer than men do
now, but
is because the names are not the names of real
people but of whole groups of people, just as we might perhaps
call the United States Uncle Sam and say, "Uncle Sam has lived
over two hundred years." The first real person mentioned in the
Bible was Eber, better written Heber, from whom the Jews were
called Hebrews.

Our lesson today starts with a man named Terah.

Where did he live?
How many sons did he have?

We need to learn their names because we shall hear of all of them
agam.

Which one of the sons died in Dr?
What son did he leave?
What did the Lord tell Terah to do?

Trace on a map the route of the journey of the family from Ur.
It was a long, slow journey. They did not have automobiles and
airplanes in those days. They traveled on foot or on donkeys, and
they took all
their cattle and sheep with them. The cattle and
sheep had to stop to graze every day. At night the people put up
tents for themselves, and set a watch over the flocks and herds.

Where did Terah stop?

We learn afterward that Nahor and his family stopped there and
decided to go no further. They named the city Haran after the
brother who had died before they left Ur, but it is also often called
the city ofNahor. Try to remember this city because we shall have other stories in which it is important.

Why did Abram go further?
What did the Lord promise him?
Who went with him?
Into what land did they come?
The land of Canaan is also called the Holy Land; later it was called Palestine
and today it is called Israel.
Where in the Holy Land did Abram first stop?
Where did he stop next?

We must remember the names of these places because we shall
have stories about them later.

What did Abram build both times he stopped?
Why could not Abram settle in the Holy Land when he first got there?
What is a famine?
Where did Abram go because of the famine?

We usually call Abram A braham. The Lord Himself later changed
the name by putting in the h, which is one of the letters in Jeho 
vah, the Lord's own name. And He changed Sarai's name to Sarah.
This means that after they returned from Egypt and made their
permanent home in the Holy Land,
they came into a closer re 
lation with the Lord than they had had before.

Intermediate

Set the young people's minds working on the correspondence of a journey
to life. After you have pointed it out and illustrated it a little, they will be
interested in thinking of other words and phrases in common use which are
based on this correspondence, such as progressive and backward nations, the
road to success, following in the steps of someone, taking the wrong road to
happiness, standing still, the highroad to fortune, and the march of time. If
they begin to think in these terms now, it will help their "feeling" for the
correspondence of the whole Bible story.

the
Noah and his descendants picture a second great church,
Ancient Church, which the Lord had established on the earth. The
Ancient Word-the Bible before our Bible-was written during the
time of this church, and the delight of the people was the study of
correspondences. But after a while man began again to turn from

THE CALL OF ABRAM

the Lord to self. People forgot the symbolic meaning of the images
they had set up in connection with their worship, and they became
idolaters. The breaking up of this second church is described in
the story of the Tower of Babel in Genesis 11:1-9.

After the story of the Tower of Babel, chapter 11 tells us the
names of the descendants of Shem, the first son of Noah. These
people came to be called the Semites, and they lived in what is
now called Asia Minor. The names in chapter 11: 10-13, like all the
names in the earlier Bible story, are not the names of individuals
but of whole generations. In verse 14, however, we 'come to the
period of recorded history. Swedenborg tells us that the first real
person mentioned in the Bible story is Eber. His name would be
more correctly written Heber, and it is from him that the Jews
were called Hebrews.

So the people in our story for today are real people. But the
story has an inner meaning just the same, and it also deals with the
formation of a third church, the Jewish Church.

Look at a map and find Dr of the Chaldees. You see that the
great desert of Arabia lies between Dr and the land of Canaan.
So when the Lord told Abram to leave Vr and go to the land of
Canaan, he had to travel a long way around the desert. Follow his
route north along the river-the Euphrates-and find Haran. Haran
was named for Lot's father, who had died before the family left
Vr. Haran also came to be called the city of Nahor, because Nahor,
Abram's other brother, settled there with his family instead of
going all the way to the Holy Land. We shall hear of Haran very
soon again. Terah, Abram's father, died in Haran, and only Abram
and his nephew Lot and their families and servants went on.

In addition to the place called Haran we should try to remem 
ber the two places in the Holy Land where Abram frrst stopped
and built altars-Shechem (Sichem) and Bethel. All the names of
people and places in the Bible story are very important because of
their spiritual meaning. Still another appears at the close of our
lesson-Egypt. Egypt, where the Nile River kept the land always
fertile, was the storehouse of the ancient world, to which people of other lands knew they could go for food in times of famine.
We shall learn its meaning presently. Again and again in the Bible
it is said that people went down into Egypt.

The story of the call of Abram in its inner meaning tells us of
a call that comes to everyone of us from the Lord: the call to leave
selfish ways which "come natural" to us, and to travel toward the
heavenly state of life which the Lord wants us to attain. The land
of Canaan, the Holy Land, is the Bible picture of this heavenly
state. It is in relation to this heavenward journey that every person
and place has its spiritual meaning. Egypt pictures the great store 
house of facts which we need to know. You can easily guess what
the famine pictures, but look up Amos 8: 11. Again and again in
our lives we come to situations in which we feci the lack of suf 
ficient knowledge. Then we have to go down into Egypt. This is
true of our spiritual progress also. We need often to "read and
meditate upon the Word of God"-one of Swedenborg's RilLes of
Life-to increase our knowledge of what the Lord wants us to be
and to do. This is a spiritual going down into Egypt. Coming back
to the Holy Land is putting our new knowledge to use in the
Lord's service.

Basic Correspondences

Senior

The two points to be most carefully developed for the Seniors are the call to
turn our backs on our natural selfish desires and thoughts, and our recurring
need of new knowledge from the Word as we go through life, which is pic 
tured in the Bible story by the frequent going down into Egypt. This ties in
with our earlier lesson on the nature of the spiritual church. The young people
know that in order to progress in any worldly occupation they need con-

THE CALL OF ABRAM

stantly to learn new things about it. They should be able to recognize that
this must be equally true of spiritual progress.

The story of Noah is the story of the rise and decline of a second
great church-the Ancient Church-and its final dispersion is de 
scribed in the story of the Tower of Babel. Then we have a long
genealogy. You will understand that this tells of the passing of
many generations and covers probably many centuries. But now
we are coming down in the Bible story to historic times. Sweden 
borg tells us that the first real person whose name appears in the
Bible is Eber (Genesis 11:14), or Heber, as it should be written,
from whom the Jews were called Hebrews. So the story of the
third church,
the Jewish Church, is for the mo'st part true in the
letter as well as having an inner meaning. Although the inner
meaning is the truth which the Lord wishes us to learn, we must
first fix in our minds the literal story, for it is only through the
letter that the inner meaning can be reached. The names and inci 
dents in these early chapters are mentioned again and again as we
proceed in our reading.

The people of the earth had now gone far from the Lord, and
the Jewish Church, instead of being either spiritual or celestial, was
to be wholly natural, a mere representative of a church, for there
can be no true church without a spiritual interior. Yet the Lord
could still be present in the world through the correspondence of
the rituals which the Jews were commanded to observe (Hebrews
8:5).

Again a remnant of the old church was called to begin the new.
Abram and his family were this remnant. Abram was called to
leave his home and go to the Holy Land, which was promised him
for himself and his descendants as a possession forever. Naturally
the Jews take this promise literally and so do many Christians.
The history of this land since the Second World War has been
deeply influenced by this belief. But it is the spiritual descendants
of Abram-those who obey the Lord, as Abram did-to whom the
promise is really made, and the land promised is not the earthly
Canaan but what it represents-a heavenly state of lasting peace
and happiness. Abram obeyed the Lord's call, and his obedience
began a new history.

There is a beautiful
lesson for us as individuals in the inner
meaning of this story. Each one of us is called by the Lord to
leave our own country-our natural selfish state-and journey to
the Holy Land of heavenly living. I t is a long, slow journey, with
many stops on the way. Everyone who begins this journey does
not attain the same state. Abram's father Terah died in Haran
before they actually reached the Holy Land, and Abram's brother
Nahor and his family settled in Haran. Haran represents a state of
natural goodness, a state in which many people stop, people who
want
to obey the Lord and to be good, but are content with
obedience of an external type and are not interested in learning
lessons the Lord has to
and understanding the deeper spiritual
gIve us.

Abram and Lot and their families went on and reached Canaan,
journeying steadily southward. As the east represents a state near
to the Lord in heart, so the south pictures a state of spiritual
intelligence, a progression into clearer light. Wherever he stopped
Abram built an altar to the Lord. So we ought to do. We should
recognize the Lord's providence in every attainment of our lives
and thank him at each step for bringing us to another stage of our
Journey.

But before Abram could settle in the land permanently, a famine
came upon him. The famine pictures a 'sense of need for more
knowledge, which always comes periodically if we are really mak 
ing progress (Amos 8: 11). When we reach a point at which we
the Lord and what he wants of
think we know enough about
us, we may be very sure we have stopped advancing spiritually.
Throughout the Word Egypt pictures the store of natural knowl 
edges~in its best sense knowledge of the letter of the Word. Abram
went down into Egypt. Later Jacob, Joseph, and finally the Lord
Himself went down into Egypt. All our learning periods are so 
journs in Egypt.

Abram, as founder of the Jewish Church, pictures our first child-

THE CALL OF ABRAM

like response to the Lord's call to lead a good life. We are to leave
our country (the low state of spiritual life into which we are born),
our kindred (our general selfish affections and thoughts), and our
father's house (our own particular inherrted weaknesses and evils),
and go to the land which the Lord will show us-a heavenly state
of life which will open to us gradually if we accept the Lord's
guidance (Matthew 19: 29). When we see that the purpose of life
is to do the Lord's will and not our own, we are hearing the Lord's
call, and our obedience to this call is the beginning of our heaven 
ward journey.

Adult

The change to the period of actual history should be pointed out and ex 
plained. Cover the general points of the lesson briefly and then ask for ques 
tions .and develop further the indicated subjects.

Up to this point our lessons have been on the portion of the
Word Swedenborg says was copied by Moses from the Ancient
in the
Word, and we have not been dealing with historical fact
letter.* A rcalla Coelestia nn. 1140 and 1343 state that the first
person mentioned in the Word who is a historical personage as well
as a representative figure is Eber (Genesis 11: 14), from whom the
Hebrews took their name. AC 1343 says that Eber constituted a
Second Ancient Church, which came to an end in idolatrous wor 
the father of Abram, and that Abram signifies a
ship in Terah,
Third Ancient Church (AC 1360), from or in which the Lord insti 
tuted the Jewish Church. The Second Ancient Church, like the
First, recognized spiritual things and knew that its forms of wor 
ship had their value from their correspondence. It was in this
church that sacrifices were instituted. But as the people degener 
the knowledge of the spiritual meaning of the various acts
ated,
and symbols of worship was lost until they regarded their images
and sacrifices as holy in themselves, and became idolaters, knowing

==== FOOTNOTE: See AC 1401, but also see SS 103.

nothing of love for the Lord and the neighbor or of heaven and
eternal life. So the Lord and the angels could no longer be present
with men in their interiors-their hearts and minds-because they
no longer had any internal thought, and because all real worship is
internal, there could no longer be a real church on earth. Still the
Lord had to keep His contact with men in order to keep them
alive and to save those whose intentions were good. So He insti 
tuted the Jewish Church, which was not a real church at all but
merely the representative of a church. One of the Epistles says of
the Jewish priests who "offer gifts according to the law" that they
"serve unto the example and shadow of heavenly things" (Hebrews
8:5). The Hebrew nation was chosen by the Lord for this purpose
not because they were a particularly religious people, as is com 
monly thought, but because they were a wholly external people,
and could be led through fear of punishment and hope of reward,
interfering with their freedom, to carryon worship of
without
Jehovah according to the particular forms which would correspon 
dentially represent true worship, and so by the correspondence of
these forms could keep the connection between heaven and earth.
Their history could be so providentially directed by the Lord that,
recorded in words, it would correspondentially express heavenly
things and the divine life itself.

It is the history of this church which we are beginning now.
Abram was a man who lived on the earth and did things of which
we read in the letter of the Word; but if he had been no more than
that, the story of his life would be of no more value to us than the
history of any other .man. He is also a representative figure-rep 
resentative of the Lord and of the celestial man":-and everything
that is recorded of him in the Word has a meaning with reference
to the Lord's life and to our own lives. And we should remember
that it is what the Lord chose to have recorded in the Word which
has this meaning. The findings of archaeology with regard to con 
ditions in Abram's time may be interesting to us as natural learn

We have learned that the stories of the Garden of Eden treated

THE CALL OF ABRAM

of the rise and decline of the church in a celestial type of person,
and that the stories of Noah treat of the rise and decline of the
church in the spiritual type of person. Now we come to the devel 
opment of a church among natural men. We are born natural men
takes a long time for us to develop on this
and women, and it
natural plane; so the story is given us in detail, and every detail
has a deep importance for us individually. The dealings of the Lord
their history as it is recorded in the
with the Jews throughout
Scriptures picture His dealings with us in our progress through life.
This is what makes the Bible the Book of Life for us.

Abram was called to make a journey. The symbol of a journey
as the correspondent of progress through life is so woven into our
common thought and speech that everyone should be able to rec 
ognize it. Indeed the journey of the children of Israel through the
wilderness has always been recognized as a picture of the progress
of the soul. Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress is a classic example of the
use of this symbol. The very word progress embodies the same
symbolism. We cannot talk at all without employing correspon 
dences. In life we pass from state to state, from low to high or
from high to low. Sometimes we go backward; sometimes we stand
still. We reach lofty states of vision,
like mountain tops, from
which we can look back upon the whole of our life and see it in its
true proportions, and forward to the new states we are approach 
ing. We recognize this symbolism as a fact. But with Swedenborg's
help-or rather, with the help of the Lord by means of Sweden 
borg-we are enabled to go further: we can understand the mean 
ing of each detail in this Bible journey of Abram and apply it to
our own experience. Abram was called to leave Ur of the Chaldees,
the land of his birth, and go to the land of Canaan. The land of
our birth is our natural inheritance of evil and falsity; the land of
Canaan is a heavenly state. The Lord calls each one of us to turn
our backs upon our natural selfish impulses and thoughts and, in
obedience to His commands and under His guidance to travel to 
ward a state of heavenly feeling and thought-thus toward heaven
itself. We do not get there all at once. We sometimes tarry a long
time in halfway states, as Abram tarried at Haran. Some of us,
without actually going backward, stop halfway, as Nahor and his
family did. If we go on with Abram and reach our goal, we do not
remain in the first heavenly state we taste, which is pictured by
Abram's stop at Shechem in the valley, but we go on to the higher
country of Bethel. Each new heavenly state fills us with gratitude
to the Lord, which is pictured by Abram's building altars wherever
he stopped.

Then we come inevitably to a time when we feel a hunger for
more truth. There was a famine in the land. "Behold, the days
come, saith the Lord God, that I will send a famine in the land,
not a famine of bread, nor a thirst for water, but of hearing the
words of the Lord" (Amos 8: 11). And we know that: "Blessed are
they that do hunger and thirst after righteousness; for they shall be
filled." Spiritual hunger and thirst are meant by famine. Abram
went down into Egypt. The land of Egypt is the Bible symbol of
a state of learning on the natural plane-"the memory knowledge
of knowledges,"· as it is called in AC 1461. There was no rain from
heaven in Egypt, but its land seldom failed to yield crops because
it was made fertile by the annual overflow of the Nile and watered
from it by irrigation. In the same way, our memory knowledge
comes to us not from within but from without, and its fruit is
stored up constantly waiting to be needed. Whenever there was
a famine in the ancient world, its people knew that in Egypt they
could buy grain. So Abram went down into Egypt; later Joseph
went down, and was followed by all the children of Israel; and
finally the Lord Himself as a babe was taken into Egypt. We should
have no difficulty in seeing what these journeys into Egypt mean
in our spiritual
life. They mean procuring knowledge from the
letter of the Word where the Lord has stored it up for us. Whenever
there is a famine in our spiritual life, what we need is to go to the
Word and read it and learn new truths from its letter, into which
the spirit of the Lord may flow, enlightening us and giving us new
spiritual power. But we are never to stay permanently in this mere
learning state. We are to take our new riches back to the Holy

THE CALL OF ABRAM

Land as Abram did and use them in the Lord's service in our daily
life.

From the Writings of Swedenborg
Arcana Coelestia, n. 1461: "And Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn.
That this signifies instruction in knowledges from the Word, is evident from
the signification of 'Egypt,' and from the signification of 'sojourning.' That
'Egypt' signifies the memory-knowledge of knowledges, and that 'to sojourn'
signifies to be instructed, will be seen presently.... The external man is cor 
poreal and sensuous; nor does it receive anything celestial and spiritual unless
knowledges are implanted in it, as in ground; for in these celestial things
can have their recipient vessels. But the knowledges must be from the Word.
Knowledges from the Word are such that they are open from the Lord Him 
self; for the Word itself is from the Lord through heaven, and the Lord's life
is in all things of the Word, both in general and in particular, although it does
not so appear in the external form."

== ABRAM AND LOT
Genesis 13: 1-13; 14: 1-16

In addition to the chapters assigned,

the teacher should read
Genesis 11, 12, 18, and 19, which cover the story of Lot. Familiarity with a map of the journey, and with the location of the cities
mentioned in the Holy Land is also important. Archaeologists are
uncertain as to the exact
location of the cities of Sodom and
Gomorrah, but it is beginning,to seem probable that they may be
found in an area now covered by part of the Dead Sea, which was
in Bible times part of the plain of Jordan.

=== Doctrinal Points
When we are tempted, the Lord always manages to warn US in some way.

From chapter 12 of Genesis on, the Word is in general true history

as well as parable.

We should examine our thoughts to see if they are based on

heavenly or on worldly principles.

A life of willing obedience to the Lord leads toward heaven.

=== Notes for Parents

Abram, or Abraham as he was later renamed by the Lord, was
a man chosen by the Lord as the founder of the Jewish Church.
The church raised up among the few good people who remained
after the Most Ancient Church perished (those described by the
story of Noah) was called the Ancient Church. As you read in
chapters 10 and 11 of Genesis, it continued for many generations,
but eventually it also became corrupt. Its people were not de 
stroyed like those of the earlier church, but they became hostile to
each other and were scattered all over the earth. This is described
in the symbolic story of the Tower of Babel. It was among these
people that idolatry arose. Recorded history begins in this period

ABRAM AND LOT

and finds men selfish and warlike and worshipers of idols. But even
among these people there were some individuals who were better
than others. They, too, were idolaters and had lost all knowledge
of true worship, but they believed in a God and wished to obey
Him rather than to follow their own desires. Such a man was
Abram.

Abram was called by the Lord to leave his home in Dr of Chal 
dea and go to the land of Canaan, which is called the Holy Land.
He obeyed, taking with him his immediate family, which included
his orphaned nephew Lot. Some of them stopped' halfway-as
some of us stop halfway in our progress from natural selfish living
to a state of heavenly living-but Lot went on with Abram. Read
the story in chapter 12. The lesson begins as they were about to
settle in permanent homes in the Holy Land. We see that, although
Abram and Lot did not quarrel,
their herdmen did, and Abram
gave Lot his choice of the part of the country in which he wished
to settle. Lot's choice of the low valley of the Jordan, because it
looked pleasant and easy to live in, led him into many difficulties.
Read with your children this week chapters 15 through 21 and see
how Abram prospered while Lot failed even though Abram and
later the Lord did their best to save him.

We all have choices to make every day, and we are often tempted
to make Lot's choice of the way which looks easiest and most
pleasant, without stopping to think of the temptations and dangers
which the easy path so often brings with it. Yet we all admire
people who are willing to do the hard things. And we know what
we mean when we say of a person that he is "going downhill."
Children should be taught that the easy way is not necessarily the
right way, and that strength is gained-in mental and spiritual
things as well as in physical ones-by measuring up to difficult
tasks as they come to us.

Primary

The whole story of Lot can be t&ld very simply, with emphasis on Abram's
kindness to him, on the Lord's blessing of Abram because of his obedience,
and on the Lord's merciful provision for the rescue and protection of Lot,
even after he made a foolish choice. Be sure the children learn the names of
Abram and Lot and the fact that the "children of Israel" about whom they
will hear so much were descendants of Abram, and that the descendants of
Lot were the Moabites and the Ammonites who became enemies of Israel.
Explain also that Abram's name was later changed to Abraham, and that he
is usually referred to as Abraham.

How was Noah saved from the flood?
When the rain was over, what two birds did he send out to see if the ground
was dry?
How many times did he send out the dove?
What was the first thing Noah did when he came out of the ark?
A whole race of people was built up from the descendants of Noah.
For a time they lived well, but after a while they again forgot the Lord and
began to go their own selfish ways.
But the Lord had promised not to destroy mankind again; so this time He
scattered them over the face of the earth.
The story of this is told in the first nine verses of chapter 11 of Genesis.
It is called the story of the Tower of Babel.
But again the Lord found a man who would obey Him.

The man's name was Abram. At first he lived in a city called Ur,
but the Lord told him to take his family and everything he had
and travel to the land of Canaan, because this was to be his home
and the home of his children and grandchildren and great-grand 
children.

Canaan was a long way from Ur, but Abram obeyed the Lord.
He took his wife with him. Her name was Sarai. And he also took
his hephew Lot, whose father was dead. Abram's brother Nahor
and his family and old Terah, the father of Abram and Nahor,
went, too, but they did not go all the way. They stopped at a place
which they called Haran after Lot's father.

When Abram and Sarai and Lot reached the land of Canaan, one
of the first places they stopped was Bethel. You will often hear of
Bethel in our lessons. Do you remember what was the very first
thing Noah did when he came out of the ark after the flood? He
built an altar and worshiped the Lord. Abram did the very same
thing at Bethel, because he was so grateful to the Lord for bringing

ABRAM AND LOT

them safely into the promised land.

Then Abram went farther south in the land of Canaan and then,
because there was a famine in the land, they had to go down into
Egypt for a while. A famine is a time when food is so scarce that
people cannot get enough to eat. While Abram lived in Egypt, the
Lord helped him and he became very rich "in cattle, in silver, and
in gold."

When they came back to the land of Canaan, where did they go first?
There Abram worshiped the Lord again.
What trouble did Abram and Lot have?
How did Abram settle the difficulty?

Lot went

to live near Sodom and very soon began to have
troubles. Once Abram had to go down and save him when the
people of Sodom were carried away by their enemies, and later
the Lord had to send two angels to save Lot when Sodom was
destroyed because of its wickedness. When we have a choice to
make, we should be more careful, shouldn't we?

Junior

Have the class study a map and look up all the Bible references in the notes.
Emphasize the fact
that this is the beginning of true history in the Bible as
well as the beginning of a third church. The important lesson is, of course,
the foolishness of choosing the thing which looks easy and pleasant without
stopping to think whether Or not it is the right thing. Stress the importance
of avoiding bad companions.

How did the people of the Most Ancient Church destroy themselves?
Why was it that Noah could be saved?
What was the first thing Noah did when he came out of the ark?
What did the Lord promise?
What does Swedenborg call the church which then grew up?

The people of the Ancient Church,

like those of the Most
Ancient Church, lived at peace with each other for a long time
and were very happy and very wise, especially in spiritual knowl 
edge. But as time went on, they began to be proud of their wisdom
and to think that they were wise of themselves and did not need to
learn of the Lord. Then they began to have differences of opinion,
and each one thought everyone else ought to agree with him be 
cause he believed himself to be wise. Finally they could no longer
live together in peace and were scattered all over the earth. Read
Genesis 11:1-9. This is the familiar story of the Tower of Babel,
but with what you have learned you can understand that it is a
picture of the condition of the people in the end of the Ancient
Church. The tower they were trying to build was begun in the
valley-way down on the level of their own minds-and they im 
agined they could reach up to heaven in that way. All sorts of
strange ideas and beliefs grew up, and men began to worship idols
which they themselves made. Our history books go back to this
time, because it was at this time that men began to try to preserve
records of their own greatness, and history depends on these rec 
ords for its knowledge. So our history books do not tell about the
Golden and Silver Ages.

With chapter twelve of the Bible we begin to study about indi 
viduals who really lived and did the things the stories tell about.
We have seen that Adam and Noah were names which described
whole generations of people. But Abram and Lot were individuals.
Look at a map and find Ur of Chaldea, where they lived. They
were idolaters like all the people around them, but they were men
who meant to be good and to do what God wanted them to do,
and not just to have their own way. So the Lord could use them
to begin another church on earth, which was to become the Jewish
Church. Abram, or Abraham as he was later named by the Lord,
was chosen because he was always willing to obey the Lord, even
though he had many false ideas about God in his mind just as his
father and ancestors in Chaldea had.

Abram was told by the Lord to leave Dr and travel to the land
of Canaan, and the Lord promised to make of him there "a great
nation," and to bless him. Abram obeyed, even though the journey
was a long one and the new land was unknown to him. He took
with him his wife Sarai, his father Terah, his brother Nahor, and
his nephew Lot (whose lather Haran had died). Look at your map

ABRAM AND LOT

and see how they had to go way up to the north to avoid traveling
across the desert. Find the place called Haran. This place was
named for Lot's father, and it was also called the "city of Nahor"
because Nahor and his family decided to settle there and not go
on to the land of Canaan. Terah also stayed there and died be 
fore Abram went on. But Lot continued with Abram. When they
reached Canaan, which we know as the "Holy Land," they stopped
first at Shechem and then at Bethel, and at each of these places
Abram built an altar and worshiped the Lord. Then they went
toward the south and, because there was a famine in the land, they
went down into Egypt and stayed there for some time. And the
Lord blessed both of them and made them rich.

But now that they were about to settle in the land which had
been promised to Abram, they found that they would not be able
to live together. Our story tells us that their herdmen quarreled
about where their herds ;md flocks should graze. We all know that
quarreling is wrong, and yet we are tempted to quarrel even some 
times with friends. It is selfishness which causes quarrels. Abram
refused to quarrel with Lot.

What did he propose?

By being generous he proved himself the better man, and the Lord
did not let him lose by his kindness. Find Bethel on your map. It
is on very high ground and from it you can see a long distance in
both directions. It was a good place to make the choice of land.

What part of the land did Lot choose?

He chose it because it looked like good pasture for his flocks. He
did not stop to think or to look ahead. We often choose the things
that look best on the outside, without stopping to think.

What is mentioned in our reading from chapter 13 which suggests a possible
danger in Lot's choice?
In chapter 14 we learn that this was a very real danger.
How was Lot taken captive?
Who saved him and brought him back?

When we choose to live with bad companions, we are very likely
to get into trouble just as Lot did. At first our friends step in and
save us from the consequences of our foolishness. But each time
we make the wrong choice, it
is harder for us to be saved. Lot
went on living in the low plain, and after a while he came to live in
the very gate of Sodom. If you will read chapter 19, you will find
that Sodom and Gomorrah had become so wicked that they were
to be destroyed, and the Lord sent
two angels to warn Lot and
lead him out of Sodom. Even then he was not willing to go up
into the mountains, as the angels advised him to do. You see that
after Lot separated himself from Abram, he became weaker and
weaker in character. Every time we choose to do what we know is
not just what we ought
to do, we grow a little weaker. Lot's
descendants, the Moabites and Ammonites, were enemies of the
Jews all through their history.

Can you see something of what this story means in its inner,
spiritual sense? It means that when we choose to turn away from
what we know the Lord wants us to do-the mountains always
picture states near to the Lord-and choose to live for what we can
get for ourselves-the low plain-just because that looks easiest and
most pleasant, we are headed for trouble. And it means that we
should be careful to keep good company and not imagine we are
strong enough to go with bad companions without doing as they
do. The story of Lot is written in the Bible by the Lord to serve as
a warning to us.

Can you think of a sentence in the Lord's Prayer which we ought to say to
ourselves when we are inclined to do as Lot did?

Intermediate
Trace in general outline the correspondence of the story of Abram's journey
through his return from Egypt. Then take up the correspondence of Abram
and Lot with reference to our individual lives, and follow through with Lot's
choice and its consequences.

Just as selfishness crept into the Most Ancient Church and grad 
ually destroyed it, so pride in their own intelligence and knowl 
edge crept into the Ancient Church. Gradually people forgot what

ABRAM AND LOT

the correspondences they had learned really meant; they came to
worship as idols the images of animals and birds and fish which
originally they had made to remind them of spiritual things. In this
way many conflicting beliefs arose, and people quarreled and be 
came enemies, and had to move away from each other. Recorded
history begins with this state of the world, and therefore people
imagine that men, to start with, were idol-worshipers and savages.
The story of the Tower of Babel (Genesis 11: 1-9) pictures this
final breaking up of the Ancient Church.

But the Lord had promised that people would never again be
allowed to separate themselves completely from Him and so de 
stroy themselves. As before, He was able to find a few people
whose intentions remained good, even though they were also idol 
worshipers. Abram and his family were such people.

From chapter 12 of Genesis on, the Bible story is in general 
and in most of its particulars-true history as well as inspired par 
able with a spiritual meaning within the letter. Abram was a man
who was willing to obey the Lord in all things, and he was chosen
to be the father of the next church, the Jewish Church. This was
not a celestial church like the Most Ancient, or a spiritual church
like the Ancient, but a church on the natural plane of life only.
Obedience to the letter of the law was its requirement. When we
have passed out of our babyhood-but are still very little children 
all we know about right and wrong is that we must obey our
parents. Abram pictures this stage in our life. This-obedience-is
the beginning of the development of a heavenly character. If we
do not learn to obey, we cannot be heavenly people. But there
must be continual progress. Abram was called to leave his home,
Dr of Chaldea, and go to the land of Canaan, which came to be
called the "Holy Land," and which represents heaven or a heavenly
character. So we are called by the Lord to leave our natural selfish
inclinations and fit ourselves to live in heaven.

Abram's journey is described in Genesis 12: 1-10. He stopped
for a time at Haran, and his brother Nahor stayed there. Then
Abram went on into the Holy Land, and stopped first at Shechem
and then at Bethel, building an altar in each place. Then because
of a famine, he went to Egypt where he became very rich. All
through the Bible the land of Egypt pictures the part of our minds
in which we store up facts-Sweden borg calls them "memory 
knowledges." At every step of our progress, material as well as
spiritual, we find that we need more knowledge before we can go
on. The gaining of this knowledge is pictured by going down into
Egypt; and we shall find that many people in the Bible went down
into Egypt at some point in their lives. Coming back to the Holy
Land is trying to use our new knowledge in the service of the Lord.
Our story for today teaches us a very important lesson. Lot was
Abram's own nephew. He had spent all his early life traveling to
the Holy Land under Abram's protection, and had gone down into
Egypt with him and had come back rich. Yet Lot's descendants,
the Moabites and the Ammonites, were to become bitter enemies
the Israelites. The first germ of this en 
of Abram's descendants,
mity developed in the story we are studying now.

There is something in us which, like Abram, is ready to accept
whatever state of life the Lord gives us and to use all the learning
we acquire in His service. That is why Abram ca~e back from
Egypt rich not only in cattle (affections for useful deeds on the
natural plane), but also in silver and gold (truth and goodness).
But there is also in us something which,
like Lot, is not at first
bad, but which loves the easy and pleasant places of life. Lot also
had herds and flocks, but it is not said that he had silver and gold.
Lot is good and safe so long as he remains with Abram, but when
the herdmen of the two (which picture particular objectives 
spiritual with Abram and worldly with Lot) began to quarrel, a
separation had to be made. Lot chose to live in the valley of
the Jordan because it looked fertile and pleasant. The valley rep 
resents the lower plane of our lives, the plane of sense enjoyment.
The valley in itself was not evil, nor is sense enjoyment evil; but
temptations lurk there, and when we deliberately choose to spend
our lives on that plane, we find ourselves exposed to the influence
of evils of all kinds (pictured by the wicked cities of Sodom and

ABRAM AND LOT

Gomorrah).

Sodom and Gomorrah picture selfishness and the falsity that
goes with it. Selfishness and worldliness create jealousy and quar 
rels, and these often bring trouble to the innocent as well as to the
guilty. This is why we should keep away from bad companions.
Lot soon got into trouble because he chose to live too near to
Sodom. The story of this first trouble and of Abram's rescue of
Lot is told in the second part of our assignment.

But Lot did not learn his lesson. He still chose to live in the
plain, and in chapter 19 we find him living in the very gate of
Sodom. He still means to be good; so when Sodom and Gomorrah
are about to be destroyed for their wickedness, the Lord sends
two angels to warn Lot and, because Lot received them gladly and
heeded their warning, they could lead him out of Sodom in time.
the word translated angel really means
We need to know that
"messenger." Those who warn us of danger and try to keep us
from doing wrong are the Lord's angels,
too; and when we are
tempted,
the Lord always does manage to warn us through our
parents, our teachers, our friends, or our conscience, If we wel 
come this advice and heed it, we can be saved.

We should know also the meaning of the well-known story of
Lot's wife, who looked back after they were led out of Sodom and
was turned into a pillar of salt. Have we ever recognized that some 
thing we have been doing is wrong and made up our minds to stop
it, and then started thinking how pleasant it was and thus lost our
good resolutions? This is Lot's wife looking back at Sodom. Salt
in its good sense is the wish to do as truth teaches; in its bad sense
it is the acceptance of a truth without the desire to live according
to it. The pillar of salt into which Lot's wife was turned is set up
in the Bible as a warning to all of us. When we make up our minds
to do right, we must go straight forward and not let ourselves look
back longingly at the old ways. Read Luke 9: 62 and 17: 28-32.
"Remember Lot's wife" is a good verse to remember.

The choice which Abram offered Lot is presented to us over and
over again in the Bible, as it is in life. Read Deuteronomy 30:15-20
and Matthew 6: 19-21. One way lie earthly delights, the other way
heavenly treasures. Both may be enjoyed so long as Lot is led by
Abram. Abram settled in Hebron, a high place in the southern part
of the Holy Land, and built his final altar there. A life of willing
obedience to the Lord leads toward heaven.

Basic Correspondences
the land of Canaan = a heavenly state

Egypt = a state of natural learning,

or memory-knowledge

a valley = the plane of natural living

Senior
With this class it is well to emphasize the way in which the natural tendency
to worldliness grows upon us. They will fmd it prevalent in their environment
and need to recognize its dangers and to be on their guard against it. The New
Church differs from some of the other churches in its attitude toward exter 
nal pleasures. Call special attention to the passage from the writing of Sweden 
borg quoted at the end of this lesson, which states the principle involved.
Urge them to examine their recreations and pleasures to be sure that they are
such as "agree perfectly with celestial things," that is, that they do not detract
from their love to the Lord and the neighbor.

We have observed how when the Most Ancient Church became
wholly evil, the Lord separated from the others the few who still
retained a desire to serve Him, arid formed them into a new church
termed the Ancient Church, one of a different character and on
a lower level of spiritual life than its predecessor. This Ancient
Church, described in the story of Noah and his descendants, in
time also perverted the revelation given to it, ascribing their knowl 
edge of spiritual things to themselves and using it for selfish pur 
poses. In the early days of this church men had set up images of
animals and birds and other natural objects to call to their minds
the spiritual realities which they represented. As the church de 
clined,
these images came to be worshiped as idols, and many
degraded forms of worship sprang up. Because of their different
beliefs and their pride in their own intelligence, they could no

ABRAM AND LOT

longer live together in peace, and gradually their descendants were
scattered all over the face of the earth. The dispersion of the rem 
nants of this church is symbolically described in the familiar story
of the Tower of Babel (Genesis 11:1-9). It is in this condition that
recorded history finds the human race, and some historians have
assumed that man's original state was one of idolatry and mutual
hostility, not realizing that these things were the result of a long
decline. In the Bible story true history begins after the period
described by the Tower of Babel, so that from now on we are
reading about actual individuals. But this history was guided by
Divine Providence, and its record in the Word was inspired, so that
it has a continuous inner meaning just as the early chapters of
Genesis have.

The new church to be established out of the good remnant of
the Ancient Church was to be on a still lower level. We recognize
that in each of us there are three planes of life: the will, the under 
standing, and the outward conduct. The Most Ancient Church was
connected with the Lord through the will, as we have seen, and
the Ancient Church was led through the understanding. The third
the Jewish Church, was to be governed wholly by the
church,
principle of obedience in the outward conduct. Indeed, Sweden 
borg tells us that it was not a real church at all since it had no
"internal," but only the representative of a church. Yet so long
as it remained faithful to the laws and statutes laid down for its
it served to keep the connection between the Lord
observance,
and man, since these laws and statutes were correspondences of
spiritual realities.

Abram was chosen by the Lord to be the father of the Jewish
Church because he was a man who was willing to obey to the letter
whatever commands he received frpm the Lord. He was called to
leave his home in Dr of the Chaldees and his father's house, and go
to the Holy Land-Canaan-where it was promised him that he
should prosper and become a great nation.

In our own individual lives the great symbol stories of the first
eleven chapters of Genesis describe the states which are in us by
heredity. We are gifted with will and understanding, but both of
these are naturally selfish. Men do not like to believe this; they
like to imagine that they are born good and that other people are
responsible for the evils which develop in them. But we should
know better. No one has to teach a child to be selfish, to want his
own way, to strike, to rebel against order. We are born selfish and
the Lord has to teach us, through our parents and teachers first
and later through the Word, what the true way of life is, and how
to live it. At a very early age we, like Abram, are called to leave
our natural inheritance and begin the long journey to the Holy
Land of heavenly living. The whole period of Abram describes our
childhood states.

We saw in the Creation story that in each of us there is an in 
ternal and an external side to our being-the heavens and the earth.
With reference to the development of our outward lives, Abram
pictures the internal and Lot the external man. Lot was Abram's
nephew. He left Dr with Abram,
traveled with him to Canaan,
went down to Egypt with him, and returned to the Holy Land
very rich. Then the herdmen of Abram and Lot began to quarrel
over pastureland for their herds. As very little children we are not
conscious for a time of any distinction between our higher and our
lower wants. But there soon comes a day when we have to choose
between obeying our parents and having something we think we
want. There is a contest within us between the principle of doing
right and the principle of doing what pleases us at the moment.
These opposing principles are the "herdmen" of Abram and of
Lot. The Lord permits the separation of the higher and the lower
in us, but in the story of Abram and Lot He points out to us just
what the dangers are when the worldly side of us separates itself
from the direction of the higher or internal man. Lot chose the
low plain of the Jordan because it looked pleasant and fertile, just
as we often choose to live for external pleasures and success. But
in this plain were the wicked cities of Sodom and Gomorrah,
which represent selfishness in the will and the falsities in the un 
derstanding which go with this selfishness. Lot was frrst involved

ABRAM AND LOT

in the war which the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah were waging;
he was taken captive and had to be rescued by Abram. So we are
likely to become involved in the rivalries and jealousies of worldly
ambition. And later in the story (chapter 19) when the wicked
cities wcre to be destroyed, Lot was found living in the very gate
of Sodom, and was delivered only by being led out by the two
angcl visitors. Even then, his wife-his affection-looked back and
was turned into a pillar of salt as a warning to all who, having
undertaken to lead a new life, look back longingly at the delights
of the old life (Luke 17:31-33). Salt represents the fact that truth
is of no value unless it is obeyed (see Matthew 5:13). Lot refused
even thcn to go into the mountains as the angels advised him to
do. and his descendants became enemies of the Israelites, just as
the thoughts and desires which spring from our worldly choices
continue to be stumbling-blocks in the path of our spiritual prog 
ress all our lives.

Adult

You may be surprised to find that some of the class know nothing of Lot
except that Lot's wife was turned into a pillar of salt. This incident has proved
so striking and controversial that it is important to see it as one of the last
results of Lot's original choice, and so get it into its proper proportion to the
rest of the story. As to the incident itself, there is no more reason to doubt it
than to doubt any other miracle in the Scriptures. If the class is bent upon
discussing it. be sure they realize that it is logically inconsistent to accept the
Lord's miracles in the New Testament and refuse to accept the miracles in
the Old Testament, just as it is logically inconsistent to accept the visions of
Isaiah, Ezekiel, and Paul and refuse to accept Swedenborg's visions.

We have seen that the people of the Ancient Church-the Silver
Age-were led by truth. Their great interest was in learning truths,
and they had access to the knowledge of the Most Ancient people,
which had been preserved and handed down to them. Thus they
knew correspondence of the things of nature with spiritual things,
and this study was their greatest delight. From our own little
knowledge of correspondences we can imagine what wide variety
of interest
this study must have had, and we can see how, as
Swedenborg tells us (AC 1285), the people of that time could have
developed a wide variety of forms of worship, depending upon
their particular interests and points of view. Yet as long as they
were in charity, that is, as long as they worshiped from love to the
Lord and the neighbor, they were in perfect harmony as to doc 
trine. This is what is meant in the story of the Tower of Babel by
their being "of one language and of one speech." When people are
working with a common interest and without thought of self, they
easily understand one another. They "speak the same language,"
and variety in knowledge and point of view adds to the harmony
of their efforts. But again the love of self crept in, and the Ancient
Church came to its end and its people were literally as well as
spiritually scattered over the face of the earth. Most of the pagan
religions in the world are perversions of beliefs handed down by
tradition from the scattered remnants of the Ancient Church.

Up to this point our lessons have been on the portion of the
Word copied by Moses from the Ancient Word, and we have not
been dealing with historical fact in the letter. Swedenborg tells us
(AC 1140, 1343) that the first person mentioned in the Word who
is a historical personage as well as a representative figure is Eber
(Genesis 11: 14), from whom the Hebrews took their name. He
tells us (AC 1343) that Eber constituted a second Ancient Church,
which came to an end in idolatrous worship in Terah, the father
of Abram, and that Abram signifies a third Ancient Church (AC
1360), from or in which the Lord instituted the Jewish Church.
The second Ancient Church,
like the first, recognized spiritual
things and knew that its forms of worship had their value from
their correspondence. It was in this church that sacrifices were
instituted.* But as it degenerated, the knowledge of the spiritual
meaning of the various acts of worship was lost, until they came
to regard their images and sacrifices as holy in themselves and
became idolaters, knowing nothing of love for the Lord and the

*See, however, Genesis 8: 20.

ABRAM AND LOT

neighbor or of heaven and eternal life. So the Lord and the angels
could no longer be present with men in their interiors, because
they no longer had any internal thought. There could no longer
be any real church on earth, because all real worship is internal.
Still the Lord had to keep His contact with men to keep them alive
and to save those whose intentions were good, and He instituted
the Jewish Church, which was not a real church at all, but only
the representative of a church. It is said of the Jewish priests who
"offer gifts according to the law" that they "serve unto the ex 
ample and shadow of heavenly things" (Hebrews 8: 5): The Hebrew
nation was chosen by the Lord for this purpose, not because they
were a peculiarly religious people but because they were a wholly
external people and could be led, through hope of reward and fear
to carryon worship of Jehovah according to the
of punishment,
particular forms which would correspondentially represent true
worship and so-through correspondence-keep the connection be 
tween earth and heaven which could no longer be maintained
through the minds and hearts of men. Their history could be
directed by the Lord so that it could be recorded in words which,
by correspondence, would express heavenly things and the divine
life itself.

The fundamental principle of the Jewish Church was recognition
of the necessity of obeying the commands of God. Abram lived in
Dr of Chaldea, and he and his people were idolaters; but appar 
ently he above others was inclined to absolute obedience. When he
was called by the Lord to leave his country and his father's people
and take the long journey to Canaan, he obeyed. And throughout
the story he obeyed unhesitatingly when the Lord spoke to him.
He represents in us the beginning of the development of spiritual
life. This beginning-when we are very little children-lies in obedi 
ence, first to our parents and then to the precepts of right conduct
which have been taught us.

Abram did not leave Dr alone. He took with him his wife Sarai,
his father Terah, his brother Nahor, his nephew Lot-whose father
had died in Dr-their families, and all their servants, cattle, and
possessions. We start our journey of life just where we are by
heredity, and must take with us all our qualities, all our abilities,
and all our weaknesses. Abram's father died before he reached the
land of Canaan, and his brother Nahor and his family stopped half 
way and settled in Haran (also called the city of Nahor). There are
in us tendencies which, while not evil, are "simple." We say we
have "outgrown" them. Yet they remain in our background and
we go back to them from time to time for renewal of our early
simple faith. These are represented by Nahor. But Lot went all
the way with Abram.

Each plane of our minds has its internal and its external. Abram
pictures the internal man in its early state, and Lot the external or
sensuous man. We are all perfectly familiar in our own experience
with the struggle between higher and lower motives and principles.
Lot chose to live in the low but inviting valley of present satisfac 
tion, and Abram dwelt in the mountains of the Lord's promise.
In the fertile valley of the Jordan, Lot's choice, were the wicked
cities of Sodom and Gomorrah. Lot went to live near Sodom.
Because of this he was captured and carried away when the four
kings from the Tigris-Euphrates valley came over to make war on
the five kings of the Jordan valley. This pictures our early temp 
tation to do as others do. At first the childhood habit of obedi 
ence, like Abram, is near enough to be aroused and strong enough
to go after us and bring us back to a good state. But temptations
increase. In chapter 19 we find Lot
living in the very gate of
Sodom when it was about to be destroyed for its wickedness. We
are familiar with the story of the angels who came to Lot to lead
him out of Sodom. Even then, we recall, Lot refused to go to the
mountain and chose to live in the little city of Zoar, and the Lord
permitted him to make his choice. Lot was saved, but his two sons,
Moab and Ammon, born to him after this escape, fathered the
Moabites and Ammonites, who represent the evils and falsities that
result when men live in the externals or worship without the in 
ternals. They were enemies of Israel for generations. All Lot's
troubles began when his herdmen quarreled with Abram's herd-

ABRAM AND LOT

men, at which time he separated from Abram and went to live in
the valley.

And what of Lot's wife who disobeyed the command of the
angels and looked back toward Sodom? To look back or turn
back means to recede from good once we have seen and under 
taken it. When we make up our minds to do the right thing, we
should go forward with it steadily and not dally with thoughts of
the pleasures of the course from which we have turned. Salt in a
good sense represents the affection of truth or the desire to live
according to the truth. When this is lost, the salt has lost its savor.
It was an old custom, coming from a knowledge of this correspon 
dence, to sow a conquered city with salt. We should be able to
learn from past experience not to "look back." The pillar of salt
into which Lot's wife was turned stands as a perpetual warning.
The Lord Himself said, "Remember Lot's wife."

From the Writings of Swedenborg
Arcana Coelestia, n.1547: "Lot represents sensuous things, by which is meant
the external man and its pleasures that pertain to sensuous things, thus those
things which are outermost, and which are wont to captivate man in his
childhood, and draw him away from goods. For so far as a man indulges tb
pleasures that originate from cupidities, he is drawn away from the celestial
things that are of love and charity; because in those pleasures there is love
from self and from the world, with which celestial love cannot agree. There
are, however, pleasures that agree perfectly with celestial things, and that like 
wise appear similar in external form ... But the pleasures that originate from
cupidities are to be restrained and wiped out, because they block the way to
celestial things. It is these pleasures, and not others, that are treated of in this
chapter-by Lot, in that he separated himself from Abraham."

== ABRAHAM AND ISHMAEL
Genesis 16

Review briefly the story of the Most Ancient Church and its
destruction as a preparation for describing the decline and fall of
the Ancient Church. Then review the raising up of the remnant
called Noah and go from that to an account of the call of Abram.
The thought of the Lord's stepping in while a remnant of good
remained can be connected with the promise of which the rainbow
was the token. Be sure the classes understand why Abram is used
in our chapter and why we always speak of him as A braham.

=== Doctrinal Points
The three planes in our lives.
The origin ofidolatry.
Humility and obedience the basis of all spiritual progress.

=== Notes for Parents

Abraham was a real person. The Jews think of him as the father
of their race. His home was in the city of Dr in the land of Chal 
dea, and he came of a nation of idol worshipers, one of the many
branches into which the Ancient Church was divided after its fall,
which is described in the symbol story of the Tower of Babel
(Genesis 11:1-9).

In Abram the Lord found a man who would obey Him even at
great cost to himself, and He called him to leave his home and go
to the land of Canaan where He would make him the father of
a great nation. Abram obeyed and the Lord prospered him greatly;
but in our chapter for today we find that he and his wife Sarai
have grown old and still have no child. How is Abram to become
the father of a nation? Sarai tries to solve the problem by giving
him her Egyptian bondservant Hagar as a wife. People in that
degenerate time had lost all knowledge of what a true marriage is.
It seems strange to us that we should read in the Bible of men who
had more than one wife and yet were blessed by the Lord. But we
must remember that the Lord judges us not by the wrong things
which we do ignorantly-which are many-but by those we do
knowing that they are wrong.

Sarai meant to do the right thing, and when Hagar despised her,
Abram upheld Sarai. Hagar had to be taught to submit to her
mistress. We cannot escape the consequences of our misdeeds by
running away from them. Yet
the Lord dealt gently with Hagar,
as He does with us. His Word is our "fountain of water in the
wilderness" and also the angel-or "messenger"-of the Lord,
recalling us to our duty and promising us happiness if we will
obey.

Ishmael was to become the father of a great people, but he was
not to be Abram's heir, as we shall learn later. You will notice that
the names Abram and Sarai are not spelled in this chapter as we
are accustomed to find them spelled. In chapter 17, verses 1-5 and
15-16, you will find the story of how the spelling of their names
came to be changed. The h which was inserted in each is one of
the letters of the Lord's name Jehovah and was added to show that
they were to stand thenceforth in a closer relation to the Lord
than before. Every letter of the Hebrew in the original language of
the Bible is important.

Primary

Try to fix in the children's minds the series of names Adam, Noah, Abraham.
Emphasize the fact that the descendants of Noah came to think they knew
better than the Lord, just as Adam and Eve had, and so they stopped obeying
Him and became bad. Then speak of Abram's call and its result, and read the
chapter for today last. Help the children fix in their minds the relationships
of Abram, Sarai, Hagar, and Ishmael.

This is a story of the father of the Jewish people. Jews still call
themselves "children ofAbraham." The Lord founded a new church
in the world through Noah and his family and for a time people
remembered the covenant of the rainbow and obeyed the Lord.
But it did not last.

You know how happy you are when you are being good and
everyone is pleased with you. But do you keep on always being
good? No; sooner or later you forget and do something you know
is naughty. That was just the way it was with the people of that
Ancient Church. And they became worse and worse until they
were no longer obeying the Lord at all; so they stopped being a
church.

Then the Lord called Abraham, a man who was still willing to
obey. He lived far to the east in a city called Ur. The Lord told
him to leave his home and go to the land of Canaan, and promised
that if he would obey, his descendants would become a great
nation.

Abraham did obey, and the Lord blessed him in the land of
Canaan. He lived in a city called Hebron, and became very rich.
There was one thing, however, that Abraham needed which he did not have.
What was it?
Who was Abraham's wife?
How did she decide to give Abraham a son?
Who was Hagar?
What did she do that was wrong?
Why did she run away?
Where did the angel of the Lord find her?
What did he tell her to do?
What did he say about her son?
Who was the son of Abraham and Hagar?

In the story in this chapter the names are Abram and Sarai, but
later the Lord changed them to Abraham and Sarah, and that is
the way we should remember them.

Junior

The reason for the decline of the Ancient Church is important for the Juniors.
They should also be drilled on the fust part of the Abraham story. The essen 
tial questions for this are given in their notes. The teacher should add questions on chapter 13. In this lesson stress the weakness and foolishness of
trying to run away from the consequences of our wrongdoing.

After the time of Noah the people had a Bible from which they
learned the truth. It is called the Ancient Word and certain books
in it are referred to in our Bible. Read Numbers 21:14, Joshua
10: 13, and II Samuel 1: 18. The Ancient Word has been lost, but
we may know something of what it was like because Moses copied
from it the first eleven chapters of Genesis. It was all written in
symbol language in which the people of that time spoke and wrote,
since they knew to what everything in nature corresponds. They
were very wise. But unfortunately they began to pride themselves
on their wisdom and to forget that they needed to look to the
Lord for guidance. So their church-the Ancient Church-declined,
and again the time came when the Lord had to gather together the
remnant of good people and build up a new church.

The beginning of this new church is described in the story of
Abraham. The original names of Abraham and his wife Sarah were
Abram and Sarai. The h, which is one of the letters of the Lord's
name Jehovah, was put in later to show the closer relation they
came to bear to the Lord (Genesis 17: 1-5, 15).

Why did Abram go down into Egypt?
Where did Abram settle when he returned to the land of Canaan?
In Egypt Abram had gained great riches, but there was one thing he did not
have. What was it?
How did Sarai decide to help Abram to have a son?

Abram and Sarai did not know that it was wrong for a man to
have more than one wife at a time. So the Lord did not blame
them. He saw the love in Sarai's heart which wanted to make her
husband happy.

What was Sarai's servant's name?
From what country did she come?
When Hagar knew she was to have a son, how did she treat Sarai?

Do we ever make fun of someone because he can't do something
that we can do? This is always wrong. In the first place, there are
probably things he can do which we can't. But even if we could

ABRAHAM AND ISHMAEL

do everything better than he, we should not let it make us proud,
because it is the Lord who gives us all our abilities, and He gives
them to us to use to help other people and never to hurt them.

Did Abram side with Hagar or with Sarai?
Abram was happy that he was to have a son. but he was a just man and he
knew that Hagar was in the wrong.
Where did Hagar go when Sarai treated her harshly?
Where did the angel of the Lord fmd her?
What did the angel tell her to do?
What did He promise her?

We must never run away from the results of our own wrong 
doing. That is cowardly and makes us weaker instead of stronger.
We grow stronger by acknowledging what we have done that is
wrong and by trying to make it right as far as we can. The Lord
cannot make us happy while we are doing wrong. The word angel
means "messenger." The angel of the Lord speaks to us just as
truly as he did to Hagar. The Lord's messenger to us is the Bible,
and He can speak to us through everything we know that comes
from the Bible. You know that when you have done wrong, there
is something inside you that seems to be telling you so and telling
you just what you ought to do. We call this inside voice our con 
science, but it is based on what we know from the Lord's Word. It
may help you sometimes, when you hear the voice of conscience,
to think, "This is the angel of the Lord speaking to me by the
fountain of water in the wilderness."

Did Hagar obey the Lord?
What was her son's name?
What did the angel say he would be?

Intermediate
The reason for the fall of the Ancient Church and the quality in Abraham
which enabled the Lord to use him to begin a new dispensation should be
made clear. In the lesson the meaning of producing children and the meaning
of the Egyptian servant Hagar are the important parts to stress.

The character of the Ancient Church-the church called Noah-
was different from that of the Most Ancient Church. The people
of the Most Ancient Church were governed by their will or emo 
tions, but those of the Ancient Church were governed by their
understanding. So at the height of the Ancient Church the people
were very wise. They loved to study the inner meaning of their
Word and they understood it much more fully than we do. But
their wisdom was accompanied by a great temptation, the temp 
tation to be proud of their knowledge and to forget to be humble
before God. This "pride of self-intelligence" grew until they could
no longer serve the Lord as His Church on earth. The end of the
Ancient Church is described in the story of the Tower of Babel.
According to His promise-the covenant of the rainbow-the
Lord did not destroy these people. He merely took from them the
understanding of the truths they had misused, and scattered the
people "upon the face of all the earth" (Genesis 11: 8). Some of
the religions of the Orient are based on ideas handed down by
tradition from this church.

But again the Lord gathered a remnant of good people who still
wished to obey Him, instructed them anew, and built them into
a church. Abram's virtue was implicit obedience. He had many
false ideas in his mind because he had grown up in the last days of
the decline of the true Ancient Church, but he was willing to do
what he believed the Lord wanted him to do. So the Lord could
promise to bless him and make of him a great nation.

In our chapter for today Abram and his wife Sarai are very old
and, in spite of the Lord's promise, Abram still has no heir. So
Sarai offers Abram her Egyptian bondwoman Hagar that he may
have a child by her, and Abram accepts the offer.

We know that it is wrong for a man to have more than one wife
at a time. The people of the early churches-while they were true
churches-knew it, too. But by the time of Abram men had forgot 
ten a great many of the truths which had been given them in the
beginning, and Abram and Sarai had no thought that they were
doing wrong. So the Lord did not blame them for it. He does not
blame us for doing wrong in ignorance unless our ignorance is will-

ABRAHAM AND ISHMAEL

ful; that is, unless we have refused to learn the truth when it was
offered us. This is one of the great mercies of the Lord. Neverthe 
less when we do wrong, there are always bad consequences. Hagar's
son could not be Abraham's heir.

In spiritual terms, the desire for children is the desire to produce
what is good and true, to make our lives count for something in
the building of the Lord's kingdom. This is a good desire, but it is
often at first united to false ideas of what is good and true. Hagar
was an Egyptian and a servant. There are three great Bible coun 
the land of Canaan, Assyria, and Egypt. Like all groups of
tries:
three in the Word they represent the three great planes of our lives:
will,
thought, and act. You will learn more about these as we go
on, but you may remember that Egypt is the land of "memory 
knowledge," Assyria the land of thought and reasoning, and the
land of Canaan the land of the will to make all that we know and
think serve the Lord. Think, for example, how we come by our
religion. First we store in our memories knowledge from the letter
of the Word-this is Egypt. Then we think about these knowledges
and come to understand what they mean-this is Assyria. Finally
we come to love to obey what these knowledges teach-this is the
land of Canaan. Women in the Bible represent affections for various
kinds of truth. So Hagar the Egyptian represents the affection for
memory-knowledges. This is one of our early affections-we like
to "know things." This is a good and useful affection so long as it
is made to serve the true purpose for which knowledge is intended,
which is Sarai, Abram's true wife. But sometimes we become proud
of our knowledge and think we know more than those who are
really wiser than we. This is Hagar despising her mistress.

When Hagar was rebuked, she ran away into the wilderness.
A wilderness is the opposite of a safe, cultivated place where one
can be at home. Many times in the Bible we find people going into
the wilderness. This is always a picture of a confused and unsettled
state of mind, when one seems to have lost his firm hold on
the truth, his spiritual home. Those who are proud of their own
knowledge and despise others are often brought into such a state.
Yet, in the Bible stories, people in the wilderness are always, like
Hagar, being led to wells or springs of water. This means that the
Lord is always present to show us the truth when we realize our
need of it.

The angel of the Lord found Hagar by the fountain of water in
the wilderness. An angel is a messenger-that is what the word
means. First he told her to go back to her mistress and do right,
and then he made her encouraging promises about her son. When
we have done wrong and are confused and unhappy,
the Lord
leads us to the truth, and His angel-which for us is the Word-tells
us to go back and try to make up for the wrong we have done and
that the result will be a great blessing.

Hagar's son was Ishmael. Later we shall take up the meaning of
Ishmael and Isaac, Abraham's two sons. Notice here the prophecies
which the angel spoke concerning Ishmael.

Basic Correspondences

the land of Canaan = the inmost plane of our life in

which we desire to serve the Lord

Assyria = the thinking and reasoning plane

Egypt = the outmost plane 
memory-knowledges

a wilderness = a confused and unsettled state

Senior

Try to make clear to the young people that Abram, although he is the third
in the series of churches, is also the fIrst in a new series of three-Abraham,
Isaac, Jacob-all on the natural plane. Our lessons from now on will be inter 
preted mainly as they apply to our individual development from infancy to
adulthood.

From chapter 12 of Genesis on, although it continues to be
parable, it is also for the most part true history. Historical records
other than the Bible go back approximately to the time of Abra 
ham; so we may fairly say that the first eleven chapters of Genesis
treat of prehistoric times. From the height of the Most Ancient

ABRAHAM AND ISHMAEL

Church, described by the Garden of Eden before the creation of
Eve, down to the fall of the Ancient Church, described in the story
of the Tower of Babel (Genesis 11: 1-9), we find people becoming
less and less spiritual, and more and more external and worldly.
the second a spiritual
The first church was a celestial church,
church, and the third-described by Eber (Genesis 11: 14) -a natu 
ral church. We shall find presently that in the descendants of Abra 
ham this third church gradually lost all interior understanding until
in the church set up among the children of Jacob or Israel it was
no longer anything but the "representative of a church," because
it had no spiritual life within it.

The Ancient Church declined and fell as a result of the growth
of the "pride of self-intelligence." Its people had had great wis 
dom, but after a time they began to forget that all their wisdom
was a gift from the Lord. They had understood correspondences
and developed a worship in which they used images of natural
things to remind them of the spiritual things which they signified.
But
in time they forgot the spiritual significance and began to
worship the images themselves. So they became idolaters, and all
the idolatrous religions with which we are familiar in the world
today are perverted remains of the Ancient Church.

While there were still, however, a few left who, although they
worshiped idols, still were sincere in their desire to obey God
instead of depending on themselves, the Lord called Abram to
leave his home in Dr of the Chaldees and go to the land of Canaan
and reestablish there the worship of the one God. Abram was
chosen because he was willing to be obedient even at great cost to
himself. He obeyed without question.

In our lives we may think of the Most Ancient and Ancient
churches as picturing our inherited background, and of Abram as
representing our early childlike obedience to the Lord. But we
soon begin to grow up as independent individuals and, just as the
early people wanted a life of their own, so in the literal Bible story
Abram wanted a son of his own. Children always picture new
developments: sons, truths; and daughters, goods or affections.
Abram's first son, however, was not to be his heir, because he
was not the son of Abram's true wife Sarai. This is a very interest 
ing story. In the letter Abram and Sarai do wrong as we see it.
The early people in the Adamic and Noachic churches knew that
a man should have only one wife at a time, but by the time of
Abram this truth, along with many others, had been lost. Thus
Abram and Sarai were innocent in their wrongdoing and the Lord
did not hold it against them; but still there were evil consequences.
The same law holds today. We are not held responsible by the Lord
in His mercy for evils we commit ignorantly, if our ignorance is
not willful; yet the consequences of our wrong deeds follow inevi 
tably.

In the Bible the various countries picture different planes of life.
Egypt pictures the plane of natural or external knowledge-that is,
of memory-knowledge. As women picture affections for different
kinds of truth, Hagar, the Egyptian servant, pictures the affection
for natural or memory knowledges. Our first efforts to produce
ideas and works of our own are often the offspring of purely
natural affections. The ideas so produced are never truly spiritual.
So Ishmael, the son of Abram and Hagar, was to be a "wild man,"
or, as the original Hebrew says, a "wild-ass man." When we are
young, our affections cling to external satisfactions and we reason
from these external things. We are always sure we are right and are
likely to laugh at our parents and teachers, just as both Hagar and
later Ishmael despised and laughed at those higher than they.

Hagar represents an external, natural type of affection. Ishmael
represents our youthful reasonings. Hagar's pride drives her into
the wilderness. Our state of mind at this time is very like a wilder 
ness, with no regular paths, no fixed abode, no cultivated food.
Yet even here we find water. The Lord shows us the truth in our
time of need, and His angel, or messenger, the Word, tells us to go
back and submit ourselves humbly to those who are wiser than we,
and all will be well with us.

The great fault of our first reasoning power is pride. No matter
how bright and clever we are, we always need to look to the Lord

ABRAHAM AND ISHMAEL

for guidance, or we are really lost in a wilderness. And in trouble
and temptation the Lord is very close to us and ready to show us
the way home as soon as we really acknowledge our need.

Adult

The three main lines of thought to be followed are the transition from the
Ancient to the Jewish Church, the change of application in our interpretation
as we pass to the historical part of the Word, and the meaning of Hagar and
Ishmael.

We have thought of Noah as picturing the Ancient Church which
was established on earth after the flood. We commonly think of
this as the second church and of the Jewish Church as the third.
But Swedenborg points out that the three sons of Noah picture
different derivations of doctrinals and worships in the Ancient
Church-Shem true internal worship, Ham "internal worship cor 
rupted," and Japheth "external worship corresponding to internal"
(AC 1146)-and the explanation of the internal sense of the gen 
ealogies in chapter 10 of Genesis shows clearly how these three
types deviated more and more widely as time went on from the
true pattern of the Ancient Church. As might be expected,
the
descendants of Shem continued to be the core of the Lord's con 
nection with mankind, and in this line there developed a "second
Ancient Church" in Eber. Of this church we read in AC 1343:
"That 'Eber' was a nation called, from Eber as its father, the He 
brew nation, and that thereby is signified the worship in general
of the second Ancient Church,
is evident from those historical
parts of the Word wherein it is spoken of. From that nation, be 
cause the new worship commenced there, all were called Hebrews
who had a similar worship. Their worship was of the kind that was
afterwards restored among the descendants of Jacob; and its chief
characteristic consisted in their calling their God 'Jehovah,' and in
their having sacrifices. The Most Ancient Church with unanimity
acknowledged the Lord, and called Him Jehovah, as is evident
from the first chapters of Genesis, and elsewhere in the Word. The
Ancient Church, that is, the church after the flood, also acknowl 
edged the Lord, and called Him Jehovah, especially those who had
internal worship, and were called, 'sons of Shem.' The others, who
were in external worship, also acknowledged Jehovah, and wor 
shiped Him. But when internal worship became external, and still
more when it became idolatrous, and when each nation began to
have its own god whom it worshiped, the Hebrew nation retained
the name Jehovah; and hereby were distinguished from the other
nations. Together with their external worship, the descendants of
Jacob in Egypt lost this also-that they called their God Jehovah;
nay, Moses himself did so; and therefore they were instructed first
of all that Jehovah was the God of the Hebrews, and the God of
Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob."

AC 1360 tells us that Terah, the father of Abram, was a "third
Ancient Church" which had become idolatrous, and Terah's death
in Haran (AC 1375) signalized the end of this idolatrous worship
and "the beginning of a representative church through Abram."
In AC 1403 Swedenborg says: "From the first chapter of Gen 
esis up to this point [Genesis 12: 1], or rather to the mention of
Eber,
the historicals have not been true but made-up historicals,
which in the internal sense signify celestial and spiritual actu 
alities." This is further explained in AC 1409: "The Most Ancient
Church, which was celestial, looked upon all earthly and worldly,
and also bodily things, which were in any wise objects of the
senses, as being dead things; but as each and all things in the world
present some idea of the Lord's kingdom, consequently of things
celestial and spiritual, when they saw them or apprehended them
by any sense, they thought not of them, but of the celestial and
spiritual things; indeed they thought not from the worldly things,
but by means of them; and thus with them things that were dead
became living. The things thus signified were collected from their
lips by their posterity and were formed by them into doctrinals,
which were the Word of the Ancient Church, after the flood. With
the Ancient Church these were significative; for through them they
learned internal things, and from them they thought of spiritual

– Anita Dole Bible Study Notes Volume 1 –© 2001 by The Swedenborg Foundation. Scanned by Bayside Church. Used on www.newchurchvineyard.org by permission.

ABRAHAM AND ISHMAEL

and celestial things. But when this knowledge began to perish, so
that they did not know that such things were signified, and began
to regard the terrestrial and worldly things as holy, and to worship
them, with no thought of their signification, the same things were
then made representative. Thus arose the Representative Church,
which had its beginning in Abram and was afterwards instituted
with the posterity of Jacob. From this it may be know~ that
representatives had their rise from the significatives of the Ancient
Church, and these from the celestial ideas of the Most Ancient
Church. But with representatives the character of the person is not
considered at all, but the thing which he represents; for all the
kings of Judah and Israel, of whatever character, represented the
Lord's kingly function; and all the priests, of whatever character,
represented His priestly function. Thus the evil as well as the good
could represent the Lord and the celestial and spiritual things of
His kingdom."

The story of the patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob pictures
in the internal historical sense the development of this represen 
tative church, and in its internal sense the development of anyone
of us. So we may think of the whole story of Abraham-which is
more or less familiar to all of us-as picturing our spiritual state in
infancy and very early childhood. Our lesson for today deals with
the beginning of the change from this innocent, trustful, obedient
age to the part of our childhood when we are beginning to try to
think and act for ourselves. Swedenborg summarizes our chapter
in its inmost meaning as follows: "The subject treated of in this
chapter is the Lord's first rational, which was conceived by the
influx of the internal man into the affection of memory-knowl 
edges [scientiae] of the external. The internal man is 'Abram';
the affection of memory-knowledges in the external is 'Hagar the
thence derived is 'Ishmael.'"
Egyptian handmaid';
The name Hagar means a "stranger" or "sojourner" and in a simple
way we can see that our conclusions from our early thinking are
inevitably temporary. They are based on our knowledge of the
external world alone. We reason from appearances. And it follows the rational
that we resent efforts to correct our ideas and conduct by those
who are older and wiser and whose standards are based on deeper
spiritual truths. This is pictured in the story of Hagar's despising
her mistress, being rebuked, and fleeing from the face of her mis 
tress.

Hagar is found by the angel at the fountain of water in the wil 
derness. Our affection for external knowledges, under the Lord's
is always supplied with some external knowledge of
providence,
the Word, which serves for rebuke, advice, and encouragement in
goodness. So Hagar returns and is again subject to her mistress.
But Hagar's son, although he is to be the father of a great people,
is not
to be Abraham's heir. This means that our first natural
reasoning is necessary and will always play a part in our lives,
especially in the conduct of our worldly affairs, but
is not
adequate to lead us in our spiritual progress.

it

From the Writings of Swedenborg

Arcana Coelestia, n. 1949:
"He shall be a wild-ass man. That this signifies
rational truth, which is described, is evident from the signification of 'a wild 
ass,' as being rational truth. In the Word there is frequent mention of horses,
horsemen, mules, and asses; and as yet no one has known that these signify
things of the intellect, of the reason, and of memory-knowledge. That these
animals and their riders have such a signification will of the Lord's Divine
mercy be fully confirmed in the proper places. of the same class is the 'ona 
ger,' for this is the mule of the wilderness, or wild-ass, and it signifies man's
rational; not however the rational in its whole complex, but only rational
truth. The rational consists of good and truth, that is, of things belonging to
charity and of things belonging to faith, and it is rational truth that is signified
by the 'wild-ass.' This then is what is represented by Ishmael, and is what is
described in this verse. It seems incredible that rational truth when separated
from good should be of such a character, neither should I have known this to
be the case unless I had been instructed by living experience. Whether you say
rational truth, or the man whose rational is of this kind, amounts to the same.
The man whose rational is of such a character that he is solely in truth-even
though it be the truth of faith-and who is not at the same time in the good
of charity, is altogether of such a character. He is a morose man, will bear
nothing, is against all, regards everybody as being in falsity, is ready to rebuke,

to chastise, anl to punish; has no pity, and does not apply or adapt himself
to others and study to bend their minds; for he looks at everything from
truth, and at nothing from good. Hence it is that Ishmael was driven out, and
afterwards dwelt in the wilderness, and his mother took him a wife out of the
land of Egypt (Gen. xxi. 9-21); all of which things are representative of one
who is endowed with such a rational."

== ABRAHAM AND THE ANGELS
Genesis 18

This lesson is from the middle of the Abraham story. Review
briefly the facts concerning Abraham up to this point, leaving the
rest of his story to be covered later. In the story this time Abra 
ham's desire to be directed by the Lord should be emphasized, in
contrast to the general state of mankind especially as it was pic 
tured in the lesson on the Tower of Babel.

=== Doctrinal Points
Before His Advent the Lord appeared to men by filling an angel

with His presence.

In the Word literal history begins with Genesis 12.
Faith is really of the heart. The mind tends to doubt.
Abraham's trust in the Lord and obedience to Him are essentials

of charity.

=== Notes for Parents

In this story Abraham is nearly a hundred years old. The Lord
has kept his promise-made when He called Abraham to leave his
ancestral home in Chaldea and go to the land of Canaan-and
Abraham is rich and well established in the land. But one promise
of the Lord is still unfulfilled. For the Lord has said that Abra 
ham's descendants shall inherit the land and become a great nation,
and as yet Abraham's wife Sarah, who is also very old, has had no
children. Abraham has one son, Ishmael, born to him by Sarah's
bondwoman Hagar, but the Lord has told him that Ishmael cannot
be his heir.

Abraham's outstanding virtues were trust in the Lord and obedi 
ence to Him. It was these virtues which made it possible for the
Lord to be with him and to prosper him, and also to speak to him
as He does in our chapter. As we read the chapter, we find that

== ABRAHAM AND THE ANGELS

Abraham almost immediately recognizes the three men as angels
or messengers of the Lord, and as the chapter goes on, he speaks
to them as one person and is answered by the Lord, until in the
last part of the chapter his whole conversation is with the Lord.
The renewal of the promise of an heir to be born to him by Sarah
he accepts without question. Sarah cannot conceal her doubts, but
we know that within the year she did have a son, Isaac.

The lesson for us in this chapter is that trust and obedience are
never in vain. They always bear fruit which carries on into the
future. Sometimes it seems to us that the good have many hard 
ships to bear and that the evil prosper, but that is because we are
thinking only of what happens in this world and forgetting that
this is only the beginning of our life and that what counts in the
end is what is happening in our souls. This is what the last part of
our chapter tells us. We all have in us the spiritual counterparts of
the wicked cities of sodom and Gomorrah, selfish desires and
wrong thoughts, but if we do our best from day to day to learn
the Lord's will and do it, the Lord will surely spare us and bring us
safely to heaven.

Primary
Only the ftrst part of the chapter is chosen for these, younger children. The
Lord's promise to Abraham and the fact that he and Sarah were old people
and had had no son will serve to point up the lesson. The details of his enter 
tainment of the angels will interest the children. Tell the children that the
word angel means "messenger."

Our story is about Abraham. Abraham was one of the people
who still wanted to be taught by the Lord and to obey Him even
after most of the world had become self-willed and ignorant of
heavenly things. So the Lord could teach Abraham and be with
him and help him.

The Lord told Abraham to leave his home and go to the land
of Canaan and settle there. It was a long journey but Abraham
obeyed, and he finally settled in a place called Hebron-or some 
times called Mamre. The Lord prospered him and he became very
rich in cattle, in silver, and in gold. He and his family were shep 
herds and herdmen and lived very simply-not at all as most of us
do today. Their homes were tents, which they could take down
and move about so that their flocks could always find pasture.

The Lord had promised Abraham that he would be the father
of a great nation, but Abraham and his wife Sarah had had no chil 
dren and they were now old people. This troubled Abraham very
much, but the Lord always keeps His promises.
Who came to see Abraham?
How did he receive them?
What did he tell Sarah to do?
What other food did he give them?
What did they promise him?
What did Sarah do of which she was afterward ashamed?

The three men who came to Abraham were angels or messengers
of the Lord, and Abraham recognized this and welcomed them and
was happy to entertain them with the best he had. And he believed
what they told him, even though Sarah doubted.

Junior
For this class the story of Abraham is best taught with the help of a map, and
this story should be treated as an incident in the total story, with the empha 
sis on the promise of Isaac. Do not, however, neglect the general lesson of
Abraham's questions concerning Sodom and Gomorrah. The exact location
of these two cities geographically is not known, but their general location
may be assumed from the story of Lot.

What is the first great church on earth called?
How is its end described in the Bible?
What is the second great church called?
What serious fault developed in it?
What happened to it when it would no longer serve the Lord?
By what story in the Bible is its end described?

The Lord never lets the world be without a church. You remem 
ber that Cain represents faith and that the Lord kept Cain from
being killed even after Cain had killed Abel. To start the third
church the Lord chose Abram. Abram and his family had grown

ABRAHAM AND THE ANGELS

up with a great many wrong ideas about God and religion, but
they still wanted to do what would please God instead of just
trying to have their own way. So the Lord could teach them.

The Lord told Abram to take his family and leave Or of Chaldea
and travel to the land of Canaan. Abram made his home at Hebron,
where the Lord renewed His promise to Abram that he would be
father of a great people, and as a sign changed his name to Abra 
ham and Sarai's name to Sarah. This was a sign because the letter h
is the principal letter in the Lord's name Jehovah, and it meant
that Abraham and Sarah, because they were obedient to the Lord,
had come to stand in a very special relation to Him.

Now we come to our story for today. Mamre, in the first verse

of our chapter, is another name for Hebron.

Who came to see Abraham at Mamre?
What did Abraham offer them ftrst?
What did he tell Sarah to do;
What else did he give them to eat?
What did they promise him?
What did Sarah do?

On your map find the two cIties of Sodom and Gomorrah.
These were in the valley which Lot had chosen for his home, and
perhaps you remember that Lot had already had trouble because
he lived too near these wicked cities. He and his family had been
captured, and Abraham had had to go and rescue him. Now the
two cities have become so wicked that they must be destroyed.

What does Abraham ask the Lord?
What were the numbers in order as Abraham gave them?

When you are older, you will understand more of what this story
means, but you can see now that it teaches us that the Lord is very
kind and merciful and does everything He can to help and save us,
so long as there is any real goodness in us. It is never the Lord's
fault if a person does not get to heaven. But the Lord cannot save
us if we turn from Him altogether and become wholly selfish. And
of course the more obedient and unselfIsh we are, the more happi 
ness the Lord can give us.
Intermediate

The principal lesson for this class is the correspondence of Abraham, the
meaning of his call, and the importance of the good states of our infancy in
our later development.

Abraham obeyed the Lord. When the voice of the Lord came to
him, telling him to leave his home in Dr of Chaldea and make the
long journey to the land of Canaan, he gathered together his fam 
ily and his possessions and started out. You remember the story.
Abram and his wife Sarai-their names were later changed to Abra 
ham and Sarah-together with Abraham's brother Nahor and his
family, and their nephew Lot-son of another brother, Haran, who
had died-and their old father Terah took the route up around the
northern edge of the Arabian desert, living in tents and stopping
often to pasture their flocks and herds. At one of these stopping
places, not too far from Canaan, Nahor decided to settle. They
named the place Haran after Lot's father, and in the Bible it is also
sometimes called "the city of Nahor." There Terah died. We need
to remember this place because of its importance in our later
stories.

Abraham and Sarah and Lot, with their servants and their ani 
mals, went on into the land of Canaan, stopping at Shechern and
Bethel, where Abraham built altars, and then going on southward.
You remember that because of a famine they had to go to Egypt
for a time and that they prospered there and became rich. When
they returned to the land of Canaan, they separated, Lot choosing
to live in the rich Jordan valley, in spite of the wicked cities of
Sodom and Gomorrah in that area, and Abraham taking the more
mountainous region and making his home at Hebron.

This is a true story, but it is also a story of a spiritual journey
which we take in our early childhood, for Abraham represents the
state of every little child, a state of simple trust and obedience.
At that state of our lives we are all ignorant and we know only
the external things which we see and touch-just as Abraham was
an idolater-but the Lord has seen to it that there is something in
us which accepts instruction about Him. The land of Chaldea rep-

ABRAHAM AND THE ANGELS

resents our first natural self-centered state, but we are called by
the Lord to go to the land of Canaan, which represents heaven or
a heavenly character. And the Lord promises each one of us, as He
promised Abraham, that if we obey Him the land of Canaan shall
be ours forever.

In our present chapter Abraham is settled in Hebron and is pros 
perous and happy except for one thing. He has no heir. Ishmael
has been born to him by Hagar, Sarah's Egyptian bondwoman, but
the Lord has told him that Ishmael is not to be his heir. We soon
recognize that the three men who come to Abraham are messen 
gers of the Lord, or angels, for they speak for the Lord.

In fact, if you read carefully, you will find that the angels are
sometimes called "he" and that in verse 13 they are even called
"the Lord." Swedenborg explains this for us by telling us that
before the Lord came into the world as Jesus Christ He sometimes
appeared to men by "filling an angel with His presence." Abraham
received the men with joy and gave them the best he had. This
again shows Abraham's openness to direction by the Lord, and it
is a picture of the simplicity and of the pleasure with which little
children receive instruction in the stories of the Word.

The angels told Abraham that Sarah would bear him a son, even
though by this time Abraham and Sarah were both old. Sarah
doubted, but Abraham believed. The promise of an heir is the
promise that the truth we learn and the good we do will not be
wasted but will "bear fruit," that is, will lead to further develop 
ment of heavenly character.

The latter part of our chapter, although it seems to have no
connection with this promise in the letter, really carries it further.
The wicked cities of Sodom and Gomorrah picture the evils and
falsities which "come natural" to us because we are born selfish.
Sometimes we get to thinking that we just can't help being bad,
and we become discouraged with ourselves and are tempted to give
up trying to be good. This is pictured by the angels going down to
look over Sodom and Gomorrah to see if they are so wicked that
they must be destroyed. Every number in the Word has a corre-
spondence. So the numbers which Abraham uses in our chapter
describe different kinds and degrees of goodness, beginning with
fifty, which pictures a life full of goodness and truth, and ending
with ten, which pictures "remains," the good states of our infancy
stored up in us by the Lord. Perhaps you have read stories of how
a young man who seemed about to become a criminal has suddenly
thought of his mother and his innocent childhood and decided to
change his ways and reform. This is an example of how the Lord
can work through these childhood "remains."

So the conversation between the Lord and Abraham in our
chapter teaches us how the Lord uses every bit of goodness and
truth we ever had, and is trying always to save us from becoming
wholly selfish and destroying our spiritual life.

Basic Correspondences

Abraham = the state of infancy

and very early childhood

the land of Chaldea = the natural state into which

we are born

the land of Canaan = heaven or a heavenly character

Sodom = evil from the love of self
Gomorrah = falsity from the love of self

futy = what is full (truths full of goods)
ten = remams

Senior

More can be done in this class with the conversation concerning Sodom and
Gomorrah. One of the temptations young people have to meet is the question
-not only in their own minds but from other people-"What's the use?" They
need to be impressed with the fact that the Lord"'s presence with us is very
real, and that no right choice of ours is ever wasted.

The story of Abraham's call to leave his home in Dr of the
Chaldees and go to the land of Canaan pictures something in the
experience of every one of us. We are born wholly ignorant and
with a deep-seated tendency to selfishness which comes to us by

ABRAHAM AND THE ANGELS

inheritance from our natural ancestors. The evils and consequent
false tendencies which developed in the Most Ancient and Ancient
church~s are born in us just as they were in Abraham. But the
Lord sees to it that each of us has also an inheritance from Him in
the form of a "counter-urge" to overcome our selfishness and make
spiritual progress. When you were a very little child you began to
feel this prompting to be good instead of naughty. It was the voice
of the Lord calling you to leave "the land of your fathers"-your
selfishness-and go to the land of Canaan-the heavenly character
which the Lord would make your own if you obeyed.

Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob picture our spiritual development
as we grow from infancy to adulthood. Abraham stands for our
infancy and very early childhood. Abraham trusted and obeyed
the Lord just as we, when we are little, trust and obey our parents.
We have studied Abraham's journey, the settling of his brother
Nahor in Haran, the arrival of Abraham and Lot at Shechern and
then at Bethel, their sojourn in Egypt because of the famine, and
their return and separation, when Lot chose the Jordan valley and
Abraham took the more mountainous part of the land. You will
remember the story of Lot and the difficulties he had because he
lived too near the wicked cities of Sodom and Gomorrah, and that
this represents the tendency of the natural, external part of our
minds to be lured into evil by the attractions of the world.

At the time when our lesson for today opens, Abraham is settled
at Hebron-also called Mamre-and has been made rich and secure
through his obedience to the Lord. He has one son, Ishmael, born
to him by his wife's Egyptian bondwoman Hagar; but the Lord
has told him that Ishmael is not to be his heir. Yet he has been
promised that his descendants shall inherit the land after him, and
that his wife Sarah shall have a son.

This promise is renewed and made definite as to time by the
three men who come to Abraham in our chapter. Notice that
although there are three, they are referred to and addressed as one,
and that Abraham not only receives them with all possible honor
but evidently recognizes that they speak for the Lord. Swedenborg
tells us that before the Advent the Lord appeared to men by "fill 
ing an angel with His presence." Isaiah (63: 9) speaks of "the angel
of his presence." Of the three men who appeared to Abraham
Swedenborg says: "That this signifies the Divine Itself, the Divine
Human, and the Holy proceeding, may be seen without expli 
cation; for it is known to everyone that there is a Trine, and that
this Trine is a One." (AC 2149) He explains this story as it refers
to the Lord's early childhood, and says: "In the internal sense the
subject here treated of is Jehovah, in that He appeared to the Lord,
and that the Lord perceived this; but not by an appearing such as
there was to Abraham; for it is historically true that three men
were seen by Abraham, but this represents the Divine perception,
or the perception from the Divine which the Lord had when in
the Human."

The promise of an heir is the promise that our obedience to the
{.ord will have lasting good results. Sarah's laughter at the promise
of a son pictures our natural tendency to doubt whether it is really
worthwhile to try to be good. Abraham did not doubt and there 
fore we have the account of his conversation with the Lord con 
,~erning Sodom and Gomorrah, which is really a further expla 
nation of the promise of an heir. The numbers picture various
states of goodness and truth. Fifty is a full state. Five always
means "a little." So five less than fifty means lacking only a little
of a full state of goodness and truth. Forty pictures temptation,
and we are told that the Lord never lets anyone come into temp 
tation unless he has the strength to resist it if he chooses to do so.
Thirty is a lesser degree of temptation. Twenty is "the good of
ignorance" and is used of those who are good but are not yet
adults. Ten signifies "remains"-states of good stored up in us by
the Lord, especially from our early childhood, to help us when we
are tempted. The lesson is that anyone of these states of goodness
has in it
the elements of salvation. We all have in our natural
heredity the elements of our spiritual destruction-Sodom and
Gomorrah-but if we will hold fast whatever truth we learn and
do our best to live according to it, the Lord will be able to save us

ABRAHAM AND THE ANGELS

in spite of our many mistakes and backslidings. It is only when
we stop trying to learn of the Lord and to obey Him that we are
following the road to spiritual destruction.

Adult

The story of Abraham and its general correspondence should be familiar to
the Adult class unless- the group contains newcomers to the church. Most of
the time should be spent on the details of the chapter, with special attention
to Swedenborg'S explanation of the visit of the three men, of Sarah's laughter,
and of the conversation about Sodom and Gomorrah.

In approaching the familiar story of Abraham we need again to
remind ourselves that all history is the record of slow changes, and
that events which seem to us sudden and sometimes inexplic 
able are nevertheless the result of the development of seeds sown
long before. As the deNastation of the Ancient Church was ac 
complished gradually, so the inauguration of the Jewish Church
was not by a sudden sweeping creation.

The Jews look to Abraham as the father of their race, and we
are accustomed to think of the call of Abraham as the beginning
of the Jewish Church. But if we read the writings carefully, we find
that Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob constituted the last phase of the
Ancient Church. Swedenborg speaks of three Ancient Churches.
The first is pictured by Noah and his sons. The second began with
Eber, who is the first real person mentioned in the Word and from
whom the Jews take the name of Hebrews. The third is described
in the story of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. For although Abraham
was an idolater, having lost all understanding of spiritual things,
he still had the desire to serve God rather than self, the desire
which is essential to a true church. Isaac and even Jacob retained
something of this desire. The Jewish Church, which was not a true
church at all but merely the representative of a church, was insti 
tuted among the sons of Jacob and their descendants. Swedenborg
has much to say about this in connection with the interpretation
of Genesis 32, 33, and 34.
In explaining the stories of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, Sweden 
borg deals principally with the celestial sense, with their appli 
cation to the states through which the Lord passed from infancy
to adulthood, as He progressively opened the planes of His Human
and united them to the indwelling Divine. But we are frequently
reminded in the writings that the process of regeneration with man
is analogous to the process of glorification in the Lord. So we
rightly think of Abraham as picturing our spiritual state in infancy
and very early childhood, a state of celestial innocence and trust
but also a state of ignorance. The call of Abraham to leave his
father's house in Ur of the Chaldees and go to the land of Canaan
is the call we hear- when, as little children, we first recognize that
we ought to be good instead of naughty. If we obey the call, we
begin our journey and eventually reach the Holy Land. Like Abram
we go down into Egypt for the sustenance we need-the knowl 
edges of the Word necessary to our spiritual life-and return rich
"in cattle, in silver, and in gold." We experience the separation
from Lot when we see that the natural part of us seeks external
satisfactions; and our early struggles with ourselves are on this
most external plane, as Abraham had to rescue Lot when he be 
came involved in the difficulties of the wicked cities of Sodom
and Gomorrah.

Sodom and Gomorrah appear in our chapter for today. We may
wonder at first what connection there is between the first half
the connection becomes
and the last half of the chapter, but
evident when we think what the promise of an heir means. We are
approaching the birth of Isaac, who represents our higher rational
faculty. Ishmael-the natural rational-is already in the picture.
That is, we are passing out of the infant state and have developed
the ability to "reason from appearances." We are at the stage when
we begin to argue with our parents. At heart we know we ought
to continue to trust and obey them-Abraham's confidence does
not waver-but our innocent delight in their complete wisdom 
pictured by Sarah-is attacked by doubts. The promise of an heir
is the promise that our efforts to do right will surely bear lasting

ABRAHAM AND THE ANGELS

fruit. The doubt comes to the child in the form of a question:
"What is the use of trying to be good all the time? I try and try,
and never seem to satisfy people."

In verse 1 of our chapter Swedenborg's translation is "the oak 
groves of Mamre," and as the Hebrew word is terebinth-the teil 
tree or oak of Palestine-there seems no reason for the translation
"plains" of the King James Version. The Revised Standard Version
translates it "the oaks." The oak groves signify perception from
memory-knowledges, and the fact
that Abraham sat in the tent
door signifies a state of worship. So we have present the conditions
necessary for receiving a communication from the Lord. We are
told in the writings that before the Advent the Lord appeared to
men by filling an angel with His presence, and we find that Abra 
ham received the three men immediately as angels or messengers
of the Lord. In AC 2149 Swedenborg says that the three men
signify "the Divine ItseJf, the Divine Human, and the Holy pro 
ceeding," and he continues: "for it is known to everyone that
there is a Trine, and that this Trine is a One." Then he analyzes
the conversation between Abraham and the angels to point out
that they are addressed as one, that they speak as one, and that
this One is identified with the Lord. A similar circumstance may
be noted in chapter 19, where the two men who come to Lot are
referred to as "they" while they are in Sodom, but become "he"
after Lot has been led out.

The mission of the angels is to confirm the promise of an heir
and to name the time of his birth. Concerning Sarah's laughter,
which revealed doubt, Swedenborg says in AC 2216 that laughter
is "an affection of the rational" and he continues: "So long as
there is in the rational such an affection as displays itself in laugh 
ter, so long there is in it something corporeal or worldly, and thus
merely human." Even in the Lord, at the time in His earthly life
which is pictured here, the rational still had much of the human
in it, which was to be expelled, and this in the celestial sense is
signified by Sarah's laughing.

Abraham's questions concerning Sodom and Gomorrah and the
Lord's replies are an answer to our childhood question, "What is
the use of trying to be good?" They are a study in the basic
requirements for salvation. "If I find in Sodom fifty righteous
within the city, then I will spare all the place for their sakes."
Fifty signifies "what is full," in this case "truths full of goods."
This is a spiritual picture of the man who has persisted in the
effort to learn truths from the Word and to live according to them.
But we all recognize our shortcomings in this respect. "Peradven 
ture there shall
lack five of the fifty righteous." Five signifies
"a little." Forty and thirty both signify temptation-thirty a less
degree than forty. We are told that genuine temptations come to
no one who is not regenerating, for spiritual temptations are not
mere external trials but are the urge to despair of our power to do
right and to give up the battle, to take the easy downward path.
So long as we have these inner struggles, we may know that our
state is not hopeless. Twenty represents "the good of ignorance,"
"those who have not been in temptations and yet are good," and
Swedenborg ascribes this especially to the state of young people
between the ages of ten and twenty, because they have not reached
the age of full responsibility for their choices. All these are saved.
Finally the number ten signifies "remains." All little children-in
whom the Lord always stores up remains of good and truth 
and all adults who have not by their own choice destroyed these
remains in themselves are saved.

From the Writings of Swedenborg
Arcana Coelestia, n. 2216: "It is an affection of the rational, and indeed the
affection of truth or of falsity, in the rational, that is the source of all laugh 
ter. So long as there is in the rational such an affection as displays itself in
laughter, so long there is in it something corporeal or worldly, and thus merely
human. Celestial good and spiritual good do not laugh, but express their de 
light and cheerfulness in the face, the speech, and the gesture, in another way;
for there are very many things in laughter, for the most part something of
contempt, which, even if it does not appear, nevertheless lies concealed; and
laughter is easily tlistinguished from cheerfulness of the mind, which also pro-

ABRAHAM AND THE ANGELS

duces something similar to it. The state of the human rational with the Lord
is described by Sarah's 'laughing'; and thereby is signified with what kind of
affection the truth of the rational, at that time separated from good, regarded
what was said: that it should be put off, and the Divine put on; not that the
Lord laughed, but that He perceived from the Divine what the rational still
was, and how much of the human there still was in it, and which was to be
expelled. In the internal sense this is what is signified by Sarah's 'laughing.' "

Genesis 21: 1-21

In this lesson, some of the details of the birth of Ishmael are
reviewed in order to contrast sharply the first rational-Ishmael 
with the second rational-Isaac. The reiterating of the promise of
an heir in the last lesson will lead naturally into the story of the
birth of Isaac.

Doctrinal Points
We need to develop a higher reason than that which judges accord 

ing to worldly values and standards.

Notes for Parents

Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob,

the three great patriarchs of the
Jews, were men like ourselves with weaknesses and faults. The
Lord did not choose those whose lives He recorded in His Word
because they were better than other men, but because He saw that
He could direct them in such a way that from the record of their
lives we could learn truths which we need, and He dictated that
record to the men who wrote it down in such a way that every
word might contain deep lessons for future ages. The Lord leads
us as we are, and uses our sins and our mistakes as well as our good
deeds and better feelings in His effort, to lead us away from evil
and toward the heavenly life.

In our lesson for today we review briefly the fact that Sarah,
because she had no child, had given her Egyptian maidservant to
Abraham to wife. Men in that time had, as we have already learned,
traveled very far from their first innocent and happy state. They
had by Abraham's day lost all knowledge of true marriage, and
polygamy was generally accepted as permissible. Sarah and Abra 
ham had no thought of doing wrong in this story, and they were

== THE BIRTH OF ISAAC

not condemned for this decision by the Lord. Indeed Ishmael, the
son of Abraham by Hagar, was not only preserved, but was prom 
ised that his seed should be a great nation.

However, he was not to be Abraham's heir. Sarah finally gave
birth to a son-Isaac-through whom the line of Abraham was to
be carried on. This line of Abraham pictures our own development
from infancy to adult life. As little children we are simple and
obedient, as Abraham was. But it is not long before we begin to
try to think and reason for ourselves. We parents all know how
"difficult" our children can be while this first reasoning is devel 
oping. They do not have experience enough to see beneath the
surface of things or to realize that what
looks pleasant is not
necessarily good, and they are always sure they are right and their
parents wrong. This is Ishmael. Ishmael was a "wild-ass" man. The
Hebrew word translated merely "wild" in Genesis 16: 12 really
means "wild-ass." Ishmael and his mother both showed the same
this faculty of
disposition we see in our young teenagers. Yet
independent thinking about our external conduct, when put in its
proper place, is a necessary and useful one. The Lord promised
Abraham that Ishmael also should become a great nation although
his place would not be in the Holy Land.

/

The birth of Isaac pictures the birth of a higher type of reason 
ing power which bases its judgments on knowledge of divine truth
and the desire to serve the Lord, instead of upon outward appear 
ances and principles of self-interest. It is from this higher reason
that we are able to progress spiritually.

Primary
Center the story on Ishmael's being sent away because he mocked at the baby
Isaac. Even little children have this tendency to make fun of younger brothers
and sisters and need to be taught to be gentle and kind. The story of both
Ishmael and Isaac will interest the children. They should learn the names
Hagar, Ishmael, and Isaac.

By this time Abraham and Sarah were very old people. Abra 
ham was nearly a hundred years old and Sarah was nearly ninety.

==== GENESIS 21:1-21

The Lord had made a promise to Abraham that his descendants
would inherit the Holy Land and become a great nation, but Sarah
had never had a child. Therefore, as we learned recently, she had
finally given Abraham her Egyptian servant Hagar for his wife, and
Hagar bore him a son, who was named Ishmael.

Abraham loved Ishmael dearly, but

the Lord told him that
Ishmael was not to be his heir, and that Sarah herself should have
a child.

When Ishmael was fourteen, Sarah finally had a son.
What was his name? Isaac means "laughter."
How old was Abraham when Isaac was born?
What did Ishmael do which made Sarah ask Abraham to send him away?
Where did Hagar and Ishmael go?
What promise did the Lord make for Ishmael?

Junior

Have the Juniors find Hebron and Beersheba on a map. Dwell on the story of
Hagar's first dismissal and then of how Ishmael showed the same spirit as his
mother. If the children get clearly in mind the character of Ishmael, they will
more easily understand later the difference in the correspondence of Ishmael
and Isaac. Stress the fact that Isaac was Abraham's heir, but that the Lord
gave Ishmael a promise also.

The Lord had promised Abraham that his descendants should
inherit
the Holy Land and should become a great nation, but
Abraham and Sarah had had no children, and now they were very
old. So Sarah had given her husband her Egyptian servant Hagar.
In the depraved state of religion at that time, it was not considered
wrong to have more than one wife; so Abraham and Sarah were
doing no intentional wrong.

What was the name of the son of Abraham and Hagar?
Why did Sarah want to send Hagar away?
How did the Lord save Hagar?
What did He tell her to do?

Hagar obeyed the Lord and returned to her mistress. The son
who was born to her was named Ishmael. Abraham was very happy

THE BIRTH OF ISAAC

to have this son, but the Lord told him that Ishmael was not to be
his heir, but that Sarah herself would have a son. When he was
ftnally born, Abraham was a hundred years old and Sarah ninety.

What was he named?
How old was Ishmael when Isaac was born?
How can you tell?
What did Ishmael do which made Sarah angry?
Are we ever inclined to make fun of people who may be better than we?

When we do this,
it is because we see only the outside of things
and have not learned to judge wisely. When we are young, we often
get into trouble by just such hasty and foolish judgments. Remem 
ber this when you are tempted to think you know better than
your parents what you ought to do.

Sarah was angry with both Hagar and Ishmael.

What did she ask Abraham to do?
How did Abraham feel about it?
What did the Lord tell him to do?

Parents often have to punish their children when they would much
rather not. Sometimes they even have to send them away from
home. Many children have been sent away to school for this rea 
son. But if we do what is right, the Lord will always take care of
the consequences.

So Abraham sent Hagar and Ishmael away, giving them bread
and water to take with them. Again they went into the wilderness,
but this time Hagar did not ftnd the well herself. When she thought
she and Ishmael were about to die, she wept and, it is recorded,
God heard the voice of the lad (see AC 2691) and "opened her
eyes and she saw a well of water." Do you think Hagar was wan 
dering around with her eyes shut? No, we have other eyes besides
the ones we usually mean when we say "eyes." We have the eyes
of our minds, and these may be shut when our physical eyes are
open. When some hard problem is given us, we sometimes say,
"I don't see the answer to that." And sometimes we shut the eyes
of our minds on purpose, because we just don't want to see. We do
this when we want to have our own way instead of doing what we

==== GENESIS 21:1-21

really know is right. But then, when our own way leads us into
serious trouble, we become humble and anxious for help, just as
Hagar did when she thought she and Ishmael were going to die in
the wilderness. The Lord can open our eyes to see the truth just as
He showed Hagar the well of water.

What did Ishmael become?
What country did his wife come from?
What country had his mother come from?

Intermediate

Young people in their early teens are at the stage when they are beginning to
exercise the natural rational freely. They are, whether openly or in private,
examining the opinions and conduct of their elders from what seems to them
a superior height of knowledge. They are very sure they are right-their
parents are simply behind the times, getting old and dull. Children at this
age are sometimes very disagreeable without realizing it at all, because they
can see no flaws in what their natural reason tells them. It is the "wild-ass"
stage. The Intermediate teacher will do their parents a great service if he can
impress them with the story of Ishmael and Isaac in such a way that they will
see the limitations of Ishmael and why he had to be put in his place and can
be led to realize that there is a higher type of reasoning into which they them 
selves may soon grow if they will. It may be helpful to show them that they
have a promise of this higher faculty in themselves whenever they find them 
selves arguing with their own conscience, for their conscience is the beginning
of their higher reason.

We are told in Genesis 13: 1-2 that when Abram came back from
Egypt, he was very rich "in cattle, in silver, and in gold." This is
a picture of the great treasure of knowledge we acquire when we
are children. It is knowledge of the things of the natural world
and also knowledge of the Bible and of how the Lord wants us to
live. We bring this knowledge back to the land of Canaan-the
Holy Land-when we use the things we have learned in the Lord's
service. Abram settled in the southern part of the land at Hebron,
which became the center of the Jewish Church in its early years.
Like Abram himself, Hebron represents a state of simple, childlike
goodness and obedience.

THE BIRTH OF ISAAC

The Lord had promised that all

the land of Canaan should
belong to Abraham and his descendants, and that they should
become a great nation. Yet Abraham and Sarah were now old and
still had no children. Sarah's giving Abraham her Egyptian servant
Hagar to wife and Abraham's having a son by her was not wrong
in their sight, for it was customary in those times for a man to
have more than one wife. By the time of this third church, the
truths originally given to mankind had been so far forgotten that
nothing was known about true marriage. The Lord did not con 
demn Abraham-He does not condemn us for our unintentional
sins-but He did not continue Abraham's line through Ishmael.

When Abraham was a hundred years old and Sarah was ninety,
the Lord permitted Sarah to bear Abraham a son. The boy was
named Isaac, which means "laughter." Read verse 6 of chapter 21
to learn one reason for this name, but also read verse 19 of chapter
17, which shows that the Lord Himself gave the name. We can well
believe that Abraham and Sarah were joyful when he was born.
Ishmael was fourteen when Isaac was born. We know that many
boys at that age are not much interested in babies. Babies seem to
them very little and weak, and they can't see why people make
such a fuss about them. Ishmael was this kind of boy, and he pic 
tures the kind of reasoning that such a boy uses. To him physical
strength and physical ability meant a great deal, and he was scorn 
ful of weakness.

Just as Hagar had been sent away when she was scornful of
Sarah, so now the same thing happened to Ishmael. Abraham loved
Ishmael and did not want to send him away, but the Lord told him
to obey Sarah. Sarah pictures our love for heavenly things and her
son Isaac pictures a higher type of reasoning power than that pic 
tured by Ishmael, a reasoning which judges according to spiritual
standards instead of natural ones. The "Ishmael" in us would tell
us that we should do the things which will bring us the most
obvious profit now; our "Isaac" would tell us that we should
do the things which will please the Lord and help other people.
Ishmael would call a rich man successful; Isaac would call a good

==== GENESIS 21:1-21

man successful. Ishmael would think of death as a tragedy; Isaac
would think of death as the beginning of real life.

If we want the Isaac type of reasoning to grow in us, we have
to keep Ishmael in his proper place. He is useful to us all our lives
and the Lord wants him to live and prosper, but not to direct our
thinking and acting. We remember that all through the Bible the
Holy Land pictures a heavenly character, while Egypt pictures
mere knowledge in the memory. The wilderness pictures our state
of mind when we do not see anything above the worldly or natural
level and so have no real spiritual home or abiding place, no fixed
foundation from which to think and decide our problems. Our
minds wander about from place to place.

It is said that Ishmael became an archer. Arrows picture argu 
ments. The natural reason is very clever in the use of argument.
Remember this when you are inclined to argue with your mother
or father about something they say you ought or ought not to do.
Can you see why Ishmael married an Egyptian wife? Think how
beautifully all the details in this story fit into the picture as the
internal sense of the Word explains it.

It is often helpful to go back to the fIrst verse of the Bible and point out that
the whole Bible is a study of the development of the heavens and the earth in
man, as a race and as an individual, and that it is our principal business in life
to recognize both and to develop them in their proper relationship. Seniors

THE BIRTH OF ISAAC

are beginning to outgrow the Ishmael stage. They are facing such questions as,
"Can a man be honest and succeed in business?" "Can a girl be popular with 
out 'petting'?" "What is the use of going to college when I might be earning
money now?" These are questions to which the answer of Ishmael is very
loud and positive. We need to do all we can to strengthen the baby Isaac in
them.

Today we come to the fulfillment of the promise made to
Abraham by the Lord. Sarah bears a son, and he is named Isaac.
Abraham was a hundred years old when Isaac was born, and Sarah
was ninety.

In the Scriptures the birth of a son pictures a new development
of truth or a new intellectual faculty. Abraham's first son, Ishmael,
fourteen years older than Isaac, was born to him by Hagar, Sarah's
Egyptian bondservant, and represents our first reasoning power,
born of our observation of the world about us and judging accord 
ing to appearances, without taking spiritual things into consider 
ation. When we are developing this kind of reason, we are very
sure that we are right and are impatient with those who disagree
with us. We like to argue with everybody, and we are scornful
of the ideas and advice of older and wiser people. We may make
ourselves so disagreeable that people avoid us, as Sarah wanted
Ishmael sent away.

But if we believe in the Lord and the Word and really want to
do right,
there comes a time when we begin to see more deeply
into life, and to reason on the basis of the Lord's purposes for us
instead of from merely worldly considerations. This is the birth of
Isaac, whose mother was Sarah, the affection for spiritual things.
Isaac represents the true reasoning power which the Lord intends
to be ruler of our minds. Isaac and not Ishmael was to be Abra 
ham's heir.

Then Ishmael had to be cast out. For instance, when we are
young, we are likely to think that having fun is the object of life
and that bodily strength and ability, good looks, and good clothes
are the most desirable things. We admire "football heroes," good
dancers, those who dress well, those with money to spend. Even

==== GENESIS 21:1-21

It

when we begin to look for deeper qualities, it is often hard for us
to believe that they are not necessarily present in the people and
things we have admired.
is hard for us to put the physical
attractiveness of a person out of the question and to look more
deeply into those things which seem to produce desirable external
results and ask, "Are they based on right principles?" Abraham
grieved because he had to send Ishmael away. Some people never
outgrow the Ishmael stage; they never really grow up spiritually.
They may live good moral lives and even belong to a church and
attend it regularly, but their idea of doing good, both for them 
selves and for their church, never gets beyond externals, the things
which are called good in a worldly sense. They are scornful of
those who dare to question the actual "goodness" of what they
propose.

Ishmael mocked Isaac, just as Hagar earlier had scorned Sarah.
Our natural reasoning power looks askance at spiritual things and
makes fun of them. So if our spiritual reasoning faculty is to
develop, the lower must be thrust out. This is hard to do, and at
first it may seem about to die altogether. But it is not to die. Our
lower reasoning power-the "natural rational," as Swedenborg calls
it~is useful in its proper place. When we recognize that it is help 
less by itself and must look to the Lord in the Word for life and
guidance,
it can see the truth. When Hagar saw that she and her
son were about to die and wept in despair, the Lord opened her
eyes to see the well of water in the wilderness.

From that time on Ishmael, protected by the Lord, prospered.
The fact that his mother took him a wife from the land of Egypt
is quite proper in the internal meaning, for the affection for natural
knowledge is the true "wife" of the natural rational faculty. He
continued to dwell in the wilderness because the natural reason is
concerned with many different natural fields and has no fixed
abiding place. He was an archer, because arrows picture arguments
and the natural reason is interested in argument concerning exter 
nal things. But the Ishmaelites continue to play an important role
in the Bible story. Our natural reason, properly placed, is strong

THE BIRTH OF ISAAC

and useful, helping us to make our way in the world, to defend
ourselves and others, to master those things which are necessary to
our natural life and to our occupations and to confirm spiritual
things by what we experience in the world. The truly good man
bases his thinking and acting upon what the Lord teaches him in
the Word, but he does not withdraw from the world and live in
a world of dreams. He lives a useful, practical life from love to
the Lord and the neighbor, thinking always what the Lord would
have him do rather than what will bring him the praise of men.

Adult

The lesson should center on the nature of the natural and spiritual rationals
and the difference between them. Ishmael is the reasoning that is born of the
world, Isaac the reasoning that is born of the church.

Our writings tell us that we commit sin only when we do what
we know or believe to be wrong. When we do wrong, believing that
we are doing right,
the inevitable external consequences follow,
but our souls are not injured. The Lord is always striving to keep
us from destroying our spiritual life; so when He sees that men are
no longer able to resist certain evils, He takes away the knowledge
that these things are wrong, and lets them live under lower stan 
dards in order that they may still be able to choose to do what
they believe is right and save themselves from hell, if they will.
The Hebrew nation began after men had degenerated to such a
degree that the inner planes of their minds had been closed and
they thought only of this world, and not at all of spiritual things.
All spiritual knowledge had thus been taken from them and many
things seemed right which the people of the Most Ancient and
Ancient churches had known to be wrong. One of these things was
marriage with more than one wife. This is why the Old Testament
Scriptures contain so many instances of multiple marriage. We
should understand this in order that we may not be troubled by
the question of why the Lord permitted such things to become
part of the Bible. Abraham and Sarah did no conscious wrong

==== GENESI S 21: 1-21

when Abraham, at Sarah's prompting, took Hagar to wife. They
were old and had had no children and the carrying on of their
family meant a great deal to them, especially in view of the Lord's
promise that Abraham's seed should inherit the land of Canaan
and should become a mighty nation.

But in the Lord's sight the son of the Egyptian bondwoman was
not a proper heir for Abraham, and fourteen years later the Lord
performed a miracle and permitted Sarah, then ninety years old,
to bear Abraham a son. When, on the day when Isaac was weaned,
Ishmael mocked at him, Sarah was more clear-sighted than Abra 
ham. Abraham's love for his first son would have prompted him
to keep Ishmael in the home, but the Lord told him to obey Sarah
and send Hagar and Ishmael away.

the celestial,

In general Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob picture the development
of three planes in our lives:
the spiritual, and the
natural. When we are babies, we live in a celestial state-although
we have no real knowledge or understanding of it-in which we are
close to the Lord (Matthew 18: 10) and depend wholly upon His
care without thinking for ourselves or trying to govern ourselves.
This is the period represented by Abraham. Then comes a time
when our reasoning faculty begins to develop. This general period
is represented by Ishmael and Isaac. Then follows the period when
we have to carry out our ideas in the conduct of our daily life and
occupations-make them practical, or put them into practice. This
period, the hardest of all,
is represented by Jacob and his sons.
We must pass through all these stages of development before we
are really ready for the work of regeneration.

Isaac, when he is grown up and has become the head of his
family, represents our reason when it is fully and rightly developed,
but this does not come all at once. When a child first begins to use
his reason, he makes a great ~any mistakes because he has only
superficial knowledge to draw upon and because he is proud of
his new faculty and unwilling to admit that others may know more

reasoning power, as well as our higher reason, comes to us from
the Lord in the course of our normal development. But Ishmael's
mother was an Egyptian bondwoman. We recall that women rep 
resent the affections and that Egypt represents external or mem 
ory knowledge, a purely natural affection. All children at a certain
age are eager to learn all sorts of things, to fill their minds with
information of various kinds without discrimination, and their
first reasoning faculty springs from this affection and is fed by the
material which they gather into their memories. But Hagar was
only a bondwoman. This pictures the fact that the mere affection
for learning is not the true affection from which our thoughts and
feelings should spring, but only one of the servants of that affec 
tion, and that it should be kept in control and not permitted to
set itself up. If it is not kept in its place, it easily becomes scornful
of spiritual things. So first Hagar and then both Hagar and Ishmael
had to be sent away to make room for Abraham's true heir.

Yet both times the Lord preserved Hagar and her child. The
love of learning and the reasoning which springs from it are both
orderly and useful
in their place. Ishmael married an Egyptian
woman. That is, our natural reason-or natural rational, as Sweden 
borg calls it-not only springs from an affection for natural knowl 
edges, but this affection is its proper "wife" from which its further
developments come. Ishmael became a great nation, but he dwelt
in the wilderness of Paran, the Arabian desert. Our natural rational
continues to develop and to function throughout our lives, but its
field of usefulness is in the constantly changing environs of our
external lives, and not in the Holy Land of our inner thought and
feeling. Our spiritual development is carried on through the higher
rational, the spiritual rational, which is represented by Isaac, the
son of Abraham by his true wife Sarah, who represents the affec 
tion for spiritual truth.

Ishmael has his place in our lives. The Lord gives us our natural
rational and wishes it to develop and to serve in our outer lives:
prudence, thrift, foresight, executive ability, salesmanship are all
"children" of Ishmael; they are useful and worth cultivating so

==== GENESIS 21:1-21

long as they are recognized as servants and not considered spiritual
virtues or allowed to interfere with our spiritual life and develop 
ment. The Lord said to Abraham, "In Isaac shall thy seed be
called." The spiritual rational is later in developing-Isaac could
is the
not be born until Abraham and Sarah were old-but it
thoughts and affections which spring from it-Isaac's descendants 
which connect us with the Lord and enable us ultimately to possess
the Holy Land of heavenly happiness.

Examples of the distinction between Ishmael and Isaac in our
own experience are not hard to find. Ishmael tells us that we are
in this world for only a short time and that therefore we should
get as much as possible for ourselves from it in pleasure, in money,
and in fame. Isaac also tells us that we are in this world for only
a short time, but he tells us that we shall live to eternity in a world
wh~re nothing counts but the character we have developed here,
and that therefore it makes little difference whether or not we
have pleasure, money, and fame here so long as we are developing
heavenly character. Ishmael uses many sharp arguments to uphold
the necessity for considering self first-he was an archer. Isaac is
quiet and gentle, at home in the Holy Land, seeking to learn the
Lord's will and to base the daily decisions upon that will. He takes
his wife from among his father's kindred. He does not contend
for the wells of the Philistines. He is forbidden by the Lord to go
down into Egypt. The spiritual rational must maintain its integrity
against all worldly temptations if our spiritual life is to be pre 
served.

From the Writings of Swedenborg
Arcana Coelestia, n. 2654: "The human rational-that namely which has its
birth from worldly things through impressions of sense, and afterwards from
analogies of worldly things by means of knowledges-is ready to laugh and
mock if told that it does not live of itself, but only appears to live so; and
that one lives the more, that is, the more wisely and intelligently, and the
more blissfully and happily, the less he believes that he lives of himself; and
that this is the life of angels, especially of those who are celestial, and inmost,

or nearest to the Lord; for they know that no one lives of himself except
. .. This rational would mock if it were said
Jehovah alone, that is, the Lord.
that in heaven the greatest are they who are least, the wisest they who believe
and perceive themselves to be the least wise, and the happiest they who desire
others to be the most happy, and themselves the least so; that it is heaven to
wish to be below all, but hell to wish to be above all; consequently that in
the glory of heaven there is absolutely nothing the same as in the glory of
the world."

Review the last lesson. Remind the children that the Lord had
promised Abraham that his descendants should inherit the land.
This makes a good background for the story of how Abraham and
Sarah longed for a son and were given Isaac in their old age. It will
show how much depended upon Isaac, and how dear he was to
Abraham.

Doctrinal Points
The Lord never tempts us. Temptation comes from our selfish
desires. The Lord merely permits temptation to come when we
make it necessary.

The Word is written in the language of appearances in order to

reach the evil as well as the good.

Our first faith in the Lord is often mixed up with a lot of false

ideas.

The Lord will always give us the power to do right if we persist
in obeying His commands as we are given to see them from the
Word.

Notes for Parents

The Lord performed a miracle for Abraham and Sarah, enabling
Sarah to bear a son when she was ninety years old and Abraham
a hundred. By command of the Lord the boy was named Isaac,
which means "laughter." (Read Genesis 17:15-19; 21:3,6.) Nat 
urally Isaac was deeply loved by his parents. But when he was
still a young boy, a strange idea came into Abraham's mind. He
believed it came from God, and so the Bible says, "God did tempt
Abraham." We all tend to think that our troubles are "sent" by
the Lord. Really they are always the result of evils either in us or
in other people, and the Lord saves us from all but those He sees

may help us to learn lessons we need.

The people from whom Abraham came and the people living
about him in Canaan believed the Lord to be a "jealous" God who
needed to be pacified by sacrifices of animals, and sometimes by
the sacrifice of their own children. Abraham naturally had many
such false ideas in his own mind. So his desire to prove his com 
plete devotion to the Lord took the form of the thought that he
to sacrifice his dearest possession, which was Isaac. The
ought
story of his journey and of how the Lord stopped him at the last
moment is our lesson for today. Read again verse 12 of chapter 22
to see why the Lord permitted Abraham to go almost to the point
of the actual killing of his son.

We are told in the writings of Swedenborg that the people of the
corrupted Ancient Church had the idea of sacrifice so ingrained
in their minds that the best the Lord could do for them and for
the church which followed was to teach them to sacrifice animals
instead of human beings. That is one reason why the letter of the
Old Testament is so full of laws regarding the birds and animals
to be offered. But we should know that all these animals and birds
and all the details of the laws for their offering represent spiritual
things, and that even the word sacrifice does not mean to kill or
even to "give up," but rather to "make holy." When we live our
lives from day to day in love to the Lord and the neighbor, we are
making the sacrifices commanded in the Word.

It is interesting to know that Mount Moriah, where Abraham
went for his sacrifice, was the hill which long afterward became
part of the city of Jerusalem and which was the site on which
Solomon built the Temple.

Primary

Isaac is the name to be remembered by the little children, and they can
understand that his father Abraham loved him very much. Tell the story very
simply, dwelling on Abraham's desire to serve the Lord even if it meant giving
up the dearest thing he had, and dwelling on the Lord's goodness in saving
him from making a mistake, and in giving Isaac back to him. Point out that

==== GENESIS 22:1-14

we are often mistaken, even when we mean to do right, and that the Lord
always sees our good intention and tries to help us not to make mistakes,
because mistakes can do a great deal of harm. Review the meaning of an altar.
In addition to the name Isaac, they should be impressed with the name He 
bron as Abraham's home, and with Mount Moriah as the place of his sacrifice.

After Abram and Lot separated, Abram and his wife Sarai went
to live in the southern part of the Holy Land, making their home
at a place called Hebron. Abram obeyed the Lord in everything,
so that
the Lord even changed his name and that of Sarai by
putting into each a letter from His own name to show how close
they were to Him. This was the letter h. So their names became
Abraham and Sarah, and this is the way they are remembered.
And finally the Lord gave them the one thing they wanted and
did not have-a son. They were both very old when this son was
born; so he was all the more dear to them. His name was Isaac.
Isaac means "laughter."

But while Isaac was still a young boy, a strange idea came to
Abraham. He was so grateful to the Lord that he felt he ought to
prove it, and so he decided that the only way really to prove it
was to give up to the Lord his very dearest possession.

What was his dearest possession?
In those days people thought that in order to give anything to the Lord
they had to kill it and burn it upon an altar.
This was called making a "sacrifice."
Where did Abraham go to sacrifice Isaac?
Try to remember the name of this place, because you will hear of it again.
Abraham did not tell Isaac what he was planning to do.
What did Isaac ask him on the way up the mountain?
What did Abraham answer?
When he was about to sacrifice Isaac, who stopped him?
What did the Lord say?
What did Abraham find at hand to sacrifice instead of Isaac?

Abraham was very happy that he was allowed to keep Isaac,
and Isaac grew up to be a very great man like his father. We all
make mistakes sometimes, but if we are trying to do right,
the
Lord can help us and keep us from doing real harm. We must
remember, however, that He cannot help us unless we are always

THE SACRIFICE OF ISAAC

trying to learn more and more about what is really right from the
Word.

Junior
Follow the Junior notes, stressing the geography. Have the class locate Bethel,
Hebron, and Mount Moriah. Stress the true meaning of the word sacrifice,
and explain how it was that Abraham could think that the Lord wanted him
to kill Isaac. Make clear to them that what the Lord does want us to give up
are those things which stand in the way of our doing right, and that we love
the Lord as Abraham did when we put doing right above having our own way.

Where did Abraham come from?
Why did he leave there?
Where did he go?
Who went with him?
Where did his brother Nahor stop?
Who was Abraham's wife?

After his separation from Lot at Bethel, Abram went farther
south and settled in Hebron. There he was regarded as a great man.
The Lord blessed him and changed his name to Abraham. In the
Hebrew language every letter is important. The letter represented
by our h is one of the letters in the name Jehovah. Adding it to
Abram's name meant that he was especially devoted to the Lord.
The name of Abram's wife, Sarai, was also changed by adding an h:
she became Sarah.

Abraham lacked one thing: a son to inherit all his possessions.
Sarah, because she loved Abraham, offered him her Egyptian hand 
maid, Hagar, for another wife. In the depraved state of religion at
that time, men thought it was permissible to have more than one
wife. So by Hagar, Abraham had a son whom he named Ishmael.
But
it was not right that Ishmael
should be his heir, and finally gave him a son by his true wife,
Sarah. This son was named Isaac. His birth was a miracle, for
Abraham was a hundred years old, and Sarah ninety, when Isaac
was born. We can imagine how dearly Abraham loved Isaac.

the Lord told Abraham that

Then a great temptation came to Abraham. The 'Scripture says,

thing about
the Bible which we shall often need to remember.
The Lord wrote the Bible by means of men, and used in its letter
the things that were in their minds. Sometimes their minds could
understand what He meant, and then the truth could be expressed
clearly. But often their minds contained false ideas which partially
hid the truth, just as a cloud hides the sun and yet lets some of its
light shine through. Clouds in the Scriptures represent the letter
of the Word. You can see how this is. You know that your parents
love you dearly all the time. But when you are bent on doing
wrong, and their love has to take the form of checking and even
of punishing you, you feel that they do not love you. Abraham
had been brought up among idol-worshipers who believed that the
gods envied them their dearest possessions and could be made
happy by the sacrifice of animals and even of children. Abraham
loved the Lord and wanted to serve Him wholly. Thus he was
prompted to sacrifice the dearest thing he had, which was Isaac.
He thought
the prompting came from the Lord. His desire did
come from the Lord, but the form it took came from his own
mind.

Where did they go for the sacrifice?

This is thought to be the very Mount Moriah in Jerusalem where
the Temple was built long afterward.

Who went with them?
What beast of burden did they take?
How long did the journey take?
What happened at the foot of the mountain?
What did they take with them up the mountain?
What did Isaac ask his father?
What did Abraham reply?

The Lord was pleased with Abraham's devotion and with his
willingness to sacrifice his dearest possession. He let Abraham
prove his sincerity by taking the long, three-day journey, climbing
the mountain, and even making all
the final preparations and
raising the knife. Then He showed Abraham that Isaac was to be
spared.

THE SACRIFICE OF ISAAC

What did He provide for the sacrifice?

Abraham had to be allowed to give expression in his own way to
his good desire.

Read Micah 6: 6-8 and Psalm 51: 16-17, and see what the Lord
really wants us to do for Him in the way of sacrifice. The word
"sacrifice" comes from two Latin words and means "to make
sacred." The Lord has made the world and everything in it for
our use and enjoyment, but He does want us to sacrifice-that is,
to "make sacred"-all that He gives us by using our talents and
our possessions in service to Him and to our neighbor. The people
of Old Testament days were allowed to sacrifice animals and birds
and meal and oil because these things represented good affections
and thoughts.

Isaac grew ~p and became the second great "patriarch" or father
of the Hebrews. Abraham knew that Isaac should not be allowed
to marry one of the women of the land in which they now lived.
So he sent his chief servant to Haran to get a wife for Isaac from
among his own people.

Where was Haran?
Who had settled there?

We shall study next
the beautiful story of the servant's journey
to Haran and of how he was led by the Lord to choose the right
woman. He brought back with him Rebekah, the granddaughter
of Abraham's brother Nahor, as a wife for Isaac. Ishmael married
an Egyptian woman and settled in the wilderness of Paran, and
became the father of the Ishmaelites, about whom we read in the
Bible and who are probably the ancestors of the Arabs of our time.
But Isaac inherited the Holy Land.

Intermediate

The meaning of Isaac, and the meaning of Abraham's temptation and the
reason for it, should be stressed. The outline of the correspondence of his
journey and its conclusion can be given. The thought to leave in the minds
of the pupils is that of the true meaning of sacrifice.

==== GENESI S 22: 1-14

The Lord had promised that all

the land of Canaan should
belong to the descendants of Abraham. Yet Abraham and Sarah
were very old and still had no son. Chapter 16 of Genesis tells how
Sarah was troubled by this and offered Abraham her handmaid,
Hagar, in the hope that Hagar might bear him a son. Abraham had
grown up among the corrupt descendants of the Ancient Church
and had many false ideas in his mind. One of these was that it was
allowable for a man to have more than one wife. This is even today
the belief in many of the nations whose religion has come down
from that time. Hagar did bear Abraham a son, who was named
Ishmael, but the Lord told him that Ishmael should not be his heir;
and in their old age Sarah bore Isaac.

Abraham was the beginning of a new church-a church on the
natural plane of life. The story of Abraham in general pictures our
very early childhood when we look to our parents for everything
and know only that it is wrong to disobey them. With Ishmael and
the period in which we
Isaac a new period in our lives begins:
begin to think for ourselves and to reason about right and wrong.
At first our reasoning is based only on what Swedenborg calls
"appearances"-how things look. If a thing seems pleasant, we
judge that it is right. But later we develop a higher kind of reason 
ing based on what
the Lord tells us in the Word. These two are
called the "natural" reason and the "spiritual" reason. Ishmael
represents the first and· Isaac the second. Ishmael mocked Isaac
and had to be sent away to live in the wilderness, while Isaac
inherited the Holy Land. We have to keep Ishmael in his place and
to recognize that it is Isaac through whom the good life must be
developed.

Now we come to our lesson for today. When Isaac was still a
young boy, it is said that "God did tempt Abraham." We need
to know that the Bible is written for the most part in terms of
"appearances" of truth-that is, truth as it seems to our limited
human minds. Abraham, like many people, believed that God was
directly responsible for everything that came to him, both good
and evil. You hear people say, "Why did God send this trial to

– Anita Dole Bible Study Notes Volume 1 –© 2001 by The Swedenborg Foundation. Scanned by Bayside Church. Used on www.newchurchvineyard.org by permission.

THE SACRIFICE OF ISAAC

me?" But God does not tempt us. The bad things that come to us,
and all our temptations, come from evil either in ourselves or in
others. Actually the Lord withholds us from many tern ptations 
from every temptation which He sees we are not strong enough
to resist. But we grow by doing hard things; so He lets us feel the
consequences of our bad feelings and wrong thoughts as far as we
are really able to learn from them. This is temptation. You know
that if your mother and father did everything for you and never
let you do anything for yourself, you would not grow up to be
a very strong person in character.

What really happened with Abraham was this: He wanted to
serve the Lord wholly; he had in his mind the idea, which came
from thereligion in which he had been brought up,
that sacrifices
of animals and even of human beings were pleasing to God; so
the desire to show his devotion to the Lord took the form of the
thought that he ought to/sacrifice his dearest possession, which was
Isaac. The Lord permitted this thought to come to his mind and
permitted him to go a long way toward carrying it out, because
it was useful for Abraham to prove the sincerity of his devotion
to the Lord. Their journey took three days, which is a picture of
completeness of any state, and the place to which they went was
Mount Moriah, which was later to be the site of Solomon's temple
within the city of Jerusalem. That is, Abraham's desire to serve the
Lord wholly took him finally to a state which was to become the
highest state his people would reach. First he "rose up early in the
morning" (the morning picturing the beginning of a new state);
then he "saddled his ass" (got control of his natural ideas-the
meaning of the ass-which otherwise would perhaps have borne
him in another direction); then he took the'wood (the feeling that
he was doing right), and two of his young men (thoughts that he
had about the way to do right), and Isaac (his higher reasoning
faculty, which was still very young). But when he reached Mount
Moriah, he left the ass and the young men behind him, and in
addition to Isaac and the wood, he took fire and a knife, which
picture love and truth, up to the top with him, and there he built

==== GENESIS 22: 1-14

his altar. When we want to do something good, we often start with
very imperfect ideas of how to do it; but if we persevere, gradually
our feelings and thoughts become purer, and when we get really
to the point of doing the thing,
the Lord sometimes shows us
suddenly a much better thing to do. Perhaps you have not had
such an experience yet, but you will have; and when you do, you
will remember how the Lord stopped Abraham just as he had
raised the knife to slay his son, and showed him instead the ram
which had been caught in the thicket by its horns. To slay Isaac
would have been a wrong thing:
it would picture destroying our
higher rational faculty; that is, ceasing to think and reason about
our religion. But the ram pictures a kind of love of truth which is
innocent-a reasoning which does not destroy our God-given minds
but lifts them up into true service of the Lord. This ram had been
caught in a thicket, and Swedenborg tells us that a thicket pictures
natural ideas.

Here is an example which will help you to understand what this
story means. We have recently read the first eleven chapters of the
Bible. Natural ideas about the Bible lead us to question the truth
of the stories in those chapters; and if that is all we have, we must
either give up our belief in the Bible or refuse to think and reason
about it. Our love of truth is "tangled in the thicket," and wc arc
about to "sacrifice Isaac" in order to prove our devotion to the
Lord. But with the help of the new knowledge the Lord has given
us of the true meaning of the Bible, we can untangle thc ram
and lift it up on the altar as an offering to the Lord. The word
sacrifice means "to make sacred." All our faculties are given us to
use, but to use in the service of the Lord and under his guidance.

Basic Correspondences

the ass = the natural reason
the ram = truth which is strong
because it is innocent

Senior
The meaning of Isaac is important for young people as well as the difference
between Ishmael and Isaac. Point out to them that fundamentalist sects actu 
ally make the sacrifice of Isaac-they give up rational thinking-in order to
keep their loyalty to the Lord, and that their devotion is to be praised even
while we reject their doctrines.

In the Scriptures, the birth of a son pictures a new development
of truth or a new intellectual faculty. Abraham, we have seen, rep 
resents the simple state of obedience of our very early childhood.
Abraham's first son, Ishmael, was the son of Hagar the Egyptian
servant, and represents our first
reasoning power which judges
according to appearances and does not take spiritual things into
consideration. When we are developing this kind of reason, we are
very sure that we are right, and we are impatient with those who
differ with us. We like to argue with everybody, and we are scorn 
ful of the ideas and advice of older people. We may even make
ourselves so disagreeable that people avoid us. This lower reasoning
power is a necessary and useful faculty, but it cannot live in the
Holy Land: it must be separated from the higher, spiritual reason
pictured by Isaac.

Isaac was born when Ishmael was fourteen years old, and he was
the son of Sarah, born when Sarah was ninety and Abraham was
a hundred. Sarah was Abraham's true wife, and represents the
affection for spiritual

truth.

The story of Abraham's attempt to sacrifice Isaac has troubled
many because in the letter we are told that God tempted Abraham,
and that He told him to offer Isaac as a burnt offering.

Does God tempt us? We should realize that much of the letter of
the Word is written according to what Swedenborg calls "appear 
in writing the Word, used the minds
ances" of truth. The Lord,

==== GENESIS 22: 1-14

of men just as they were. Sometimes they could understand His
meaning and express it clearly. But often falsities in their minds
or evil desires in their hearts clouded the truth or turned it into its
opposite. When we are in good states, we can see and understand
that the Lord loves us, but when we are bent on going our own
way, or when our minds cling to some false idea, even our good
impulses, which we know come from the Lord, are turned in our
minds to wrong forms of expression. So the letter of the Word
took its form according to the states of mind and heart of those
through whom the Lord gave it, and sometimes it appears to say
opposite things.

Abraham, we remember, was brought up among idolaters who
were in the habit of sacrificing animals-and sometimes even their
children-in the effort to please and propitiate their gods. So when
Abraham was moved to show his complete devotion to the Lord,
it seemed to him that he was called upon to sacrifice his dearest
possession, his son and heir. This same mistaken idea of sacrifice
is not uncommon even among Christians. It appears in the idea
that we ought to give up anything we really enjoy, or that anything
we like very much is bound to be wrong. The Lord made the world
and everything in it for our use and enjoyment, and does not want
us to give up anything that is good for us. But He does want us to
"sacrifice," that is, to "make sacred," all He gives us by using aU
things rightly in service to Him and to the neighbor.

In its inner meaning, the story has a very clear application for
in
all of us. A son pictures a new development of truth. Isaac,
particular, represents the "spiritual rational," our higher reasoning
power. We like to think of this as our own, and Abraham's prompt 
ing to give up Isaac pictures our recognition that our reasoning
power, like every other good thing in us, is not really our own, but
the Lord's in us. Sometimes people, recognizing this, are tempted
to give up trying to reason about religion. This is like killing Isaac.
But the Lord does not want this. He has given us our reason to use,
and wants us to use it freely, but it should be directed by His truth
into the paths of service. Our understanding of how to do the

THE SACRIFICE OF ISAAC

Lord's will has been confused by false ideas and ideals in the world
about us; it is like the ram caught in the thicket by the horns. We
need to save Isaac alive and sacrifice the ram-that is, to continue
to use our reason, but to submit our ideas of what is good and
useful to the guidance of the Lord's truth. We have all had the
experience of trying to help someone, and finding that we have
done more harm than good. Our intention was good, but we lacked
the wisdom to carry it out effectively. This is just why we need to
develop and use our "spiritual rational" by studying die Word and
the teachings of the church, and basing our thoughts and actions
on a true knowledge of the Lord and of His purposes.

Adult

There are many good topics for discussion in this lesson: the nature of the
the false ideas of marriage and of worship which were in
higher rational,
Abraham's mind, the Lord's permission of falsity in order to preserve the
good intention, the true meaning of sacrifice.

We should have in mind that the first rational we develop in our
childhood, represented by Ishmael, is what is called the "natural
rational"-that is, it is the reasoning which bases its conclusions
on natural knowledges (Hagar the Egyptian servant represents the
affection for memory-knowledges), or sense experience, and on
the outward appearance of things. It is a necessary step in our
development and a necessary faculty all through our lives, since
we must live practical lives in a finite world; and Ishmael, although
he was banished from the Holy Land, became the father of a
great nation.

Isaac represents the higher or spiritual rational,

the rational
which takes into account the Lord and spiritual things and recog 
nizes that
the outward appearance may be the opposite of the
truth. Although Abraham was one hundred years old when Isaac
was born, he continued to live for another seventy-five years; so
Isaac was a long time in coming into his full inheritance. The
spiritual rational is slow in developing, and for a long time must

be kept close to childhood innocence and trust. Young people,
when they begin to develop the ability to reason about spiritual
things, need the protection of their early states of belief and won 
der which the Lord has stored up in them as "remains." And there
is a point in the life of every child who is developing in the right
direction at which he feels the temptation described in our story
for today: the temptation to give up his newly discovered faculty
of reasoning about spiritual things, lest it interfere with his child 
hood faith. In the churches about us in the world, there are many
conscientious young people who make just this decision; and some
churches encourage it, teaching that there are "mysteries" which
we are not meant
to understand and must accept "on faith."
Still others "sacrifice Isaac" in an easier and less conscientious
way by promoting the idea that "it does not matter what you
believe so long as you live well," discarding all real thought about
spiritual things in favor of mere external good works.

The literal sense of this brief story raises some basic questions.
It is said that "God did tempt Abraham." In the New Church we
know that God never tempts, that all temptation comes from the
hells and is the result of evils in our inheritance or in our environ 
ment or resulting from our own sins. We also know that the Lord
never permits a temptation to present itself to us except as He
sees that we are able to resist it with His help, if we will (see
I Cor. 10: 13). He constantly withholds all other temptations from
us. Read, in this regard, the excerpt from the writings at the end
of this chapter.

But we all tend to blame the Lord for all our troubles, tacitly
if not openly. With Abraham this tendency was very natural. We
have seen that he grew up among the people of the Ancient Church
in its last perverted stage. He had many falsities in his mind. One
of them was the belief that multiple marriages were permissible;
hence his acceptance of Hagar. Another was the thought that God
was a jealous God and needed to be propitiated. And another was
the idea that it was laudable to sacrifice one's child, that this was
the supreme sacrifice and hence must be especially pleasing to

THE SACRIFICE OF ISAAC

God. We are told that
the Lord never destroys falsities in our
minds until we are ready to receive the truth in their place. Read
the parable in Matthew 12:43-45. We are also told that He uses
the falsities in which we are brought up so far as they can be made
serviceable to keeping us in orderly living and capable of advancing
into a knowledge of truth. This He did with Abraham. In the case
of his temptation to sacrifice Isaac the Lord allowed him to go
through with it to the point of the very act in order that he might
be confirmed in his intention of putting the Lord first in his life,
and could be shown that this intention was the real sacrifice which
the Lord desired. The ram represents "the spiritual from the
human race," which is devotion to the Lord developed through
conscience. And the ram was found "behind him" and was "caught
in a thicket by his horns"; with Abraham this spiritual had been
"entangled in natural knowledge" (AC 2831).

Once we have grasped the general meaning of the story, every
detail of Abraham's journey to Mount Moriah-the mount on
which later Solomon's temple was built-becomes full of meaning
for us. "Abraham rose up early in the morning and saddled his
ass." Morning pictures the beginning of a new state and the ass
pictures our natural reason. Abraham, having conceived a new
purpose, acted upon it at once and began by bringing under con 
trol that faculty which so often rebels against our higher, spiritual
promptings, but which can be made to serve them if our resolution
is firm. This idea is further carried out in his taking the two young
men, his servants, who picture the rational faculties already devel 
oped for service in his daily problems. "And he clave the wood of
the burnt offering." Wood, Swedenborg says (AC 2784), pictures
"the good that is in works, and in justice," and the cleaving of
wood pictures placing merit in this good. The placing of merit in
one's own good works-except by the Lord in whom is all merit 
is in itself an evil, but it can be made to serve a use when the end
sought is the burnt offering, a genuine desire to serve the Lord.
But when the mountain was in sight, the two young men and the
ass were left behind to wait, and the wood was carried up the

==== GENESI S 22: 1-14

mountain by Isaac. So we, when we are prompted to some new
dedication of our lives to the Lord, often start out with very
thoughts about what our service will be and even with
natural
a good deal of self-praise; but
if we persevere-the three days'
journey pictures a fully developed state-the mountain does come
in sight, and we leave our natural selfish thoughts and reasonings
behind, and our new spiritual thought bears the credit for our
good deeds up the mountain to the Lord. And the whole experi 
ence is then crowned by the realization that to consecrate our
reasoning powers to the Lord does not mean to give them up,
but to find blessing and fulfillment through them (verses 15-18).
And after this realization we can safely return to the exercise of
our natural reasoning faculty in our daily activities. "So Abraham
returned to his young men, and they rose up and went together
to Beersheba." Beersheba signifies "the doctrine of charity and
faith which was Divine and to which human rational things were
adjoined" (AC 2858).

the most grievous and inmost

In AC 2767-2859 Swedenborg gives the interpretation of this
whole story in its inmost sense, relating to the Lord's life. He
shows us how the Lord admitted temptation through His human
rational to the very utmost. In AC 2786 we read: "As regards the
state itself, it is ... the state which the Lord assumed when He
underwent temptations, and here that which he assumed when He
underwent
temptations. His first
preparation for that state was that He entered into a state of peace
and innocence, and that He prepared the natural man in Himself,
as also the rational, so that they should serve the Divine rational,
and that He adjoined the merit of righteousness, and in this man 
ner elevated Himself." And in AC 2795 we read: "The Lord could
not be tempted at all when He was in the Divine Itself, for the
Divine is infinitely above all temptation; but He could be tempted
as to His human. This is the reason why when He was to undergo
the most grievous and inmost temptations, He adjoined to Himself
the rational and the natural of it, as
the prior human,
described in verse 3; and why He afterwards separated Himself

from these." An interesting statement is found in AC 2816: "It is
the Lord's Divine led His
according to the internal sense,
Human into the most grievous temptations." We may think of this
when we pray "Lead us not into temptation." The Lord had power
to overcome every temptation and so "led" Himself into them.
The form of our prayer suggests that we recognize that we have
no power of ourselves, and would flee temptation as far as the
Lord sees it to be possible. AC 2819 is a wonderful summary of
the whole doctrine concerning temptation.

From the Writings of Swedenborg
Arcana Coelestia, n. 2768: "Its being said that 'God did tempt,' is according
to the sense of the letter, in which temptations and many other things are
attributed to God; but it is according to the internal sense that God tempts
no one; but in the time of temptations is continually liberating from them,
as far as possible, or as far a& the liberation does no harm, and is continually
looking to the good into which He is leading him who is in the temptations;
for God never takes part in temptations in any other manner; and though it is
predicated of Him that He permits, still it is not according to the idea which
man has of permission, namely, that by permitting He concurs. Man cannot
comprehend it in any other manner than that he who permits is also willing;
but it is the evil within the man which causes, and even leads into the temp 
tation; and no cause of this is in God-as the cause is not in the king or in the
judge, when a man does evil and suffers punishment therefor. For he who
separates himself from the laws of Divine order, all of which are the hiws of
good and thence of truth, casts himself into the laws that are opposite to
Divine order, which are those of evil and falsity, and thence of punishments
and torments."

Notes for Parents

For Sarah and Abraham the Lord performed a miracle,
for
Abraham was a hundred years old and Sarah over ninety when
Isaac was born. The name Isaac means "laughter" and we read that
Sarah said "God hath made me to laugh, so that all that hear will
laugh with me." Ishmael was fourteen when Isaac was born, and
because he mocked at the baby, he and his mother were sent away
to live in the wilderness, where Ishmael became the father of a
numerous people, mentioned several times in the Bible as the Ish 
maelites. Sarah and Abraham both lived to see Isaac grow up, for
Sarah lived to be a hundred and twenty-seven, and Abraham was
a hundred and seventy-five when he died.

It was after Sarah's death that Abraham sent his servant on the
long journey to Haran to get a wife for Isaac from among the
descendants of his own brother Nahor. The story of Rebekah at
the well is a well-known one. It may seem to us today a strange
way of choosing a wife, but it had in it all the elements which
really make for a happy marriage. The principal one was trust in

==== GENESIS 24

the Lord. Abraham was obeying the Lord in not allowing his son
to marry a woman of different religious standards from his own.
The servant asked the Lord's guidance in the discovery of the right
maiden. Rebekah's family and Rebekah herself accepted what they
believed to be the Lord's will, and Isaac received the wife so chosen
without question. There would be fewer broken homes today if
parents brought up their children to think of marriage as a holy
state to be prepared for and entered into under the Lord's guid 
ance and with the desire and intention to serve Him. Parents today
do not choose mates for their children, but they can do much to
prepare them to make wise choices for themselves.

Primary
This is a long chapter and is difficult to cut to a suitable reading for younger
children. Interrupt the reading at each break in the continuity and tell briefly
the part of the story which has been omitted. Parents reading with the family
at home are urged to read the whole chapter aloud, but not all at once.

Abraham loved his son Ishmael, but the Lord told him that he
was to have another son who would be the child of his true wife
Sarah. So when Ishmael was fourteen years old, Sarah had a son.
He was named Isaac, which means "laughter."

After Isaac grew up and his mother Sarah had died, Abraham
sent his servant to Haran, where Abraham's brother Nahor had
settled, to get a wife for Isaac from among his own relatives. The
servant took ten camels with him on the journey, as well as pres 
ents to give to his master's future wife and her family.

Where did the servant stop near the city of Haran?
What did he ask of the Lord?
What maiden did the Lord show him was to be Isaac's wife?
Who was Rebekah?
Her parents and her brother Laban welcomed Abraham's servant.
They felt that the Lord had chosen Rebekah for Isaac and so they were
willing to let her go.
Rebekah was willing also.
Where was Isaac when he first saw Rebekah?
Was he satisfied with the wife the servant had brought him?

Junior
In connection with this lesson fIx in the children's minds the origin of the
"city of Nahor" or Haran. Show it to them on a map and trace Abraham's
original journey, pointing out Ur, Haran, Shechem, and Bethel where he fIrst
built altars, and Hebron where he settled. Have them look up the Bible refer 
ences in their notes. A chart of the family of Abraham will be included with
the lesson on Jacob's wives and sons.

The Lord had wrought a miracle for Sarah and had given her
a son when she was over ninety years old. This son was Isaac,
whose name means "laughter." He was so named betause of Sar 
ah's great joy when he was born. Read Genesis 21:6. Sarah lived
to be a hundred and twenty-seven. Then she died, and Abraham
bought as a burying place for her the cave of Machpelah, which
became the family burying place and is mentioned several times
later in the Bible.

Isaac now needed a wife. Most of the other people in the land at
that time were Canaanites and worshiped idols. Abraham wanted
his son to have a wife who worshiped Jehovah as he did because
he knew that religion was the most important thing in a person's
life and that a difference of religion would be likely to lead to
differences of opinion and unhappiness and also might cause Isaac
to forsake the Lord. So he sent his servant back to his own rela 
tives to find a wife for Isaac.

What did Abraham's servant take with him?
Where was he to go?
Who was Nahor?

The "city of Nahor" was named Haran after another brother of
Abraham. Read Genesis 11: 27-32. When Abraham came from Ur
of Chaldea to the Holy Land, his father and his brother Nahor and
his family, as well as Lot, Haran's son, had started with him, but
Nahor had stopped and settled at Haran before they reached the
Holy Land.

Where did Abraham's servant stop when he came near Haran?
How did he try to make sure he would pick out the right maiden?
Did the Lord answer his prayer?

==== GENESIS 24

Who came out to draw water?

In those days people did not have running water in their houses.
Water was very scarce, and often there was just one well for a
whole city. Every family had to send someone to the well to draw
water and carry it home, and water for the animals had to be
drawn up from the well, too, and poured into troughs so that they
could drink. The animals were led out to drink from the troughs.
Read Genesis 29: 2-3.

What did Rebekah do?
How did the servant know she was the right maiden?
Who was Rebekah's grandfather? Who was her brother?

We want to remember the name Laban because we shall learn more
about him in the future.

How was Abraham's servant received by his master's relatives?
Why were they willing to let Rebekah go with him?

You see they, too, believed in the Lord and wanted to be led by
Him.

What presents did the servant give Rebekah?
Was Rebekah willing to go with him?
Who went with her from her home?

If you would like to know the name of Rebekah's nurse, read
Genesis 16: 13-14. Beer is the Hebrew word for well. Remember
this when you see other names in the Bible which begin with these
four letters.

What did Isaac and Rebekah take for their home?

Intermediate

This is a difficult lesson for the Intermediates, but it
is good to introduce
them to the idea not only of what true marriage is but of the necessity of the
union of goodness and truth in order to produce anything living and perma 
nent. The teacher should study the lesson carefully and try to be prepared
with illustrative examples which will come within the experience of his par 
ticular class.

ISAAC AND REBEKAH

Sons represent

truths and daughters affections. But in a mar 
riage the husband represents a certain good and the wife represents
the affection for the kind of truth which goes with that good. You
will understand this better when you are older, but perhaps an
example will help now. Suppose you make up your mind to grow
up to be good. You will first have to learn how-that means to
learn truths. But suppose you care only to learn the kind of truths
which will make you appear good to other people and do not care
to learn from the Lord what is good in His sight. Then your good 
ness will be only external or natural goodness. It will not be true
spiritual goodness at all. Abraham, you remember, obeyed the
Lord. His true wife Sarah pictures affection for truth from the
Lord, while the Egyptian servant Hagar pictures affection for ex 
ternal or natural truth. We all begin to do right from this natural
affection. That is, we like to be praised and to avoid punishment.
So our first reasoning is based on the thought of what will profit
us most. This is Ishmael. But when we are older, we begin to see
that this is not enough; we see that we ought to please the Lord,
whatever people may think of us. Then our reasoning begins to
be based on truth from the Lord. This is Isaac, the son who was
finally born to Sarah. And after he was born, Hagar and Ishmael
were sent away and Isaac was the one who grew up at home and
later took his father's place as head of the family.

Let us think back to the beginning of Abraham's story and see
if we remember it-where he came from, why he left his birth 
place, who left with him, where they first stopped, and who stayed
there. Now again we hear of Haran, the city of Nahor. When it was
time for Isaac to marry, Abraham did not want him to take a wife
from among the Canaanites. The Canaanites were idolaters. Abra 
ham wanted his son to have a wife who would worship Jehovah
as he did. He felt sure that among his brother Nahor's family a
good wife for Isaac could be found. You see that the new kind of
affection which belonged with the spiritual reasoning which Isaac
represents had to spring from the same childlike obedience to the
Lord in which Al)raham had always been.

==== GENESIS 24

Abraham sent his servant to Haran to find a wife for Isaac. This
was not a servant in the sense iIi which we use the word. He was
rather a steward, the man who had charge of all Abraham's house 
hold and possessions. Abraham's wealth is shown by the fact that
the servant traveled with ten camels and took very valuable pres 
ents for the bride and her family. All our external abilities and
knowledges are useful when they are made to serve our spiritual
development. Abraham's servant represents the kind of under 
standing of external things which performs this use, and camels
represent external knowledges. We have to "use our heads" in
doing good as in everything else. Perhaps you remember that John
the Baptist, who came to call people to repentance, wore raiment
of camel's hair.

Abraham's servant did not, however, depend entirely on his own
judgment. When he stopped at the well outside of Haran, he asked
a sign of the Lord. Rebekah came to the well in fulfillment of the
sign. She was the granddaughter of Abraham's brother Nahor.
Remember that her brother was named Laban, for we shall hear
more of him later. Rebekah and her family had' the same feeling
toward the Lord that Abraham had. They were sure that it was the
Lord who had chosen Rebekah for Isaac, and so were willing that
she should go.

This is a beautiful story of the making of a happy marriage.
When people are to live together all their lives, it is very important
that they should be suited to each other, not merely in external
ways, but also in the things of the heart and mind; for if they are
not,
they will be unhappy and cannot make the right kind of
home. We should pray the Lord to help us choose wisely in this
most important choice of our whole lives. We should also try to
find someone who has the same standards of right and wrong that
we have. This means that it is very important that husband and
wife have the same religious belief.

You remember that water corresponds to truth. In the story, the
well from which the water was drawn represents the letter of the
Word. Rebekah's willingness to draw water from the well not only

ISAAC AND REBEKAH

for Abraham's servant but for his camels also pictures willingness
to go to the Word for truth to guide our external conduct as well
as our religious thought. It was because Abraham and Isaac trusted
the Lord that they sent the servant to Haran for Isaac's wife; it
was because Rebekah's parents and her brother trusted the Lord
that they were willing to let her go; and it was because Rebekah
trusted the Lord that she was willing to leave her home and take
the long journey to a strange land to marry a man she had never
seen. Read the last verse of the chapter. It is a beautiful picture of
the beginning of a new home upon the foundation of the memory
of a happy childhood home.

Senior
Stress the fact that as we grow up our states change and that each new state
needs new truth from the Lord to direct it. We never become wise in and
from ourselves. The nature of marriage as a representative of the union of
divine love and wisdom in the Lord should be mentioned, and the need of
looking to the Lord for guidance in choosing a mate as well as the need for
being sure that the desire of both is to serve the Lord in and through their
marrlage.

Isaac-Sarah's son, who was to inherit all of Abraham's pos 
sessions and become the head of the family when his father died 
represents a kind of reasoning power based on belief in the truth
revealed by the Lord in the Word instead of on worldly ideas of
what is true. Sarah and Abraham were both very old when Isaac
was born. This pictures the fact that by the time our "spiritual

==== GENESIS 24

rational" begins to develop, our childhood states of simple trust
and obedience are passing away. Our lesson for today-Isaac's mar 
riage-takes place after Sarah's death.

When Abraham was first called by the Lord to leave Dr of
Chaldea and go to the land of Canaan, he did not start alone. In
addition to Sarah, his brother Nahor and his family went with him,
as well as their father Terah and Lot. the son of another brother,
Haran, who had died. Lot, you remember, went all the way to
Canaan with Abraham, but Nahor and his family went only part
way. They settled in Mesopotamia-which means "between the
rivers" (the Tigris and the Euphrates)-and the place where they
settled was named Haran for Lot's father. It is also called in the
Bible the "city of Nahor." There Terah died.

After Sarah's death Abraham determined to find a wife for his
son Isaac in the family of his brother Nahor. In our chapter for
today he sends his servant-really his steward-on the long journey
to Haran. Abraham's home, you remember, was in Hebron, in the
southern part of the Holy Land. The ancient Jews were always
forbidden to take wives from the people of any land in which they
were. But we know that this command has a deeper meaning. A
true marriage represents the union of good and truth-the man,
before marriage, representing the understanding, and the woman,
the affections. When a good understanding is united to evil desires,
great wrongs result. We sometimes read in the newspapers of a
"mastermind" in a gang of criminals. Isaac, the spiritual rational,
must be united to the affection for doing right in the Lord's sight 
not to any merely worldly ambition. A person can be truly rational
only when he has both true thoughts and good desires. The family
of Nahor represents a state of simple goodness, such as many Gen 
tiles have.

Wells play an important part in the story of Isaac. Water, as we
know, represents truth. The well from which this water of truth
is drawn is the letter of the Word. We remember the story of the
the well in Samaria and the living water He promised.

ISAAC AND REBEKAH

pictures the fact that a true spiritual affection wishes to be guided
by the Word in all the affairs of life, even worldly affairs, for the
camels represent enjoyment of knowing about the natural world.
Abraham, Isaac, Abraham's servant, Rebekah, and all her family
were governed by trust in the Lord and willingness to obey Him.
This is a beautiful story of how a happy marriage should be
formed-not that parents should choose their children's mates, but
that the Lord's guidance should be sought and followed. In the
first place, people should have the same religious beliefs in order
to live happily together, for these are the deepest things in their
lives and determine their standards of right and wrong. And both
partners in the marriage should wish above all things to do the
Lord's will. Then they will agree in their aims for their own lives
and for their children, and their home will be founded on unselfish
love of the Lord and the neighbor, which is the source of all
happiness in this world as well as in the spiritual world.

Adult
Discuss the different types of affection for truth and the need of the proper
affection if the life is to bear spiritual fruit. The mere "search for truth" is not
necessarily good. Another fruitful topic for discussion is the duty to bring up
our children from the beginning with a spiritual idea of marriage. This is the
most important thing parents can do in directing their children's choice. Note
that in the story it was not the servant or the parents who chose Isaac's mate,
the Lord, and everyone concerned recognized the Lord's part in the
but
matter.

The story of the birth of Isaac pictures the beginning of the
development of the higher rational faculty in us, the faculty which
looks deeper for its basis than mere external appearances of truth,
and depends instead upon the truth revealed by the Lord in Hi's
Word. When Isaac was born, Abraham was a hundred years old,
Sarah over ninety, and Ishmael fourteen. We recall that Ishmael,
because he mocked at
the baby Isaac, was sent away with his
mother into the wilderness, where he married an Egyptian wife
and became the father of a numerous people. Then follows the

==== GENESI S 24

story of Abraham's temptation to offer Isaac as a burnt sacrifice
the last moment the Lord checked
to the Lord, and of how ()t
the sacrifice and provided a ram in place of Isaac. We will doubt 
less remember that here again we have a case of the language of
appearance. The Lord of course did not command Abraham to
sacrifice Isaac, but He does command each of us to be willing to
do His will at whatever apparent sacrifices of our own desires or
possessions. Chapter 23 tells of the death of Sarah at the age of
a hundred and twenty-seven, and of her burial in a cave in a field
in Machpelah, which Abraham bought for the purpose from Eph 
too, has its inner meaning, but the literal
ron the Hittite. This,
fact is also important to remember because the cave of Machpelah
is mentioned several times later in the Bible story, and because it
should be noted that Sarah died before Isaac's marriage.

As little children we live, as it were, on the celestial plane, being
ruled by our affections and surrounded as to our souls by influ 
ences from the celestial heavens. This is the Abraham stage. But as
we develop in body and mind, this state gradually passes and a new
one succeeds. We come to be ruled by our rational faculty, to look
to it as the head of our house, so to speak. This is the Isaac stage.
It is an entirely new state, with new interests and new affections.
When it is fully developed, it can no longer cling to the former
childlike states of affection and thought. We say that a little child
can be led by love, but an older child must be reasoned with. Both
the little child and the older child when in their best states love
the truth, but they love it in a different way. Each has a type of
affection for truth which is appropriate to his state. So when Isaac
is developed to maturity, Sarah dies and a wife must be found for
him to take the place his mother has held in his life. The way in
which this wife is sought and found pictures in every detail the
way in which true rationality is established in the life of everyone
of us who develops as he should under the Lord's guidance.

Abraham in the story pictures the Lord at work in our hearts.
His eldest servant, who was over all his household, stands for the
natural mind, which governs our daily life-if it is a true servant-

ISAAC AND REBEKAH

in the interests of the Lord and according to His will. This servant
is told to seek a wife for Isaac, but not to seek her among the
degenerate inhabitants of Canaan. 'We recall the beginning of the
story of Noah in Genesis 6, where it is said that the sons of God
married the daughters of men, and a race of giants ensued who
eventually destroyed each other. That pictured the uniting of
truths from the Lord with selfish natural affections, using what
we know of the Lord to excuse and support our selfish desires.
Now we are again warned against falling into the same evil. Our
new rational mind must not be "married" to selfish and worldly
desires-we must not use our new faculty to excuse our faults and
to support us in selfish living and thinking. Instead, it must have
a wife from its own people, an affection for learning about the
Lord and about how to serve Him.

This can be illustrated by the right and the wrong way to study
the Bible. If, when we read the Bible, we are constantly looking for
statements which we like because they make us feel that we are
good-and perhaps that people who disagree with us are wrong 
and that the Lord will forgive us whatever we do, and pass over
all the condemnations and commands which point out our evils,
we are "marrying" our rational understanding of the Word to our
selfish affections-the "daughters of the Canaanites!' But when we
read the Bible to find out where we are wrong in the Lord's sight
and to find help to correct our faults, then we are "seeking a wife
for Isaac among Abraham's kindred." It is our natural mind, the
same part of us which gathers knowledge of everyday affairs and
keeps it in order, which goes out to find this true wife. It makes
use of all that we have learned from childhood about the Lord
and His will-the ten camels (AC 3048)-and it goes back to our
first understanding of doctrine which is represented by Haran.
There the servant found Rebekah by the well of water, and he
recognized her as his master's bride because she willingly drew
water not only for him but also for his camels. The well, of course,
is the letter of the Word, and the water is truth from the Word.
Only a genuine affection for divine truth will draw from the Word

==== GENESIS 24

refreshment for the mind and for all the knowledges of the Lord
the
which are laid up in it. Selfish affections would gladly let
knowledge of the Lord in the mind die. We may bring this lesson
home to ourselves in this way: When we attend church and Sun 
day school, do we love to hear the Bible explained and try to
apply its lessons to our own character and its problems? Or, when
the minister begins to touch upon some wrong thought or feeling
which we recognize as our own, do we close our ears and try not
to listen, or try to think of someone else to whom the lesson
applies?

But there is still another part of the story. When Rebekah was
found, she had to be brought
to Isaac. Isaac was on no account
to go back to Haran. Haran was not in the Holy Land at all; it was
merely one stage of the journey to the Holy Land, the time when
one begins dimly to see that he must obey the Lord and try to
get to heaven. After we have developed our rational faculty, the
Lord does not want us to go back to this state. Some people inter 
pret the Lord's statement that we must become as little children
(Matthew 18: 3) to mean that we should go back to the blind faith
of a little child and merely obey the Lord's teaching without
expecting to understand it. This is not what the Lord means. He
gives us our brains to use in matters of religion above everything
else. He wants us to study and understand His teaching, to become
His "friends" (John 15: 15). What we are to seek to retain-or to
regain-from our childhood is not our ignorance but our humility,
gentleness, and trust: our "innocence." We are, as Swedenborg
says,
to cultivate the "innocence of wisdom" in place of the
"innocence of ignorance." So Rebekah must be brought to Isaac.
Our affection for the Lord's truth must be raised to the rational
plane of our lives and united to our rational faculty. Then Isaac
is "comforted after his mother's death." When we have grown out
of the state of simple, blind acceptance of divine truth, we are
sometimes sad and bewildered. We can no longer accept some
things which we have heretofore taken for granted, because our
unaided reason cannot explain them, and yet we miss our belief in

them and seem lost without it. This story teaches us that nothing
will really satisfy us until we can restore our belief by seeing its
rational basis. A great many people who as little children have
believed in the Lord and the Bible lose their faith when their
reason develops because they have not found the rational expla 
nation of the Word which the New Church has to give. Many of
them long for their early states of belief and trust and never feel
"at home" again. They move about from one church to another,
looking for a doctrine which they can accept. The story of the
marriage of Isaac and Rebekah has a challenge for the New Church.

From the Writings of Swedenborg
Arcana Coelestia, n. 3212: "And Isaac was comforted after his mother. That
this signifies a new state, is evident from the signification of 'receiving com 
fort,' as being a new state; for a state of consolation is new; and that it suc 
ceeded to the foregoing is signified by 'after his mother.' . . . When man is
being regenerated, he is then becoming altogether another, and is being made
new; therefore also when he has been regenerated, he is called 'born again,'
and 'created anew.' Then, although he has a similar face and a similar speech,
yet his mind is not similar; his mind, when he is regenerate, is open toward
heaven, and there dwells therein love to the Lord and charity toward his
neighbor, together with faith. It is the mind that makes a man another, and
a new man. This change of state cannot be perceived in the body of man, but
in his spirit, the body being merely the covering of his spirit; and when it is
put off, then his spirit appears, and this (provided he has been regenerated)
in altogether another form, for it then has the form of love and charity in
beauty inexpressible."

==== ISAAC AND ABIMELECH

Genesis 26: 1-33

We have already studied the best-known stories about Isaac.
For the two youngest classes the teacher should be prepared to
retell very briefly the story of the birth of Isaac and of his mar 
riage to Rebekah, and should then tell today's story as an example
of his dealings with the people of the land. With the older classes,
also, the life of Isaac should be reviewed briefly as an introduction.

Doctrinal Points
The Abraham story teaches the way in which the Lord developed
as a child, and this is continued in the stories of Isaac and Jacob.

Nothing in the Word is accidental or unnecessary.
We should not try to force our doctrines on those who do not

want them.

True rationality is based on the desire to learn and obey the truths

of the Word.

Notes for Parents

The son born to Abraham and Sarah was Isaac, and we remem 
ber that Ishmael, who was fourteen years old when Isaac was born,
mocked at the baby and as a consequence was sent away with his
mother Hagar into the wilderness. This may at first seem to us
a harsh punishment for a thoughtless act, but we can understand
it if we realize the lesson it is given to teach us. We all have an
"Ishmael" in us in our natural disposition to judge according to
appearances and to discount
the deep spiritual causes and prin 
ciples. Our teenagers do this when they are so sure that they know
better than their parents. We can see the folly of it in them, but
do we always realize that it is exactly the same folly in us which
makes us imagine that we know better than the Lord what is good
for us?

304
Isaac, who was to be Abraham's heir, represents our maturer
judgment, which develops late and grows up slowly under the
Lord's guidance, and is steady and obedient. Our story today is
a picture of how this higher judgment can direct our lives wisely
even after the simple trust and obedience of childhood, represented
by Abraham, is gone.

If you will read the Lord's words to the woman of Samaria in
John 4: 5-14, you will see that the Lord's truth in the Bible is the
well to which we must go for spiritual cleansing and refreshment,
the only water with which our thirst can be permanently satisfied.
The stories of the Bible which we learned in early childhood are
the wells dug by Abraham. We, like the Philistines, often fill these
wells up with earth when, as we grow older, we let worldly ideas
and desires discourage and destroy our belief in the Bible. Isaac,
our more mature judgment, has to redig these wells. As he did this,
the Lord could prosper him until even the king of the Philistines,
who had at first
tried to drive him out of the country, decided
that it was to his interest to make peace with him. The people to
whom we go for advice and help in our times of doubt and need
are not
those whose lives are controlled by selfish and worldly
ambition, but those whose judgments are based on the deep and
sure foundation of the Lord's precepts.

Primary
Teach the children the name Isaac and what it means. Tell the story of Isaac
and then read the story for the day, explaining the importance of the wells
and emphasizing the name Beersheba.

Where was Abraham's first home?
What did the Lord tell him to do?
Where did Abraham finally settle in the land of Canaan?
What was the one thing Abraham and Sarah wanted which they did not have?
Who came to Abraham with a message from the Lord?
What was the message?
Less than a year later Abraham and Sarah did have a son.
They named him Isaac, which means "laughter."
Abraham and Sarah were old when Isaac was born.

== ISAAC AND ABIMELECH

After Isaac grew up, his father sent one of his trusted servants
on a long journey to the place called Haran where Abraham's
brother Nahor had settled, to bring back a wife for Isaac from
among his own relatives, because the people of Canaan did not
worship the Lord, and Abraham wanted his son to have a wife
who would not lead him away from the true worship. The servant
the granddaughter of Nahor, and Isaac
brought back Rebekah,
loved her very much. Isaac and Rebekah had twin sons, Esau and
Jacob. We shall hear more about them in our next lesson.

After Abraham died, Isaac became the head of the family, and
the people of Canaan soon had to recognize that he was a great
man just as his father had been.

Into whose country did he go in a time of famine?
Abimelech, king of the Philistines, was afraid of him and asked him to leave.
What did Isaac do in order to get water for his flocks and cattle?
Who had dug the wells in the first place?
What had the Philistines done to them?
Over how many wells did the herdmen of the land quarrel with Isaac's
herdmen?
What did Isaac call the third well?
Rehoboth means "room."
You see Isaac chose to let the Philistines have the first two wells rather than
quarrel over them.
Then Abimelech came and asked Isaac to make peace with him, and they
made a treaty and swore not to do each other any harm.

You see Isaac did not let his herdmen keep on quarreling with
the herdmen of the land. He went on until he found a well which
the others did not want. Then Abimelech realized that Isaac was
not his enemy, and came and asked Isaac to make peace with him.
You know that if you keep on quarreling with another child,
someone always gets hurt in the end, and everyone is unhappy.
But if one of you refuses to go on quarreling and just walks away
and does something else, the one who is left is likely ') want to
make up. So when a quarrel begins,
it is
always the one who has the most sense who stops first.

try to remember that
Junior

The general story of Isaac up to the beginning of our lesson should be re 
viewed briefly. If the children ask why Isaac lied about his wife, call their
attention to the two similar stories about Abraham (Genesis 12: 10-20; 20:
1-11) and tell them that the explanation is in the spiritual sense, which they
will study when they are older. The story of the wells is the important part
of the lesson for the Juniors, and an attempt should be made to fix Beersheba
in their minds.

Abraham had been recognized by all the people of the land as
a great man. He had made agreements with the kings among whom
he lived and had found plenty of pasture and water for his flocks
and herds. Isaac was now head of the family, but the people of
the land did not know him as they had known Abraham and they
thought that they might safely take advantage of him. You remem 
ber that when Abraham first came into the land there was a famine
and he had to go down into Egypt for a time. Now there is another
famine, but the Lord tells Isaac not to go to Egypt.

Where did Isaac go?
What was the king of the Philistines called?
What did Isaac tell the people about Rebekah?
How did Abimelech find out that she was Isaac's wife?
Did Isaac prosper in the Philistine country?
What had happened to the wells which Abraham had dug there?
Why did Abimelech want to send Isaac away?
Why could Isaac not use the first two wells which his servants dug?
What happened when they found the third?
What agreement did Isaac and Abimelech make?
What did Isaac call the place where it was made?

Now read Genesis 21:22-32. It is thought that the word Abim 
elech, which means "father of a king," was not the name of one
person but of a whole line of kings of the Philistines. Abraham had
made an agreement with the Abimelech of his day just as Isaac
did now. Shebah or Sheba means "oath" and Beer means "well";
so Beersheba means "the well of the oath." Look on a map and
find the Philistine country along the shore of the Mediterranean
Sea. We shall hear a great deal about the Philistines. Now find

ISAAC AND ABIMELECH

Beersheba. We may think of it as the southernmost city of the
Holy Land. The northernmost city was Dan. So the expression
"from Dan to Beersheba," which we find several times in the Bible,
means the whole length of the land. Isaac's agreement with Abim 
elech at Beersheba established him with the people of the land as
a great man, just as his father had been.

Intermediate

The teacher should review very briefly the story of Isaac from his birth to
the time of our lesson. The principal emphasis of this lesson should be placed
on the meaning of Isaac in our lives, on why Isaac prospered in the Philistine
country more than the Philistines themselves, and on the meaning of the
wells and what happened to them. The teacher should be familiar with the
interpretation of the incident concerning Rebekah as found in the Senior and
Adult notes, and should be prepared to touch upon it if the young people are
curious to understand more than is given in their own notes.

Abraham represents our spiritual state in infancy and early child 
hood. It is a beautiful state, and yet we know that we all expect
and want little children to grow up. If they are to take their true
places in the world, they must learn to think and act for them 
selves. The period of learning to think and reason is pictured in
the Word by the stories of Abraham)s sons, Ishmael and Isaac.

Ishmael, you remember, was not Sarah's son. His mother was
Sarah's Egyptian bondwoman Hagar. There is a great deal in the
the land of Egypt. Egypt, because of the river Nile,
Bible about
did not depend on rainfall for its fertility, and so there was always
grain in Egypt even when other countries were suffering from
drought and famine. Egypt represents the plane of memory-knowl 
edge. We can store our minds with facts even when we are not able
to understand an4 use them. Ishmael, born of an Egyptian mother,
represents the beginning of our thinking and reasoning power,
when we judge by what we see and hear in the natural world
without understanding the causes that are within and above what
we see.

But after a while we begin to find that things are not always
just what they seem to be. Our senses sometimes deceive us. Our
turn out as we expected. There are spiritual laws
plans do not
which must be learned and obeyed. When we see this, Isaac is
born. In our lesson for
today there is a famine in the land of
Canaan, just as there had been in the time of Abraham; but the
Lord tells Isaac not to go down into Egypt as his father had done.
Our higher reason must not depend on the kind of knowledge
which concerns this world only. We must learn doctrine concern 
ing the Lord and spiritual
life. This kind of knowledge is rep 
resented by the land of the Philistines.

Now notice in our story the difference between the Philistines
and Isaac. Isaac prospered so greatly in the Philistine country that
the Philistines envied him and wanted him to leave their land.
The Philistines picture the kind of people who like to know what
the Bible teaches and to talk and reason about it but do not try
to live according to its teachings. Isaac pictures those who try to
learn and understand the same things, but for the sake of living
as the Lord wants them to live. So Isaac prospered and became
rich in the Philistine country.

Another thing in our lesson which shows the difference between ,

the Philistines and Abraham and Isaac is the statement that the
Philistines filled up with earth the wells which Abraham's servants
had dug. Water, you know, represents truth. In the Word, a well
represents the truth as we find it
in the Bible. The wells which
Abraham and Isaac dug picture the Bible when it is studied as the
Word of the Lord for the sake of life. To fill these wells up with
earth is to stop the truth from appearing in the Word by preferring
our own opinions to the Lord's guidance. And you notice that
the Philistines claimed two of the wells as their own. When people
think that the Word was made up by men instead of inspired by
the Lord, they cannot find its truth. All they see is their own ideas.
We all have this tendency, which comes from our natural self-love.
You know that when you start to argue with someone, you seldom
really listen to what he is saying: you think only about making
him agree with you.

ISAAC AND ABIMELECH

Isaac's apparent deceit

in telling Abimelech that Rebekah was
his sister is something you will understand better when you are
older. But you should know that this is the third time such a thing
has happened in the Bible story. Abraham earlier told Abimelech
that Sarah was his sister, and still earlier in Egypt he told Pharoah
the same thing. We find these two stories in Genesis 20: 2-7 and
12: 11-20. Swedenborg points out that the fact that this incident
is repeated three times in the Word shows that it has a very deep
and important meaning. You will see that this is an illustration of
what we were saying just now-that things are not always what
they seem.

This is also the second time that an agreement has been made
at Beersheba. Read Genesis 21:22-31. Beer means "well," and
Sheba means "oath," and so Beersheba means "the well of the
oath." It was the southernmost city in the Holy Land.

Those who think that the Word is the product of men some 
times argue that these repetitions are mistakes-something put in
by the scribes who copied the Scriptures. This is one of the ways
in which the well of truth is stopped up with earth. The Lord
makes no mistakes.

Basic Correspondences

Egypt = the plane of memory-knowledge
the land of the Philistines = the knowledge of doctrinal things

Senior

The development from Abraham through Ishmael
to Isaac should be ex 
plained clearly as a preparation for understanding the meaning of Isaac's
dealings with the Philistines. The important lesson is the difference between
an intellectual interest in the Word and going to the Word and studying it to
find out how to live.

Our true spiritual progress comes through Isaac, our spiritual
rational faculty. If we are developing properly, Abraham gives all
that he has to Isaac and dies, as we are told in Genesis 25: 5-9,
and Ishmael and Isaac bury him. It is after this that Isaac and
Rebekah have their twin sons, Esau and Jacob.

Then comes our story for today. There is a famine in the land,
just as there had been when Abraham first came there. Abram had
gone down into Egypt, and we remember that this pictured our
need in early childhood for acquiring all kinds of natural knowl 
edges. But Isaac is told by the Lord not to go to Egypt, and in 
stead he goes to the land of the Philistines. This is because natural
knowledges are not the basis of spiritual reasoning. The land of
the Philistines represents knowledges of doctrine.

We find that Abraham had in his time made a treaty with
Abimelech, king of the Philistines, and had dug wells in the Philis 
tine country; but after the death of Abraham the Philistines had
stopped these wells and filled them with earth. The Philistines
themselves represent those who like to learn doctrine but make
no attempt to live according to it. When we are little children in
the Abraham state, we learn-among other natural knowledges 
stories from the Word and the lessons drawn from them by our
elders. These are Abraham's' wells. But often, as we begin to assert
our own wills, these wells are stopped up with the earth of our
own worldly and selfish ideals. We rebel against going to Sunday
school and church. We stop saying our prayers. We think we know
enough to take care of o'urselves without the Lord.

When Isaac develops in us, we have to go down again into the
Philistine country and redig the wells. Some of them we cannot
reclaim because the Philistine hold on them is too strong, but
eventually, if we persist, we find one we can develop, and then
Isaac can renew the oath made between his father and Abimelech.
Beersheba means "the well of the oath." In the Word, a well is
frequently used as a symbol of the Bible, because we draw truth
from the Bible just as one draws water from a well. If we are to
become regenerate, we must keep on searching until we find a
doctrine which enables us to understand the Bible and to see the
Lord's truth in it.

One part of our chapter often puzzles people. Isaac in the begin 
ning deceives Abimelech by saying that Rebekah is his sister. Abra-

ISAAC AND ABIMELECH

that

ham had said the same to Pharaoh about Sarah and repeated it
later to Abimelech (Genesis 12: 11-20; 20:2-7). Critics of the Bible
have sometimes thought
these repetitions were mistakes of
the scribes who copied the Scriptures, but this is a case of the
Philistines' filling a well with earth. Swedenborg says: "As the
same thing occurred three times, and is three times repeated in
the Word, it is evident that there is in it an arcanum of the greatest
moment, which can never be known to anyone except from the
internal sense" (AC 3386). In the internal sense a sister pictures
rational truth, but a wife pictures truth united to good. People in
the Philistine state are interested in learning rational truth; but
because they have no desire to apply rational truth to their own
conduct, they would destroy the same truth if it were presented
to them as something they ought to do. This meaning is not so
hard to understand as you might think. We all enjoy learning new
things, but do we alway.s welcome good advice?

Adult

We should be able to take it for granted that the adults know the general
story of Isaac, and so the teacher may concentrate on the specific lesson,
which is an important one often overlooked.

All adults who have brought up children or who have observed
the development of any child from infancy through the early
"teens" should be able to draw upon their experience for help in
understanding our lesson for today and its background. The key 
note of the lesson is to be found in the wells. Throughout the
Bible a well is the symbol of the Word. We dig wells when we go
to the Word for truth. Without the Word our lives are barren.

Abraham had dug wells in the Philistine country. In early child 
hood we learn the stories of the Word and are given instruction
from them. But as we develop out of the innocent childhood
states, as we learn more about the world and its standards and
begin to reason from appearances-the Ishmael state-the Philis 
tines stop up these wells of truth and fill them with earth. The
Philistines lived in the Holy Land along the coast. Their part of
the country pictures knowledge of doctrine, but the Philistines
themselves represent "the memory-knowledge of knowledges," the
knowledge of spiritual truths held in the memory but not used in
life. We all have the Philistines in us, for we all know more truth
than we are willing to use. Whenever we know what we ought -to
do but reason ourselves out of doing it because it
is not con 
venient, the Philistines in us are stopping up Abraham's wells and
filling them with earth.

In AC 2083 Swedenborg shows us very clearly the nature of
the progression from Abraham through Jacob in the Lord's own
experience, which is our pattern: "Abraham, as said in various
places before, represents the Lord's internal man, but Isaac His
rational man, and Jacob His natural man. The Lord's internal man
was Jehovah Himself. His rational man, because conceived of the
influx of His internal man into the affection of memory-knowl 
edges in the e_xternal man, was from the Divine thus conjoined
with the Human. Hence the first rational, represented by Ishmael,
was human; but it was made Divine by the Lord, and then it is
represented by Isaac." So in our lives our first reasoning, although
a faculty given us by the Lord, is exercised on the basis of natural
knowledges and must later be corrected as we learn by experience
that appearances are often deceiving and that spiritual causes and
principles are the only true basis of rational thought. Wise parents
recognize the "difficult" years in their children as merely a necess 
ary step in their growing up, and draw a breath of relief when they
see the first signs of maturer judgment.

It is interesting to note that Sarah dies some time before Abra 
ham. Sarah, Abraham's true wife, represents the genuine affection
for truths received in the simplicity of childhood. The child out 
grows this affection when he begins to want to do his own think 
ing, but the good intention of childhood persists, joining itself to
a different
type of affection for truth-comparatively obscure 
which is represented by Keturah, whom Abraham married after
Sarah's death. Modern psychiatry, which delves into the inner

ISAAC AND ABIMELECH

experiences of the childhood of an individual, might well study
the six sons of Abraham and Keturah and their descendants. They
appear from time to time throughout the Old Testament story,
usually as enemies of the descendants of Isaac, but we note in
Genesis 25: 5 that "Abraham gave all that he had unto Isaac." All
our spiritual progress depends upon the development of the true
rational whose judgments are based without equivocation upon
the truths of the Word.

looks to rational

Abraham and Isaac both swore a covenant of peace with Abim 
elech, king of the Philistines, who represents "the doctrine of faith
that
things." The truly spiritual man has no
quarrel with interest in doctrine and reasonings about it. It was
the Lord who sent Isaac down into the Philistine country in time
of famine-to knowledges of doctrine, not to the mere natural
knowledges represented by Egypt-and prospered him there. Isaac
was even led to repeat the ruse twice practiced by Abraham (Gen 
esis 12:11-20; 20:2-7) and to represent Rebekah at first as his
sister. The difference between Rebekah as a sister and Rebekah
as a wife is the difference between the affection for spiritual truth
as an intellectual exercise and affection for the same truth for the
purpose of directing the life. Swedenborg points out that with
those who do not wish to change their ways of life, spiritual truth
will be rejected if it is presented first as an exhortation to good,
whereas in its merely intellectual aspects they may find it interest 
ing and pleasing, and after it
is accepted intellectually it may
gradually affect the life. We should remember this in our mission 
ary efforts.

Beersheba-"the well of the oath"-became Isaac's home. It is
the southernmost city of the Holy Land, and we recall that the
north and south direction is the measure of the extent of enlight 
enment, the north representing ignorance and the south enlighten 
ment; so it is clear that Isaac's settling in Beersheba, digging a well
and building an altar there after his covenant with Abimelech,
gives us the true pattern of spiritual enlightenment which is the
necessary basis for a good life, both external and internal.
From the Writings of Swedenborg
Arcana Coelestia, n. 3464: "As regards the doctrinal things that are from the
literal sense of the Word, the case is this: When a man is in them, and at the
same time in a life according to them, he has a correspondence in himself; for
the angels who are with him are in interior truths, while he is in exterior ones,
and thus through the doctrinal things he has communication with heaven, but
according to the good of his life. As, for example, when in the Holy Supper
he thinks in simplicity of the Lord from the words then used- 'This is My
body, and this is My blood'-the angels with him are in the idea of love to
the Lord and charity toward the neighbor; for love to the Lord corresponds
to the Lord's body, and to bread; and charity toward the neighbor corre 
sponds to the blood, and the wine ... and because there is such a correspon 
dence, there flows an affection out of heaven through the angels into that
holy state in which the man then is, which affection he receives in accordance
with the good of his life. For the angels dwell with everyone in his life's
affection, thus in the affection of the doctrinal things according to which he
lives; but in no case if his life disagrees therewith; for if the life disagrees, as
for instance if he is in the affection of gaining honors and riches by means of
doctrinal things, then the angels retire, and infernals dwell in this affection,
who either infuse into him confirmations of the doctrinal things for the sake
of self and the world, thus a persuasive faith-which is such that it is regard 
less whether a thing is true or false provided it captivates the minds of others 
or else they take away all faith, and then the doctrine of his lips is only a
sound excited and modified by the fire of these loves."

== JACOB AND ESAU
Genesis 25: 19-34; 27

Again we have a story about two brothers, but this time they
are twins with the same mother as well as the same father. The
teacher should fill in a little of the background by telling how
Abraham sent his servant up to Haran, where his brother Nahor
had settled, to bring back a wife for Isaac from his own people.
Sarah had already died, and after Isaac married Rebekah, Abraham
died also.

Doctrinal Points
The Lord is merciful to us, and uses even our selfishness to teach

us spiritual lessons.

The people in the Bible are not meant to be examples for us to

imitate. Only the Lord's life is our example.

Notes for Parents

Rebekah, Isaac's wife, came from Haran. When Abraham and
his family took the long journey from their home in Dr of Chaldea
to the land of Canaan, his brother Nahor started the journey with
him but stopped part way at Haran, and decided to settle there.
Rebekah was Nahor's granddaughter. The Jews were many times
commanded not to intermarry with the people among whom they
happened to live. In this way their line was kept pure. The deeper
reason for the prohibition was, of course, that they might not be
drawn away into other religions.

Isaac and Rebekah had no children for twenty years, and then
the twins Esau and Jacob were born. They were not identical
twins. Esau was red and hairy-his other name Edom means "red"
-while Jacob was a "smooth" man. And Esau was a "cunning
hunter, a man of the field," while Jacob stayed at home tending

JACOB AND ESAU

the flocks and herds. Esau was his father's favorite, and Jacob was
his mother's.

We have seen in past lessons that the people in the Bible stories
were far from perfect. This is clearly illustrated in our two stories
for today. Jacob in the first place drove a shrewd bargain with his
brother, but Esau's fault was even greater, in being willing to sacri 
fice his proper future in order to satisfy his immediate physical
hunger. Esau, as the firstborn, was entitled to the birthright, the
right
to be his father's heir. He was also entitled to the better
blessing from his father, and here both Jacob and Rebekah ob 
viously did wrong. But when the deceit was successfully carried
out, Esau was so angry that he dete~ined to kill his brother.
There was not much to choose between Esau and Jacob.

In the Bible we often find stories about pairs of brothers: Cain
and Abel, Joseph's two sons Ephraim and Manasseh, and in the
New Testament Peter aJld Andrew and James and John. In our
progress through life everything we "bring forth" has a twofold
character, including both intention and thought, will and under 
standing. We know that Abraham represents our innocent little
childhood; and Isaac, the development of our reasoning faculty.
Esau and Jacob follow. They represent the period when young
people are beginning their independent lives in the world, taking
jobs or going away to college, standing on their own feet for the

are faulty. The point of our Bible story is that although the will
is primary-we never do anything which is not prompted by a
desire of some kind-it is always necessary for us to set our under

thoughts are very imperfect, and to control our impulses until we
have learned to be really wise and to prefer to do the right things.

Primary
The lesson can be centered on the f1rst story about the selling of the birth-
right. Be sure to explain what a birthright was. The later story can be read
at the end, if there is time. Try to teach the children the names Esau and
Jacob, but keep in their minds especially the series of names Abraham, Isaac,
and Jacob. They should be able to see that both Esau and Jacob did wrong,

- and that they both suffered as a result.

You remember that when Abraham started out from his home
in Dr to go to the land of Canaan, his brother Nahor went with
him but did not go all the way. He stopped about halfway, at
a place called Haran, and settled there.

After Isaac grew up, Abraham did not want him to marry any
of the Canaanite women; so he sent his most trusted servant back
to Haran to find a wife for Isaac in his own brother's family.
The servant brought back Nahor's granddaughter Rebekah, and
Isaac was very happy to marry her.

Isaac and Rebekah had no children for twenty years. But finally

they had twins, whom they named Esau and Jacob.

Which was the firstborn?
Were the twins alike?
What did Esau like to do?
What did Esau ask Jacob to give him?
What bargain did Jacob make with him?

Esau was very foolish to sell his birthright just to satisfy his
hunger, and Jacob did wrong to take advantage of his brother in
this way. And later he did something still worse.

Which of the twins was Isaac's favorite?
Which was Rebekah's favorite?
When Isaac was old, what did he ask Esau to do?
Rebekah helped Jacob to deceive his father by pretending to be Esau.

When Esau came back with his venison, his father was very
much upset, but he told him he could not take back the blessing
he had given Jacob. He gave Esau a different blessing-really a
better one (see Genesis 27:39-40)-but Esau was still so angry that
he said he was going to kill Jacob. So Rebekah persuaded Isaac
to send Jacob away to Haran, her former home, for a long visit.

JACOB AND ESAU

Junior
Have the children trace again on a map the journey of Abram from Ur to
Canaan, find Haran, and remind them of Nahor's settling there. This will
introduce Rebekah, as Nahor's granddaughter. There are several lessons sug 
gested in the Junior notes which children of this age can easily understand.
Stress especially the fact that when we do wrong, we always suffer for it
sooner or later, even though at the time we may seem to "get away with it."

Whom did Isaac marry?
Where did she come from?

Isaac and Rebekah lived together for twenty years before they

had children. Then they had twin sons.

What were their names?
Which was the fustborn?
Were they identical twins?

Esau means "hairy," and Edam,
the other name by which Esau
is called, means "red." You want to remember that Esau was the
father of the Edomites, who appear several times in the Bible story,
usually as enemies of the Israelites.

Verses 29 to 34 of chapter 25 tell how both Esau and Jacob
did wrong. In the King James Version there are some unfamiliar
words in the story. Pottage is something cooked in a pot, like soup
or stew. Sad is an old past tense of the verb seethe and means
"boiled." The birthright was the right of the oldest son to become
head of the family after his father's death. Lentiles are any kind
of bean or pea; there are several varieties, one of which is red.

Jacob did wrong in taking advantage of his brother's hunger and
weakness to drive a sharp bargain, and Esau did wrong in giving up
a valuable privilege to satisfy his appetite. Whenever we do some 
thing wrong in order to get something we happen to want very
much at the moment, we are "selling our birthright for a mess of
pottage"; this is a common expression taken from this story. What
do you think our "birthright" really is? Read Matthew 25:31-34.
We are different from animals in that we are capable of learning
about the Lord and obeying Him, and thus of coming to love Him
and be "inheritors" of His kingdom in heaven. We can think about
His will and judge whether the things we want to do are good or
bad in His sight. Animals cannot think about God or about right
and wrong. They are governed by their instincts and appetites.
So whenever we let ourselves be governed by our natural desires,
we are putting ourselves on the level of animals and "selling our
birthright."

which son was the favorite of Isaac?
which was Rebekah's favorite?

When Isaac was very old and almost blind and knew it was
nearly time for him to die, he wanted to give Esau his blessing 
the special blessing which was the right of the firstborn. This was
customary among the Jews. The Bible records several instances of
it. The father's final blessing was very precious to the son.

What did Isaac ask Esau to do for him?
Why did Rebekah want Jacob to deceive his father?
How did she help him do it?

Isaac was doubtful. He said, "The voice is Jacob's voice, but the
hands are the hands of Esau." Still, he gave him the blessing. When
Jacob was gone and Esau came in with his venison and Isaac knew
that he had been deceived, he said he could not take back the
blessing.

Does it seem strange that Jacob should have been permitted to
get his blessing by deceit? Jacob did not go unpunished for his
wrongdoing. He had to flee from his brother's anger and spend 
many long year's far from home, and finally he had to bow down
before his brother and ask his forgiveness. The Lord' used the
people in the Bible just as they were, to teach lessons which you
will understand when you are a little older. He made even their
wrongdoing serve a use. We must study the stories carefully to find
the lessons and not think that because someone was blessed by
the Lord, everything he did was right. We know that we often do
wrong things, and yet think of all the blessings the Lord gives us!
Read carefully the blessing Isaac gave Jacob and the blessing he

JACOB AND ESA U

gave Esau. We shall see that both these blessings were fulfilled.
Esau's plan to kill his brother shows something of his character,
just as his willingness to sell his birthright does.

Rebekah's plan to save Jacob was also used by the Lord. It
started a whole train of circumstances which we shall study in our
later lessons. Everything we do, every decision we make, changes
the course of our lives. We should try hard, therefore, to learn to
make wise and right decisions.

Intermediate

In this lesson the general correspondence of Jacob and Esau is taken up first
because it completes the Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob series. The young people
should have these patriarchs and their general meaning very clearly in mind
before they go on. The reason-for Jacob's taking precedence over Esau can
be related to the correspondence of Isaac. That is, we need to know truth
and to reason from spiritual principles. This is a good opportunity to be sure
that the young people understand that the New Church does not teach that
all Bible characters are examples to be imitated. The Intermediates are old
enough to understand how this can be, and to recognize it without losing any
of their reverence for the Word.

Abraham died and was gathered to his people. The childhood
state of simple obedience in our lives passes away finally _and is
replaced by the rule of the rational, which is Isaac. As we grow
out of our young childhood, our minds develop and we begin to
think for ourselves and finally to act independently. Isaac rep 
resents the thinking and Jacob and Esau the acting period. Our
independent lives are developing and progressing, but at the same
time they are coming down from the high plane of innocence and
tru.st which characterized our infancy to the level of the outside
world. Here our life is clearly divided between our desires and our
knowledge-Esau and Jacob. The Lord wants both to be good, to
be led by Him, but by nature we are selfish and lacking in wisdom.
Both Esau and Jacob were faulty. And our desires and our know1-
edge conflict, just as there was trouble between Esau and Jacob.
Esau, Isaac's firstborn son, pictures the love or desire side and
Jacob the truth or thought side of our activity in the world.
Desire comes first. If we had no desires, we should neither think
nor act. But in order to do what we want we must first learn how.
So actually Jacob has to take the first place for a time. Jacob
means "supplanter." He supplants his older brother.

The character of Jacob in the Bible has puzzled some people;
they have assumed that anyone the Lord prospered must have
been a thoroughly good person and meant for us to copy. But this
is not so. The people in the Bible had good and bad qualities, just
as we have, and we are to learn from their stories, even in the
letter, what not to do as well as what to do, and about the Lord's
tender and merciful dealing with men even when they make serious
mistakes. Jacob took a mean advantage of his brother, but Esau
also did wrong in despising his birthright-the cherished right of
the firstborn to follow his father as head of the family-and giving
it away to satisfy his hunger. It may seem to us very unlikely that
he would really do this. Yet we do the same sort of thing con 
stantly. We are always giving up something important which we
might have at some future time for the sake of some unimportant
thing we happen to want right now. Our birthright is the right to
know and love the Lord-that is what makes us men instead of
animals-to be "sons of God" and to "inherit the kingdom of
heaven." Whenever we sacrifice our Christian ideals for the sake
of some worldly satisfaction which we want at the moment, we
are selling our birthright for a mess of pottage. Jacob could not
have cheated Esau if Esau had not yielded to temptation. We
sometimes feel, as Esau did, that we shall "die" if we do not get
what we want, but the Lord wil1 always give us strength to resist
temptation if we really try.

In the second part of our lesson Jacob pretends to be Esau.
We often pretend to be the kind of people we wish we were.
The Lord knows our real motives. But He does not take away his
blessing, since it is better for us to do right from selfish motives

JACOB AND ESA U

than not to do right at all, and this is one of the ways in which we
form good habits and gradually come to love doing what is right.
Esau, too, was a mixture of good and bad. He wanted to be blessed
and was willing to obey his father and to take a great deal of
trouble to procure the blessing. But he was also ready to kill his
brother because of his disappointment. When we do not get what
we want, don't we sometimes want to hurt somebody? Esau and
Jacob in their youth were both thoroughly selfish just as we are
in the beginning.

It was a long time before Jacob and Esau were reconciled, and
both had to go through years of hard work and discipline first.
It takes all our lives in this world to bring our desires and our
thinking together in the service of the Lord.

stages and which remain in our background and come up to trouble us later.
We are tracing one thread-the Lord's influence in our lives-but there are
other "side lines" branching off here and there from the true line, all of
which must eventually be brought into order and under the control of the
Lord. This will help to relate the Sunday school lessons to the young people's
school and home and recreational activities, and will help to show them the
primary importance of religious instruction.

The obvious lesson of the literal story of our first chapter is
summed up in the common expression "selling one's birthright for
a mess of pottage"; for everyone can see that Esau made a foolish
trade, and we know, if we really look at ourselves honestly, that we
are all frequently tempted to grasp at some present outward satis 
the sacrifice of a future great and more interior good.
faction at
But the deeper lessons of the chapter are hidden. We need first
to realize that with the birth of Esau and Jacob, we reach the third
and final stage in our development from infancy to manhood.
We all like to look back upon our early childhood, and we recog 
nize the beauty of its innocent, trusting spirit; but the time comes
when our thinking must be made actual in deeds. The rational
stage of our development-the Isaac stage-must end, and we must
begin to seek an independent place in the external life of the
world. Esau and Jacob represent
this external, "practical" plane
of life. And because it is in the carrying out of our purposes that
we must finally be specific, it is here that the separation between
will and thought, desire and knowledge, becomes evident.

So now instead of a single son we have twins. Esau pictures the
twin brothers yet often in conflict.
will and Jacob the intellect:
The will is the firstborn because there must be motive before there
can be any thought. But because the human will is by birth selfish,
the intellect must for a time take first place. The selfishness and
shortsightedness of our natural affections and impulses arc pic 
tured in Esau's willingness to give up his whole future to satisfy
his present physical hunger.

In our second story Isaac is old and his eyes are dim. When we
pass from the thinking stage of our teens to active, independent
life, we are likely to become so absorbed in the external affairs
of every day that we do not see clearly for a time. We arc easily
deceived by appearances. Our wills are not yet unselfish. The wild
game which Esau brought for his father represents our own ideas
of goodness with which we like to be satisfied. Jacob is permitted
to substitute two kids of the goats, which represent genuine good 
ness, though of a natural kind. So our minds help us, although at
this stage it is necessary that the truth be made to seem desirable:
Jacob puts on Esau's clothing and puts the skins of the goats on
his hands and on the back of his neck to make himself appear like
Esau.

This does not mean that Jacob did right. The Lord permitted
the deception to teach us that a selfish will must not be allowed

JACOB AND ESAU

to lead us. We must learn the truth and follow it even though we
imagine that the truth came out of our own minds, and
at first
praise ourselves for thinking of it. This is what is represented by
Isaac's words, "The voice is Jacob's voice, but the hands are the
hands of Esau."

In the literal story Jacob paid a heavy penalty. He, the more
home-loving of the two brothers, had to start off alone and serve
many years in a strange land before he was allowed to return and
enjoy his inheritance. Haran, to which he went, represents a state
of simple obedience. After we have developed our faculties and
begun our independent life in the world, we have to go through
a long period of doing right just because we know we ought to,
before the Lord can develop in us the real love of truth and good 
ness which enables us to enter into our true spiritual home.

Adult

There is plenty of discussion material here, especially in the thought that
"natural good"-which is Esau-is never pure or trustworthy, and that our
real spiritual progress is dependent upon Jacob, our interest in truth.

Swedenborg says: "There are in every man an internal man,
is intermediate, and an external, which is
a rational man that
properly called the natural man. With the Lord these were rep 
resented by Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob" (AC 1893). The Abraham
stage with u~ is our infancy, when the internal man is open to
the heavens 'and is filled by the Lord with "remains"-innocent,
trustful, happy states which can later be used in our regeneration.
Then we develop into the rational or Isaac stage, and finally are
ready to carry out in everyday life the knowledges and affections
which we have developed in the previous stages. The rest of our
life, if we regenerate, is spent in developing and then in bringing
into order this natural or external plane and in gradually bringing
it to act as the servant of the inner planes. So, although Abraham
and Isaac come first, and in one sense are higher than Jacob, their
descendants are called the seed of Jacob or the children of Israel
(Israel being the name later given to Jacob by the Lord), and their
history occupies the rest of the Old Testament. Our story today
deals with Jacob and his elder twin Esau, and of how Jacob instead
of Esau came to be head of the family. We have spoken before of
the two divisions of our lives, symbolized by the two rooms in
the ark-the will and the understanding. The natural plane of our
lives has these two divisions, and they are pictured by Esau and
Jacob, Esau good in the natural plane, and Jacob truth in the same
plane. They are twins because the will and the understanding,
good and truth, go together as equals in us from the beginning.
Esau is actually the elder because all power is from the will,
even the power to think, and influx from the Lord or from the
hells primarily affects our wills. Throughout most of our life,
however, Jacob supplants Esau, because we have to learn what is
right before we can do it: our understanding appears to take first
place. The Lord permits this change,
this inversion of the true
order, to meet the changed conditions caused by man's turning
to self and perverting his will. That is, because by inheritance our
will is selfish, we cannot safely be guided by it but must be taught
what is right. Jacob instead of Esau must be head of our house.
But we note that Esau eventually is to break off the yoke of his
brother. This means that when we are regenerated, when we have
practiced doing as truth teaches until the Lord has been able to
give us a new will, then we may again be ruled by our will and do
as we please freely.

The literal story of Esau and Jacob has proved a stumbling block
to those who believe that all those in the letter of the Word whom
the Lord favors must be exemplary characters. Here is a man who
cheated, lied, and stole, and yet was allowed to keep the fruits
of his deception and to become the ancestor of the Lord's chosen
people. How can we "get around" this obvious fact? In the New
Church we do not have to get around it. The Bible characters,
with the exception of our Lord, are not in themselves exemplary.
Many of them are evil men, doing evil deeds. But the Lord can
make use even of their evil deeds to teach us the ins and outs of

JACOB AND ESAU

our own souls and the nature of the humanity which He assumed
and glorified. He makes use of evil to show how His providence
foresees and provides for all our states and tries to lead us back
to Him, however far we may have departed. In the inmost sense,
which relates to the life of the Lord,
the Word is all true and
beautiful. In the inner sense, which relates to our own states, we
see the Lord's love and truth acting upon our degenerate human
nature in the effort to save us. In the letter we see this struggle
acted out upon the stage of real life by the Hebrew nation, the
nation chosen to portray it. Thus even in the letter, if we keep the
whole face of it in mind when studying any given story, we can
see good and evil, truth and falsity at work and trace their effects.
We must not expect the letter to portray ideal conditions.

The objection to the story of Jacob and Esau is based on the
desire to have all evil punished immediately and obviously. This
is not the Lord's desire; it is a very earthly one. The Lord desires
to show us our evils and to turn us from them, never to punish.
Evil punishes itself, often not immediately or obviously, but surely
in the end. The results of Jacob's evils can easily be traced in his
fear of Esau not only immediately after his deed but even twenty
years later when he returned and sought reconciliation with his
brother. Furthermore, Esau himself is far from exemplary. He is
willing to sell his birthright-his proper future-to satisfy his im 
mediate physical hunger. Here is a lesson which all can see and
understand. How often we put present pleasure above future good!
How often for the sake of some trivial thing which we want now
we do what we know is injuring our character and our prospects,
and even what we know will bring us pain and sorrow later! We
know that our eternal happiness depends upon our keeping the
commandments, yet we continually allow carelessness, laziness,
cowardice, and selfishness to lead us to break them. We know
that our spiritual progress depends upon our learning about the
Lord and doing His will, yet we let ourselves become absorbed in
worldly pursuits and pleasures and neglect our regular reading of
the Word and the writings and our worship of the Lord. We know
that we are higher than animals just because we have spiritual
possibilities which they do not have, yet we choose to live on the
level of earthly satisfactions like animals. We think Esau was very
foolish, but we do as he did every day.

We have seen that Esau pictures good, and Jacob truth, in the
natural plane of our minds. We should all agree that the really
important
thing is to be good. Esau is the elder twin and the
rightful head of the family. Why then does the Lord permit Jacob
to supplant Esau? Why do we have to try to keep on learning
truth, studying the Word and trying to understand it more and
more deeply? If we do what we think is right, is not this all that
can be expected of us? Many people today answer this question
in the affirmative. Yet have we not often done what we thought
was right and found out afterward that it was just the wrong thing?
This is our key to the true answer. There is indeed some good in
everyone. The Lord has seen to that. But there is also in each of
us by our natural inheritance a great deal of evil, and we cannot
distinguish between good and evil without truth from the Lord.
If we think of ourselves as naturally good and as competent to
judge right and wrong without instruction from the Lord, we shall
judge and act from evil impulses qui~e as often as from good ones,
and presently we shall believe that whatever we think is true and
whatever we want is good, and then we shall be unable to see any
fault
in ourselves or to improve ourselves in any way. No matter
how well we are brought up, we never come to the point in this
life when we can safely act from impulse without thought, and
our standards are never perfect. Our wills are never wholly pure.
We must keep on learning more and more of the Lord's truth and
apply it to deeper and deeper states in ourselves. For all our time
on earth, Jacob must be the head of our house and Esau must
serve him. Not until we get to heaven, where our wills are wholly
satisfied to serve the Lord, will Esau be able to take his rightful
place.

JACOB AND ESAD

From the Writings of Swedenborg
Divine Providence, n. 234: "There are no laws of permission by themselves or
apart from the laws of the Divine providence, but the two are the same; there 
fore God is said to permit, which does not mean that He wills, but that on
account of the end, ~hich is salvation, He cannot avert. Whatever is done for
the sake of the end, which is salvation, is according to the laws of the Divine
providence. For the Divine providence . . . is constantly moving in a way
diverse from and contrary to man's will, continually intent upon its end; and
in consequence, at every movement of its operation or at every step of its
progress, where it observes man to be swerving from that end, it guides,
bends, and directs him according to its laws, by leading him away from evil
and leading him to good. That this cannot be done without the permission
of evil will be seen in what follows. Moreover, nothing can be permitted
without a reason, and the reason can be found only in some law of the Divine
providence, which law teaches why it is permitted."

== JACOB'S DREAM
Genesis 28

We have three easy points of connection between this story and
those which have preceded it, points which help us to review.
And we must review regularly if we are to present the Bible as
a continued story and not just as a number of separate stories.
The three points are: first, Jacob's relation to Isaac and to Abra 
ham; second, the place Haran; and third, the place Bethel.

Doctrinal Points
The Lord is always present with us and watching over us.
The Word is the connecting link between man and the Lord.
We find the basis of our faith in the truths of the letter of the

Word.

Anointing with oil is the symbol of confirming truth by loving it.

Notes for Parents

This beautiful story is familiar to us all. We can picture the
young man Jacob starting out on a long journey all by himself
with no certainty as to where he would get food or how he would
prosper, and also with the knowledge of the wrong he had done
his brother and of his brother's anger. He could not have been in
a very happy state of mind. We all have times when we are very
much like Jacob. We too do wrong and carry burdens on our
conscience, and we too often have to start out on new under 
takings with very little assurance as to how. things will turn out
for us.

Have you ever thought how many stories there are in the Bible
which concern sleep? Swedenborg tells us that the reason why we
need so much sleep is that when we are asleep our minds are taken
off the things of this world and of our own success and desires,
and the Lord can draw closer to us and renew our souls. Our souls

JACOB'S DREAM

need sleep even more than our bodies do. Little children need
a great deal of sleep because it is in infancy and early childhood
that
the Lord stores up in them states of trust and innocence
which will help them all their lives.

So Jacob had a wonderful dream which gave him hope and
courage and led him to promise to serve the Lord all his life.
Jacob's dream is a picture of something we may have in pur own
lives which will give us courage and strength to face all our prob 
lems and troubles if only we will take advantage of it. The Bible
is our "Jacob's ladder." Its foot is on the earth; that is, it is written
in terms of everyday life, which we can understand. But its top
is in heaven, and the Lord is there at the top. The ascending angels
are our thoughts going up to Him as we read it and the angels
that are descending on it are His truths which He speaks to us
through it.

Primary

Teach the children the three names in the series Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
We can try also to teach them Haran and Bethel, which should be somewlia""t
familiar from earlier stories. There will be no trouble in interesting them in
the story of the dream, and they will probably be able to repeat it. Emphasize
the fact that the Holy Land was the real home of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob,
so that Jacob hated to leave it and was looking forward to coming back.
It will also be a good thing to have them learn the names of the wives of
Abraham and Isaac. Particularly connect Jacob's setting up of the stones after
his dream with Abraham's building an altar at the same place. Tell them that
Bethel means "house of God."

Isaac grew up to become a great man, as his father had been.
His wife's name was Rebekah, and she was the granddaughter of
Abraham's brother Nahor, who had settled in a place called Haran.
Isaac and Rebekah had twin sons, Jacob and Esau. You know
that most twins look very much alike. But Jacob and Esau were
very different in looks and also in character, and they didn't get
together. So when they grew old enough, Isaac and
along well
Rebekah thought it would be a good thing to separate them for
a while.

They sent Jacob to Haran to visit his uncle Laban. They hoped,
too, that he would find a wife there. Abraham and Isaac had both
been told by the Lord that they and their family ought not to
marry any of the women who lived about them in the land of
Canaan, because these women worshiped idols instead of the Lord.
The journey to Haran was a long journey for young Jacob to
take alone, and he was not very sure that he would be safe on the
way and would be able to find enough to eat. And then, too, Jacob
loved his own home and wanted most of all to be sure he would
return to it.

What was one of the places where Jacob stopped for the night?
What did he use for a pillow?
What did he see in his dream?
What did the Lord tell him?
How did Jacob feel when he woke?
What did he call the place?
Bethel means "house of God."
What did Jacob do with the stones he had used for his pillow?
Do you remember someone else who had built an altar at Bethel?
What did Jacob promise the Lord?

The dream gave him courage for the long journey, because it
showed him that the Lord was near him all the time and watching
over him. The Lord is near us all the time, too, watching over us
and taking care of us.

And we, too, have a Jacob's ladder which connects us with Him.
Do you know what it is?
It is the Word.
When we study the Word, our thoughts go up to the Lord and the Lord's
thoughts come down to us, just like the angels ascending and descending
on the ladder.
Do you know that the word angel means "messenger"?

Junior

The meaning of the "ladder" can easily be taught to children of this age,
and they will find it a new and striking way of thinking of the Bible. The

JACOB'S DREAM

correspondence of stones and of oil can also be given. Have them locate Beer 
sheba, Bethel, and Haran on a map. By now they should be able to recall the
past events connected with Haran and Bethel. Be sure they know the meaning
of the word "angel." Have them look up the last book in the Old Testament
and tell them the meaning of its name.

Isaac and Rebekah had twin sons, Esau and Jacob. Jacob was
the one through whom the Hebrew nation was to be carried on;
so Isaac sent him also to Haran to find a wife. He traveled all
alone, and we find that when he started, he was not even sure
that he would be able to find food and clothing.

How did the Lord encourage him?
Where was he when he had this wonderful dream?
Who had built an altar there a long time before?
What story have we had about something that happened at Bethel?
Bethel means "house of God."
Why do you think Jacob named it that?

Can you tell

the story of Jacob's dream? The Hebrew word
translated "ladder" means a "way of steps." Jacob was lying on
the earth with his head on a stone.

Who was at the top of the ladder?
Who were going up and down on it?
The word translated "angel" means "messenger."

Do you know that there really is a "way of steps" between us
and the Lord? We are on the earth living every day, working and
playing and going to school. And we think of the Lord as in
heaven. But every time we read the Bible our thoughts go up
toward the Lord and His thoughts come down to us. The Bible
is our "Jacob's ladder." Stones on which things are built represent
truths. The stones at the foot of Jacob's ladder are the truths we
learn in the Bible. Our thoughts are the "angels" or messengers
going up, and the Lord's thoughts are the angels coming down.

How did Jacob feel about his dream?
What did he do to mark the place?
What did he pour on the stone?

The people of Jacob's time knew from tradition-that 1S, from
things which had been passed down from father to son for many
centuries-that there was something holy about olive oit and that
to pour it on anything meant to make the thing holy. This was
called "anointing." People in the beginning knew that oil meant
true love comes from the Lord. When we do
love and that all
anything for someone, if we put love into the doing, the Lord is
in it through us, and the service is holy. We want to remember
what anointing means and why, because we shall have many cases
of it in our study of the Bible. Do you know the twenty-third
Psalm? Look it up and read verse 5.

What did the Lord promise Jacob?
What did Jacob promise the Lord?

Both these promises were kept.

Intermediate

The spiritual meaning of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob should be taught at this
point, as well as the general meaning of Jacob's journey and the particular
correspondences of the dream. Stress Jacob's need of this encouragement, and
our need of the Word to strengthen us for our daily living.

Isaac and Rebekah had twin sons, Esau and Jacob. Esau was
the firstborn, but it was Jacob through whom Abraham's line was
to descend. Esau and Jacob were not identical twins, and they did
not get along well together. Jacob had to be sent away to escape
the anger of Esau, whom he had tricked. Jacob's journey grew out
of this incident, but it was also planned that he, like his father,
should take a wife in Haran.

The journey was a long one for a young man to take alone,
and there were no hotels along the way as there would be today.
Jacob slept outdoors wherever he happened to be when night fell.
From his words near the end of our chapter, we know that when
he lay down to sleep at Bethel he was not feeling very confident
about the future. But the dream showed him that the Lord was
watching over him, and gave him new courage.

Bethel was one of the places where Abraham built an altar when

JACOB'S DREAM

he first came into the land, and it was also the place where Abram
and Lot decided to separate and from which they looked over the
land so that Lot might choose the part he preferred. It is called
Bethel throughout
the Bible story, but apparently the name was
actually given it first by Jacob. Bethel means "house of God."
The stones which Jacob took for his pillow picture truths,
the
foundation truths of the Word on which we may rest with confi 
dence. And in the morning Jacob set up these stones for a pillar
to mark the place where the Lord had encouraged him and given
him a promise and where he also had made a promise to the Lord.
Both these promises were kept.

The ladder is the most striking part of the story. The Hebrew
word translated "ladder" means a "way"-the translators evidently
assumed that a way from earth to heaven must be a ladder,
especially since the angels were said to be ascending and descend 
ing on it. And the word translated "angel" means "messenger."
Can you think what is the "way" by which our angels or messen 
gers go up to the Lord and His angels come down to us? It is the
Word. The angels are our thoughts and the Lord's thoughts. The
foot of the way is on the earth. That is,
the Word is written in
human language and in terms of things we can understand. But
the top. Jacob's lying down to sleep on stones of
the Lord is at
the place is a picture of our trusting in what we have learned of
the Lord even when we feel alone and afraid. But after his dream,
the same stones up for a pillar of remembrance and
Jacob set
poured oil on them. When we really see how the Word connects
us with the Lord, we go forward without fear and we love to
think of the truth He has given us. Oil corresponds to love. The
custom of "anointing" or pouring oil upon something to signify
that it was holy had come down from the times of the Ancient
Church, when men knew correspondences. We shall find many
instances of it in the Word, and even in our own day it is a part of
the ceremony carried out in the coronation of kings and queens.
In the dream the Lord made a promise to Jacob, and Jacob 
after he woke and set up the pillar-made a solemn vow to the
Lord. This exchange of promises is a "covenant." The Lord's
promise is made to all of us just as much as to Jacob, and if we
make Jacob's vow and keep it,
the Lord will fulfill His promise
to us as surely as He did to Jacob. Sometimes people wonder why
the Lord should have prospered Jacob, who was obviously such
a faulty person. But the story should encourage us very much,
for it shows that if we study the Word and try to live according to
its precepts, then we too-who are full of faults-can eventually
reach our heavenly home, and that the Lord is always close to us
trying to show us the true way.

Basic Correspondences
stone = truth
oil = love

Senior

The deeper meaning of Jacob in relation to Abraham and Isaac is especially
useful for young people of this age, as well as the need of going back to Haran
to renew our childlike good intentions, but with a view always to becoming
more and more serviceable to the Lord-coming back to the Holy Land.

This is one of the most striking and best-loved stories in the
Bible. The picture is so clear that it has inspired artists: Jacob lying
on the ground with his head on the stone, the shining ladder or
"way" stretching up to heaven, the bright forms of angels ascend 
ing and descending on it, and a suggestion of the Lord's figure in
the radiance at the top.

In the inner meaning the vision is still more beautiful. We know
that stones represent truths. Truth is sometimes hard, yet we can
always depend upon it. When we are in doubt or fear and are
entering upon a new course which may bring us into difficulties
and dangers, we can have confidence in the truths which we have
learned from the Word, knowing that if we keep the Command 
ments with a desire to serve the Lord, we shall be given strength
to meet whatever comes. In the series Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob,
Abraham represents the time when we are very little children,

JACOB'S DREAM

trusting wholly in our parents and knowing no law except obedi 
ence to them; Isaac represents the time when our reasoning faculty
is developing and we are trying to decide what is right and wrong
according to what we can learn from the Word with the help
of our parents and teachers; and Jacob represents the time when
we are beginning our independent lives, not perhaps entirely grown
up yet, but no longer directly under our parents' control and
guidance. So this journey of Jacob in its inner meaning comes
very close to the experience of young people just leaving home
for college or just beginning to earn their living. At this time we
look forward eagerly to the future and yet we are a little anxious,
a little fearful of our own powers, and in the back of our minds
is the wish for assurance that someone is taking care of us still.
We need Jacob's dream to encourage and sustain us.

What is our "way" from earth to heaven? It is the Word of God,
which connects earth with heaven and man with God. Its foot is
on the earth, the letter of the Word, written in human language
about the earth and the people on it. At the top of the way is the
Lord: "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God,
and the Word was God." What are the angels? We remember that
the word "angel" means "messenger." Every time we open the
Word with a sincere desire to learn of the Lord, our "angels" begin
to come down to us. And it was during the dream that the Lord
spoke to Jacob and promised him that he should return to his land
in time and that the land would be his. As we read the Word,
its promises speak to us clearly, telling us that if we are faithful
heaven will be ours, whatever our experiences in life may be.

When Jacob woke in the morning, his first reaction was awe.
He realized that the Lord was not far away and unheeding, but
present with him and watching over him. He promised to serve
the Lord, and he set up the hard stones on which he had been
lying as a pillar of remembrance and a witness of the covenant
between himself and the Lord. In the same way, when we have
once had a vision of what is in the Word, the truths of the letter
stand in our minds as assurances,· proved by experience. And we,
like Jacob, "pour oil upon them"; that is, we love them and think
of them as holy, and begin to yield willing service instead of
obedience prompted by self-interest, in hope of reward or fear
of punishment. Jacob's promise to give the Lord a tenth of all he
received represents acknowledgment that all we have is from the
Lord and should be used in His service. This is the meaning of the
"tithe," which has played a prominent part in church finances
even to this day.

We should learn to remember, whenever we seem to be alone
and facing difficulties and perhaps dangers, that the Lord is really
close to us, and that we can see Him if we go to His Word, lift our
thoughts to Him, and try to learn what He has to say to us. Jesus,
as He was about to leave His disciples, said: "Remember! I will be
with you always, to the end of the age." (Matthew 28: 20)

Adult

After the general meaning of the story, possible points of special interest may
be the reason for going to Haran for wives, the reason why Isaac himself was
not allowed to go there while Jacob was, and the meaning of "angel."

We recall that when Isaac grew up, Abraham sent his servant to
Haran to find a wife from among his own kindred, and that the
servant brought back Rebekah,
the granddaughter of Abraham's
brother Nahor. Isaac and Rebekah had twin sons, Esau and Jacob.
They represent the will and the understanding on the natural plane.
Swedenborg says (AC 1893): "There are in every man an internal
man, a rational man that is intermediate, and an external, which
is properly called the natural man. With the Lord these were rep 
resented by Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob." The Abraham stage with
us is our infancy, when the internal man is open to the heavens
and is filled by the Lord with "remains"-innocent, trustful, happy
states which can later be used in our regeneration. Then we develop
into the rational, or Isaac, stage; and finally we are ready to carry
out in everyday life the knowledges and affections which we have
developed in the previous stages. The rest of our lives is spent, if

JACOB'S DREAM

we regenerate, in bringing into order first this natural or external
plane and then successively the rational and the internal plane.
So, although Abraham and Isaac come first and in one sense are
higher than Jacob,
their descendants are called the seed of Jacob
or the children of Israel (Israel being Jacob's later name) and their
history occupies the rest of the Old Testament. Esau was the
firstborn, and we readily recall
the story of how Jacob cheated
him first of his birthright and then of his blessing. Esau was the
firstborn of the twins because Esau represents the will; Jacob, the
understanding; and the will actually comes first. All power is from
the will, even the power to think. But throughout most of our
lives Jacob supplants Esau because we have to learn what is right
before we can do it. It is only late in life that Esau begins to break
off the yoke of his brother-that is, when by long practice in doing
is good. Esau and his
the truth we finally come to love what
in the Bible
descendants (the Edomites) play only a small part
narrative. This is because that narrative is concerned with our
life in this world, when for the most part we must be under the
guidance of truth.

After Jacob had stolen Esau's blessing, Esau threatened to kill
him, and his mother Rebekah persuaded Isaac to send him to
Haran to find a wife from the family of her brother Laban. We
recall
that Haran was the place where Abraham and his family
stopped for a time on their journey from Ur to Canaan, that Abra 
ham's brother Nahor settled there, and that Abraham's father,
Terah, died there. Terah represents the old, idolatrous state; and
Haran, the first stage of our progress toward a really good life,
before we have reached any real understanding of the truth. That
is, Haran represents good and truth of a very external kind, or
goodness in an obscure state. Yet this simple goodness is the begin 
ning of all our spiritual progress, and we must constantly be going
back and renewing in ourselves this fundamental desire to "be
good." Abraham was told by the Lord on no account to allow
Isaac himself to go back to Haran; yet Jacob was sent there and
spent twenty years there. The reason for this is found in the differ-
ence in correspondence between Isaac and Jacob. Isaac represents
the true rational, which must remain in the Holy Land of spiritual
thinking and lift external and natural knowledges up to itself, as
Rebekah was brought out of Haran to the Holy Land to Isaac.
Jacob, on the other hand, represents the Lord's working on the
natural plane of our lives: so he necessarily must spend a great deal
of time in Haran and must unite himself to affections on that
plane. We live on the natural plane of thought most of the time.
In that plane we try to do right, to distinguish between right and
wrong, to form good habits, and gradually to bring that plane up
to the level set by the Lord's own example when He lived in the
flesh. This is Jacob living in Haran, marrying there, having children,
and accumulating flocks and herds-but always with the knowledge
that eventually he was to take them all back with him to the Holy
Land.

Jacob knew he was to come back to the Holy Land because
the Lord told him so in the dream which is the subject of our
lesson for today, and at the same time the Lord promised him
that land for his inheritance. This dream was given him at Bethel.
Bethel, the site of the second altar which Abraham built after he
entered the Holy Land, pictures a heavenly state in which there is
knowledge of celestial things. Jacob's tarrying here is a picture of
spiritual preparation for daily life. It was toward evening-the end
of the former state-and he took some of the stones of the place
for his pillows and lay down to sleep; that is, he rested upon
fundamental heavenly truths, and his consciousness of worldly
things was for a time suspended. Then he saw the vision of the
ladder or "way" reaching from earth to heaven, with the Lord at
the top and the angels ascending and descending upon it; and the
Lord spoke to him, promising him protection and favor.

Jacob's dream is always a beautiful and appealing picture, and
it is all the more beautiful when we see its deeper meaning. What
is the "way" which connects earth with heaven and the Lord?
It is the Word. Its letter is made up of things of earth and is read
and learned by us while we are upon this earth. But within and

JACOB'S DREAM

above the letter are meanings, higher and higher-first about the
history of man as a race, then about the development of each one's
soul, then about the angels and their life-and highest of all about
the Lord's own life and work. From the letter our thoughts can
ascend gradually to some knowledge of the Lord Himself; and
once we have gained this knowledge, the Lord's spirit and teaching
can reach down to us and instruct us even in the little things of
life on earth. Perhaps we recall that angel means "messenger."
the same word is used of earthly and of
In the Old Testament
heavenly messengers, and Malachi,
the name of the last book of
the Old Testament, means "my messenger." The same is true of
the Greek word used in the New Testament. Literally, John the
Baptist sent "angels" to the Lord to ask if He really was the
Messiah. Can we not see our thoughts-like messengers from our
minds-climbing up by means of the Word to the Lord, and his
thoughts-like messengers-coming down to us through it? We are
at the bottom; the Lord is at the top. And if we listen to the Word,
we can hear the voice of the Lord telling us that the Holy Land of
heavenly life is meant for us, and that He is with us and will keep
us wherever we go. But in order to have this vision, we must be in
a state in which we rest on the foundation truths of our faith and
put our concern for ourselves and the world to sleep.

Jacob needed this vision to keep him from becoming absorbed
in the life of Haran. We need it to keep us mindful that heaven
is our real home, and to keep us from becoming absorbed in the
duties, cares, and pleasures of everyday life in the world. And
when Jacob awoke, realizing that he had been granted a vision of
the Lord, he set up the stone upon which he had rested as a pillar
and poured oil upon it and vowed to serve the Lord and to give
Him a tenth of all he should possess. This is a picture of what our
reaction should be to the realization that the Word is our means
of connection with the Lord. In our lives we should set up the
simple, fundamental truths-the Commandments-as our testimony
that we are to serve the Lord, and we should put love into the
keeping of them, as Jacob poured oil on the pillar. And we should
promise to obey the Lord, to worship Him, and to make every 
thing that we have holy, recognizing that it comes from Him, by
using it as He would have us use it; this is pictured by the giving
of tithes.

From the Writings of Swedenborg

Doctrine of the Holy Scripture, n. 78: "It is through the Word that the Lord
is present with a man and is conjoined with him, for the Lord is the Word,
and as it were with the man in it. The Lord is also Divine truth itself, as
likewise is the Word. From this it is evident that the Lord is present with
a man and is at the same time conjoined with him, according to his under 
standing of the Word, for according to this the man has truth and the deriva 
tive faith, and also love and the derivative life. The Lord is indeed present
with a man through the reading of the Word, but He is conjoined with him
through the understanding of truth from the Word, and according thereto;
and in proportion as the Lord has been conjoined with a man, in the same
proportion the church is in him. The church is within man; the church that is
outside of him is the church with a number of men who have the church
within them. This is meant by the Lord's words to the Pharisees who asked
when the kingdom of God would come: 'The kingdom of God is within you.'
(Luke 17:21) Here the 'kingdom of God' means the Lord, and from Him,
the church. I t

The early part of the story of Jacob and Esau and the incident
at Haran should be reviewed very briefly. Then ask the pupils
about the story of Jacob's dream, and go on from there to the
lesson for today.

Doctrinal Points
The three planes of life: will, thought, and act, with their technical

names: celestial, spiritual, and natural.
The order of development of these planes.
The natural plane has an internal and an external.
No act is genuinely good unless the motive within it is unselfish

love for the Lord and the neighbor.

Notes for Parents

Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob are called the "patriarchs." The Jews
looked to them as the fathers of their race. They were also reg 
ularly called in the Bible the "children of Israel." Israel is another
name for Jacob. The story of how Jacob came by this name is
found in Genesis 32: 24-28.

You will remember that Jacob had to be sent away to visit his
uncle Laban at Haran because he had taken away from his twin
brother Esau-who was the firstborn-both the birthright and the
blessing which Esau should have had, and Esau had threatened to
kill him. Does it seem strange that the Lord should have allowed
one who would do such things to become his father's heir and
head of the family? If it does, we should think whether our lives
have always been such that we deserve the blessings which the
Lord has given us. There is only one perfect character in the Bible
and that is the Lord Jesus. All the others are men and women like
ourselves, with faults as well as virtues. The Psalmist writes: "If

JACOB'S WIVES AND SONS

thou, Lord, shouldest mark iniquities, 0 Lord, who shall stand?"
And yet Jacob's sins were not without consequences to him.
He was the home-loving one of the twins, and he had to leave his
home and spend twenty years serving his uncle Laban in Haran.
He carried his fear of Esau all that time, as we learn from the story
of his return in Genesis 32 and 33. If we repent, the Lord forgives
our sins, but no sin is ever without consequences.

The story of Jacob's meeting and loving Rachel, of his long
service for her, of his being given Leah first, and of the birth of
his twelve sons is a true story, but it is also a parable. It teaches us
how a young person, as he starts out in life, catches a glimpse of
an ideal and begins to work eagerly for its achievement, and then
finds the way unexpectedly long and hard, beset by difficulties
if he is faithful and patient, he will
and disappointments. Yet
finally reach his goal. We should remember this lesson as we try
to help our children choose their life work, and we should also
remember that they will find lasting happiness in their work only
if they undertake it with the motive of service to the Lord and
the neighbor in their hearts. Work done for self never brings happi 
ness or spiritual growth.

Primary
As you talk about the lesson, repeat the names Jacob, Leah, and Rachel as
often as possible so that the children will become familiar with them. They
should also hear about Jacob's long stay in Haran and the fact that he had
twelve sons. Mention Joseph as the last son born in Haran, and the fact that
Benjamin was not born until after they returned to the Holy Land.

Isaac and Rebekah had twin sons, Jacob and Esau. Even though
they were twins,
they were not at all alike, and as they grew up
they did not get along well together. Once Esau even threatened
to kill Jacob. So Isaac and Rebekah sent Jacob away on a visit to
Rebekah's old home in Haran.

Do you remember the story of the dream Jacob had on the way?
When he came to Haran, where did he stop first?
Who came out to water her father's flock?

==== GENESIS 29; 35:23-26

How did Laban receive Jacob?
What other daughter did Laban have?
What did Jacob ask of Laban?
When the seven years were over, Laban deceived Jacob and gave him Leah
instead of Rachel.
So Jacob served another seven years for Rachel.
After that he served another six years, and took his pay in sheep and cattle.
How many years does that make altogether?
Leah bore Jacob six sons.
She also gave Jacob her handmaid Zilpah, who bore him two sons.
Rachel's handmaid Bilhah bore him two sons.

Eleven sons were born to him in Haran and a twelfth after he got
back to the Holy Land. Only the last two were the children of
Rachel, the wife whom Jacob loved best.

,-

These last two were Joseph and Benjamin. Joseph was the last
one born in Haran. Benjamin was born near Bethlehem. Do you
know who else was born at Bethlehem a long time afterward?
It was the Lord, when He came into the world to show us how
we ought to live.

Junior

Get as much of the review as possible from the children themselves. Then
cover rapidly the whole story of Jacob's sojourn in Haran, of his wives and
sons, and of his return to the Holy Land. Have the children look up Genesis
32:24-28 so that they will learn that Jacob and Israel are the same person.
It is important to fix this fact in their minds. They should also be told of
Benjamin's birth and Rachel's death near Bethlehem, and about the cave of
Machpelah where the three patriarchs and their wives were buried. Two simple
lessons should be stressed: Jacob's tendency to think of himself in everything
he did, and its long-lasting results; and the fact that we have to work long
and patiently to attain anything that is really worthwhile, and that our work
should always be done from the desire to be useful to the Lord and the
neighbor.

Our lesson today takes us to Haran again. You will remember
that Isaac and Rebekah had twin sons, Esau and Jacob; that Esau,
who was the firstborn and so should have been his' father's heir,
sold his birthright to Jacob; and that afterward Jacob, with his

– Anita Dole Bible Study Notes Volume 1 –© 2001 by The Swedenborg Foundation. Scanned by Bayside Church. Used on www.newchurchvineyard.org by permission.

JACOB'S WIVES AND SONS

mother's help, deceived his father and stole Esau's blessing, and
so had to be sent away to escape Esau's wrath. You will remember,
too, about the dream Jacob had at Bethel on his way to Haran, and
about the promise he made to serve the Lord if the Lord would
prosper him and bring him safely home again.

We find now that Rebekah's brother Laban has become the head

of the family in Haran.

Where did Jacob stop ftrst when he came to Haran?
What did he find at the well?
What did the shepherds tell him?
Who came to the well with Laban's flock?
How did Laban receive Jacob?
What other daughter did Laban have?
Which one did Jacob love?
How many years did he fust serve for her?
At the end of the seven years how did Laban deceive him?
What excuse did Laban give?
How much longer did Jacob have to serve for Rachel?

Things do not always turn out just as we expect. Jacob had to
learn this. He had made a bargain with the Lord and he had made
one with Laban. When we do our work just for what we expect
to get out of it for ourselves, we are often disappointed in the,
result. We need to learn to work for the love of being useful to
others and to the Lord. Then our enjoyment in our work is a
constant and lasting thing.

The people of this period had no feeling that it was wrong to
have more than one wife at a time. So Jacob had two wives and
two "concubines"-servants who also bore him children. He had
in all twelve sons. You need not learn all their names at once, but
you should read the list over often and become familiar with the
names, for they appear constantly in the Bible story from this
point on, since they became the heads of the twelve tribes of
Israel.

Israel is another name for Jacob. EI is one of the Hebrew words
for God. Israel means "one who prevails with God." In the Bible
story, Jacob. is sometimes called Jacob and sometimes Israel, and

==== GENESIS 29; 35:23-26

when you are older, you will learn why this is so; for nothing in
the Word is ever accidental. All through their history in the Bible
the Jews are commonly called the "children of Israel."

Of Jacob's twelve sons six were the children of Leah: Reuben,
Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, and Zebulun; and Leah also had
a daughter, whose name was Dinah. Two of Jacob's sons, Dan and
Naphtali, were the children of Rachel's handmaid Bilhah; and two,
Gad and Asher, were the children of Leah's handmaid Zilpah. The
two youngest sons, Joseph and Benjamin, were Rachel's children.
Joseph was the last one born in Haran. After serving Laban four 
teen years for Leah and Rachel, Jacob served him six years more
for wages, which he received in sheep and cattle, and then he
returned to the Holy Land. Benjamin was born in the Holy Land
not far from Bethlehem. The story of his birth is found in Genesis
35: 16-20.

The few verses from chapter 35 which we have as part of our
lesson give the full list of Jacob's twelve sons. It is good to remem 
ber where you may find them. Padan-aram (Genesis 35: 26) is a
name for the plain in which Haran is situated. This -part of the
country was afterward Syria, and Aram is another name for Syria.
It is also called Mesopotamia, a word which means "between the
rivers," because it lies in the triangle between the Tigris and Eu 
phrates rivers.

Jacob stayed with Laban at Haran for twenty years altogether,
and yet when he returned home he was still very much afraid that
Esau would try to kill him. When we have done harm to someone,
one of our punishments is that we have to live with a sense of fear.
But Esau, who was the one wronged, had long since forgiven Jacob
and welcomed him with open arms. Jacob got back to Hebron in
time to see his father Isaac again before he died. We are not told
in the Bible just when Rebekah died, but in connection with the
story of Jacob's own death in Genesis 49:28-33, we learn that
Abraham and Sarah, Isaac and Rebekah, Jacob and Leah were all
buried in the cave of Machpelah, which Abraham had bought from
the Hittites for a family burial place when Sarah died. Rachel died

when Benjamin was born, and was buried near Bethlehem.

Intermediate
lessons for this age group are the general meaning of the
The important
patriarchs as the three planes of our lives, and that these planes develop in
order; then that nothing is really accomplished until will and thought are
expressed in act; that
the plane of conduct has its internal as well as its
external; and finally that the external of the natural must be brought into
order before any genuine spiritual affections and thoughts can be produced.

Jacob is the third -of the men who are called "patriarchs";
Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. In our lesson about Hagar and Ishmael
we spoke of the three planes of our lives: will, thought, and act.
Everything we do involves all three. We must have some desire
before we even think of doing a thing; then we must think about
how to do it; and finally we must actually do it, or o~ desire and
thought come to nothing. Again and again in the Bible we find
groups of three which picture these three planes in one order or
another. Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob represent them in the order of
their development. Abraham pictures our infancy and little child 
hood when we are governed by our desires, Isaac our later child 
hood and early youth when our minds are being developed and
trained, and Jacob our later youth when we are beginning to take
up active duties in the world. More technical names for these three
planes are celestial, spiritual, and natural. So in the development
of a good life-the subject of the Bible in its internal sense-we
have to pass through these three stages: we first have to want to
be good, then we have to learn what is good, and finally we have
to do what we have learned to be right. The story of Jacob is the
story of the development of this outward or natural plane of good 
ness.

Jacob was by no means a model character. Like most of us, at
the start he had his own interests in view and was willing to serve
himself by getting the better of someone else. And even when his
wonderful vision of the ladder induced him to decide to serve the
Lord, he had his own safety and success in mind. We are all inclined

==== GENESIS 29; 35:23-26

to be selfish to begin with, and the Lord uses our very selfishness
as a means of inducing us to lead orderly lives.

The same lesson is repeated in another form in our chapter for
today. Jacob did reach Haran safely and stopped outside the city
the same well where Abraham's servant had found Rebekah.
at
The well, you remember, pictures the letter of the Word. When we
are trying to live good lives, our first stopping place must always
be the Word, for that is where the water of truth from the Lord
is found. As our chapter tells us, all the flocks must gather a~ this
well to drink. The sheep represent innocent and trustful affections.
In the Bible husbands represent goods and wives the affection
for the kind of truth which belongs with the particular good pic 
tured by their husbands. Isaac had to have a wife from Haran,
but Ishmael's wife-like his mother-was from Egypt. Our story
has a very interesting meaning which you will probably not find
too difficult to understand. Jacob meets Rachel at the well and
loves her at sight. He is willing to serve seven years for her, "and
they seemed unto him but a few days, for the love he had to her."
But when the seven years are over, he is given her sister Leah first
and has to serve seven more years for Rachel.*

Leah and Rachel both picture affection for truth, but for truth
of different kinds. Leah, the older, represents "the affection of
external truth" and Rachel "the affection of internal truth." Have
you ever had beautiful thoughts about growing up to be a wonder 
fully fine person whom everyone would love? This is Rachel. Per 
haps for a whole day you tried to be that kind of person and you
were very happy and the day went like the wind. But somehow
your beautiful ideal slipped away from you, and you began to find
doing right much less beautiful and desirable because it involved
so much everyday, plodding study and work. That is Leah,
the
"tender" (weak) eyed. Before we can attain the constant joy in
serving the Lord, we have to form the habit of doing what is right
even when we can't see clearly what it all leads to.

*although she was given to him after one week (see Genesis 29:27-28).

JACOB'S WIVES AND SONS

And this brings us to the sons of Jacob. In the Bible the birth
of children pictures the producing of truth and good. As Jacob
represents genuine goodness in the natural or outward plane of
life, his twelve sons represent all the different goods and truths
which can be produced in our souls by a good outward life, lived
from the desire to serve the Lord. The sons of Leah are born first 
faith and love and good deeds and good will of an external kind.
Next are the sons of the two handmaids-lesser truths and goods
which serve the higher ones. Last of all are born the sons of Rachel
-true interior love and understanding, which are the means of our
salvation and regeneration or rebirth as spiritual instead of merely
worldly people. It is a long process, but that is just what our life
in the world is for.

Study carefully the chart which shows the sons of Jacob with
their mothers, and remember where it is for reference, because the
twelve sons are the heads of the twelve tribes of Israel. Israel is
another later name for Jacob (read Genesis 32:24-28). The names
and correspondence of the twelve sons playa constant part in the
Bible story, the last mention of them being in Revelation 21: 12,
where we find them written on the gates of the New Jerusalem.
We cannot take them up individually now, but we shall study some
of them in connection with later lessons. The order in which they
are born is the order in which they develop in our lives if we are
progressing spiritually, and when we are discouraged with our
progress it may help us to remember that the highest goods and
truths were the very last to be born. We shall have more to say
about Joseph in our next
lesson. He was the last one born in
Haran. Benjamin was born after they returned to the Holy Land.

JACOB'S WIVES AND SONS

Leah = the affection of external truth
Rachel = the affection of internal truth

the twelve sons = all things of truth and good which

can be developed in our lives

Senior

The three planes of life and the order of their development should be stressed
and then the fact that after these are developed, the natural plane must be
brought
into order before regeneration can proceed to higher planes. The
difference between seeing an ideal and achieving it is an important point.
But most important for this age is the point that our occupations should be
chosen and pursued from the motive of service to the Lord and the neighbor
rather than from the motive of self-advancement.

Each new development in our lives-both in our general progress
and in every particular achievement-follows the same pattern.
There must first be a desire in our will. We never do anything
without some motive, good or bad. Then the desire must take
form in our thought, and the means to accomplish it must be
worked out by our reasoning powers. Finally, the desire and the
thought must find expression in action if they are to accomplish
anything. These three stages, with reference to our spiritual devel 
opment and progress, are pictured by the three patriarchs, Abra 
Isaac, and Jacob. Jacob represents the outward or natural
ham,
plane of achievement. We ought to "want to be good." We ought
to learn from the Word what is right and to think about how we
should live in order to fulfill the Lord's purposes for us. But the
desire and thought get us nowhere spiritually except as we actually
do from day to day what we have found is right. And we all know
from experience that it is not always an easy matter to carry out in
our outward conduct our highest intentions and thoughts. Making
the outward life heavenly is a long, slow process.

Jacob, as you may remember, was not an exemplary character.
He deceived his father and stole his brother's blessing ~nd left
home under a cloud, in fear of Esau's vengeance, a fear which
stayed with him through his whole twenty-year sojourn in Haran.

==== GENESIS 29; 35:23-26

The promise he made to serve the Lord, following the wonderful
dream which he had at Bethel near the beginning of his journey,
was given on condition that the Lord would make his journey
successful and bring him safely home again. And in our lesson
today we find that his service to his uncle Laban is a series of bar 
gains. It is his own interest which he obviously has first in mind.
This is a characteristic of the external life of everyone of us
before we are regenerated. We are born with tendencies to selfish 
ness, and in our first contacts with the world our efforts are cen 
tered on our external comfort and success. What happens to us in
this world seems to us the essential thing.

And yet the Lord sees to it that we all have glimpses of some 
thing higher. The innocent, trustful states of our infancy and the
instruction from the Word-direct or indirect-which we receive as
children, are stored up by Him in our subconscious mind as the
"remains" through which He can speak to us and help us. These
stay with us as Jacob's vision must have stayed with him, always
holding up an ideal which is higher than mere worldly success.

This fact is brought out by the story of Leah and Rachel, the
two daughters of Laban whom Jacob married. We remember that
daughters picture affections. Leah, the elder daughter, pictures the
affection for truth on the external plane of life. She is the elder
because this affection in us develops first, even when we know
that there is a higher one. We saw this fact in our study of Ishmael
and Isaac. This first affection does not see very far. Leah was
"tender" (weak) eyed. Rachel, who was beautiful and well favored,
is the affection for interior truth.

When Jacob stops at the well outside of Haran-which we re 
member pictures the Word in its letter-it is Rachel who comes
with her father's sheep, and with whom Jacob immediately falls
in love. When, with the intention of serving the Lord, we read the
Word, our innocent "remains," like the sheep, are brought to our
minds by the Lord and with them a delight in learning spiritual
truth, which we immediately accept as our ideal. But Jacob, we
remember, is goodness on the natural plane. He agrees to work

JACOB'S WIVES AND SONS

seven years for Rachel; the years pass quickly, but then he finds
that Leah is given him instead of Rachel, and he has to work seven
years more for Rachel. Isn't this just like our own experience?
We catch sight of a vision of a noble life and set out to attain it,
but when we think we deserve to have achieved our goal, we find
it still ahead of us.

Now comes the further lesson. Rachel was at first barren, and
it was Leah who bore Jacob's first four sons and two more later.
And each of the two handmaids also bore him two sons before
Rachel was able to have a child. We have already seen that the
birth of children pictures the bringing forth of truths and goods.
Rachel,
the affection for interior truths, must be our ideal from
the beginning, but for a long time it is the affection of external
truth and affections for the lesser knowledges that serve our prog 
ress in understanding which are productive in our lives. An example
may help: Suppose a boy 1 through his early associations in home
and church, catches a vision of the ministry as the work to which
he really wants to give his life. He starts out eagerly to work
toward that goal, but presently he finds that he must learn a great
many other things before he can even begin his theological studies,
and even after he becomes a minister, much of his work seems to
be of an external and routine character, and it is only after years
of patient service that he sees that he is beginning to accomplish
the spiritual uses to which he looked forward in the beginning.
In the choice of any life work, the ideal of service to the Lord
and the neighbor should always be present from the start, but the
achievement of the ideal is the work of a lifetime.

The twelve sons of Jacob represent "all truths and goods in
the complex." Complex is from a Latin word meaning to "braid
together." We sometimes speak of our modern life as being com 
plex. But we seldom stop to think how truly complex, how inter 
woven, are all our thoughts and affections, how different each
person's mind is from every other, and how our own minds vary
from hour to hour in respect to what motive and what thoughts
are uppermost and governing all the others. The twelve sons of

==== GENESIS 29; 35:23-26

Jacob are mentioned again and again in the Bible, and Swedenborg
tells us that the order in which they are mentioned in any given
place is very important in the interpretation of the events being
narrated. We cannot take them up individually in anyone lesson,
but one or another of them will come up from time to time as we
go on with our course.

As we should expect, Rachel's two sons, Joseph and Benjamin,
who were the last to be born, represent spiritual good and truth.
We shall follow this thought further when we study about Joseph.
Joseph was the last one born in Haran. Benjamin was born near
Bethlehem after Jacob and his family returned to the Holy Land.

Adult

Interesting discussion topics are: (1) the change in Jacob's correspondence as
his story progresses; (2) the necessity of developing an orderly outward life
as a basis for any higher development; (3) the difference between seeking
such a life for the sake of self and seeking it from the motive of love to the
Lord and the neighbor; (4) the difference between recognizing an ideal and
achieving it; (5) the general correspondence of the twelve sons of Jacob.

It should not confuse us to find the correspondence of Jacob
apparently changing, for it is the story of the beginning of our
achievement of the good external life and of its gradu~l develop 
ment from appar:ent to genuine good-that is, from a life which
is good in the eyes of our neighbors to one which is good in the
sight of the Lord.

With reference to A braham and Isaac, Jacob represents the time
in our lives when we are beginning to direct our own affairs inde 
pendently of our parents. If we have been developing in an orderly
way,
the simple, trustful states of our infancy have passed into
our subconscious, and we have also judged and put behind us the
boastful, self-confident state represented by Ishmael. Isaac, the
genuine rational, is head of our house. But Isaac is growing old.
This does not mean that we no longer have to think and reason,
the faculty is adequately developed and the time has

come when our primary business is its application to the outward
conduct of life.

For the successful pursuit of our new activities we must acquire
new truth but-as in the case of Isaac's marriage-this truth must
not be sought for mere selfish and worldly purposes. Jacob's wife,
like Isaac's, must be found in Haran. She must be an affection of
truth springing from the same primary source, our original deter 
mination to serve the Lord. This is an important point to keep
in mind in helping our children to begin their independent lives
rightly. Whatever occupation they may choose, it should be chosen
and pursued from a desire to serve the Lord and the neighbor
rather than merely to find a secure and remunerative place in this
world. In the historical interpretation, the representative church
of the Jews had to be established in the line of Terah, who, we
remember, signified the third and last Ancient Church.

There are differences between the story of Isaac's marriage and
the story of Jacob's which are interesting. Isaac, we recall, was not
under any circumstances to go to Haran himself. In the formative
years when your higher rational is being developed, it must never
be allowed to leave the Holy Land, the spiritual plane. Rebekah
had to be brought to Isaac. But Jacob is driven to leave the Holy
Land for a time in the search for his true wife. When we come to
work out our religion on the plane of outward conduct, we must
necessarily be concerned with external as well as with internal
truths. Another difference is in the fact that Rebekah came to the
well with her pitcher on her shoulder to draw water to be carried
home. The emphasis here is on the acquisition of truth from the
Word-the well-for later use. Rachel, on the other hand, came to
the well bringing her father's flock, of which she was the shepherd 
ess. As the family of Nahor, who left Dr with Terah and Abram
but went no farther than Haran, picture simple, uninstructed good 
ness and obedience, so the flock of Laban, Rachel's father, pic 
tures those who wish to be "led and taught" (AC 3795). Rachel,
therefore, represents a desire for truth for immediate, specific uses.
Swedenborg thus summarizes the meaning of the contents of

==== GENESIS 29; 35:23-26

in AC 3758 and 3759: "In the
chapter 29, one of our chapters,
is described the Lord's
internal sense of this chapter by 'Jacob'
natural-how the good of truth therein was conjoined with kindred
good from a Divine origin, which good is 'Laban'; at first through
truth, which is 'Rachel.'" And in AC
the affection of internal
3793 he says: "Jacob therefore now puts on the representation
of the natural, and Rachel the representation of truth; but as all
conjunction of truth with good is wrought by means of affection,
it is the affection of truth to be coupled with good that is rep 
resented by Rachel. Moreover in the natural, as in the rational,
there is an interior and an exterior; Rachel representing the affec 
tion of interior truth, and Leah the affection of exterior truth."
The whole story of Jacob's marriages and of the birth of his sons
is actually one of the orderly development of the good external
life-which must have an internal in order to be good. Rachcl is
the ideal, glimpsed at first and then labored for long and paticntly
with inevitable delays and disappointments on the way.

In AC 6335 occurs one of the simplest statements of the corrc 
spondence of the twelve sons as "all truths and goods in onc com 
plex." Another helpful definition of them is found in AC 6448:
"By them are described all states of the church as to goods and
truths, thus as to the spiritual life of everyone within the church."
like that of everything in the
Individually their correspondence,
Word, changes slightly with the order and context in which they
are mentioned. A very full statement of this variation in order of
the twelve is found in AC 3862 and a briefer one in AC 6335.
The general correspondence of the individual sons is briefly as
follows:

Reuben: faith.
Simeon: faith in the will.
Levi: charity.
Judah: the celestial church, or the Lord as to the Divine celcstial.
Zebulun:
Issachar: recompense from works.
Dan: those who are in the good of life from truth, but not yet

from good.

the spiritual church, the Lord as to the Divine spiritual.

Gad: works from truth and not yet from good.
Asher:
the blessedness of the affections.
Naphtali: temptation and the state after temptation.
Joseph:
Benjamin: the truth of the good of the spiritual church.
Joseph was the last one born in Haran. Benjamin was born near
Bethlehem after the return to the Holy Land, and Rachel died and
was buried there. It is interesting also to find that it was Leah and
not Rachel who was buried with Jacob in the cave of Machpelah
along with Abraham and Sarah, Isaac and Rebekah. Rachel was
Jacob's inspiring ideal, but Leah was apparently his true mate.

From the Writings of Swedenborg
Arcana Coelestia, n. 3819: "Leah is called the 'elder' because external truth
is Hrst learned, and Rachel is called the 'younger' because internal truth is
learned afterwards, or what is the same, man is Hrst affected with external
truths, and afterwards with internal ones; for external truths are the planes
of internal ones, being generals into which singulars are insinuated; for with 
out a general idea of a thing man comprehends nothing that is singular. This
is the reason why in the literal sense of the Word there are general, but in
the internal sense singular truths."

Genesis 35

This lesson requires more preparation on the part of the teacher
than some. The teacher should be sufficiently familiar with the
whole story of Jacob (Genesis 25: 19 through Genesis 34) so that
he can review it rather fully. He should also think out carefully
the particular points in the lesson for the day which he thinks can
be presented most interestingly and usefully to his class.

Doctrinal Points
The Lord uses even our selfishness at first to lead us to good.
Nothing in the Word is accidental or unimportant.
Everything comes to us first through our minds.
Nevertheless, our will is the primary cause of our thoughts as well

as of our acts.

Notes for Parents

.

One of the best-known stories in the Bible is the story of how
the lone young traveler Jacob slept one night in the open at Bethel
and was given a wonderful dream of a ladder set up on earth whose
top reached to heaven, and of the Lord at the top and angels
ascending and descending upon the ladder. And in the morning
Jacob vowed that if the Lord would prosper him and bring him
safely home again, he would always serve Him.

Jacob's desire then was only to be spared to come home. Yet
when he reached Haran, he immediately fell in love with his uncle's
daughter Rachel and forgot all about going home. He stayed in
Haran for twenty years. He became rich through serving his uncle,
and by his two wives, Rachel and her sister Leah, and their hand 
maids, Bilhah and Zilpah, he had eleven sons and one daughter.
This story is a picture of something which happens in the lives of
many young people. They are brought up in good homes, taken to
Sunday school and church, and given the religious principles they
need to guide them through life. Perhaps they join the church.
They mean to be faithful. But when they finish high school, they
leave home for college or for some occupation. They fall in love
and marry and take on the responsibility of providing for a grow 
ing family, and their minds and lives are so occupied with what
seem the necessities of life in the world that
their
early ideals.

they forget

But men have deeper and higher needs which the world cannot
meet. Sooner or later the man or woman who has been rightly
brought up remembers that this world is not his final home, and,
like the prodigal son in the parable, says: "I will arise and go to my
father." Our chapter today tells of Jacob's return, of his putting
away the false ambitions and worldly satisfactions he has been
striving for, and coming back to Bethel to fulfill his vow. Then he
is ready to be reunited to Isaac and to inherit the land promised
him by the Lord. In this story the Lord is telling each one of us
that if we will only realize how unsatisfying the things of the world
are and return home to Him, we shall be among those who hear
Him say: "Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom
prepared for you from the foundation of the world."

Primary

The younger children will not profit by so complete a review of Jacob's life
as the older ones. In the introduction, dwell on Jacob's dream more than on
the rest of the story, as the children may have some recollection of it, and it
connects naturally with the return to Bethel.

Jacob was his mother Rebekah's favorite.
Once she saved him from Esau's anger by persuading Isaac to send him on
a long visit to her brother Laban in Haran.

Jacob was welcomed by his uncle Laban and was so satisfied in
Haran that he stayed there for twenty years. In those days people
had forgotten that it is wrong for a man to have more than one
wife at a time. Jacob married two of Laban's daughters, Leah and
Rachel, and he had two other wives, who were the servants of

JACOB'S RETURN

Leah and Rachel-you may remember how Abraham had a son by
Hagar, Sarah's Egyptian handmaid.

Eleven sons and a daughter were born to Jacob in Haran.
The eleventh son was Joseph.
After Joseph's birth Jacob decided to go home with his family.
He stopped at Bethel, where he had had a wonderful dream on his way
to Haran.
What did the Lord promise him there?
What son was born to him near Bethlehem?
Who died there?
Joseph and Benjamin were Rachel's only children.
Where did Jacob find his father?
How old was Isaac when he died?
Esau and Jacob had become friends again.

Try to remember that the Lord gave Jacob a new name-Israel.
That is how the descendants of Jacob came to be called "the chil 
dren of Israel."

Junior
In this class review by questions and comments the whole factual story of
Jacob, as this is the age at which children should become thoroughly familiar
with the whole Bible story. Be sure the children look up the Bible references
in their notes and go over the names of the twelve sons of Jacob. Point out
on your own Bible map the four cities named in the chapter.

In Haran Jacob was welcomed by his uncle Laban and decided
to stay and work for him. He married two of Laban's daughters,
Leah and Rachel. The people of those times had forgotten that it
is wrong for a man to have more than one wife. Leah bore Jacob
six sons and a daughter. He had four more sons by Bilhah and
the handmaids of Rachel and Leah. Finally Rachel had a
Zilpah,
son, Joseph. Then Jacob decided to go back to his home in the
land of Canaan, after having lived in Haran for twenty years. He
was still afraid of Esau, but he found that Esau had long since
forgiven him and welcomed him gladly.

Do you remember the story of the wonderful dream which
Jacob had when he first left home-the dream of the ladder reach-

ing from earth to heaven, with the Lord at the top and angels as 
cending and descending upon it? Read in Genesis 28: 16-22 about
Jacob's vow. Bethel means "house of God." Now in our chapter
for today we learn how Jacob kept his vow.

Where did the Lord tell Jacob to go?
How did Jacob prepare his family for worship?
Who died at Bethel?
What other name did the Lord give Jacob?
What promise did the Lord make to him?
Who died near Bethlehem?
Who was born there?
Who else was born at Bethlehem hundreds of years later?

Benjamin was the twelfth and last of Jacob's sons. You will find
the names of all twelve in verses 23 to 26 of our chapter. You want
to read them and become familiar with them, because these twelve
sons became the heads of the "twelve tribes of Israel" about whom
we shall hear a great deal as we go on. You want also to remember
that Joseph and Benjamin were the last
two of the twelve, and
that they were the only children of Rachel, who was Jacob's favor 
ite wife.

Where did Jacob find his father Isaac living?
Who buried Isaac when he died?

Isaac was buried in the cave of Machpelah, which Abraham had
bought for a family burying place when Sarah died. After Isaac's
death Jacob became head of the family. Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob
are called the three patriarchs.

Intermediate

This class can be given the general correspondence of the Jacob period and
something of the application of the particular incidents in his history. The
important lesson for them in the chapter for the day is that mere worldly
success never satisfies the mind and heart and that when we realize this, we
must recognize and put away the thoughts and habits into which we have
fallen as a result of putting worldly ambitions first.

In the Bible story Abraham represents our spiritual state in our

infancy and very early childhood, and Isaac represents our state
when we are old enough to have learned our need of recognizing
the Lord's laws and have begun to form our judgments of right
and wrong according to them. If we are developing properly, we
should reach the Isaac stage before we are through high school.
But we know that after high school there is a time when we
have to think a great deal about how we are to get along in the
world. We leave horne and go to college or into some occupation
and, although we are not yet really grown up, we are pretty much
"on our own." This period is called the development of the natural
plane of life and is described in the stories about Jacob.

Jacob married the two daughters of Laban, Leah and Rachel,
who represent affections for exterior and interIor truths, and was
also given their two handmaids. By these four women he had one
daughter and twelve sons, only the last two of whom-Joseph and
Benjamin-were the children of Rachel, Jacob's first love. He also
became rich in flocks and herds. Jacob's sons picture the various
faculties which we develop in this period of beginning our inde 
pendent lives; and the flocks and herds, the abilities and knowl 
edges which corne to us.

Then suddenly after twenty years Jacob decided to go horne.
The young man or woman who is inwardly good cannot be satis 
fied just to enjoy his own success in the world. He knows that he
must take his possessions and abilities horne to his Father's house 
back to the service of the Lord.

The first

thing that happens in this homecoming-on the very
border of the land-is Jacob's reunion with Esau. Jacob, remember 
ing the wrong he had done Esau, was afraid, but Esau welcomed
him gladly. This pictures the time when we realize that our good
intentions and our understanding of the truth are really in har 
mony and can work together. Then comes our chapter for this
lesson. You remember that when Jacob left home, he slept one
night at Bethel and had the wonderful dream of the ladder reach 
ing to heaven, and that in the morning he vowed that, if the Lord
would prosper him and bring him safely home again, he would

==== GENESI S 35

worship and serve Him. So now that he has been prospered and
to Bethel, builds an altar there, and
brought back, he goes first
worships the Lord.

Two things come into the story before the altar can be built.
The first is easy to understand. All Jacob's people must put away
"the strange gods that were in their hand and all their earrings
which· were in their ears" and these were hidden "under the oak
which was by Shechem." In the first part of the Jacob period we
develop a good many worldly ideas and ambitions; these are the
"strange gods." And we listen to many worldly and selfish prompt 
ings and -do wrong things because of them; these are the "golden
earrings." We must recognize these as unworthy and put them
away before our worship of the Lord can be pure.

The second incident seems a strange on.e: "Deborah, Rebekah's
nurse, died, and she was buried beneath Bethel under an oak."
Why should Rebekah's nurse, who came long ago with Rebekah
from Haran (Genesis 24:59), appear suddenly in the middle of
this story of Jacob? From the literal sense we find no explanation,
but in the spiritual sense this incident has a wonderful meaning.
Rebekah's nurse represents hereditary evil. We are all born with
selfish inclinations, but the Lord uses this natural selfishness of
ours to induce us to form good habits. A child is led to behave
rightly mostly by fear of punishment and hope of reward, and in
the Isaac stage these same selfish motives also lead him to learn
the Lord would have him be and do. So our affection for

selfishness. But when, as adults, we decide to bring our worldly
achievements back into the service of the Lord, this selfish motive
is put away forever.

truth, which is Rebekah,

Then finally Jacob is ready to be united to his father Isaac in
Hebron and to inherit his father's place as head of the family.
Isaac dies, and his sons Esau and Jacob bury him. This does not
mean that we stop using our spiritual rational which Isaac rep 
resents, but that it has now become so much a part of our every 
day thought-so natural to us-that it no longer stands out as a

Senior

The Seniors are themselves in the beginning of the Jacob state, and the spiri 
tual lessons involved in our chapter are especially important for them. Many
of them think now that they will never be led away from serving the Lord.
Call their attention to the fact that Jacob's desire when he left home was only
to return as soon as possible, but that he became so involved in his activities
and accomplishments in Haran that it was twenty years before he actually
made the effort to go back to the Holy Land.

In the writings Swedenborg explains the stories of Abraham,
Isaac, Jacob, and Joseph for the most part in the celestial sense
in which they tell us of the inner. life of the Lord as He was
developing from infancy to adulthood; but he tells us' that our
own individual development is analogous, and so they apply to us
also. The Lord took on from Mary all the natural human heredity
just as we have it, and dealt with its temptations one after another
as they came to Him. So the Lord is our pattern.

After the period of Ishmael and Isaac comes the period of Jacob
and Esau. Jacob and Esau represent the natural plane of our lives
in its relation to the Lord-Jacob as to truth and Esau as to good 
especially that period in our lives when we are just beginning to
take our places in the world as independent individuals.

In our early childhood, represented by Abraham, we experience
and store up in our subconscious the states of innocence and trust.
In our early youth, represented by Ishmael and Isaac, we acquire

==== GENESIS 35

knowledges and develop the power of reasoning, first
in a very
external and superficial way and later more deeply, with a truer
perception of values. When we begin to grow up and to "live our
own lives," we are at first necessarily very much concerned with
establishing ourselves in the world. We turn our back on the Holy
Land, so to speak, and devote ourselves to the practical problems
of everyday life. This is Jacob's sojourn in Haran.

But Haran is not our home. Always in the back of our minds is
the vision with which we started, and sooner or later we become
dissatisfied with our bondage to the "practical" life, and turn our
faces homeward. Like Jacob, we travel slowly, checked at first by
the pull of old ideas and somewhat hindered by our flocks and
herds, the very riches we have worked so hard to acquire in Haran.
Finally we reach the borders of our homeland. But before we
actually enter it, Jacob must be reconciled with Esau. Heavenly
life consists in the union of both will and understanding in the
Lord's service. Then follows our chapter for today.

We remember that when Jacob, fleeing from Esau, was granted
his first encouraging vision at Bethel-the dream of the ladder-he
promised that if the Lord would take care of him and bring him
safely back to his home, he would serve Him. Now the Lord's part
of the covenant is fulfilled. Jacob has been prospered and has come
back with great wealth to settle peacefully in his own country.
So he returns to Bethel and builds an altar there, requiring all his
household to give up their idols and be clean and change their
garments. This is a picture of the effort we should make, if we are
to reform all our worldly ways of
trying to live a heavenly life,
there shall be no divided
feeling,
allegiance to turn us astray. The people did give Jacob their idols
and also the "earrings which were in their ears." This seems a
strange addition, unless we know that the ear pictures obedience
and the earrings the delight of obedience, so that what is pictured
is the willingness to stop listening to and acting upon the dictates
of self-will. Jacob buried all these things under the oak at Shedhem
before he went on to Be.thel. Swedenborg tells us that to bury

thinking, and acting so that

JACOB'S RETURN

something under an oak pictures rejection of it forever. Jacob's
stop at Shechem represents his coming to a state of peace, and we
cannot come into this state so long as our minds are divided in
their allegiance. "Ye cannot serve God and mammon."

After Jacob reached Bethel and built his altar there, it is written
that Rebekah's nurse Deborah died and was buried at Bethel under
an oak. This seems a completely irrelevant incident. In the letter
we find no suggestion of a reason why Rebekah's nurse should
suddenly appear in the story of Jacob. But her death and burial
just at this point picture the rejection of the hereditary evils in
which we have grown up. Deborah, you remember, was sent with
Rebekah from Haran when Abraham's servant took Rebekah away
to become Isaac's wife. It is part of the Lord's providence that our
evils are never separated from us suddenly or violently but are
allowed to go on until we see and reject them ourselves. The same
lesson is taught in the Gospels in the parable of the tares among
the wheat.

Benjamin is born at Bethlehem because he represents the highest
type of good which can be exercised on the natural plane of our
lives. This cannot be produced until we get back to the Holy Land,
although Joseph-the truth which leads to this good-can be seen
like Sarah's,
before we have attained our goal. Rachel's death,
pictures the end of one stage of our development, the affection
proper to that stage subsiding into the background of our experi 
ence as we go on to new interests.

The death of Isaac is the final act in the drama of our develop 
ment from infancy into a full adult state. From Genesis 49: 31 we
learn that Isaac and Rebekah were both buried in the cave of
Machpelah, and that Jacob and Leah were both buried there also.
This suggests that, although Rachel was Jacob's first
love and
his ideal, Leah-the affection for external truth-was actually his
proper wife. The death of Isaac does not mean that at this stage
we have given up our spiritual reasoning, but that this faculty has
become a part of our everyday life. Jacob has come into the qual 
ities possessed by his fathers, Abraham and Isaac. A truly good

==== GENESIS 35

external life has within it both the innocence and trust which are
Abraham and the rational understanding of spiritual values which
is Isaac.

Adult

Most of the Adult class will be more familiar with the other stories about
Jacob than with chapter 35; so the teacher should begin immediately with
the current lesson, only touching in passing on the earlier part of Jacob's life.
Call attention especially to the burying of the idols and earrings at Shechem,
the burial of Deborah at Bethel, and the burial of Rachel at Bethlehem. These
three burials, followed by the burial of Isaac and by Jacob's final entry into
his birthright, form excellent discussion material, especially in relation to the
popular tendency to make external good works the first thing of religion.

The stary of Jacob is a very important one for our thought
about our everyday life, for Jacob and Esau represent the natural
plane of life-Jacob this plane as to truth and Esau the same plane
as to good. There is much emphasis in churches today upon exter 
nal good works, and we all know that these should be done. But
if good works are genuinely good they must be an outgrowth of
love to the Lord in the heart and an understanding of His nature
and will
in the mind-not a substitute for these inner qualities
of religion. Those who love the Lord and the neighbor and think
about their own shortcomings and the Lord's mercy do their exter 
nal good works as a matter of course and do not talk about them.
Jacob and Esau were at first rivals and even enemies. Our natural
good impulses are eager to express themselves and impatient of
instruction, and our natural understanding of the truth is pleased
with itself and not too scrupulous in its methods of advancing
itself. Esau was a "hairy" man and Jacob a "smooth" man. Hair
represents the part of the life which is most external. Jacob's long
sojourn in Haran was necessary to teach him the true value of his
home and the necessity of reconciliation with his brother. So a
young person goes out self-confidently to make his place in the
world, and it may take him a long time to realize that life is more
than material success, and that he needs to go back and reclaim

JACOB'S RETURN

the good states and the spiritual principles of his childhood period
of instruction.

In interpreting the story of Jacob, Swedenborg deals primarily
with its celestial sense,
in which it is a description of the Lord's
progress toward the glorification of the natural degree. But he is
careful to point out that the order of glorification with the Lord
was the same as the order of reg~neration with man. We recall that
Jacob's name was changed to Israel after he wrestled with the angel
(Genesis 32: 28), and this change is repeated in our chapter for
today. In the celestial sense this change marks the completion of
another step in the Lord's glorification. Jacob represents the Lord's
natural as to its external; Israel, His internal natural. This is why
both names are used frequently in the rest of the Bible story,
sometimes even in the same verse, Jacob coming to stand for the
church of that day as a mere representative of a church, while
Israel stands for the true internal which the ancient Hebrew rites
represented. The names are not interchangeable and are never used
in the letter of the Word without clear purpose.

The sons born to Jacob in Haran picture the faculties developed
by each of us as he "finds himself" in the life of the world-Joseph
being the final faculty of receiving and understanding genuine spiri 
tual truth. It is after Joseph's birth that Jacob decides to return to
Canaan. But Benjamin, who represents the good proper to genuine
truth, is not born until after Jacob has returned, become reconciled
to Esau, and performed his worship at Bethel.

Four very familiar places are mentioned in our chapter: She 

chern, Bethel, Bethlehem, and Hebron.

The strange gods and the earrings which the people surrendered
to Jacob were buried "under the oak which was by Shechem."
The strange gods and the earrings represent falsities held in the
mind and falsities made actual in life, and to bury under an oak
is to put away forever. This was accomplished at Shechem because
Shechem, Abram's first stop in the Holy Land, represents "the
first of light, which is interior truth." Before we can worship the
Lord truly we must be willing to put away every false idea and

==== GENESIS 35

bad habit which we find to conflict with His wisdom and love.
Then Jacob advances to Bethel. Jacob in his return is following
the same course which Abraham followed when he came into the
Holy Land from Ur so many years before, stopping first at She 
chern, then at Bethel, and finally at Hebron, and building altars
as he went. This pictures of course an advance, little by little, into
holy states of innocence and trust. Abraham's journey was a child 
like following of the Lord. Jacob's is a more mature, though more
worldly or natural obedience. Abraham was being led into these
states out of ignorance and idolatry. Jacob is coming back to them
after a long period of wandering, caused by his own transgression.
The Lord tells us: "Except ye become as little children, ye shall
not enter into the kingdom of heaven." When Jacob comes back
to Bethel, the "house of God," the Lord appears to him again and
renews the promises He had made to Abraham and to Isaac.

The death of Rebekah's nurse Deborah at Bethel tells of the
passing of former affections when new ones are developed. Deb 
orah is the hereditary evil from the mother. Hereditary evil lies
back of all our acts in childhood. We do things largely for the sake
of self. Though children are directed by their parents and led by
the Lord through angel associates, yet hereditary evil is within
everything they do. But it does not become actual because they do
not act from their own free will. This is the innocence of infancy.
The difference between the innocence of infancy and the inno 
cence of wisdom is that in the former "the innocence of infancy
is without, and hereditary evil within," whereas in the latter, "the
innocence of wisdom is within and evil both actual and hereditary
without." (AC 4563) The natural, purified of its falsities and evils,
has come into a new state. Bethel-"house of God"-signifies this
new state of the natural, for the house in which truth dwells is
good. The altar Jacob built at Bethel is the worship of the Lord
by the natural mind.

Our lesson marks the first appearance of Bethlehem in the Bible
story. The birth of Benjamin and Rachel's death are the first inci 
dents we connect with it. Bethlehem is near the border of the two

JACOB'S RETURN

lots later assigned to the tribes of Benjamin and Judah. As the
birthplace of Benjamin, and later of David, and still later of the
Lord, it marks the beginning of great changes. The death of Rachel
near Bethlehem in the celestial sense pictures the expulsion by the
Lord of whatever was hereditary and human in the affection for
interior truth. In the human affection from the mother is the glory
of self and the world. Good is done for the sake of self. The Lord
felt this temptation and put it away, and we should recognize this
evil in ourselves and try to overcome it with His help.

Isaac died at Hebron and was buried by his sons Esau and Jacob
in the cave of Machpelah. (See Genesis 49:29-32.) Jacob became
head of his family. It is helpful to fix in our minds the fact that
of the three patriarchs Abraham pictures the celestial, Isaac the
spiritual, and Jacob the natural plane of life, the planes through
which we pass from infancy through youth to maturity. When we
first consider ourselves ,"grown up," we are in the Jacob stage,
when natural and worldly things are most interesting and absorb
our time and thought. We branch out into many fields of interest,
as Jacob's twelve sons headed families and eventually divided the
land. Still we have in us our inheritance from our infant and child 
hood states and we have in us the deeper affections, represented
by Joseph and Benjamin, to link us to spiritual and celestial things.
Our early states are in us and affect all we do. So the places that
are mentioned in the early chapters of Genesis recur again and
again throughout the ,.Bible story.

From the Writings of Swedenborg

Arcana Coelestia, n. 4563: "It is known that man derives evil from both his
parents, and that this evil is called hereditary evil. He is therefore born into it,
but still it does not manifest itself until the man becomes an adult and acts
from his understanding and the derivative will, and meanwhile it lies hidden,
especially during infancy. And as of the Lord's mercy no one is blamed for
what is hereditary, but for what is actual (nn. 966, 2308] , and what is heredi 
tary cannot become actual until the man acts from his own understanding
and his own will, therefore infants are led by the Lord by means of infants

==== GENESIS 35

and angels from Him, and hence they appear in a state of innocence while
hereditary evil still lurks in everything they do. This hereditary evil yields
them nourishment, or is as a nurse, until the time when they judge for them 
selves; and then if they are being regenerated they are brought by the Lord
into a state of new infancy, and at last into heavenly wisdom; thus into
genuine infancy, that is, into innocence; for genuine infancy or innocence
dwells in wisdom. The difference is, that the innocence of infancy is without,
and hereditary evil within; whereas the innocence of wisdom is within, and
evil both actual and hereditary is without."

Notes for Parents

The story of Joseph is one of the best-known stories in the Bible,
and people have always recognized that
there are several simi 
larities between it and the story of the Lord's life on earth, for
both Joseph and the Lord were carried into Egypt, both were
betrayed by those who should have loved them, both were sold
for a few pieces of silver, both we,re always faithful and always
forgiving, and both were saviors of their people.

Joseph was Jacob's eleventh son, the first child born to Rachel,
Jacob's favorite wife, and the last one born in Haran, where Jacob
had been sent to escape the wrath of his brother Esau. Rachel's
second child, Benjamin, was born after Jacob had brought his
family back to Canaan and been reconciled to Esau. Rachel died
when Benjamin was born, and was buried near Bethlehem.

Joseph was different from his older brothers. As the later story
shows, they were concerned only with worldly success, but Joseph
cared about the things of the spirit and was unselfish. They called
him "this dreamer." Often today people who think about the
heavenly life are scoffed at by the worldly as dreamers or idealists.
But it is the people with ideals who have been the really great men
and women of history.

One of the reasons why Joseph's brothers hated him was that
he was his father's favorite. Another was that his dreams indicated
that he would be greater than they. In the series of patriarchs 
Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob-Jacob pictures our state when we are
beginning our independent life in the world. His twelve sons stand
for all
the faculties which we develop that enable us to act as
the ten older sons our practical, worldly abilities, and
individuals:
the two youngest the higher spiritual impulses and thoughts which
are our inheritance from our Heavenly Father.

For a long time these higher things in us are put aside, as we
busy ourselves with making our way in the world. We sometimes
even imagine that they have been killed, as Jacob thought Joseph
had been, but the Lord preserves them deep within us, until the
experiences of life bring us to a sense of need which only spiritual
truth and good can satisfy. Joseph by the abilities he received fr~m
the Lord rose out of prison to the place of ruler of Egypt. Later
his brothers came to him there for help in time of need.

Primary

The children should be reminded of the number of sons Jacob had altogether
and the name of Joseph, whom Jacob loved best. The gift of the coat and
the jealousy of the brothers will be easy for them to understand. Later in the
story tell them that it was the Lord who put it into Reuben's heart to save
Joseph from death, and that the Lord was preparing Joseph to become a great
man and to save his whole family. The moral lesson of the way in which envy
of another person grows until it wants to do him real harm is a good one for
young children, and not
too far from their experience with brothers and
sisters and playmates.

Jacob stayed in Haran for twenty years, working for his uncle
Laban. He married two of Laban's daughters, Leah and Rachel,
and became very rich in herds and flocks. Eleven son s were born

to him in Haran and another after he came back to the land of
Canaan, twelve in all. When he came back, he was still very much
afraid of Esau, but he found that Esau, who had also become very
rich, had long since forgiven him and was happy to see him again.
Someday you will want to learn the names Qf Jacob's twelve
sons. These were their names, in the order of their birth: Reuben,
Simeon, Levi, Judah, Dan, Naphtali, Gad, Asher, Issachar, Zebulun,
Joseph, and Benjamin. They also had a sister named Dinah. Per 
haps you can remember that the oldest was Reuben and the two
youngest Joseph and Benjamin. These two youngest sons were the
children of Rachel, who was Jacob's favorite wife. That was one
reason why Jacob loved them best, and he especially loved Joseph.

What did Jacob make for Joseph?
Why did the older brothers hate Joseph?
His dreams showed that he was to be greater than they.
What did the brothers decide to do?
Who persuaded them not to kill Joseph?
What did they finally do with him?
Who. was Ishmael, the father of the Ishmaelites?
Where did they take Joseph?
To whom was he sold?

The brothers thought

they would never see Joseph again, but
the Lord took care of him in Egypt and he became a great man
there, and several years later he was able to save his whole family
from starving to death. Joseph always obeyed the Lord, and he
came to realize that the Lord had permitted the hardships of his
boyhood for a good purpose.

Junior
Shechem, the place of Abraham's first altar, appears again here and should be
located on a map and impressed on the minds of the class. It is an important
place throughout the Bible story. It may also be helpful to turn to Genesis 35,
verses 23 to 26, and read the names of the twelve sons of Jacob as a prep 
aration for later lessons. The children will note that Reuben, who persuaded
his brothers not to kill Joseph, was Jacob's eldest son. They should learn his
name and that of Benjamin the youngest in addition to Joseph. Tell them also

==== GENESIS 37

that in those days the Lord often taught people through dreams, and that
Joseph's two dreams have an inner meaning which they will study when they
are older. Stress the Lord's providence in saving Joseph and tell them that we
often find, as we grow older, that experiences which at the time we thought
very hard were really blessings in disguise.

Jacob lived in Haran for twenty years and became rich there. He
married the two daughters of his uncle Laban, Leah and Rachel,
and had eleven sons and a daughter before he left Haran. The
oldest was Reuben and the youngest, Joseph. Then he brought his
family back to the land of Canaan, was reconciled to Esau and
reunited with his father Isaac. His twelfth son, Benjamin, was born
near Bethlehem. Jacob loved Joseph and Benjamin best of his sons
because they were the children of Rachel, his favorite wife, who
died when Benjamin was born.

At the time of our story for today, Joseph was seventeen.

What did Jacob make for him?

Jacob's preference for Joseph was one reason why his brothers
hated him, and there were two other reasons.

What do we learn in verse 2?
What two dreams did Joseph have?
What did both dreams mean?
Where did Jacob send Joseph?
What do you remember about Shechem?
Where did Joseph find his brothers?
Dothan is a little plain not far north of Shechern.
What did the brothers say when they saw Joseph coming?

Does it seem strange that they should have been willing to kill
their brother? Aren't we all likely to dislike people who are so
different from ourselves that we cannot understand them? Read
Matthew 5: 21-22 and I John 3: 15. Every willful murder has its
beginning in feelings of jealousy, anger, and hatred in the heart.
If we realized how dangerous such feelings are, we should all try
harder to put them out of our hearts when they first appear there.

Which brother persuaded the others not to kill Joseph?
What did the others finally do with- him?
Whose son was Ishmael, the father of the Ishmaelites?

Sketch for the class the whole story of Joseph in its simplest outlines, using
the facts of today's lesson followed by those mentioned in the last paragraph
of the notes for Adults. Most of the young people will be somewhat familiar
with this story. Then take up the twelve !l'ons of Jacob and their general mean 
ing, the meaning of Joseph, and the importance of this quality to our ultimate
salvation. The attitude of the older brothers toward Joseph can easily be
illustrated from the young people's own experience. Most of them have at
one time or another rebelled against going to Sunday school and church, and
doubtless all know other young people-and older ones, too-who scoff at
religion and stifle their own impulses to be good in any deep sense-that is,
to do more than keep within the law.

When Jacob was sent away from home to Haran to save him
from the wrath of Esau, he stayed away for twenty years. During
that time, which he spent serving his uncle Laban,· he married two
daughters of Laban, Leah and Rachel, and had seven sons by them.
He had four more sons by Bilhah and Zilpah, the handmaids of
his two wives, and after he returned to Canaan, Rachel bore him
a twelfth son, Benjamin. In those days people had forgotten that
multiple marriages were wrong.

Jacob pictures the natural plane of our life. The Israelitish
church, which was really a mere representative of a church, was
to be developed among his descendants. Our outward acts, if they
are not hypocritical, are pictures of the things hidden in our hearts
and minds, even though we may never think of anything but out 
ward acts and of what their results are likely to be for our life in
this world. Jacob's twelve sons picture all our proper affections
and thoughts through which this plane of outward conduct is

==== GENESIS 37

developed and regulated. The earlier sons are the more external
affections which develop first; the sons of the handmaids are those
which serve our growth in a lower way; and the last two sons 
born of Rachel, who was the wife Jacob loved best-represent the
deep spiritual affections and thoughts which develop last. They
are all good and useful and have their proper place in our lives.
But our more external and natural ideas and desires should be
recognized as subordinate to the higher ones. When we first grow
up, our ideas of religion are chiefly concerned with external con 
duct, but deep within us we have feelings which we cannot express
and are sometimes ashamed to acknowledge, thinking our friends
might laugh at them. It is these deep religious "remains" which
will eventually save us from becoming entirely worldly and selfish.
They are pictured by Joseph and Benjamin: Joseph, the affection
for spiritual things; and Benjamin, the understanding of them or
the desire to learn about them.

If we remember this, the story of Joseph becomes a wonderful
parable. In our chapter today Joseph is pictured as different from
his brothers and hated by them because of this difference. He is
a dreamer. He has visions which tell him that he is to be greater
than his brothers and even than his father and mother. His older
brothers want to kill him. Is not this true of our interest in spiri 
tual things when we are coming to maturity? We know it is really
the most important thing in our lives, which gives us dreams and
the future. Yet our external reasonings make fun of
ideals for
those dreams and ideals and do their best to stifle them. And they
do succeed for a time in putting our Joseph away in Egypt-the
land of mere memory-knowledge-and forgetting about him, pre 
tending he is dead. How many young people stop going to church
and Sunday school and try to forget the deeper aspects of religion
as soon as they get out from under their parents' control!

But Joseph is not dead. He is preserved by the Lord in Egypt
to be the savior of his whole family later in time of need. That is,
the Lord preserves our early religious feelings and thoughts deep
in our memories where we shall find them again when great need-

the famine-arises in our lives.

We should also realize that the Old Testament in its inmost sense
is a story of the life of the Lord Himself. Joseph is one of the Bible
figures who most clearly picture the Lord. The Lord was different
from others, a dreamer who knew that in the end all would bow
down before Him. He went down into Egypt. He was sold for a
few pieces of silver. His garments were taken from Him and used
to prove His death. But He was not dead. We must keep this
thought about
the inmost meaning of the Word in our minds
throughout our study of the Bible.

recognizing that there are relative values in life, and that one of the objectives
of our thinking should be to learn to put first things first. Read them Matthew

things.

In studying the internal meaning of the Word, one is sometimes
puzzled by the apparently endless repetition of the cycle of temp 
tation, transgression, repentance, restoration, and peace. Today we
have Jacob reconciled to Esau and once more peacefully settled in
Hebron; yet the very next incident is the jealousy among his sons
and the selling of Joseph, his favorite, into slavery in Egypt. And
the cycle starts all over again.

life? We
recognize an evil in ourselves; with the Lord's help we fight and
overcome it; we experience the peace of victory-only tq discover
a new and deeper temptation waiting to attack. You will some 
times hear older people say, "I seem to myself to grow worse
instead of better as the years go on." This is really just as it should
be. As one grows in physical strength, harder and harder tasks are
entrusted to him; as he grows in spiritual strength, deeper and
deeper inner evils are revealed for him to overcome. We cannot
overcome all our evils at once. But as we put one behind us, the
Lord can show us another, so that our whole life may be a forward
progress step by step up the heavenly way.

Jacob represents the natural plane of our life, especially the
period when we are finding our independent place in the world
and adjusting ourselves to the demands of earning a living and
establishing a new home and family in society. Jacob's settlement
in the Holy Land with the new name of Israel (Genesis 32:38)
represents our determination that our life and our home shall be

JOSEPH AND HIS BROTHERS

godly and not merely worldly.

Still our desire to do right may have many motives within it,
and these motives-represented by the twelve sons of Jacob-are
not always harmonious. Joseph and Benjamin, our love for and
understanding of spiritual things, we recognize as our highest and
most mature qualities. "Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his
children, because he was the son of his old age." But our lower
interests are opposed to what is spiritual in us even to the point
of trying to destroy it.

Joseph had dreams and visions. Our spiritual nature centers
about internal rather than worldly values, and the worldly part of
us makes fun of anything which cannot be perceived through the
physical senses. If we think of Joseph as the deep-seated religious
impulse which everyone of us has from the Lord, we can see in
our own experience and in that of our acquaintances how worldly
desires seek first to destroy it, then to bury it, and finally dispose
of it by relegating it to the realm of childhood experience, part of
our necessary knowledge but no longer essential to our life. You
will even hear people say, "It is a good thing for children to go to
Sunday school; it helps them to form good habits; but of course
they will outgrow a lot of the things they are taught." This is
Joseph sold into Egypt for twenty pieces of silver.

But it was fortunate for the worldly brothers that Joseph was
not really dead. As we all know, the time came when their very
life depended on him. As the Lord preserved Joseph and endowed
him with abilities which brought him into a place of authority in
Egypt, so He preserves the "remains" of our early spiritual states
deep within us against the time when the worldly principles which
we have adopted prove to be wholly inadequate in the face of
some bereavement or failure or other deep loss.

Swedenborg in the Arcana Coelestia develops the meaning of
this story of Joseph principally in its inmost sense, in which it
treats of the Lord Himself. The quotation at the end of this lesson
gives us the key to this sense in the meaning of Joseph.

==== GENESIS 37

Adult

Even with this class it may be necessary to review briefly the story of Jacob's
sojourn in Haran and return to the Holy Land. Then speak of the correspon 
dence of the twelve sons and of the meaning of Joseph's being sold into
Egypt. Finally ask for comments and questions from the class, and let these
determine the further discussion.

As Jacob represents the attempt to work out the Lord's teach 
ings on the plane of daily life, his twelve sons represent all the
good affections which are developed in the course of this task.
We know that our lives are complex. We are constantly reading of
psychologists' efforts to analyze our mental and volitional pro 
cesses. Here in the story of Jacob's twelve sons we can, with the
help of Swedenborg, find a complete outline of psychology given
us by the Lord Himself. We can distinguish between higher and
lower affections in our external life. We know, for instance, that
love for friends is a higher affection than love for food, although
the latter is a necessary and good affection. We are able to see that
affection for the Lord and for heavenly knowledge is the highest
of all our affections. The sons of Jacob may be grouped according
the two sons of Rachel being these highest
to their importance,
affections,
the sons of Leah the more external affections which
lead up to them, and the sons of the handmaids the most external
affections which minister to the others. All twelve sons except
Benjamin were born in Haran, but Benjamin was born in Canaan.
Our lesson introduces the story of Joseph, one of the most-loved
stories in the Bible. Joseph was Jacob's eleventh son-his first by
Rachel,
the wife he loved best-and consequently he was Jacob's
favorite. Jacob made him a coat of many colors.* Colors picture

JOSEPH AND HIS BROTHERS

aroused the jealousy of his brothers, and their ill feeling was in 
creased to the point of hatred by the fact that he told his father
of their wrongdoings-as our spiritual perceptions reveal the evils
we try to hide-and later they resented the two dreams which
likewise set him above them. When Jacob sent Joseph to Shechem
to find his brothers and report to him concerning them, the first
thing we read is, "And they said one to another, Beholc;i, this
dreamer cometh." We are all able to recognize that it is the man
who dreams who leads others; but
in practice many of us are
inclined to belittle "idealists" and to try, like Joseph's brothers,
to put them aside where they will not interfere with our worldly
ambitions. The scribes and Pharisees treated the Lord this way
when He came among them and rebuked their evils. We can all see
how many points in the story of Joseph foreshadow the life of
the Lord. Swedenborg tells us (AC 4669) that Joseph "signifies the
Lord's Divine spiritual Human," and more clearly, "the Divine
spiritual which proceeds from His Divine Human" or "the Divine
truth which is from Him in heaven and in the church." We should
remember that it was as the Divine truth that the Lord came into
the world to save the human race.

The story of Joseph is a true story. His brothers really did plot
to kill him and finally sold him into slavery in Egypt. But the Lord
uses this story to teach us a beautiful, practi~al lesson. He was
with Joseph and turned his very troubles into a means of advancing
him and eventually of saving his whole family. Egypt, we recall,
represents the plane of memory-knowledge. We need memory 
knowledge not only for our life in the world but for our spiritual
development as well. And there is a time in our lives when it is
especially orderly and appropriate that our attention should be
centered upon acquiring it. The instances in the Bible story of
"going down into Egypt" for food and for protection are symbolic
of this fact. The Lord takes special care of children until they have
learned to take care of themselves. He gives us a long childhood
because we need so much knowledge in order to face the problems
of adult life. When He came into the world, He Himself went down

==== GENESIS 37

into Egypt to show us that this is an orderly part of our lives, and
also as a symbol of what He in His assumed human was learning:
the letter of Scripture. We remember how constantly He used quo 
tations from the Scriptures during His ministry. It was all stored
in His external memory during His childhood. Swedenborg tells us
that truth from the Lord does not flow into our minds and remain
there for our use except as we have the vessels for receiving and
holding it, which are knowledges of the Word learned in an exter 
nal way. And the Lord constantly reminds us that if we wish to
progress spiritually, we must continue to learn more from the
letter of the Word throughout our lives. "Search the Scriptures."
We should note that we are not obeying this command w hen we go
to the Word merely to find passages to support out own ideas, or
when we read only the passages which we enjoy.

All the stories of the Word relate inmostly to the Lord's life and
in their internal sense to the life of each one of us. The twelve sons
of Jacob all represent necessary affections, good when properly
used; but any of these may be perverted-turned to selfish pur 
poses-just as Joseph's brothers turned against him. When this hap 
pens, the Lord makes use of the best things in us to try to save us.
Joseph in us is our affection for truth from the Lord, our love of
thinking about the Lord and His care over us. This is one of the
"remains" stored up in us by the Lord from our innocent child 
hood states. As Joseph dreamed dreams and later was given the
power to interpret them, so when we are thinking about the Lord
from genuine affection, worldly things fall into their proper sub 
ordinate place; we see above and beyond them, and can understand
the reasons for our various experiences.

But very often our more external affections get the better of
our Joseph and put him away in the realm of memory-knowledge,
where he is at first imprisoned. Even then the Lord works within
us to preserve and strengthen Joseph against our time of need.
When some experience comes which our worldly principles are
unable to explain and in the face of which our worldly affections
fail us completely, we are led to the rediscovery of Joseph and

find him no longer a weak child, but a mighty ruler under whose
protection we may willingly place ourselves.

From the Writings of Swedenborg
Arcana Coelestia, n. 4669: ''Joseph. That this signifies the Lord's Divine spiri 
tual Human, is evident from the representation of Joseph, as being in the
supreme sense the Lord as to the Divine spiritual ... That the Lord is rep 
resented by Joseph is known in the church, for when the heavenly Joseph is
spoken of, no one else is thought of; but what of the Lord is/epresented by
Joseph is not so well known, for it is the Divine spiritual which proceeds
from His Divine Human. The Divine spiritual which proceeds from the Lord's
Divine Human is the Divine truth which is from Him in heaven and in the
church. The spiritual in its essence is nothing else. The Divine spiritual, or
Divine truth, is also what is called the Lord's royalty, and it is likewise signi 
fied by the Christ, or the Messiah ... For this reason Joseph was made as it
were a king in Egypt, that he might then represent what is of the Lord's
royalty."

==== JOSEPH IN PRISON
Genesis 39; 40

A short review of the last lesson will lead easily into the story
of Joseph. For the background of today's lesson the important
points to bring out are the length of time Jacob stayed in Haran,
the number of sons born to him there, the fact that Joseph was
Rachel's son, and the reasons why his older brothers hated him.
In all the older classes mention the meaning of the series Abraham,
the meaning of Egypt which they
Isaac, and Jacob, and recall
learned in connection with the story of Abram and Lot. All the
classes above the Primary should be fairly familiar with the general
outline of the Joseph story. I t is a long and interesting one, and the
events are so closely connected that it is hard to pass over any of
it. If the teacher prefers, he may tell the whole story very briefly
before concentrating on the events of these two chapters.

Doctrinal Points
The Lord preserves and strengthens our spiritual affections even

when we try to forget that we have them.

The story ofJoseph has a close relationship to the life of the Lord.
So it helps us to see how closely the Old and the New Testa 
ments are bound together.

Truth is necessary to protect good.
Obedience to the Lord enables one to receive understanding.

Notes for Parents

Most people are familiar with the beautiful story of Joseph.
He is an example of a man who remained faithful and upright
in the face of the severest trials, and the lesson is one from which
we can all profit. The Lord can be with us only as we look to Him
for help and keep His commandments. When we do wrong, there
are always consequences which cannot be averted. Joseph went

JOSEPH IN PRISON

through some hard experiences, but his brothers were much worse
off because they had guilty consciences to bother them. As we
read the rest of the story,
in chapters 41 to the end of Genesis,
we find that Joseph, because of his character, is in a position of
control in every situation. The brothers, on the other hand, are
afraid at every unexpected turn of events. Read chapter 42, verses
21 to 24, and see the difference between them.

Joseph represents something in the life of everyone of us 
the voice deep within us which tells us that the most important
thing in the world is to do right in the sight of God, whatever may
happen to us. We sometimes try to silence that voice and think we
have succeeded, but it is there just the same. The brothers were
never really happy until they found Joseph again and realized that
he had forgiven them and wanted to take care of them. The Lord
takes care of us if we let Him.

Primary

The Primary class needs to know that Joseph was Jacob's favorite son and
the reason why his brothers were jealous of him. Then read them verses 8
through 23 of chapter 40. You will probably have to explain what a butler is.
More of the beginning of the Joseph story should then be given. Stress the
fact that the Lord was with Joseph so that he prospered in spite of everything
that was done by his enemies. Tell the class also the end of his story and how
he forgave his brothers and took care of his whole family.

Today we have a story about Joseph, Jacob's favorite son. Joseph
had ten older brothers and they hated him, partly because his
father loved him best and partly because he was brighter and more
unselfish than they were, and the Lord gave him some wonderful
dreams which showed that he was to be greater than his brothers
and even greater than his father and mother. The Lord also gave
him power to interpret dreams-that is, to tell what dreams meant.
One day, when his brothers were all tending their flocks away
from home, the older brothers decided to get rid of Joseph. First
they thought they would kill him, but then they decided it would
be better to sell him. They sold him to a caravan of Ishmaelites,
who were on their way to Egypt. In Egypt Joseph was sold to a
man named Potiphar, who was captain of the king's guard. The
king of Egypt was always called Pharaoh.

Joseph was always faithful to the Lord and honest in everything
he did, and the Lord always took care of him. Potiphar made him
ruler over his household, but Potiphar's wife became angry with
Joseph and told her husband lies about him, and Potiphar believed
his wife and put Joseph in prison.

Even in prison Joseph made such a good impression on his

keepers that

Two of Pharaoh's servants were in prison at the same time.
Who were these two servants?
Why did they come to Joseph one day?
What did Joseph tell them about the interpretation of dreams?
What was the chief butler's dream?
What did Joseph tell him it meant?
What was the chief baker's dream?
What was Joseph's interpretation of it?
How did the interpretations come true?
What did Joseph ask the butler to do for him?
Did the butler remember?

Although the butler forgot Joseph as soon as he was free, later 
when Pharaoh himself had a strange dream which none of his
wise men could interpret-the butler remembered Joseph and told
Pharaoh about him. Joseph was taken out of prison and was able
to interpret Pharaoh's dream; so Pharaoh decided this was a very
wise man, and he made him ruler-under himself-of all Egypt.
So some time afterward, when there was a great famine in the
Holy Land, Joseph was able to save his father and his brothers
and their families, and Pharaoh invited them to come to Egypt
to live during the famine, and gave them the best part of the land
to live in.

Junior

Discuss especially the reasons why Joseph was disliked by his brothers and

JOSEPH IN PRISON

point out how liable we are to belittle people who seem to be different from
ourselves. Joseph's uprightness and desire to serve the Lord should be cited
as the reason why the Lord could take care of him and why he always rose
to positions of trust and authority. Try to cover the whole story of Joseph,
getting as much as possible from what the class themselves remember from
former years.

Of all his sons Jacob loved Joseph best and this made the older
sons jealous. Also Joseph was different from the others. The Lord
was with him especially and he had dreams which showed him
that he was to be greater than his brothers or even his father and
mother. The brothers hated him for this, also. They stripped him,
threw him in a pit and plotted to kill him, but finally decided to
sell him instead. While they were making their plans, caravans of
Ishmaelites and Midianites, on their way to Egypt, came to the pit
and drew Joseph up out of the pit, and took him to Egypt with
them. Our lesson today begins with the selling of Joseph to Poti 
phar, captain of the king's guard in Egypt.

The Lord was with Joseph. Read Genesis 45:4-8, which tells of
his reunion with his brothers many years later and his forgiveness
of them. Wherever Joseph went, the Lord was with him no matter
how hard his outward condition might be. We can see this in our
story today. Joseph's ability and honesty at first led Potiphar to
advance him until he was ruler over all Potiphar's household. But
again someone plotted against him.

Who was it this time?
Potiphar believed his wife's story.
What did he do with Joseph?

Yet you see that even in the prison Joseph's ability and honesty
attracted attention and led the keeper of the prison to put him
over the other prisoners. Even today men who have really com 
mitted crimes, if they show a disposition to obey the prison auth 
orities and to improve, are made "trusties" and given certain privi 
leges. Joseph had done no wrong.

Which servants of Pharaoh were in the prison at the same time?

Pharaoh is the name by which all the kings of Egypt were called,
just as we call the head of our government President, no matter
what his own name is.
What led the chief butler and the chief baker to come to Joseph for help?
What did Joseph tell them about the interpretation of dreams?

You see the real difference between Joseph and other people was
that Joseph knew that all goodness and wisdom and power were
in the Lord and not in himself, and he looked to the Lord for
guidance and tried to serve Him. So the Lord could show Joseph
what was true and right.

What was the chief butler's dream about?
What did Joseph tell him it meant?
What was the chief baker's dream about?
What did Joseph tell him?
Did the dreams come true?

There is something in the literal story which may show us the
difference between these two men. The butler was willing to tell
Joseph his dream as soon as Joseph said that interpretations be 
longed to God, but
the baker waited until he found that the
interpretation of the butler's dream was good before he told his
dream. That is, the baker was willing to let God into the picture
only when he thought it would be profitable to him. We are some 
times like the baker: we like to hear good things about ourselves,
but we don't want to be told when we have not been good.

What did Joseph ask of the butler?
Did the butler remember?

Sometimes we promise things when we are in trouble and want
help, and then forget all about our promises after the trouble is
over.

But the butler did remember later. Pharaoh had a dream which
no one could interpret, and that reminded the butler; and, because
he was really a good man, he was sorry he had forgotten his prom 
ise. Read Genesis 41:9-13. Pharaoh sent for Joseph, and because
Joseph could interpret his dream, he made him ruler under himself
over the whole land of Egypt. Later, when famine came, Joseph
was able to invite his father and his brothers and all their families

JOSEPH IN PRISON

to come and live in Egypt until the famine was over. So he saved
their lives, and helped them to settle in the best part of Egypt 
the land of Goshen. The hard things which had happened to Joseph
enabled him to be of great service to the others. But this would
not have been true if Joseph had not wanted to serve the Lord and
the neighbor. If we. have this good desire, everything that happens
to us can be turned by the Lord into a means of making us better
and stronger men and women, and more useful to the world.

Intermediate

This class can understand the meaning of Joseph as distinct from his brothers.
They all have Joseph in them and if they can see what is meant by trying to
get rid of him and by putting him in prison, it may help them to meet some
of the temptations to selfishness and worldliness which come with the modern
environment.

Jacob's twelve sons picture all of our faculties and affections
through which we may serve the Lord. The highest of these facul 
ties develop last, because we have to learn to live in this world
before our minds are free to think deeply of spiritual things. This
does not mean that we do not need to know what is right and try
to do it all along, but it is easier to do right in our outward life
than it is to think and to feel right.

Joseph was different from his brothers and had dreams which
told him that he was to be greater than they; this caused his older
brothers to be jealous of him and to try to kill him. Joseph pic 
tures a desire to be truly good in the Lord's sight. It does not
come to us until we have had a good deal of experience in trying
to lead successful lives. When it does come, we are ready to go
back to the Holy Land; but all the faculties and affections which
we have developed before it, which are centered on the things of
this world, resist being governed by it. The Lord protects our
"Joseph" as He protected the Joseph of the Bible story, and does
not let it be killed. But for a long time we may put it away in the
back of our minds and go on living as if it were dead. This is the
time in our lives when Joseph is in prison in Egypt. Egypt in the
Word is the land of "memory-knowledge": that is, all the body of
facts stored up in our memories.

Even in this land of memory-knowledge, Joseph easily became
a great man. I wonder if we can see how this is. When once we
have felt the desire to be truly good, we can never again think of
the world around us as something just created for our benefit.
We know that there are higher things than having good food and
clothes and money to spend, and even though we don't yet really
want to be unselfish, we know that unselfishness is best and we
can see and appreciate it in other people. We can see the use which
trouble and temptation and hard work and disappointments serve,
and things in life fall into their true order in our minds. So Joseph
was able, even while he was a servant in Egypt, to rise to a position
of control over the household of the master. Then came the effort
of Potiphar's wife to make him do what he knew to be wrong.
The desire to be good cannot be used in this way, and our selfish
desires try to shut it up so that it won't bother us. Joseph is cast
into prison.

The butler and the baker were servants of Pharaoh, king of
Egypt. They represent our senses, which serve us while we are in
this world. ,The Lord, when He instituted the Holy Supper, said
that the bread was His body and the wine His blood. Bread pic 
tures goodness and wine truth, and the Lord's body and blood
are the divine goodness and truth which nourish us if we accept
them from Him. When the butler and the baker came to Joseph
for the interpretation of their dreams, he told them that interpret 
ations belonged to God;
that only a knowledge of the
is,
Lord's truth could show them the meaning of what happened to
them. In the butler's dream he was making the wine perform its
proper use, pouring it into his master's cup; hut in the baker's
dream the birds were carrying off the bread from his basket before
it reached his master's table. So the dreams meant that the butler
would be restored to his proper place but the baker would have
to die. This is a very important lesson for us. When our senses

that

JOSEPH IN PRISON

perform their true use of bringing truth into our minds so that we
can serve the Lord more intelligently, all will be well with us.
But when we let false ideas, like the thieving birds, take away our
goodness, our senses are no longer true servants and what they tell
us is destructive to our spiritual life. An example of this is found
in the kind of books we choose to read. If we choose good, whole 
some books which give us a picture of life as it ought to be, our
minds remain clean and healthy; but when we read bad books,
we take into our minds ideas which steal away our good affections
and destroy our souls. Our Joseph-our honest desire to be good
in the Lord's sight-tells us truly what will happen to us. This is
proved many times in our experience. Sometimes, when everything
is going well with us, we-like the butler after he had been restored
to favor-forget all about Joseph down in his prison. But the time
comes again, as it did later in the Bible story, when something
reminds us, and then we are sorry for our forgetfulness, and Joseph
is brought out of prison and set over our whole life.

The story of Joseph is a beautiful story and one which will mean
more and more to you as your experience grows. You need to
know it well and to read it often. You will find also that it is a
picture of the Lord's life when He was on earth, and that many
of the things that happened to Joseph are very similar to things
that happened to the Lord. Joseph is one of the people in the Bible
who most clearly picture the Lord.

Basic Correspondences
bread = goodness
wine = truth

Senior

A good lesson for the Seniors is found in the power of Joseph to interpret
dreams. Only our recognition of the Lord and of His power in the life can
give us an understanding of the experiences we have and enable us to be of
real help to other people. People who persist in keeping Joseph shut up in the
back of their minds are left to their own imaginations, and one man's guess
is then as good as another's as to the meaning and purpose of life. Young
people should be led to feel that it is a sad thing for people to be in spiritual
darkness.

Swedenborg explains the meaning of Joseph in various ways.
Perhaps the simplest is in Arcana Coelestia, n. 3969, where he says
that Joseph represents "the good from which is truth." We may
think of this as the deep desire to be good in the Lord's sight
rather than merely in the sight of men. It is this desire which leads
us to read and study the Word and to accept correction from it in
our own feelings and thoughts as well as in our outward lives.
You remember that when Joseph's older brothers saw him coming,
they said, "Behold,
this dreamer cometh." (Genesis 37: 19) This
was because Joseph had had dreams which showed him that he
was to be greater than any of his brothers and even than his father
and mother. Our spiritual affections are greater than our natural
affections, but the natural affections resist the thought and try to
put it out of sight "in the back of the mind." The brothers first
put Joseph in a pit and then he was sold into Egypt. Egypt is the
land of "memory-knowledges," as we remember from the story
of Abram. We need memory-knowledges, but we should not be
bound by our knowledge of natural science so that we reject spiri 
tual truths.

Joseph had the power to interpret dreams; that is,

to see the
true meaning and effect of the experiences that come to us. This
in the
power comes to us from the genuine desire to do right
Lord's sight. Sometimes, perhaps for a long time,
it makes us
uncomfortable and we try to shut it up. I t is so much easier and
more pleasant to forget about right and wrong and go on getting
what we can of fun and satisfaction for ourselves without looking
at our spiritual future at all. But the Lord protected Joseph in
Egypt. First he rose to favor in the house of Potiphar, captain
of the king's guard. Even in our time of most complete devotion
to worldly pursuits we can see that it is to our advantage to go
to church and to associate ourselves with churchgoing people.
Eventually, however, this association with religion comes into con-

JOSEPH IN PRISON

flict with our selfish affection-pictured by Potiphar's wife-which
is trying to use religion selfishly and wants to control our higher
impulses. Then we put away our religious feeling still more deeply.
Joseph is cast into prison.

Pharaoh's chief butler and chief baker were also in prison. Pha 
raoh represents the principle which is at the moment ruling over
the things in our memories-sometimes the Pharaoh is a good ruler
and sometimes an evil one. His servants are the bodily senses which
bring into the mind facts necessary to maintain it. In the Holy
Supper the bread represents goodness and the wine truth. The
butler represents those senses which bring in things which affect
the intellect, while the baker represents those senses which pri 
marily move the will. Our senses are orderly servants when their
ministrations lead us to truth and good, disorderly when they
deceive us and lead us to evil. It is significant that when Joseph
said, "Do not interpretations belong to God?" the butler did not
hesitate to tell his dream, but the baker waited until he found that
the interpretation of the butler's dream was good. The butler in
his dream was pouring wine into Pharaoh's cup, performing his
proper use; but in the baker's dream birds were stealing the bread
before it reached Pharaoh. We may think here of the parable of
the Sower and the wayside, or hard-trodden path, which offered
no soil for the seeds so that the birds of the air carried them off.
These are birds in a bad sense, or falsities which destroy goodness
before it is taken into the life.

The whole story of Joseph is especially important for young
people just starting out in life. The temptation is to become so
absorbed in the life of the world, in the occupation or studies
chosen, that the thought of religion is put away into the memory
instead of being kept in the forefront of the daily life. But Joseph
was to be the savior of his people; in time of famine they were to
come to him for food and protection. Sooner or later in life come
troubles which cannot be met except in the light and strength of
faith in the Lord. The Lord preserves our "Joseph," however we
may try to get rid of him, until the time when we seek him out
and put ourselves under his protection.

Adult

The meaning of Joseph's imprisonment in Egypt and of the dreams of the
butler and baker should be discussed in their application to our own states
of temptations in the present materialistic age. The teacher will find excellent
discussion material in AC 5077-5078.

The stories of Joseph are among the best-loved in the Bible.
This is partly, no doubt, because of their variety and dramatic
qualities, and partly because our sense of justice is satisfied by the
triumph of right in'spite of scheming and persecution. We know,
however,
that the real power in them comes from the fact that
they picture states through which the Lord passed during His life
on earth, and states through which we all pass in our youth, as well
as repeatedly throughout our lives as we feel
the temptation to
stifle our spiritual promptings in the face of the pressure of our
worldly environment.

We recall that Joseph was the eleventh son of Jacob and the first
son of Rachel, the last of Jacob's sons to be born in Haran before
they returned to the Holy Land. Jacob and his sons represent
development of the church on the natural or external plane. His
two wives, Leah and Rachel, represent affection for exterior truth
and affection for interior truth. Jacob loved Rachel first but was
given Leah instead, and he had six sons by Leah before he had any
by Rachel; and, although Jacob at first was angry at Laban's decep 
tion, we find (Genesis 30: 2)
that after he had had four sons by
Leah, he was angry with Rachel because she complained of her
childlessness. So the natural man catches a first vision of a higher
spiritual state, but readily settles down into satisfaction with ex 
ternal accomplishment. The sons of Jacob represent the gradual
development of orderly living on the natural plane until, with
Joseph,
there is a beginning of true spiritual feeling. which is fol 
lowed by the birth of Benjamin-its complementary truth-after
the return to the Holy Land. Benjamin was born near Bethlehem

JOSEPH IN PRISON

and Rachel died at his birth. Jacob settled down with Leah and
eventually they were both buried in the cave of Machpelah with
Abraham and Sarah, Isaac and Rebekah. This would indicate that
Jacob's glimpse of something higher than the external order did
not take very deep root in his life, and that Leah was actually his
true wife. Nevertheless, Joseph remained his favorite son. Do we
not see this illustrated in the case of many people who live orderly
lives? The external life satisfies them and they do not
external
really wish to think more deeply: yet they like to remind them 
selves of a higher possibility within them which they recognized
in their youth.

The representation of Joseph is described by Swedenborg in
several phrasings: "the Lord's spiritual kingdom," "the spiritual
man," "the celestial spiritual man," "the charity from which is
faith, or the good from which is truth." In the Lord's life Joseph
represents the "Divine Spiritual." In our lives we can perhaps best
think of him as our inner desire to be good in the Lord's sight
rather than just in the sight of our neighbors. Joseph is the "dream 
er" who was disliked by his brothers because his dreams showed
that he was their superior. We really know that this higher urge
is the true ruler of our lives, but we rebel against the thought.
Joseph also had the power to interpret dreams. That inner voice
which brings the Lord before our minds is able to point out the
true meaning of life and all its experiences. The Lord sees to it
that each of us has his "Joseph," and that it is preserved no matter
how hard we try to stifle or even destroy it. And if we come to
the realization of our need, as Jacob and his sons did in the time
of famine, we are enabled by the Lord to dig down into our mem 
ories and find our "Joseph" not only still alive but in a position to
save and protect us.

Our lesson today finds Joseph a slave in Egypt. Egypt, we re 
member, is the land of memory-knowledge. How often we relegate
our Joseph to the land of memory-knowledge! Joseph was first sold
to Potiphar, captain of the guard of Pharaoh. Because the Lord
was with Joseph, under him Potiphar's affairs prospered and Poti-
phar advanced Joseph to charge over his household. The very fact
that we have deep within us the recognition of our duty to the
Lord serves to bring a type of order into our external lives, even
though we do not underst~nd.the source of our outward success.
But Potiphar's wife, who represents the affection which belongs
to natural truth, is not satisfied. She wants to own Joseph. We see
this temptation in the effort of the natural mind to explain away
spiritual causes and to reduce everything in life to the level of the
finite human rationality. Joseph resists and leaves the house, but
his garment is left in the hand of Potiphar's wife and she uses it
as evidence against Joseph. Garments represent outmost truths;
Joseph's garment-like the Lord's nearly two thousand years later 
represents "the ultimate of spiritual truth," the letter of the Word.
times the letter of the Word is used to discredit
Think how at
religion! So Potiphar puts Joseph in prison. We put Joseph further
and further out of sight.

Still, Joseph cannot be kept down. In prison he rises to be given
charge of all the other prisoners. When we are bent on leading
worldly lives, we keep many things in ourselves in prison: some
good things because they would bring to our minds truths which
would rebuke and correct us, and some evil things because they
would lead us to acts which would lower our reputation in the
world. The chief butler of Pharaoh and his chief baker represent
these two kinds of prisoner. We are familiar with the thought that
in the Holy Supper the wine represents truth and the bread good.
In the butler's dream he is performing his proper office, pouring
the wine into the cup of his master. But in the baker's dream the
bread which he is carrying to his master is being stolen from his
basket by the birds of the air.

Swedenborg says (AC 5077-5078) that the butler represents the
external sensual which is subject to the intellectual part of the
internal man, and the baker represents the external sensual which
is subject to the voluntary part of the internal man. This is why
the chief butler was restored to his place and the chief baker was
hanged. Our intellectual capacity often is able and willing to re-

ceive memory-knowledges of truth, but at
the same time reject
knowledges of good because we did not want to live according to
them. In short, we often are eager to learn things but unwilling
to put them into practice. Even in the letter there is a difference
between the butler and the baker. When they told Joseph that
they had been troubled by their dreams and Joseph said, "Do not
interpretations belong to God? tell me them, 1 pray you," the
butler had no hesitation in telling his dream immediately. But it
is said of the baker, "When the chief baker saw that the interpret 
ation was good," he proceeded to tell his own dream to Joseph.

judgment, but the baker waited to see if the judgment was likely
to be favorable to him. Still another indication is found in Swe 
denborg's translation of verse 16 of chapter 40. The King James
Version says the baker had "three white baskets" on his head, and
the Revised Standard Version says "three cake baskets." The latter
version gives no indication of any other possible translation, but
the center column in the Oxford teacher's edition (King James)
gives as an alternate translation, "baskets full of holes." * Sweden 
borg says "three baskets with holes in them" [canistra p erfo rata ] ,
and explains the verse as meaning that the baskets represent the

From the Writings of Swedenborg

Arcana Coelestia, n. 5149: "There is falsity from two origins-falsity of doc 
trine, and falsity of evil. Falsity of doctrine does not consume goods, for a
man may be in falsity of doctrine, and yet in good, and therefore men of
every doctrine, even Gentiles, are saved; but the falsity of evil is that which
consumes goods. Evil in itself is opposite to good, yet by itself it does not

belong to good, because truths are as it were outworks that encompass good.
These outworks are assaulted by means of falsity, and when these are as 
saulted, good is given to destruction."

The story should be very familiar to all

the young people of
the Junior age and up, and a few questions and reminders should
be enough except with the Primary class. The emphasis should be
on the difference between Joseph and his older brothers in their
outlook on life, and on the fact
that because Joseph was gentle
and upright, the Lord could be with him and make his very hard 
ships stepping-stones to success.

Doctrinal Points
The nature of memory-knowledges.

Notes for Parents

We all know the story of Joseph. It is one of the most familiar
and the best-loved in the Bible. Looked at from the outside we
might think of it just as a "success story," the story of a young
boy driven from his home by the jealousy of his own brothers,
sold as a slave, cast into prison on false charges, and nevertheless
in thirteen short years declared ruler of Egypt, second only to the
king. Joseph was indeed honest, industrious, prudent, and faithful,
but there is something else in his story which is sometimes over 
looked: When Pharaoh sent for Joseph out of the prison and said
to him, "1 have dreamed a dream, and there is none that can inter 
pret it: and I have heard say of thee, that thou canst understand
a dream to interpret it," Joseph answered, "It is not in me: God
shall give Pharaoh an answer of peace." And after Joseph had
interpreted Pharaoh's dreams,
telling him of the coming famine,
and had advised him to choose a wise man and set him over the
country to prepare against the famine, Pharaoh said to his servants:
"Can we find such a one as this is, a man in whom the Spirit of
God is?" Joseph took no credit to himself for his wisdom. He
believed in God and trusted in His guidance. When Joseph ruled
Egypt, it was the Lord who really ruled.

This is the lesson we should learn from Joseph. We are not wise
except as we learn wisdom from the Lord through His Word. We
all have our seven years of plenty, our times when we have oppor 
tunity to learn the Lord's way of life and when it is easy for us to
learn, and we have our years of famine, the times when the way
seems too hard for us and we recognize our ignorance and weak 
ness. But if in the time of plenty we store our minds with as much
of the Lord's truth as possible, we shall be able to draw on that
store in the hard times.

Childhood and youth are given us for the particular purpose of
acquiring knowledge for life, and the most important knowledge
of all is knowledge of the Lord and His ways. Let us all help our
children to make the most of their years of plenty.

Primary

The teacher should plan to retell the whole story of Joseph as simply as
possible, not adding anything that is not in the Word. Stress the fact that the
Lord could be with Joseph and take care of him because Joseph was good.
There may be children in the class who can tell some of the story themselves.
Always give them an opportunity when possible to tell what they remember.
Point out that things which happen to us that seem very hard at the time will
often lead to good for us if we remain good ourselves.

When Joseph was seventeen, his brothers decided to get rid of
him. When they were all away from home, they seized Joseph and
he was sold to men of a caravan which was on its way to Egypt.
They pretended to their father that Joseph had been killed by a
wild beast.

In Egypt Joseph was sold as a slave to Potiphar, the captain of
the king's guard. Joseph was so industrious and so wise that he
rose to be overseer over his master's household. But Potiphar's
wife lied to her husband about Joseph and her husband believed

her and threw Joseph into prison.

But in prison also Joseph rose, until he was in charge of all the
other prisoners. The king's butler and his baker happened to be
in prison, too, and Joseph interpreted some strange dreams that
they had.

Later Pharaoh-the king-had two dreams which none of his wise men could
interpret.
So the butler who had been in prison told him ofJoseph, and he sent for him.
What were Pharaoh's dreams?
What did Joseph tell him they meant?
What did Joseph advise Pharaoh to do?

Pharaoh found Joseph so wise and so favored by the Lord that

he decided to put Joseph in charge of all the land of Egypt.

Junior

We have included in the Junior notes a description of Egypt for the purpose
of impressing on the children's minds the nature of the country, since its cor 
respondence will become very important when they reach the Intermediate
age. The same principal lesson should be stressed as for the Primary class.

The Joseph story is a very familiar one and most of you have
heard it from the time when you were little children. Let us see
how much you remember of the part of the story which precedes
our chapter for today.

What did Joseph's brothers do with him?
To whom was he sold in Egypt?
To what position did he rise in Potiphar's house?
Who told lies about him to Potiphar?
What did Potiphar do with him?
How did he get along in the prison?
Who were in prison with him?
What did he do for them?
What did Joseph ask of the king's butler?
Did the butler remember when he was free what Joseph had asked him to do?
What fmally made the butler remember Joseph?

This last question is part of our lesson for today. Egypt is a
unique country. It is long and narrow because it follows the course

.

of the Nile River, and all its fertile land is in the valley on either
side of the Nile. This is what a Bible dictionary says about Egypt:
".
. The general appearance of the country cannot have greatly
changed since the days of Moses. The whole country is remarkable
for its extreme fertility, which especially strikes the beholder when
the rich green of the fields is contrasted with the utterly bare,
yellow mountains or the sand-strewn rocky desert on either side.
The climate is equable and healthy. Rain is not very infrequent.
on the northern coast, but inland is very rare. Cultivation nowhere
depends upon it. The inundation of the Nile fertilizes and sus 
tains the country, and makes the river its chief blessing. The Nile
was on this account anciently worshiped. The rise begins in Egypt
about the summer solstice, and the inundation commences about
two months later. The greatest height is attained about or some 
what after the autumnal equinox. The inundation lasts about three
is remarkably
months. The atmosphere, except on the seacoast,
dry and clear, which accounts for the so perfect preservation of
the monuments, with their pictures and inscriptions. The heat is
extreme during a large part of the year. The winters are mild 
from 50° to 60° in the afternoon shade, in the coldest season."
So you can see that seven years of famine in Egypt would be
a very unexpected calamity. And as Egypt, because of its steady
climate and productiveness, was the place to which all the sur 
rounding countries were in the habit of sending for food in times
of drought and famine, it would have been a calamity for many
besides the Egyptians if the famine had caught Egypt unprepared.
How was the Pharaoh (the title of the king of Egypt) of the time of Joseph
warned of the approaching famine?
who finally interpreted his dreams?
What did Joseph advise him to do?
Why did Pharaoh choose Joseph to carry out this advice?
What power did he give him?
Whom did he give him for his wife?
What two sons were born to Joseph?
How did he prepare for the famine?

The story of Joseph teaches us a great many lessons which you

– Anita Dole Bible Study Notes Volume 1 –© 2001 by The Swedenborg Foundation. Scanned by Bayside Church. Used on www.newchurchvineyard.org by permission.

JOSEPH RULER OF EGYPT

will study when you are a little older. But there is one principal
lesson which you can understand now. When things happen to us
which we do not like, we are all liable to waste a great deal of
time and energy in being sorry for ourselves, blaming other people,
and thinking of ways to "pay back" the wrong we believe has been
done to us, and even in finding fault with the Lord for not making
everything in the world just to suit us. If instead of this we, like
Joseph, would accept what has happened without resentment and
begin immediately to make the best of our changed condition and
set ourselves to work at being useful, we should soon find that
what we thought was a misfortune was really an opportunity for
new and greater achievement. We gain strength of character by
meeting our difficulties in the right way, just as we gain physical
strength by exercise.

Intermediate
The correspondence of the story of Joseph-particularly of this part of it-is
especially important for the Intermediates because it may affect their general
attitude toward their lessons in school and Sunday school. The meaning of
the time of famine and of the fact that only Joseph was capable of foreseeing
and providing for it will be of great help to them if they will take it to heart.

There are many things in Joseph's story which remind us of the
Lord's experience when He was on earth. Men hated the Lord
because he pointed out the wrong things they were doing, and the
Lord was betrayed by one who should have loved him, and was
sold for a few pieces of silver. But just as the Lord's trials were
the means of our salvation, so the hardships through which Joseph
passed became a means of advancing him and eventually of saving
his brothers.

Through this story also the Lord teaches us a beautiful, practical
lesson. Egypt represents the plane of memory-knowledge. This
means not only knowledge about the natural world but also the
kind of knowledge we learn in Sunday school: the stories of the
Bible, the Psalms and other passages which we memorize, the Com 
mandments, and the simple lessons we get even before we under-

==== GENESIS 41

stand any of it very deeply. You know from your study of geogra 
phy that Egypt for the most part is a low, flat country, depending
for its fertility entirely on the inundations of the Nile River, which
rarely fail. The rich soil deposited throughout the valley by these
floods raises rich crops of grain, but no precious metals or precious
stones are found in Egypt, although the Egyptians were skilled
workers in the gold and silver which they imported. The Egyptians
of Joseph's time were simple, peaceful, and industrious, and their
great men were noted for their natural learning in the sciences.
The fact that Egypt was the granary of the ancient world is sym-'
bolic of its collected learning. Swedenborg tells us that in ancient
times the knowledge of correspondences was especially cherished
in Egypt and that the Egyptian hieroglyphics were based upon this
knowledge. Ancient Egyptians worshiped the calf, the symbol of
affection for useful natural learning.

The Lord was with Joseph and protected him. His being sold in
Egypt saved him from the jealous plots of his brothers. Hundreds
of years later another Joseph was warned in a dream to take the
to save him from the wrath of Herod.
infant Jesus into Egypt
This has a meaning for us also. The chief business of everyone of
us during our childhood and youth is to acquire knowledge of all
sorts. Did you ever hear it said of someone who had been a very
active child, "I don't see how he ever lived to grow up"? The Lord
takes special care of children until they have learned to take care
of themselves. He gives us a long childhood for the very reason
that we need so much knowledge with which to face the problems
of life, and He takes care of us while we are acquiring this knowl 
edge. When He came into the world, He went down into Egypt to
show us that this is an orderly part of our lives and also as a sym 
bol of what He in His assumed humanity was doing:
learning the
letter of the Scriptures.

The Lord used quotations from the Scriptures constantly in his
ministry. He had learned these in His childhood just as we memor 
ize Bible verses. Only unlike us the Lord in His childhood stored
in His memory all of the Word of the old Testament. This shows

us how important it is that we use the opportunities we have in
childhood and youth to store our minds with knowledge of the
Word and to memorize as much of it as we can.

We have learned that the twelve sons of Jacob represent all the
good thoughts and affections which we develop. But we must
remember that any of these may be "perverted," which means
turned to selfish purposes, just as Joseph's brothers turned against
him because they were thinking of their own importance. When
the Lord makes use of the higher things in us as a
this happens,
means to save us. Joseph in us is our affection for spiritual truth.
Joseph lived in a higher thought world than his older brothers;
he dreamed dreams and interpreted them. So when we love to
think about the Lord and heaven, worldly things-food and clothes
and parties-do not seem so important because we see over and
beyond them. But very often for a time at least our worldly affec 
the better of our "Joseph" and try to get rid of him.
tions get
Then the Lord preserves him for us in Egypt. He becomes a part
of our memory-knowledge and he is in prison there. But even in
prison Joseph rose to become ruler, and he interpreted the dreams
of the butler and the baker. This is a picture of how the Lord
works in our lives even when we have tried to put Him out of our
thoughts. He holds our lives in some sort of order and from time
to time gives us glimpses of what the results of our actions must
finally be.

Then some day an experience comes to us which we cannot
understand, and none of the principles by which we have been
living in our selfish pursuit of our own pleasure is able to help us.
This is Pharaoh with his strange dreams which none of his ma 
gicians could interpret. So we are reminded of Joseph and we send
for him out of prison: we think of the Lord and try to see things
in the light of His truth. And in that light everything becomes
clear and we realize that we must set our lives in order according
to the Lord's w~y instead of our own, as Pharaoh placed Joseph
over all the land.

The seven years of plenty are the times when it is easy for us

==== GENESI S 41

to learn and when we have the opportunity. The seven years of
famine are the times-which come to all of us-when we are too
busy earning a living and taking care of our families to acquire
new knowledge, and have to depend on the principles we have
acquired in our youth. So the earlier we put Joseph in charge of
our land the better.

Basic Correspondences

Joseph = the affection for spiritual truth
for the sake of life
famine = prolonged lack of knowledge

Senior

The principal lesson for the Seniors is the same as that for the Intermediates
but should be approached in terms of the spiritual and natural planes of life
rather than as merely teaching the necessity of storing up knowledge. The
quotation from the writings will serve as a guide here.

Joseph's gradual rise to power in Egypt pictures our gradual
realization that the only really safe and wise ordering of our every 
day life must come from putting it under the government of spiri 
tual principles. When we are young, we are carried away with the
delights of natural learning and natural satisfactions. But we have
premonitions even then that
these will not always be enough.
Pharaoh's dreams are a picture of these times of ours when we ask
ourselves, "Where do we go from here?" None of the magicians of
Egypt-none of the specious arguments of self-interest-can answer
this question. But from deep within us, where worldly interests
have buried it, comes a reminder of someone who can answer,
someone who in the past has told us truly what our life would be
like. The Lord once said to His disciples, "And now I have told
you before it come to pass, that, when it is come to pass, ye might
believe." Most of the spiritual instruction of our childhood is of
this sort. When the magicians could not interpret Pharaoh's dreams,
the butler suddenly remembered Joseph.

JOSEPH RULER OF EGYPT

pictures a practical life which is inclined to be rightly ordered.
In such a life the seven years of plenty picture all the states in
which we are eager to learn and to do what is right. The experi 
ences of these times of plenty are stored up to tide us over the
inevitable times of doubt and uncertainty, which the famine rep 
resents. Whenever in times of sorrow or temptation we remind'
ourselves of what we have learned of the Lord's goodness and of
His Divine providence over us, we are going to Joseph's storehouses
to buy food.

The ability of the spiritual truths we have learned in childhood
to show us plainly what the future will bring and how we should
provide for it leads the wise to order their lives accordingly. As in
the Bible story, we still have many years in Egypt. When we recog 
nize that spiritual principles must rule in our everyday life, we are
not
immediately freed from all necessity of worldly learning and
prudence. Nor are we safely on the highroad to heaven. In the
story the captivity and the forty years wandering in the wilderness
are still ahead, before the bones of Joseph can be taken back to
the Holy Land.

Our chapter for today shows us the necessity of storing up in
our minds, while we are young and learn easily, as much as possible
of the letter of the Word, so that when we need it, the Lord can
recall it to us and give us guidance and strength to see our way
and to resist temptation. And it shows us also that if we are truly
wise, we shall from the start recognize the spiritual as our true
ruler. As Pharaoh said, "Can we find such a one as this is, a man
in whom the Spirit of God is?"

Adult

The most fruitful discussion topic is probably the application of this story to
our own lives in our recurring states of temptation, especially the lesson of
the Lord's wise providence in preparing for these states in us before we our 
selves have reached them. The meaning of Joseph is worthy of careful study.
It is not simple-but our mental processes are not simple-and we could all

profit by a clearer understanding of what actually goes on in our minds and
hearts and of the Lord's care over us.

The story of Joseph is so familiar to us and contains so many
obvious lessons that we do not always stop to think of its spiritual

meaning.
readily that Joseph sold into Egypt and there cast into prison is
a picture of how the spiritual inclinations of childhood and youth
are often pushed into the background and even willfully confined
there as our young people grow up and become absorbed in the
activities and pleasures of adult life in the world. If we have been
careful to give them adequate spiritual instruction in their child 
hood and to foster in them an affirmative attitude toward religion
and the church, we can be patient during this period of lessened
interest, knowing that Joseph is still alive and at work under the
surface and will in the Lord's good time be brought forth to inter 
pret
their problems and nourish them in the inevitable time of
famine.

But no part of the Word is applicable to one period of life alone.
If we are making spiritual progress, we pass through various cycles
of the Word again and again in the course of our lives. With every
spiritual success-such as is pictured by the return of Jacob and
his family to the Holy Land-there comes the temptation to be
self-satisfied, to forget that our seeming goodness is not our own
and to imagine that we shall not again be in want of spiritual
instruction and help. The place we think we have earned for our 
selves in the world is very satisfactory. Every time we close our
minds to the thought that we still have shortcomings, "Joseph"
is sold into Egypt.

Our own wisdom cannot prevent the recurring famine nor pro 
vide against it. Our chapter for today teaches us how the Lord
foresees our coming need and prepares us to meet it. We recall that
Joseph later said to his brothers, "God did send me before you to
preserve life." (Genesis 45: 5) Egypt pictures the plane of memory 
knowledge. In that plane in our minds are gathered all the facts
we have ever learned, not only the facts concerning the physical

world and life in it but all we have read and heard of the letter of
the Word and the instruction which has been given us in connec 
tion with it. The Lord's preparation for our time of need begins in
this plane. He sees to it that a Pharaoh-a ruling principle-comes
to the throne in Egypt who wants to be enlightened. Then he
inspires dreams which foreshadow the approaching trouble. Then,
to interpret the dreams and provide for the salvation of the people,
He causes the butler to remember Joseph and brings Joseph up out
of prison.

is 'Joseph,'

We should try to come to some understanding of what Joseph
and his experiences mean in our own lives, if we are regenerating.
For this effort one of the most helpful passages is AC 4286, where
in connection with the changing of Jacob's name to Israel Sweden 
borg says: "That this signifies the Divine celestial spiritual now,
and that
'Israel' is the celestial spiritual man in the natural, and
thus is natural; and that- the celestial spiritual man itself, which is
rational,
is evident from what follows. This is the
reason why it is said that Israel is the celestial spiritual man which
is in the natural, and thus is natural; and that Joseph is the celestial
spiritual man itself, which is rational. For in the universal sense
all the good which is of love and charity is called celestial, and all
the derivative truth of faith and intelligence is said to be spiritual."
Another helpful statement
is found in AC 4585 in connection
with the birth of Benjamin: "These things cannot fall into the
understanding of anyone unless it is known what the external man
and the internal man are, and that the former is distinct fro"m the
latter, although while man is living in the body they appear as one;
also unless it is known that the natural constitutes the external
man, and the rational the internal; and further unless it is known
what the spiritual is and what the celestial."

The importance to us of the Lord's provision for our times of
famine is impressed upon us throughout the interpretation of this
part of the Joseph story in the Arcana. In AC 5342 we find this
especially clear and simple statement: "That truths adjoined to
good are stored up in the interiors of the natural mind, and there

==== GENESIS 41

preserved for use in after life, especially for use in temptations
during man's regeneration, is a secret known to few at this day;
and therefore something must be said about this. For by the 'seven
years of abundance of produce' are signified the truths first multi 
plied, and by the corn being 'put in the cities' and 'in the midst'
is signified that
these truths adjoined to good are stored up in
man's interiors; and by the 'seven years of famine,' and by the
sustenance at that time from the gatherings, is signified a state of
regeneration through truths adjoined to good, stored up in the
interiors.... It is these truths adjoined to good that in the proper
sense are called 'remains.' In so far therefore as the man suffers
himself to be regenerated, so far the remains serve for use; for so
far a supply from them is drawn forth by the Lord, and is sent
back into the natural, in order to produce a correspondence of
the exteriors with the interiors, or of what is natural with what is
spiritual; and this is effected in the state signified by the 'seven
years of famine.' Such is the secret. The man of the church at this
day believes that no matter what anyone's life is, he may of mercy
be received into heaven, and there enjoy eternal bliss; for he sup 
poses admission to be all that is necessary. But he is much mis 
taken, for no one can be admitted and received into heaven unless
he has received spiritual life, and no one can receive spiritual life
unless he is being regenerated, and no one can be regenerated
except through the good of life conjoined with the truth of doc 
trine: from this he has spiritual life. "

From the Writings of Swedenborg

Arcana Coelestia, n. 5326: "The natural in the man who is being created anew,
that is who is being regenerated, is entirely different from what it is in the
man who is not being regenerated. The natural in the man who is not being
regenerated is everything; from it the man thinks and desires, and not from
the rational, still less from the spiritual, because these are closed and for the
most part extinct. But
in the man who is being regenerated the spiritual
becomes everything, and not only disposes the natural in its thinking and
desiring, but also determines the character of it, just as the cause determines

the character of the effect; for in every effect the only thing that acts is the
cause. Thus the natural becomes as the spiritual is; for the natural things in
the natural, such as the knowledges that derive somewhat from the natural
world, do nothing from themselves; they merely agree that the spiritual should
act in the natural, and by means of it, thus naturally."

Here again we have a lesson in which a familiar story needs to
be reviewed briefly by way of introduction-the whole story of
Joseph. In the notes for each age group the attempt has been made
to suggest the particular features of the story best suited to lead
into the lesson for the day with children of that age.

Doctrinal Points
The Lord took on a human nature from Mary and glorified it, or
or made it Divine, by overcoming the temptations which came
to Him through it.

The inmost or celestial sense of the Word describes the inner life

of the Lord when He was on earth.

The Lord keeps our early states of belief stored up within us as

a basis for our later salvation.

Good will must really be first, although we have to learn what is

right before we can do it.

Notes for Parents

We all know something of the beautiful story of Joseph, one of
the few people in the Old Testament who seem wholly admirable.
There are many things in the story which make us think of the
Lord's life on earth. He was despised by his brothers, as the Lord
was later "despised and rejected of men." He was sold for a few
pieces of silver. He was providentially taken down into Egypt to
preserve him from destruction. And because he trusted the Lord
and did right, he became wise and great, as the Lord "increased
in wisdom and stature, and in favor with <;;od and man." Finally
he became the ruler to whom his brothers bowed down, and he
forgave them and saved them.

Joseph is a representative of our higher spiritual perceptions.

JOSEPH'S SONS

These are in all of us, but while our thoughts and efforts are
centered on worldly success, we try to forget them, to put them
away out of sight. Then the Lord has to preserve them for us,
and He strengthens them so that when trouble comes we can go
to them for help.

Joseph had two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh. How often in the
Bible we find stories of two brothers! They always represent faith
and charity, or the understanding and the will. Joseph's two sons
picture the thoughts and the intentions which spring from our
recognition of the fact that we must believe and trust divine truth
as the Lord gives it to us in His Word. Manasseh was the firstborn.
He is the intention, the will. We never do or think anything except
from some impulse of the will. That is the first thing. But we find
that Jacob, when he was about to die, put Ephraim before Manas 
seh. Ephraim is the thought. No intention of ours can be carried
out until we have learned how to accomplish it. So we must learn
what is right before we can do it. We know that often our good
intentions seem to miscarry because, as we say, we "acted on
impulse." That
is why we bring our children to Sunday school
and why we must all continue all our lives to study the Bible and
go to church for help in understanding it. We need to learn new
truth from the Lord all the time; for no matter how good our
intentions, we can make no spiritual progress without it.

Primary

Joseph is almost the only individual in the Old Testament story of whom
no unworthy actions are recorded; so his story is easy to present to young
children. Be sure they get the name Joseph and know whose son he was and
that he himself had two sons who were specially favored by Jacob. The cross 
ing of Jacob's hands will interest the children, and help to fIx the story in
mind. It may be illustrated by action to impress it on their minds. call their
that Jacob himself had been put ahead of his twin
attention to the fact
brother Esau, who was actually the ftrstborn.

When a great famine came to the Holy Land, Jacob sent his sons
down to Egypt to buy food, and they had to buy it from Joseph.
Joseph was kind to them and forgave them for what they had done
to him, and told them to bring Jacob and their families and all
their flocks and herds down to Egypt, and he would take care of
them until the famine was over. And the king of Egypt, who was
called the Pharaoh, loved Joseph so much that he gave Joseph's
family the land of Goshen, which was the best land in Egypt.
In fact, they were so prosperous there that they did not want to
go home and they stayed on in Egypt for many years.

What two sons did Joseph have?
Which was the older?
When Jacob was about to die, what did Joseph do?
The blessing of the head of the family was considered very important.
Which son did Joseph expect to have the better blessing?
To which one did Jacob give it?
When you are older, you will understand why he did this.
Jacob and Joseph both died in Egypt, but they were finally buried in
the Holy Land.
Their bodies were embalmed, a method the Egyptians had for preserving
the body.
An embalmed body is called a "mummy." You may have heard about them.

Junior
Draw as much as possible of the story of Joseph from the children's memories.
Make the connection with today's lesson through Isaac's blessing of Jacob 
it may be well to read aloud some verses from Genesis 27: 1-29. This and
Genesis 45:4-11 offer a good opportunity to explain how the Lord can make
good use of even our wrong actions so that we ourselves learn by experience
and those we intended to injure are benefited. Call attention to the reason
why Ephraim and Manasseh are later named with the sons of Jacob as heads
of tribes in place of Joseph.

In Egypt the Lord took care of Joseph because Joseph was good
and trusted Him and obeyed Him always. He did well in every
work that was given him and rose to become a great man, ruler
of all Egypt, second only to the king.

Joseph did not return evil for evil. You know the Lord never
lets misfortunes come to us without a good reason. When the great
famine came and Jacob sent his sons down to Egypt to buy food,

JOSEPH'S SONS

the brothers were frightened when they discovered that the great
ruler of Egypt was their own brother Joseph, whom they had
wronged. But Joseph reassured them and forgave them. Read Gen 
esis 45:4-11. So Jacob and all his family came down to Egypt, and
Pharaoh the king, because he loved Joseph, gave them for their
home the rich land of Goshen in the Nile delta.

In the Bible story the parental blessing is very important, for it
was always inspired by the Lord and was sure to be fulfilled. Jacob
himself had deceived his father Isaac into giving him the blessing
which he would naturally have given to Esau, his firstborn. But
this,
too, was something which was permitted to happen for a
good reason. Now Jacob does intentionally what his father was
tricked into doing. The inner reason is the same in both cases, and
you will understand it when you are older. You must remember
that everything in the Word of God has a deep meaning and lesson
within it.

What two sons were born to Joseph in Egypt?
Which was the older?
Why did Joseph bring them to his father?
How did he try to arrange things so that his blind father would know which
which the elder?
What did Jacob do?
What did he say when Joseph tried to move his hands?
What special position did he give to Joseph's sons? (verse 5)

This is why we shall find, as we go on in the Bible story, that
among the tribes of the children of Israel there was no tribe called
Joseph,* but
instead there were two tribes called Ephraim and
Manasseh. What the special "portion" was which Jacob added to
Joseph's inheritance you may learn by reading Genesis 33: 18-20
and John 4: 5.

Jacob died in Egypt. We are told that his body was embalmed.
The Egyptians had a wonderful way of preserving the body by the
use of spices and salt and by wrapping it very carefully in narrow
strips of cloth. This was called embalming. Some of the bodies so

*But see Rev. 7:8.
treated have been found in the Egyptian tombs perfectly preserved
after several thousand years. They are called mummies. The secret
of this process has been lost. It took about forty days, and there
was a period of thirty more days of mourning before they started
for the burial place. So it is said that they mourned for Jacob
seventy days. Jacob's sons took his body back to the Holy Land
and placed it in the cave of Machpelah, where Abraham and Sarah,
Isaac and Rebekah, and Leah were already buried.

Then they came back and settled down in Egypt.

When Joseph was about to die, what promise did he ask his family to make?
What did they do with Joseph's body temporarily?

You will see how they fulfilled their promise if you will read
Joshua 24: 32. Joseph's body was not placed in the cave of Mach 
pelah but buried in the portion which had come to him by special
gift from his father.

Intermediate

Try to give the Intermediates a sense of the story of Joseph as a whole and
of its general meaning. Use the chapter for today to emphasize the import 
ance of having knowledge of what is right in addition to good intentions,
and Joseph's death as a preparation for the change we shall find in the picture
with the opening of the book of Exodus.

In Egypt Joseph gradually proved his wisdom and rose to power.
Then his brothers had to come to him for help and bow before
him, and he was able to save his whole family and keep them from
dying of hunger in the time of famine. The Lord preserves the
spiritual faculties in us until we are fully grown up and ready to
recognize that we cannot live without them.

Our chapter for today comes near the end of the period of our
natural development. Jacob is about to die. The story of Joseph's
bringing his sons to his father to bless and of Jacob's giving the
greater blessing to the younger son reminds us of the earlier story
of Isaac's blessing Jacob and Esau. Ephraim and Manasseh picture
much the same thing as Jacob and Esau-truth and good-but on

JOSEPH'S SONS

a plane further advanced in the working out of the heavenly life.
Truth still has to be put first, although good is really primary.
That
is, although everything we do proceeds from some desire,
we have to learn what to do before we can carry out our desire.
In spiritual things we have to learn from the Lord what is right
and make ourselves do it before we come to love it. In this story
the placing of truth first
is conscious and intentional (verse 19),
as we now have a more mature understanding of what is necessary,
whereas in the Isaac stage of our life we reacted blindly.

Jacob gives Ephraim and Manasseh an equal place with his own
sons,
thus giving Joseph's family a double portion in the inherit 
ance. Our spiritual faculties have such a double portion when we
recognize our debt to the Lord. Note the last verse in chapter 48.
The additional portion here given to Joseph is not described, but
we find out elsewhere what it was. Read Genesis 33: 18-20, Joshua
24:32, and John 4:5.

Jacob died at the age of one hundred and forty-seven, and his
body was embalmed. Mr. Worcester in The Sower tells us that the
Egyptian practice of embalming did not mean that they thought
the body was to be used again, for there are evidences in their
paintings that they knew that the soul left the body at death and
continued in a spiritual body. It probably meant that the physical
body had taken on the form of the soul, and with those who had
been good they wanted to indicate that this form would be pre 
served. They did not even bury the evil. Whether the ancient
Egyptians really knew this or not, it is the meaning of the embalm 
ing of Jacob and Joseph. Jacob's body was taken back to Hebron
and buried in the cave of Machpelah with Abraham and Sarah,
Isaac and Rebekah, and Leah. All that we accomplish on the plane
of natural goodness is stored up at once as part of our permanent
character.

Joseph makes his family give him the same promise that he had
given his father, but when he dies, it is not immediately fulfilled.
His body is embalmed and put in a coffin in Egypt. As we go
further in our worldly development, our spiritual faculties, though
preserved for us by the Lord, are apt again to become dormant
for a time, laid away in the memory. All through the period of
slavery in Egypt, Joseph's body was still there embalmed and in
a coffin, waiting for the promised release and return to the Holy
Land.

Senior

The lesson for the Seniors may be centered on the meaning of Manasseh and
Ephraim, sons of Joseph, as compared with Esau and Jacob, sons of Isaac.
Show them how in our lives similar states recur again and again, but always
on a different level, higher or lower according to whether we are progressing
spiritually or not.

When we, at the beginning of our adult life, determine to obey
the Lord instead of the dictates of worldliness-which is the begin 
ning of the church in each of us-the real struggle within us begins.
All our selfish thoughts and habits rise up to resist this new spiri 
impulse. But the Lord preserves our "Joseph" in obscurity
tual
and he develops to greatness and power without our knowledge.
And in the time of famine-when real trouble comes-we redis 
cover him and submit ourselves to him in Egypt. That is, we begin
in earnest the task of learning what the Lord would have us do
in order to save our souls. Jacob and all his family go down into
Egypt and put themselves under Joseph's protection and care.
. Our story for today reminds us of the story of Esau and Jacob,
in which Jacob, although not the firstborn of the twins, succeeded
in taking from Esau both the birthright and the paternal blessing.
Manasseh and Ephraim, like Esau and Jacob, represent good and
truth, but the level has changed. Esau and Jacob, when they were
born, represent good and truth on the unregenerate natural plane,

JOSEPH'S SONS

a good disposition and a lively mind, perhaps-but we have now
through Jacob's sojourn in Haran and return to Bethel
advanced,
and through the rise of Joseph to power, to the point where we are
able to understand truth and experience goodness intellectually.

Swedenborg makes a distinction, however, between "the intel 
lectual of the church" and what we popularly call "intellectual,"
as you will see from the quotation at
the end of this lesson.
Ephraim and Manasseh represent not our understanding of truth
and our will
to good unrelated to God, but the intellectual of
the church and the good of the church in us. This is still on the
natural plane-Ephraim and Manasseh were born in Egypt-but it
comes from the higher plane of our souls where the Lord reaches
us-their father was Joseph.

Manasseh, like Esau, was the firstborn son. The will is always
first. We do nothing and think nothing except from an act of will.
takes a good impulse in our hearts to make us even begin to
It
think about what we ought to do. But the impulse does not teach
us what is right. We all know that our good intentions often seem
to get lost, and we find ourselves doing harm when we meant to
do good. We have to think and to learn from the Word what is
right before our good intentions can result
in right action. This
is why Jacob was permitted to take precedence over Esau and Eph 
raim over Manasseh. Joseph, our internal perception, knows that
the will comes first, but Jacob, our "practical" nature, recognizes
that our understanding must for a time have first consideration.
Jacob presently dies in Egypt, but according to his last request,
his sons take his body back to Canaan for burial in the cave of
Machpelah, where Abraham and Sarah, Isaac and Rebekah, and
Leah are already buried. Joseph lives for some time after his father
but he, too, eventually dies in Egypt. He does not ask to be taken
back immediately but foresees that in the end his people will all
go back and makes them promise to take his body with them
when they go. By the time of Joseph's death it has become evident
that the Israelites have settled down for a long stay in Egypt.

This is a picture of a time in our lives when we think our spiri-
tual health and comfort are assured without further effort on
our part. Today we sometimes read and hear about "making the
decision for Christ," and the assumption often is that one who has
made this decision is "saved." Even in the New Church there is
a tendency to imagine that once we have joined the church and
established ourselves as respectable Christian people, we can stop
studying the Word and the writings and just "let our conscience
be our guide." The fallacy of this attitude is brought out in the
first chapters of the book of Exodus. But no matter how long we
remain in Egypt, we should remember that the body of Joseph,
though embalmed and in a coffin, is there with us waiting to be
restored to its proper place. The Lord preserves our former spiri 
tual perceptions until we are ready to do something with them.
And the Lord's providence is over our external lives, permitting
such experiences to come to us as may awaken us again to a sense
of need.

Adult

The correspondence of Joseph and Benjamin and of Ephraim and Manasseh
is the focal point of the lesson. In discussing the latter the teacher may want
to read to the class the quotation from the writings found at the end of the
lesson. There is excellent discussion material in the whole of AC 6222.

One of the most striking features of the Bible story is the recur 
rent cycles, often involving very similar incidents. Our chapter for
today, with its account of the blessing of Ephraim and Manasseh,
takes us back to the blessing of Jacob and Esau, and still further
back to the offerings of Cain and Abel. Each pair of brothers
represents faith and charity, or truth and good, but in different
contexts and at different levels. In each case a series of events
leads up to and follows from the relationship between the two
brothers. In the first
instance, because of the immediate back 
ground of the story, the brother representing faith is born first.
In the other two, although the brother representing love is the
firstborn, he is supplanted by his brother.

JOSEPH'S SONS

These repetitions are not accidental, and the lesson they teach
is an important one. Our lives proceed in cycles, beginning anew
with each new emergence of truth and good. If we are progressing
spiritually, the cycles carry us ever higher. If we have turned away
from the Lord, their course is inverted. We recall that the hells are
described as a man upside down (AC 3641).

The life of Jacob followed one cycle: He lived through his time
of temptation and development, returned to his childhood home,
became reconciled to his brother, and inherited his father's pos 
ition as head of the family. Joseph and Benjamin, his last-born
sons, were still in their childhood. But they constituted the begin 
ning of a new cycle. They, too, represent love and truth; but this
time the conflict was not between the two but between Joseph
and his older brothers, and Joseph was the one who was despised
and rejected. This is because Jacob was the last representative
of the Ancient Church, which was a true church, as well as the
immediate ancestor of the Israelitish Church, which was only rep 
resentative of a church. You recall
the difference between the
names Jacob and Israel. Note their use in this chapter. A new
period is beginning, in which the church is being built up. In order
that it may exist at all,
it must have some connection with the
Lord, and that connection is established through Joseph. The spirit
of the older brothers in the story is the spirit of that church
toward any internal spiritual qualities.

In technical

terms Benjamin represents "the spiritual of the
celestial" and Joseph the "celestial of the spiritual." This is not
a mere juggling of words. We can understand them and the differ 
ence between them if we remember that between the inmost or
celestial plane of the soul, where the Lord's influx enters, and the
outmost natural plane, which is in contact with the material world,
there is the interior or rational plane, which opens both ways.
Benjamin represents divine truth as it flows in from the celestial
plane through the rational into the natural. Joseph represents the
good-the celestial-which belongs to this truth. The older brothers
are the various faculties developed in the natural plane itself. They
are good or bad as they serve or resist Joseph.

In terms of the general development of the man or woman who
is regenerating, the period of Jacob is the time when he is develop 
ing his independent life on the natural plane. At some point in
that period he becomes conscious of the possibility of a higher
development within him than the merely worldly. This is the birth
of Joseph. He returns to the Holy Land of his earlier years and
reestablishes himself in worship of the Lord. But this is the signal
for a new struggle. The natural faculties resist the encroachment of
a higher authority. The older brothers say, "Behold, this dreamer
this point the
cometh," and sell Joseph into Egypt. That is, at
first desire of our natural faculties is to relegate divine truth to
the plane of memory-knowledge and keep it a prisoner there.

The story of Joseph is quite generally recognized as a fore 
shadowing of the Lord's life on earth. The Lord was carried into
Egypt to escape the wrath of the jealous Herod. He, too, was lost
to the sight of the recognized church and in obscurity "increased
in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and man." In the
regenerating person, the Lord's providence cares for and develops
the faculty of receiving divine truth until a time of famine comes
and the person realizes his own helplessness and is ready to submit
his judgment to providence. Then a new learning period begins.
Jacob and his whole family come to Egypt.

The book of Genesis leaves us with a picture of the Egyptian
state when it is orderly. Pharaoh-the natural principle--is on the
throne. But he has voluntarily placed Joseph in full control of the
land, and Israel and all his family have been settled in the best of
the land that
they may be nourished and protected during the
years of famine. It is a picture of an orderly learning period. Our
freedom of choice is unimpaired, but we have chosen the Lord as
our ruler, set our natural affections and thoughts in their proper
relation to Him, and settled down to receive instruction from Him.
One feature of this picture is Jacob's final setting up of Joseph's
two sons as equal to his own. He says, "as Reuben and Simeon
they shall be mine." Reuben and Simeon represent faith and obedi-

ence on the natural plane. Ephraim and Manasseh represent faith
and obedience on the intellectual plane. In AC 6216 Swedenborg
says, "The intellectual of the church is 'Ephraim,' and the will of
the church is 'Manasseh.'" From this point on in the Word, the
spiritual church is represented by Israel and the children of Israel,
even though the Jewish Church, represented by Jacob, is not itself
a true church even on the natural plane. We should note here a
statement made by Swedenborg in AC 6222 concerning Ephraim:
"This intellectual, which is called the intellectual of the church,
is more interior than the intellectual which comes from mere
memory-knowledges, for it is a perception that the thing is so,
not from the dictate of memory-knowledges and philosophy, but
from the dictate of the Word in its spiritual sense." Ephraim and
Manasseh are adopted by Jacob, but they are actually the sons of
Joseph, who represents the Divine as it enters the rational plane
of the mind from above.

The placing of Ephraim before Manasseh by Jacob, although
Manasseh was the firstborn, teaches a lesson which recurs so fre 
quently in the Word and is also expressed so clearly in the writings
that we have no excuse for ignoring it. The will is primary. We do
or think nothing without an act of will. But before the will can
accomplish any purpose, the mind must be instructed. And this
cannot be done once for all. The same situation recurs in every
cycle in the Word. However good our intentions may be, we make
no spiritual progress unless we are constantly trying to acquire
new truth from the Word and the writings. If we think our con 
science, as already developed, is a sufficient guide for the rest of
our lives, we are woefully mistaken. We have simply embalmed
Joseph and put him in a coffin and settled down to take our
direction from the Egyptians.

From the Writings of Swedenborg

Arcana Coelestia, n. 6222: "It is believed that those have an intellectual in
the things of the church who are skilful in confirming the tenets or doctrinals of theIr own church by many thIngs, and thIs even to persuasIOn that It IS so,
and who also are slalfulIn dexterously confutmg many heresIes But thIs IS
not the Intellectual of the church, for to confIrm a tenet IS not of the mte1 
lectual, but of mgenUlty In the sensuous, and It IS. sometImes found In the
worst of men, and can also be done by those who belIeve nothmg whatever,
and also by those who are In very falSIties NothIng IS more easy than for all
such persons to confum whatever they please, even to the pomt of persuadIng
the sImple But the mtellectual of the church IS, to perceIve and see, before
any tenet IS confIrmed, whether It Is true or not, and then to conftrm It
ThIs IS the Intellectual whIch IS represented by Ephralffi, but the good of the
church, whIch IS represented by Manasseh, IS the good of chanty whIch IS
Insmuated by the Lord Into the man of the church by means of the truths
of faIth, for these, together WIth the good of chanty, are what flow Into the
Intellectual and enlIghten It, and also make the mtellectual and the will con 
stitute one mInd
all the affection of good and truth, by whIch comes
enlIghtenment, flows from no other source, and thus IS born from no other
source, than the Internal, that IS, through the mternal from the Lord"
