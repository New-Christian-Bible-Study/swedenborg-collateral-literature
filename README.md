Nothing to see here quite yet as we're in early stages of organizing and prototyping and testing toward a collaborative effort to proofread, edit, and clean up some of our raw sources of collaborative literature.

Target titles for this experience can be found at https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/explanatory-works (including the linked Bible Commentary titles).
Source files are .PDF or .HTML and are here being rendered into plain text which is then marked up with AsciiDoc and published by AsciiDoctor.
Accordingly, there is an AsciiDoc extension published by AsciiDoctor for use with VSCode.
To set up a working environment, start with the instruction guides in https://github.com/New-Christian-Bible-Study/swedenborg-collateral-literature/tree/main/docs/setup
