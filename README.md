Welcome to the NCBS repository for our Collateral Literature library. 

Here we support a collaborative effort to proofread, edit, and clean up some of our raw sources of collaborative literature, to enable integration with the NCBS environment, and user readability in either PDF or EPUB formats.

Target titles for this experience can be found at https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/explanatory-works (including the linked Bible Commentary titles). Source files there are relatively rough .PDF or .HTML, and are here rendered into plain text which is then marked up with AsciiDoc and published by AsciiDoctor. ref. https://asciidoctor.org

Accordingly, there is an AsciiDoc extension published by AsciiDoctor for use with VSCode, and available in VSCode's Extension Marketplace
To set up a working environment, start with the instruction guides in docs/setup locally, and online at https://github.com/New-Christian-Bible-Study/swedenborg-collateral-literature/tree/main/docs/setup (still being improved)

Once configured, the general workflow here is as follows:
Select a file to work on from the status list, docs/title-status.csv
Open the file from the text/ directory.



As appropriate, update the status file and/or create or update an Issue via the online repo at github, https://github.com/New-Christian-Bible-Study/swedenborg-collateral-literature/issues



Please contact us with questions or interest.
