Welcome to the NCBS repository for our Collateral Literature library.

Editors' notes and comments go in this block

Here we support a collaborative effort to proofread, edit, and clean up some of our raw sources of collaborative literature, to enable integration with the NCBS environment, and user readability in either PDF, EPUB, MOBI, and other requested formats.

Target titles for this experience can be found at https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/explanatory-works (including the linked Bible Commentary titles). Source files there are relatively rough .PDF or .HTML, and are here rendered into plain text which is then marked up with AsciiDoc and published by AsciiDoctor. ref. https://asciidoctor.org

Accordingly, there is an AsciiDoc extension published by AsciiDoctor for use with VSCode, and available in VSCode's Extension Marketplace.

To set up a working environment, start with the instruction guides online at https://github.com/New-Christian-Bible-Study/swedenborg-collateral-literature/tree/main/docs/setup (still being improved) .... 

Once configured, the general workflow here is envisioned to be:
Select a file to work on from the status list: `docs/title-status.csv`; then open the .adoc file from the `text/` directory.

Each file is available for multiple work streams which can be concurrent.

1. Editing Text - proofreading and editing the text; what we're working with here has been through a process which is likely paginated, likely line wrapped, likely includes dash characters which split a word at the line boundary, or represent a common term such as parent-in-law, or breaks the stream of thought - as a semicolon might also serve. The digital tools which have processed these files don't really distinguish between these uses, and you'll see where dashes need spaces added or removed, or need to be deleted, or inserted. Lines may ought to be broken, or joined. The only authoritative guide to any individual text is usually not available to us. Some of us will have bound published books which would be considered authoritative. Some authoritative sources may no longer be available at all.

2. Editing Markup - another processing stream is in the 'markup' for style of output documents (i.e. headings, sections, lists); this involves manipulating blocks of text with the insertion of punctuation characters which are read by software (AsciiDoctor) which converts this plain text into a pleasant readable or printable style.

3. Background Editing - can be applied to the entire project fileset, at any time, for doing things such as converting roman numerals to integers, standardizing the form and style of common elements such as Biblical and Writings references. It's where the text and the markup intersect. See the document `docs/StyleGuide.adoc` for punctuation usage as it should be applied to both text and markup editing.

4. Proofing against an Original - which can encompass the others - requires access to some presentation of the authoritative original.

One way to proceed with text proofing is in real time in the VSCode interface. Commit your changes to the repo at least once per day.

Another way to engage the proofreading is to download the .PDF for local reading, or print it out and edit on paper; or download the EPUB or MOBI for reading on your mobile device. From these you can make annotations while reading offline; and return to enter the edits. + 
These published files are frequently updated and available at https://angelharbor.org/NCBS

In any case, please annotate(*) **the Status file (docs/title-file.csv)** by putting your name into the Proofing field for your chosen Title, and use VSCode from time to time (weekly or so; whatever you're comfortable with) to make the edits which your proofreading revealed. All edits are made to the .adoc file in `text/`

(*)example of a footnote to mention that .csv file editing is best done with the "Edit CSV" extension
