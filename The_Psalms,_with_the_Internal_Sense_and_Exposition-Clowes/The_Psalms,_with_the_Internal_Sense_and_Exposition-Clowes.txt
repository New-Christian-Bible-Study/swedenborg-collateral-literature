PREFACE

THE PSALMS, or the songs, and praises, and prayers of Israel, contain a complete 
history and description of the internal states, and of the spiritual experience of every 
member of the LORD'S Church. On the one hand we behold the good and the pious, 
strengthened by Divine mercy and power, withstanding the "fiery darts" of the 
wicked, and though a "host encamp around them," yet "are they not afraid;" though 
they "walk through the valley of the shadow of death," yet "they fear not," because 
they "are comforted and protected by the rod and staff" of infinite power and 
goodness. When in temptations, "combating the foes of their own household," the 
great REDEEMER JESUS CHRIST, the Mighty GOD, the Everlasting FATHER, is 
represented as "their shield and their buckler, their high tower, and their mighty 
bulwark of defence." When on their weary pilgrimage through the wilderness of this 
world, when their soul is fainting within them," he leads them in a "cloudy pillar by 
day, and in a pillar of fire by night;" he "strikes the rock in the desert," and the waters 
flow, and sends "bread from heaven, to satisfy the longing soul." Thus, the good and 
the pious find in the songs of Zion every encouragement, every consolation, every 
support, and the nearer they approach the gates of the celestial city, the more the 
"wondrous things" contained in the Psalms of David open to their enraptured minds. 
As the dawn of day gradually breaks upon the darkness of night, and continually 
brightens to a meridian splendour, discovering in indefinite variety the numberless 
objects of creation, so the "day-spring" from on high gradually dawns upon the 
benighted perceptions of the unregenerate mind, when it begins to be delighted with 
the divine objects which the Psalmist contemplates, and opens to its view the celestial 
prospects and the divine realities of the kingdom of heaven.

To the wicked and impious, on the contrary, if they will but for a moment arouse to 
serious reflection and feeling, the book of Psalms exhibits in most awful imagery, if 
they still persist in the "counsel of the ungodly," and still "sit in the seat of the 
scornful," their final allotments:—"the snare of the fowler" will beset them, "the 
noisome pestilence" will seize upon them, "the terror by night will affright them," "the
arrow that flieth by day will pierce them," and "the wasting destruction will over-
whelm them." How dreadful are these figures! But, how much more dreadful are the 
corresponding realities! As no state of goodness is left unnoticed and undescribed in 
the Divine Psalms from the "little good of the righteous," to that denoted by the purest
"gold of Ophir," or the "heights of Zion," so no state of evil from the "slipping of the 
foot" to the "lowest hell" is permitted to lie in concealment. The Psalms, therefore, 
spiritually understood, and practically applied, are a universal palladium to the 
regenerate and the pious, warning and guarding them against every evil from the 
"lifting up of the heel," to the "raising of the head,"—from the grossest sensual 
propensities, to the inmost subtleties of a deep-rooted self-love, and a universal 
panacea to the evil and unregenerate, who may there find a power by which they 
"may burst asunder the bands of wickedness, and cast away from them its cords," who
may thus have every "plague stayed," every "disease healed," be established in 
spiritual health, "clad with light as with a garment," and adorned with the "beauties of 
holiness."

2

These are the great and "wondrous things" of which the Psalms treat! All subjects of 
less moment than these are as inferior to the primary object and end for which these 
divine songs have been inspired by the mouth of God, as the earth is inferior to 
heaven. Every idea which binds these divine inspirations down to the personal history 
of David, and the circumstances of his age, as is the case with some commentators, is 
represented in the powerful language of scripture as "drawing the stars from heaven, 
and casting them down to the earth," that is, as prostituting the sacred knowledges of 
the spiritual sense of GOD'S most Holy Word, to mere earthly and selfish purposes, of 
abiding in the "letter which killeth," to the "quenching of the Spirit which maketh 
alive." David, and the history of his age, formed the direct base and plane into which 
the treasures of revealed wisdom could flow, and in which, as in suitable vessels, they 
could be transmitted to the remotest generations of mankind. Whilst, therefore, the 
literal sense of the Psalms in the following translation has been regarded with the 
most scrupulous, yea, most anxious solicitude, and with the most profound 
veneration, yet, it is especially to the spiritual and "wondrous things" of the internal 
sense that the reader's devout attention is invited.

That the Psalms, alike with every other portion of the Word of GOD, contain an 
internal, or spiritual sense, is well known to the readers of the doctrines of the New 
Jerusalem, but the assertion may probably appear strange and fanciful to those who 
are not yet acquainted with those doctrines. To them, therefore, a few words 
respecting the nature and tendency of the spiritual sense may not only be acceptable 
but expedient, in order that they may properly appreciate the following spiritual 
interpretations of the Psalms, and thus see the beauty, uniformity, and universal 
applicability of that admirable, yea, divine science, the science of correspondences, by
which those interpretations have been made. In order to give the reader a concise view
of the nature and tendency of the internal, or spiritual sense, contained in every 
portion of the Word of GOD, we cannot do better than make two or three extracts on 
the subject from the writings of the enlightened Swedenborg, who, as is verily 
believed, was the instrument, under especial divine auspices, of making known that 
sense to mankind, and thus of enabling them through it as a means, aided by the Holy 
Spirit of the LORD, clearly to understand the Sacred Scriptures of revealed truth, and 
in this manner to banish all discord, dissension, and heresy from the Christian church.

"That all things in nature," says Swedenborg, "both in general and in particular, 
correspond to things spiritual, and in like manner all and every thing in the human 
body, is shewn in the treatise concerning HEAVEN AND HELL, n. 87 to 105. But what is 
meant by correspondence, hath to this day remained unknown, notwithstanding it was 
a subject most familiar to the men of the most ancient times, who esteemed it the 
science of sciences, and cultivated it so universally, that all their books and tracts were
written by correspondences. The book of Job, which was a book of the ancient 
church, is full of correspondences. The hieroglyphics of the Egyptians, and the 
fabulous stories of antiquity, were founded on the same science. All the ancient 
churches were churches representative of spiritual things, and their ceremonies, and 
also their statutes, which were rules for the institution of their worship, consisted of 
mere correspondences: in like manner, every thing in the Israelitish church, their 
burnt-offerings, sacrifices, meat-offerings, and drink-offerings, with all the particulars
belonging to each, were correspondences; so also was the tabernacle, with all things 
contained in it; and likewise their festivals, as the feast of unleavened bread, the feast 
of tabernacles, the feast of the first fruits; also, the priesthood of Aaron and the 

3

Levites, and their garments of holiness; but what were the particular spiritual things 
with which each corresponded, is shewn in the ARCANA COELESTIA, published at 
London: and beside the things above mentioned, all their statutes and judgments, 
relating to worship and life, were correspondences. Now, forasmuch as Divine things 
fix their existence in outward nature in correspondences, therefore the Word was 
written by mere correspondences; and for the same reason the LORD, in consequence 
of speaking from the Divine, spake by correspondences; for whatever proceed-eth 
from the Divine, when it comes into outward nature, manifests itself in such outward 
things as correspond with what is Divine, which outward things become then the 
repositories of Divine things, otherwise called celestial and spiritual, which lie 
concealed within them.

"I have been informed, that the men of the most ancient church, which was before the 
flood, were of so heavenly a genius, that they conversed with angels, and that they 
had the power of holding such converse by means of correspondences; hence the state
of their wisdom became such, that, on viewing any of the objects of this world, they 
not only thought of them naturally, but also spiritually, thus in conjunction with the 
angels of heaven. I have been further informed, that Enoch, who is spoken of in 
Genesis, v. 21 to 24, together with his associates, collected correspondences from the 
lips of these celestial men, and transmitted the science of them to posterity; in 
consequence of which, the science of correspondences was not only known in many 
kingdoms of Asia, hut also much cultivated, particularly in the land of Canaan, Egypt, 
Assyria, Chaldaea, Syria, Arabia, in Tyre, Sidon, and Nineveh, and that from thence it 
was conveyed into Greece, where it was changed into fable, as may appear from the 
works of the oldest writers of that country.

"To shew that the science of correspondences was long preserved in the Asiatic 
nations, amongst those who were called diviners and wise men, and by some magi, I 
shall adduce a remarkable instance from 1 Sam. v. and vi. We are there informed that 
the ark, containing the two tables, whereon were written the ten commandments, was 
taken by the Philistines, and placed in the house of Dagon, in Ashdod, and that Dagon
fell to the ground before it; and afterwards, that his head and both the palms of his 
hands were separated from his body, and lay on the threshold; and that the people of 
Ashdod and Ekron, to the number of several thousands, were smitten with 
haemorrhoids, and that the land was devoured with mice; and that the Philistines, on 
this occasion, called together their priests and diviners, and that to put a stop to the 
destruction which threatened them, they came to this determination, viz. that they 
would make five golden haemorrhoids, and live golden mice, and a new cart, and 
would set the ark on this cart, with the golden haemorrhoids and mice, and have it 
drawn by two milch-kine, which lowed in the way before the cart, and thus would 
send back the ark unto the children of Israel, by whom the kine and the cart were 
offered up in sacrifice, and the GOD of Israel was appeased. That all these devices of 
the Philistine diviners were correspondences, is evident from their signification, 
which is this: the Philistines themselves signified those who are in faith separate from 
charity; Dagon represented that religious principle; the haemorrhoids wherewith they 
were smitten, signified the natural loves, which, if separated from spiritual love, are 
unclean; and mice signified the devastation of the church by falsifications of truth; a 
new cart signified natural doctrine of the church, for a chariot, in the Word, signifieth 
doctrine derived from spiritual truths; the milch-kine signified good natural affections;
the golden haemorrhoids signified the natural loves purified and made good; the 

4

golden mice signified the devastation of the church removed by means of good, for 
gold in the Word signifieth good; the lowing of the kine in the way signified the 
difficult conversion of the concupiscences of evil in the natural man into good 
affections; the offering up of the kine and the cart as a burnt-offering, signified that 
thus the GOD of Israel was rendered propitious. All these things then, which the 
Philistines did by the advice of their diviners, were correspondences; from which it 
appears, that that science was long preserved amongst the gentiles.

"Forasmuch as the representative rites of the church, which were correspondences, 
began in process of time, to be corrupted by idolatrous and likewise magical 
applications of them; therefore the science of correspondences was, by the Divine 
providence of the LORD, gradually lost, and, amongst the Israelitish and Jewish 
people, entirely obliterated. The Divine worship of that people consisted indeed of 
mere correspondences, and consequently was representative of heavenly things, but 
still they had no knowledge of a single thing represented; for they were altogether 
natural men, and therefore had neither inclination nor ability to gain any knowledge of
spiritual and celestial subjects; for the same reason they were necessarily ignorant of 
correspondences, these being representations of things spiritual and celestial in things 
natural.

"The reason why the idolatries of the gentiles of old took their rise from the science of
correspondences was, because all things that appear on the face of the earth have 
correspondence, consequently, not only trees and vegetables, but also beasts and birds
of every kind, with fishes and all other things. The ancients, who were versed in the 
science of correspondences, made themselves images, which corresponded with 
heavenly things; and were greatly delighted with them by reason of their signification,
and because they could discern in them what related to heaven and the church; they 
therefore placed those images not only in their temples, but also in their houses, not 
with any intention to worship them, but to serve as means of recollecting the heavenly
things signified by them. Hence, in Egypt and in other places, they made images of 
calves, oxen, serpents, and also of children, old men, and virgins; because calves and 
oxen signified the affection and powers of the natural man; serpents, the prudence and
likewise cunning of the sensual man; children, innocence and charity; old men, 
wisdom; and virgins, the affections of truth; and so in other instances. Succeeding 
ages, when the science of correspondences was obliterated, began to adore as holy, 
and at length to worship as deities, the images and resemblances set up by their 
forefathers, because they found them in and about their temples. For the same reason, 
the ancients performed their worship in gardens and in groves, according to the 
different kinds of trees growing in them, and also on mountains and hills; for gardens 
and groves signified wisdom and intelligence, and every particular tree something that
had relation thereto; as the olive, the good of love; the vine, truth derived from that 
good; the cedar, good and truth rational; a mountain, the highest heaven; a hill, the 
heaven beneath. That the science of correspondences remained amongst many eastern 
nations, even till the coming of the LORD, may appear also from the wise men of the 
east, who visited the LORD at his nativity; wherefore a star went before them, and they
brought with them gifts, gold, frankincense, and myrrh, Matt. ii. 1, 2, 9, 10, 11; for the
star which went before them signified knowledge from heaven; gold signified 
celestial good; frankincense, spiritual good; and myrrh, natural good; which are the 
three constituents of all worship. But still there was no knowledge whatever of the 
science of correspondences amongst the Israelitish and Jewish people, although all 

5

parts of their worship, and all the statutes and judgments given them by Moses, and 
all things contained in the Word, were mere correspondences; the reason was, because
they were idolaters at heart, and consequently of such a nature and genius, that they 
were not even willing to know that any part of their worship had a celestial and 
spiritual signification, for they believed that all the parts of it were holy of 
themselves; wherefore had the celestial and spiritual significations been revealed to 
them, they would not only have rejected, but also have profaned them: for this reason,
heaven was so shut to them, that they scarcely knew whether there was such a thing as
eternal life: that such was the case with them, appears evident from the circumstance 
that they did not acknowledge the LORD, although the whole Scripture throughout 
prophesied concerning him, and foretold his coming; and they rejected him solely on 
this account, because he instructed them about a heavenly kingdom, and not about an 
earthly one; for they wanted a Messiah who should exalt them above all the nations in
the world, and not a Messiah who should provide only for their eternal salvation.

"The reason why the science of correspondences, which is the key to the spiritual 
sense of the Word, was not discovered to later ages, was, because the Christians of the
primitive church were men of such great simplicity, that it was impossible to discover 
it to them; for had it been discovered, they would have found no use in it, nor would 
they have understood it. After those first ages of Christianity, there arose thick clouds 
of darkness, which overspread the whole Christian world, first, in consequence of 
many heretical opinions propagated in the church, and soon after, in consequence of 
the decrees and determinations of the COUNCIL of NICE, concerning the existence of 
three divine persons from eternity, and concerning the person of Christ, as the son of 
Mary, and not as the Son of JEHOVAH GOD; hence sprang the present faith of 
justification, in which three gods are approached and worshiped, according to their 
respective orders, and on which depend all and every thing belonging to the present 
church, as the members of the body depend on the head: and because men applied 
every part of the Word to confirm this erroneous faith, therefore the spiritual sense 
could not be discovered; for had it been discovered, they would have applied it also to
a confirmation of the same faith, and thereby would have profaned the very holiness 
of the Word, and thus would have shut heaven entirely against themselves, and have 
removed the LORD entirely from the church.

"The reason why the science of correspondences, which is the key to the spiritual 
sense of the Word, is revealed at this day, is, because the Divine truths of the church 
are now coming to light, and of these the spiritual sense of the Word consisteth; and 
whilst these are in man, the literal sense of the Word cannot be perverted: for the 
literal sense is capable of being turned any way, but if it be turned to favour the false, 
then its internal sanctity is destroyed, and its external along with it, whereas if it be 
turned to favour the truth, then its sanctity is preserved: more, however, will be said 
on this subject hereafter. That the spiritual sense of the Word should be opened now at
this time, is signified by John's seeing heaven open, and the white horse, and also by 
his seeing and hearing the angel, who stood in the sun, calling all people together to a 
great supper, Rev. xix. 11 to 18: but that it would not be acknowledged for some time, 
is signified by the beasts and kings of the earth, who were about to make war with 
him that sat on the white horse, Rev. xix. 19; and also by the dragon, which 
persecuted the woman, that brought forth the man-child into the wilderness, and cast 
out of his mouth water as a flood after her, that he might cause her to be carried away 
of the flood, Rev. xii. 13 to 17." T. C. R. 201—207.

6

"The spiritual sense, of the Word is not that which breaks forth as light out of the 
literal sense, whilst a person is studying and explaining the Word, with intent to 
establish some particular tenet of the church: this sense may be called the literal sense 
of the Word, but the spiritual sense does not appear in the literal sense, being within it,
as the soul is in the body, or as the thought of the understanding is in the eye, or as the
affection of love is in the countenance, which act together as cause and effect. It is 
this sense, principally, which renders the Word spiritual, and by which it is adapted 
not only to the use of men, but also of angels; whence also, by means of that sense, 
the Word communicates with the heavens.

"From the LORD proceed these principles, the celestial, the spiritual, and the natural, 
one after another. Whatsoever proceeds from his Divine love is called celestial, and is 
Divine good; whatsoever proceeds from his Divine wisdom is called the spiritual, and 
is Divine truth; the natural partakes of both, and is their complex in ultimates. The 
angels of the celestial kingdom, who compose the third, or highest heaven, are in that 
Divine principle which proceeds from the LORD, that is called celestial, for they are in 
the good of love from the LORD; the angels of the LORD'S spiritual kingdom, who 
compose the second or middle heaven, are in that Divine principle which proceeds 
from the LORD, that is called spiritual, for they are in the truths of wisdom from the 
LORD:* but men, who compose the LORD'S church on earth, are in the Divine-natural, 
which also proceeds from the LORD. Hence it follows, that the Divine proceeding 
from the LORD, in its progress to its ultimates, descends through three degrees, and is 
termed celestial, spiritual, and natural. The Divine proceeding which descends from 
the LORD to men, descends through those three degrees, and when it has descended, it 
contains those three degrees in itself. Such is the nature of all Divine proceeding; 
wherefore, when it is in its last degree, it is in its fulness. Such is the nature and 
quality of the Word; in its last sense it is natural, in its interior sense it is spiritual, and 
in its inmost sense it is celestial; and in each sense it is Divine. That the Word is of 
such a nature and quality, does not appear in the sense of the letter, which is natural, 
by reason that man has heretofore been altogether unacquainted with the state of the 
heavens, and consequently with the nature of the spiritual principle, and the celestial, 
and of course with the distinction between them and the natural principle.

* That there are two kingdoms of which the heavens consist, one of which is called 
the celestial kingdom, and the other the spiritual kingdom, may be seen in the 
Treatise concerning HEAVEN and HELL, n. 20 to 28.

"The distinction between these degrees cannot be known, except by the knowledge of 
correspondence, for these three degrees are altogether distinct from each other, like 
end, cause, and effect, or like what is prior, posterior, and postreme, but yet make one 
by correspondences; for the natural degree or principle corresponds with the spiritual, 
and also with the celestial. The nature and meaning of correspondence may be seen 
more fully explained in the treatise concerning HEAVEN AND HELL, being there 
digested under these two articles:—1st. Concerning the correspondence of all things 
in heaven with all things in man, n. 87 to 102. 2nd. Concerning the correspondence of
all things in heaven with all things on earth, n. 103 to 115; and it will be further seen 
below by examples adduced from the Word.

"Inasmuch as the Word in its interior is spiritual and celestial, therefore it is written by
mere correspondences, and what is written by mere correspondences, in its ultimate 
sense is written in such a style, as that of the prophets and evangelists, which, 

7

notwithstanding its apparent commonness, contains in it all Divine and angelic 
wisdom." S.S. 5—8.

Inasmuch as the church, both in individuals, and in the aggregate, is based upon the 
proper understanding of the Divine Word, whence she derives all her truth, her 
wisdom, her love, in short, every thing which constitutes her a church, it must be 
readily seen, that nothing can be of greater concern to man, than an enlightened 
understanding of the Word of GOD, and consequently, nothing can have greater claims 
upon the most serious attention of mankind than the science of correspondences, by 
which, as by a golden key, the treasures of revealed wisdom can be unlocked, and 
presented in wondrous display to the delighted perceptions of the inquiring mind. We 
admire the genius, and congratulate the success with which natural philosophers have 
measured the distances, calculated the orbits of the planets, explained the phenomena 
of the solar system, and unravelled the intricacies of the celestial mechanism, and the 
name of every individual who has enlarged the boundaries of science on principles 
universally applicable, and mathematically correct, is embalmed in the memory of 
every student of nature. But what are these discoveries and results, interesting and 
magnificent as they are, when compared to the discovery of the science of 
correspondences, which is adequate to the explanation of the sacred volume, which 
can unravel its "dark sayings," put to silence and shame the cavils of the infidel, and 
thus exalt the Sacred Scriptures in the estimation of the Christian to the highest 
possible degree of veneration, because it shews in what the sanctity and divinity of the
Word of God consist, and how infinitely it is distinguished from the word of man, or 
from all human composition whatsoever?

That the Word of God must have been inspired by its Divine Author, according to 
those eternal and immutable laws, by which all the operations of infinite love and 
wisdom displayed in creation, redemption, and salvation, are conducted, is an eternal 
truth, which to the mind of every wise man is placed beyond the possibility of debate. 
The Word of GOD, therefore, must be in strict analogy, or correspondence with the 
works of GOD, as the words of a wise and good man are always in correspondence 
with his deeds, that is, the words which he utters are regulated by the same motives of
action, and by the same laws of thinking as the deeds he performs; but how infinitely 
more so must this be the case between the Word and the works of GOD 

The science of correspondences, then, which as to dignity and excellence, infinitely 
transcends every other science, because infinitely more calculated to open all the 
genuine sources of wisdom to the mind of man, is that science which professes to 
explain the relation, or analogy, or more properly, the correspondence between things 
natural, and things spiritual, and thus to unfold the spiritual and Divine ideas 
conveyed in the literal sense of the Holy Word.* To understand any of the works of 
GOD in nature, a science or doctrine is deemed indispensable, thus, who could 
understand the magnificent order of the planetary system, unless he had the science of
astronomy to instruct and guide him in his study of the heavenly bodies? Without the 
aid of such a science, no systematic order could be discovered in the planetary 
spheres. Now, as the Word of GOD is strictly in analogy, or correspondence with his 
works, and as his Word has been uttered by the same immutable laws of his own 
divine order by which he spake the fiat of creation, that is, by which he has produced, 
and by which he sustains all his works, it incontestibly follows, that a science, or 
doctrine, is indispensable to the proper comprehension of his revealed Word. We are 

8

aware, that the objection will be started, that the Spirit of GOD is sufficient to 
enlighten us, if we are but sincere and devout in the study of truth, and to lead us to a 
proper and profitable understanding of the Sacred Scriptures. We admit that the Spirit 
of GOD is sufficient; but we beg to reply, that even a superficial acquaintance with the 
divine economy, and with the laws by which providence acts in enlightening and 
regenerating mankind through the influence of revealed truth, presses upon us the 
indubitable fact, that the Spirit of GOD accomplishes nothing without employing 
adequate means for the attainment of its ends. When Philip put the important question
to the eunuch, who was reading the prophet Esaias, "Understandest thou what thou 
readest?"$ his significative reply, "How can I, except some man should guide me;" 
plainly shews, that a guide, or doctrine, is necessary to lead us to a proper 
understanding of the Scriptures; the "Spirit"# was present, but it did not act upon the 
eunuch immediately, or without means, but mediately through Philip as a doctrinal 
guide, and thus led the "treasurer of Candace" to the belief, that "JESUS CHRIST is the 
Son of GOD."

* We earnestly refer the reader's attention to a work, entitled "Plenary Inspiration of 
the Scriptures asserted, and the Principles of their Composition investigated, with a 
view to the Refutation of all Objections to their Divinity, by the Rev. S. Noble;" in the
second, third, and fourth Lectures of which work, a luminous demonstration will be 
found of the existence of a spiritual sense in the Word of God, and of the science of 
analogies, or correspondences, by which it is interpreted.
$ Acts viii. 30. 
# Verse 29 

It is, therefore, firmly believed by all who have impartially and seriously considered 
the science of correspondences, discovered to the world in the writings of the 
enlightened Swedenborg, that, of the Divine mercy, the solo adequate means to the 
proper understanding of the Sacred Word, is now furnished in that heavenly science.# 
That the Christian church has, in almost every page of its practical, not ecclesiastical, 
history, anticipated some period when a fuller development, both as to doctrine and 
life of our holy religion would be divinely granted, is a fact with which the theological
student is perfectly acquainted, He finds it asserted in many of the writings of the 
most eminent divines of almost every denomination. Thus, in a theological 
dissertation, read a few years since, before the university of Cambridge, on the 
Divinity of CHRIST, to which the Hulsean Prize* was awarded, the author, after having
shown tin; legitimate use of reason in matters of revelation, says, "As the application 
of sound principles of investigation have laid open the systems of nature and 
providence, the same principles, judiciously applied, may one day lay open the 
mysteries of grace, and the method and arrangements which it has pleased GOD to 
adopt in the revelation of himself as a GOD of grace, will be found analogous to the 
method in which he has revealed himself as a GOD of nature and of providence, and 
will thus afford another powerful evidence, that the GOD of nature and of providence 
was the author of that book, which professed to make him known as a GOD of grace. 
The error of Leibnitz, and the school to which he gave rise in Germany, was, that they
philosophized with the Scriptures, instead of from them: endeavouring to prove its 
doctrines on the principle of induction, instead of endeavouring simply to prove what 
those doctrines were. It is remarkable, that this country should have produced three 
such men as a Bacon, a Newton, and a Butler; the first established the principles of all
science; Newton embodied them in the laws of nature; Butler, in the laws of 
providence. Another, adds the author, is still wanting, with the powers of a Bacon, 

9

joined to the humility of a Newton and a Butler." Here is the candid acknowledgment 
from the highest theological authority of our country, that, "another is still wanting to 
open the mysteries of grace, and to lead mankind to a clearer and fuller 
comprehension of the Divine Word" and we hesitate not a moment to assert, that the 
great desideratum has been supplied in the person of the enlightened Swedenborg,$ 
who, "with the powers of a Bacon, joined to the humility of a Newton and a Butler" 
has, under divine auspices, through the especial illumination of the Spirit of GOD, 
solved all the great problems of theology, and "opened the mysteries of grace," in a 
manner most calculated to promote the glory of GOD, and the permanent well-being of
mankind. Let his claims be impartially and duly considered,—let his system of 
scriptural interpretation be thoroughly examined, and we doubt not, that the great 
desideratum will be found to be supplied.

$ See Noble's Appeal, &c. Section V, in which Swedenborg is proved to be the man 
whom the Hulsean writer asserts to be necessary to "open the mysteries of grace, 
&c."

With regard to the spiritual or internal sense, which the science of correspondences on
uniform principles unfolds from the Word of GOD, it is well known, that in the 
primitive ages of Christianity, a spiritual sense was generally admitted to exist.# The 
writings of the early fathers are replete with spiritual and allegorical interpretations of 
the Holy Scriptures, and they who were most successful in establishing their spiritual 
interpretations, were held in the greatest reverence by the people whom they taught: 
but as they did not possess the science of correspondences, by which alone the 
spiritual sense can be successfully and regularly evolved from the sense of the letter, 
they could not avoid being led by conjecture and fancy, and thus, in many cases, they 
gave rise to delusion and error. But the science of correspondences, by virtue of the 
strict uniformity of its principles, shuts the door against conjecture and fancy, and thus
precludes the possibility of delusion and error. What is it, indeed, that the devout 
reader of the Word of GOD seeks in his pious meditations on the divine subjects 
revealed in the volume of truth? Is it not to edify himself in love, in wisdom, and in 
holiness of life? And can any thing short of a "spiritual discernment" of the things of 
GOD's Word "satisfy the longing soul," and "fill the hungry with the broad of heaven?"
What is it that the pious reader admires in the commentaries of Henry, or in the still 
profounder spiritual reflections of Bishop Home on the inspired songs, penned by the 
"sweet Psalmist of Israel," but the spiritual ideas, and the heart-felt application which 
those two pious authors were enabled to elicit from this eminent portion of the Sacred 
Word? It must be admitted, that all the excellences of these two authors are derived 
from certain glimpses, however obscure, which they enjoyed of the spiritual sense. 
But what will be the devout reader's astonishment, when he beholds in the following 
Exposition a regular series of spiritual interpretations derived from the divine Psalms 
through the science of correspondences, in which every verse, every expression, and 
every word, is made to reflect the glory of the LORD, and to bear directly upon the 
regeneration of man, and his preparation for the kingdom of heaven? The first 
principle which the spiritual sense discovers to the mind is this, that the LORD is the 
All in All of his Word; that he is the "sun" whence all the rays of revealed truth 
emanate, and that every truth is a mirror representing the LORD. How magnificent the 
idea! How supremely worthy of that Word which claims the LORD for its author! In 

10

the supreme sense, therefore, the Word treats solely of the LORD, describing his 
combats against the hells, and his subjugation of their power, when he accomplished 
the work of universal redemption, and when he glorified his Humanity. That the 
Psalms thus treat of the LORD, his own Divine testimony proves where he says, 
"These are the words which I spake unto you, while I was yet with you, that all things 
must be fulfilled which were written in the law of Moses, and in the Prophets, and in 
the Psalms concerning me,"* but that it is the spiritual sense which especially treats 
of him, and not the literal, is further proved by the following verse, "Then opened he 
their understandings, that they might understand the Scriptures," for it is plain that 
they already understood the Scriptures in their literal sense as relating to David, and 
the subsequent history of the Jewish church down to the captivity in Babylon; 
whereas, in order that they might understand the Scriptures in the spiritual sense, or as
the Apostle says, have a "spiritual discernment" of their meaning, which the Christian 
church, to whom internal things were revealed, should have cultivated and enjoyed, 
the LORD opened the understandings of his disciples. They, therefore, who imagine 
that the LORD is only treated of here and there in the Psalms, as is the case with the 
theology of the present day, do injury to the Sacred Word, and deprive it of its "spirit 
and its life."

# See Mosheim's History of the first three Centuries of the Christian Church; see also 
Clowes's Preface to the Arcana Coelestia, and to the Apocalypse Explained.
* Luke xxiv. 41.

Inasmuch as the LORD requires us to "follow him in the regeneration," "to overcome 
even as he hath overcome," to be "perfected through sufferings — temptations — 
even as he was perfected," the internal sense of the Psalms especially relates to the 
regeneration of man, and his preparation for the kingdom of heaven; and it is this 
circumstance which makes the following Exposition so eminently useful and 
excellent. For, what is it, in reality, which so seriously concerns man as a candidate 
for heaven?

Is it not the work of regeneration, by which he alone can be fitted for heaven? Is it 
possible for man to "see, still less to enter into the kingdom of heaven, unless he be 
born again?" Divine Truth itself asserts that he cannot. For what other end was the 
Divine Word given, but to promote and establish the great work of regeneration in 
man? But regeneration is a spiritual, yea, a divine work; the Word of GOD, therefore, 
must have a spiritual sense, which can be applied to the spiritual states of man. Let the
reader ponder well on the following spiritual Exposition of the Psalms, and he will 
become sensible of its amazing importance.

The following translation has been made from Van der Hooght's edition of the 
Hebrew text, published by Sebastian Schmidius, with a Latin version,* which is the 
very same edition that Swedenborg constantly used, as is abundantly evident from his 
quotations in the version of Schmidius.#

As to the following translation we wish to observe, that there are three ways by which
a translation may be accomplished. The first is a literal translation, by which every 
word is strictly rendered verbatim from the original. The second is an idiomatic 
translation, by which the original idiom is carefully conveyed into the idiom of 
another language. The third is a free translation, in which the sense of the author is 
regarded, abstractedly from the expressions he uses, and freely translated in that 
manner in which the translator supposes the author would have expressed it, had he 
written in the language into which his work is translated. The first of these ways, that 
is, the strictly literal, is the only way by which the Scriptures can be properly 
translated; in this respect, as in every other, they are essentially different from all 
merely human compositions; in these it is only necessary to have an accurate 
comprehension of the author's meaning, whereas in the former the letter is divine, and
cannot be departed from without injuring the base on which the internal sense rests, as
upon its proper foundation. A few observations will prove this to the reader: in Psalm 
cxiv. 4, we read of "the sons of the flock," rendered in the Bible version "lambs," 
which is the idiomatic translation, but which is not a base for the internal sense; see 
Exposition. In Psalm xviii. 4, 5, "cords of death" and "cords of hell," are rendered in 
the common version, "sorrows of death," "sorrows of hell;" this again is idiomatic, 
and not literal, and therefore not a proper base for the internal sense. These idiomatic 
renderings in the common version are numerous, such as "strength" for rock, Psalm 
lxxiii. 26; "defence" for shield, Psalm vii. 10, lxxxix. 18; "power" for arm, Psalm lxxi.
18; and many others, as well verbs as substantives. In a correct translation of the 
Sacred Text, not only the letter, but the points also must be taken into serious 
consideration; thus, JEHOVAH must not be substituted for JEHOVIH; see Psalm cix. 21, 
Exposition, also Note. This distinction is important, and could never have been 
preserved to the church without the points,—a sufficient argument to prove the 
indispensable necessity of studying Hebrew with the points, see A C 3455. In some 
cases, however, the Divine Text could not be rendered literally into English, thus the 
idiomatic translation was necessary; see Psalm xlix. 3, lxviii. 9; hence arose the 
necessity of notes, which we have subjoined to the text, in order that the reader, who 
is unacquainted with Hebrew, may have as correct a knowledge as possible of the 
literal sense of the Holy Word.

The reader will see from the title page, that this work was begun by the late Rev. J. 
Clowes.* Many years prior to his death, it was an object on which his pious and 
enlightened mind loved to dwell; the accomplishment of which he deemed most, 
useful and important in building up the LORD'S church in genuine charity, faith, and 
good works, but owing to the Infirmities of age, he was not able to complete it. In 
several notes which he has made in different parts of the M.S. he states, that it was his
intention, before committing it to the press, to submit it to a strict revision. This has 
been done, and the intention of that excellent and venerated clergyman has now been 
accomplished. During the long period of nearly sixty years, the life of the venerable 
Clowes was devoted to the propagation of the heavenly doctrines of the New 
Jerusalem, made known to the world through the instrumentality of the Hon. Emanuel
Swedenborg. Mr. Clowes considered these doctrines as containing the purest 
development of Christianity from the Sacred Scriptures,—as most calculated to 
promote " the glory of GOD in the highest, and peace and good will amongst men;" 
and therefore he dedicated, with unremitted industry and perseverance, his time and 
his talents to their propagation.!

promotion of genuine piety and charity amongst, mankind, and thus powerfully aid 
the building up of the true Christian church, is the ardent prayer of the

PSALM 1

1. BLESSED is the man that walks not in the counsel of the ungodly, and stands 

not in the way of sinners, and sits not in the seat of the scornful.

2. But his delight is in the law of JEHOVAH, and in his law does he meditate day 

and night.

3. And he shall be as a tree planted by streams of waters, which will yield its 
fruit in its season: his leaf also shall not wither, and whatever he does shall 
prosper.

4. Not so the ungodly; for they are as chaff, which the wind drives away.
5. Therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the judgement, nor sinners in the 

congregation of the just.

6. For JEHOVAH knows the way of the just; but the way of the ungodly shall 

perish.

The Internal Sense

That the man who does not live wickedly, is regenerated by the Word of the Lord, 
verse 1 to verse 3. But that he who lives wickedly, perishes at the day of judgement, 
verses 4, 5. Because the Lord knows every one, verse 6.

Exposition

That the Word of the Old Testament contains the mysteries of heaven, and that all and 
everything therein regards the Lord, his heaven, the church, faith, and whatever 
relates to faith, is inconceivable from the letter; for the letter or literal sense suggests 
only such things as respect the externals of the Jewish Church, when, nevertheless, 
there are internal things everywhere contained therein, which do not in the least 
appear in those externals, except in a very few cases which the Lord revealed and 
unfolded to the apostles; as that sacrifices are significative of the Lord; that the land 
of Canaan and Jerusalem are significative of heaven, on which account we read of the 
heavenly Canaan and Jerusalem; and in like manner of Paradise.

But that all and singular things, yea the most singular, not excepting the smallest jot 
and tittle, signify and involve spiritual and celestial things, is a truth to this day deeply
hid from the Christian world, the consequence whereof is, that little attention is paid 
to the Old Testament. This truth, however, might appear plain from this single 
circumstance, - that the Word being of the Lord and from the Lord, could not possibly
have any existence, unless in its inner ground it contained such things as relate to 
heaven, to the church, and to faith: for, if this be denied, how can it be called the Word
of the Lord, or be said to have any life in it? For whence is life, but from those things 
which have relation to life; that is, except from here that all and singular things have 
relation to the Lord, who is most real and essential life? Wherefore, whatever does not
interiorly regard the Lord, does not live; nay, whatever expression in the Word does 
not involve Him, or in its measure relate to Him, is not divine.

19

Without such a living principle, the Word, as to the letter, is dead; for it. is with the 
Word as it is with man, who, as all Christians are taught to believe, consists of two 
parts, an external and an internal: the external man, separated from the internal, is the 
body, which in such a state of separation is dead; but the internal is that which lives, 
and causes the external to live; the internal man is the soul. Thus the Word, as to the 
letter alone, is like a body without a soul. AC 1, 2, 3.

Inasmuch as the Word in its interior is spiritual and celestial, therefore it is written by 
mere correspondences, and what is written by mere correspondences, in its ultimate 
sense, is written in such a style as that of the prophets and evangelists, which, 
notwithstanding its apparent commonness, contains in it all divine and angelic 
wisdom. SS 8.

There are in general four different styles in which the Word is written; the first is what
was in use in the most ancient church. Their method of expressing themselves was 
such, that when they made mention of earthly and worldly things, they thought of the 
spiritual and celestial things represented thereby, so that they not only expressed 
themselves by representatives, but also reduced their thoughts into a kind of historical 
series or arrangement, in order to give them more life, and in this they found the 
sweetest delight and entertainment. This style is meant when Hannah prophesied, 
saying, "Speak you what is high, high, let what is ancient come forth from your 
mouth." 1 Samuel 2:3. Those representatives are called in David, dark sayings of old. 
Psalm 78:2, 3, 4. From the posterity of the most ancient church Moses received what 
he wrote concerning the creation, concerning the garden of Eden, etc. till the time of 
Abram. The second style is the historical, occurring in the books of Moses, from the 
time of Abram until the times of Joshua, Judges, Samuel, and the Kings, in which 
books the historical facts are exactly such as appear in the letter, but yet all the 
relations, and every part of them contain things altogether different in the internal 
sense, whereof, by the divine mercy of the Lord, we shall speak in its place and order. 
The third style is the prophetical, which took its rise from the style of the most ancient
church, which was held in high esteem. This style, however, is not connected, and in 
appearance historical like that of the most ancient church, but is broken and 
interrupted, being scarcely ever intelligible but in its internal sense, wherein are 
contained the greatest arcana, which succeed each other in a beautiful and orderly 
connection, having relation to the internal and external man, to the various states of 
the church, to heaven itself, and in their inmost sense, to the LORD. The fourth style is 
that of the Psalms of David, which is between the prophetical style and that of 
common speech, in which, under the person of David as a king, the Lord is treated of 
in the internal sense. AC 66.

In the following exposition, by the LORD is meant singly the Saviour of the world, 
Jesus Christ, who is called Lord without other names, being acknowledged and adored
as LORD throughout all heaven, because he has all power in heaven and earth. This is 
agreeable to what he said to his disciples, - "You call me Lord, and you say well, for I 
am." John 13:13. And after his resurrection his disciples called him Lord. Throughout 
all heaven they know no other Father but the Lord; because he and the Father are one, 
as he himself said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life; Philip says, show us the 
Father; Jesus says to him, have I been so long time with you, and have you not known
me, Philip? He that has seen me has seen the Father, and how say you, then, show us 

20

the Father? believe you not that I am in the Father, and the Father in me? Believe me 
that I am in the Father, and the Father in me." John 14:6, 8, 9, 10, 11. AC 14, 15.

Verse 1. Blessed, etc. To bless, in the Word, signifies in an external sense, to enrich 
with every earthly and corporeal good, according to the explanation of the Word with 
all those who abide in the external sense, as with the ancient and modern Jews, and 
also with Christians, especially at this day, wherefore they made the divine blessing to
consist in riches, an abundance of possessions, and in self-glory: but to bless, in an 
internal sense, signifies to enrich with all spiritual and celestial good, which blessing 
being never given, or possible to be given but by the Lord, signifies on that account, 
the presence and grace of the Lord; for the presence and grace of the Lord bring with 
them such spiritual and celestial good. AC 981.

Verse 1. Mention is here made of walking, of standing, and of sitting, because the one 
follows the other. For to walk has relation to the life of thought grounded in intention; 
to stand has relation to the life of intention grounded in will; and to sit has relation to 
the life of the will, thus to the esse of life. The counsel, also, of which walking is 
predicated, has respect to the thought; the way, in which a man is said to stand, has 
respect to intention; and to sit in a seat has respect to the will, which is the esse of the 
life of man. For, in the spiritual world, all things which relate to the motion and rest of
man, signify those things which relate to the life of man, because they thence proceed.
Walkings and journeyings have relation to man's motion; and hence they signify 
progression of life, or progression of thought grounded in intention of the will. But 
standings and sittings have relation to man's rest; and hence they signify the esse of 
life from which it exists, thus its being made to live. AE 687.

Verse 2. Jehovah. The Lord is called in the Word sometimes by the bare name 
Jehovah, sometimes Jehovah God, sometimes Jehovah, and afterwards God, 
sometimes the Lord Jehovih, sometimes the God of Israel, and sometimes barely 
God. He is called Jehovah, because He alone is, or lives, consequently from essence; 
He is called God as being all powerful, consequently from power, as appears in the 
Word, where the names are distinguished. See Psalm 18:2, 28, 29, 31, Psalm 31:14. 
AC 300.

Verse 2. The law. In the Word there is frequent mention made of the law, and it may be
expedient to show what is meant by it in its confined sense, what in a more extensive 
sense, and what in a sense most extensive. In a confined sense, the decalogue is meant 
by the law; in a more extensive sense, it is used to mean the statutes given by Moses to
the children of Israel; and in a sense most extensive, it means the whole Word. That by
the law, in a confined sense, the decalogue is meant, is well known; but that in a more
extensive sense, the statutes given by Moses to the children of Israel, are meant by the 
law, is evident from the particular statutes in Leviticus being so called; as, for 
instance, "This is the law of the sacrifice of peace-offerings." Levit 7:11. "This is the 
law of the trespass-offering.". Levit 7:1. "This is the law of the meat-offering." Levit 
6:7, etc. "This is the law of the burnt-offering, of the meat-offering, of the sin-
offering, and of the trespass-offering, and of the consecrations." Levit 7:37. "This is 
the law of the beasts and of the birds." Levit 11:46. Yea, the whole book of Moses is 
called the law. Deut 31:9, 11, 12, 26; as also in the New Testament, Luke 2:22; 24:44; 
John 1:45; 7:23, 8:5; and in other places. That these statutes were meant by the works 
of the law, mentioned by Paul, where he says, "that man is justified without the works 

21

of the law," Rom 3:28, is very evident from what follows those words, and also from 
his words to Peter, whom He blames for judaizing, where he says three times in one 
verse, "that no man is justified by the works of the law." Gal 2:16. That by the law, in 
its most extensive sense, is meant the whole Word, is plain from these passages: "Jesus
said, Is it not written in your law, you are gods?" This is written in Psalm 132:6; "The 
people answered Him, we have heard out of the law, that Christ abides for ever." John 
12:34; this is written, Psalm 89:29. e10:4, Dan 7:14. "That the word might be 
fulfilled, which is written in their law, they hated me without a cause," John 15:25, 
this is written, Psalm 35:19. In these passages the whole sacred scripture is meant by 
the law, as may be seen in many places in the Psalms of David. AR 288.

Verse 2. Does he meditate day and night. He who is in any love, whatever it be, is 
continually thinking of those things which are connected with that love, and this, 
notwithstanding his being engaged in thought, in speech, and in action about other 
things. This is manifested clearly in the other life from the spiritual spheres with 
which every one is encompassed, it being there known from those spheres alone, in 
what faith every one is principled, and in what love, and this although they are 
thinking of, and discoursing on, something entirely foreign to the subject; see 1048, 
1053; for the principle which universally reigns with any one produces that sphere, 
and manifests the life thereof before others; hence it may be evident what is meant by 
the obligation to be continually thinking about the Lord (to be meditating in his law 
day and night) about salvation, and about the life after death. All who are principled 
in faith, grounded in charity, do this; hence it is that they do not think ill of the 
neighbour, and that they have justice and equity in every thing they think, speak, and 
do, for the principle which reigns universally flows in into singular things, and guides 
and governs them, for the Lord in this case keeps the mind in such things as are of 
charity and consequent faith, and thereby gives to singular the things thereof a 
suitable arrangement; the sphere of faith, grounded in charity, is the sphere which 
reigns in heaven, for the Lord flows in with love, and by love with charity, 
consequently with the truths which are of faith; hence it is that they who are in heaven
are said to be in the Lord. AC 5130.

Verse 2. Day and night-day and night signify continually and in every state, for time 
signifies state, day a state of light and illustration, and night a state of obscurity. AE 
478, 747.

Verse 2. The law of Jehovah denotes the books of Moses, for as yet the prophetic 
books were not written; nor the historical books either, except those of Joshua and of 
Judges. AC 6752.

Verse 3. And he shall be as a tree, etc. Man, in the Word throughout, is likened to a 
tree; and when this comparison is made, the truths of his faith are signified by the 
leaves, and the good things of love by the fruits. AC 9337.

Verse 3. His leaf also shall not wither. Wheresoever in the Word, man is compared to 
a tree, or is called a tree, the fruit signifies the good of charity, and the leaf the truth 
thence derived. As in Ezekiel: "By the river upon the bank thereof, on this side and on
that side, shall grow all trees for food, whose leaf shall not fade, neither shall the fruit 
thereof be consumed; it shall bring forth new fruits according to its months, because 
their waters issued out of the sanctuary: and the fruit thereof shall be for food, and the 

22

leaf thereof for medicine," (Ez 47:12; Rev 22:2), where the trees denote the members 
of the church in whom is the kingdom of the LORD: fruit denotes the good of love and 
charity: the leaf the truths thence derived, which are serviceable for the instruction of 
man and for his regeneration: wherefore the leaf is said to be for medicine. AC 885.

Verse 4. For they are as chaff, etc. Faith without truths is as seed deprived of the 
medullary substance, which, when threshed, yields nothing but chaff: but faith derived
from truths is as fruitful seed, which, when threshed, yields fine flour. AR 347. John 
the Baptist says concerning the LORD: "Whose fan is in his hand, and he will 
thoroughly purge his floor, and gather his wheat into the garner; but he will burn up 
the chaff with unquenchable fire:" (Matt 3:2): where wheat denotes the good things of
love and charity; chaff the things in which there is nothing of good. AC 3941.

The Translator's Notes and Observations

Verse 3. And he shall be as a tree, etc. It is a striking instance of resemblance between
a man and a tree, that two distinct elements are necessary for the life and growth of 
each. Thus a tree requires both earth and air for its life and growth; for it cannot live 
unless one half of it, namely its roots, be implanted in the earth, whilst the other half, 
namely its branches, ascend and live in the higher element of the atmosphere. The 
case is the same with man, who is composed of two parts, a natural or external part, 
and a spiritual or internal part; each of which requires its own element for its 
nourishment. The natural or external part may therefore be regarded as the root; 
whilst the spiritual or internal part constitutes the superior half of every human tree. 
Thus man is not allowed to live a mere natural life alone, or a mere spiritual life 
alone, but both united; and they become united, when affection and thought, which 
are of his internal man, arc in harmony and agreement with his words and works, 
which are of the external man. In agreement with this resemblance between a man 
and a tree, it is written in the prophet Isaiah: The remnant that is escaped of the house 
of Judah shall again take root downwards, and bear fruit upwards (Is 37:31): for to 
take root downwards has respect to the implantation of good and of truth in the 
external or natural man by words and works, whilst to bear fruit upwards has respect 
to the implantation of good and of truth in the internal or spiritual man by affections 
and thoughts.

Verse 2. His delight is in the law of JEHOVAH, and in his law does he meditate day and
night. To delight in the law of JEHOVAH has respect to the operation of Divine Truth 
on the human will, and to meditate in his law day and night has respect to its operation
on the human understanding. Both operations are mentioned, because neither of them 
singly is sufficient. For Divine Truth cannot be received in the will, unless it be first 
received in the understanding; and if it be received in the understanding, and suffered
to remain there without affecting the will, it leaves man as unpurified and 
unregenerate as if it had not been received at all.

Verse 5. Therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the judgement, nor sinners in the 
congregation of the just. A distinction is here made between the ungodly and sinners; 
also between standing in the judgement and standing in the congregation of the just; 
which distinction cannot possibly be apprehended, until it be seen, that by the 
ungodly are meant those who are opposed in their understandings to the light of the 
DIVINE TRUTH, and by sinners are meant those who are opposed in their wills to the 

23

purity of the DIVINE GOOD. It is said, therefore, of the former, or the ungodly, that they
cannot stand in the judgement, because the judgement has relation to truth; and it is 
said of the latter, or sinners, that they cannot stand in the congregation of the just, 
because the just are those who are principled in the good of truth, which every sinner 
rejects. The contents of this verse, and also of verse the second, are a full and 
convincing proof how the HOLY WORD is written throughout, with a view to the 
Divine and Heavenly Marriage of the GOOD and the TRUE, and thus bears its own 
testimony to its Divine authority and plenary inspiration. For to delight in the law of 
JEHOVAH, as recorded at verse 2 above, has manifest respect to the GOOD; whilst to 
meditate on his law day and night, has respect equally manifest to the TRUTH; and 
both united, to the marriage of those principles. The case is the same with the ungodly
and the sinners recorded in this verse; and also with standing in the judgement and 
standing in the congregation of the just; since the ungodly are those who oppose the 
DIVINE TRUTH, and sinners are those who oppose the DIVINE GOOD; and the inability 
of the former to stand in the judgement, and of the latter to stand in the congregation 
of the just, is grounded in their opposition to that DIVINE TRUTH and DIVINE GOOD, the
marriage of which is thus conspicuously marked in all the pages of Divine 
Revelation; because to effect that marriage in the human mind is the grand end and 
design of every law, commandment, and instruction of the ALMIGHTY.

Verse 6. For JEHOVAH knows the way of the just. JEHOVAH is here said to know the 
way of the just, because it is in agreement with himself, and thus affects him with 
delight; whereas he is said not to know what is in disagreement with himself, and thus
what affects him with no delight. In the parable therefore of the ten virgins, the five 
foolish ones are rejected with these awful words: Verily I say to you, I know you not 
(Matt 25:12.) Not that the LORD had no knowledge of their folly, but that he had no 
delight in it, and therefore was said not to know it.

24

PSALM 2

1. Why are the nations tumultuously assembled, and why do the peoples meditate

a vain thing?

2. The kings of the earth have set themselves together, and the rulers have 

consulted together, against JEHOVAH, and against his ANOINTED.
3. We will burst to pieces their bonds, and cast away from us their cords.
4. He that sits in the heavens shall laugh; the LORD [ADONAI] shall have them in 

derision.

5. Then shall he speak to them in his anger, and in his wrath shall he terrify them.
6. Yet have I anointed my king upon Zion, the mountain of my holiness.
7.

I will proclaim the decree: JEHOVAH has said to me. You are my son; today 
have I begotten you.

8. Ask of me, and I will give the nations for your inheritance, and the ends of the 

earth for your possession.

9. You shall bruise them with a rod of iron, as a potter's vessel shall you break 

them in pieces.

10. Be intelligent now, O you kings; be instructed, O you judges of the earth.
11. Serve JEHOVAH with fear, and exult with trembling.
12. Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and you perish in the way; for his anger will 

shortly kindle. Blessed are all they that put their trust in him.

The Internal Sense

That they who ought to be in the truths and goods of the church are against the LORD, 
verses 1, 2; but we are to separate ourselves from them, because they are nothing 
before the LORD, verses 3, 4; and will be destroyed, verse 5. That the LORD will take 
upon him the HUMAN [Nature,] and restore the church, verses 6 to 8; and that he will 
disperse the falsities of evil, verse 9; we are therefore to acknowledge and worship the
DIVINE HUMAN [Essence] of the LORD, lest we perish, verses 10 to 12.

Exposition

Verse 1, 2, 6, 7, 12. That by the ANOINTED OF JEHOVAH is meant the LORD as to the 
DIVINE HUMAN [Essence,] is evident, for it is said, JEHOVAH said to me. You are my 
SON, today have I begotten you. - Kiss the SON, lest you perish. - Blessed are all that 
put their trust in him. These things, indeed, in the literal sense, are said in relation to 
David; but by David, in the Word, is meant the LORD as to Divine Truth, or as a King. 
It is likewise evident, that the subject here treated of is the coming of the LORD; then, 
the last judgement executed by him, and, afterwards, his kingdom over all things of 
the world. The spiritual things which lie concealed in every expression, and which are
signified by them, are these: The nations are tumultuously assembled, and the peoples
have meditated a vain thing, signifies the state of the church and of the former 
heaven, as being to pass away: the nations are they who are in evils, and the people 
they who are in falsities. The kings of the earth have set themselves together, and the 
rulers have consulted together, against JEHOVAH, and against his Anointed, signifies 
the falsities of the church and its evils, as being altogether opposed to Divine Good 

25

and Divine Truth, and thus to the Lord. The kings of the earth are the falsities of the 
church, and the rulers are its evils; and JEHOVAH is the LORD as to the Divinity Itself, 
thus as to Divine Good, and his Anointed is the LORD as to the Divine Humanity, thus 
as to Divine Truth. I have anointed my king upon Zion, the mountain of my holiness, 
signifies the Humanity of the LORD as to Divine Truth proceeding from the Divine 
Good of his Divine Love, and hence his kingdom over all things of heaven and of the 
church: Zion and the mountain of holiness, are heaven and the church, consequently, 
all things of heaven and of the church. I will proclaim the decree, signifies an arcanum
of providence and of the Divine will. JEHOVAH said to me you are my Son, today have
I begotten you, signifies the LORD as the Anointed, the Messiah, the Christ, and King, 
thus as to his Humanity, conceived and afterwards born from the Divinity Itself, or 
JEHOVAH: today signifies what was ordained from eternity, and has respect thence to 
the conjunction and union effected in time. Ask of me, and I will give the nations for 
your inheritance, and the ends of the earth for your possession, signifies his kingdom 
and dominion over all things belonging to heaven and to the church, which will be 
his. Kiss the Son signifies conjunction with the LORD by love; to kiss signifies 
conjunction grounded in love. Lest you be angry, and you perish in the way, signifies 
lest evils invade you, and you be condemned: for to be angry, when predicated of the 
LORD, signifies the turning away of men from him, thus their anger, and not the 
LORD'S; and evils are what turn themselves away, and thence are angry. For his anger 
will shortly kindle, signifies the last judgement, and the casting down of the evil into 
hell. Blessed are all they that put their trust in him, signifies salvation by love and 
faith in the LORD. AE 684.

Verses 2, 6. The kings of the earth are falsities, and the rulers are evils, which come 
from the hells, against which the LORD fought when he was in the world, and which 
he conquered and subdued. The Anointed of JEHOVAH is the LORD as to the DIVINE 
HUMANITY, for he fought from there, Zion the mountain of holiness, upon which he is 
said to be anointed as king, is the celestial kingdom, which is in the good of love; this 
kingdom is the inmost of heaven and the inmost of the church. AC 9954.

Verse 7. Today have I begotten you. In the Divine idea there is no time, but a presence 
of all things which have been and shall be; wherefore it is said in David, A thousand 
years in your sight are but as yesterday (Psalm 90:4.) And again: I will proclaim the 
decree JEHOVAH has said to me. You are my Son; today have I begotten you (Psalm 
2:7) Today is the presence of the LORD'S coming. Hence also it is that an entire period 
is called, in the Word, a day; its first state, twilight and morning, and its last, evening 
and night. AR 4. Today is not from eternity, but is in time. Doctrine of the LORD, DL 
19 

Verse 9. You shall bruise them with a rod of iron. A rod of iron denotes the power of 
spiritual truth in the natural, for all natural truth, in which there is spiritual truth, has 
power. Iron is natural truth. AC 4876.

Verses 10, 11, 12. Be intelligent now, O you kings, be instructed, you Judges of the 
earth; serve JEHOVAH with fear, and exult with trembling. Kiss the SON, lest he be 
angry, and you perish in the way. Kings denote those who are in truths; who, also, 
from truths, are everywhere called the sons of a king: the Son here denotes the LORD, 
who is called a Son, because he is the Truth Itself, and all truth is from him. AC 2015.

26

Verse 12. Kiss the Son. - Speaking of the LORD, whose Divine Humanity is the Son. 
To kiss him is to be conjoined to him by the faith of love. AC 3594.

The Translator's Notes and Observations

In almost every verse of the above Psalm a reference is made to the heavenly 
marriage of the GOOD and the TRUE, which pervades the HOLY WORD throughout, and 
distinguishes it from all human writing whatever. Thus in the first verse, mention is 
made of the nations being tumultuously assembled, and of the peoples meditating a 
vain thing: where nations denote those who are opposed to what is GOOD, and peoples
those who are opposed to what is TRUE; whilst the former are said to be tumultuously 
assembled, and the latter to meditate a vain thing. So likewise in the second verse, the
kings of the earth are said to set themselves together, and the rulers are said to consult
together, against JEHOVAH and against His ANOINTED: where a similar two-fold 
opposition is marked against the DIVINE GOOD, which is here called JEHOVAH, and 
against the DIVINE TRUTH, which is here called His ANOINTED. We next read, at verse 
3, of bursting to pieces their bonds, and casting away from us their cords: and also, at 
verse 4, of Him that sits in the heavens laughing, and of ADONAI having them in 
derision: and, at verse 5, of his speaking to them in his anger, and terrifying them in 
his wrath: where it is evident that bonds and cords, laughing and having in derision, 
anger and wrath, are expressions which have a distinct reference to the two opposing 
principles of evil and error, which are ever at work to separate and destroy the union, 
or marriage, of the Divine principles of the GOOD and the TRUE. The same observation
will apply to verse 10, where it is written, Be intelligent now, O you kings; be 
instructed you judges of the earth.

Verse 12. Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, etc. - Nothing can be more evident than that 
by the SON is here meant the MANHOOD, or HUMANITY, which God assumed in the 
womb of the Virgin Mary, and which he afterwards made DIVINE, by exalting it to an 
eternal union with himself. Nothing also can be more evident, than that by kissing this
Son is meant the affectionate application of all our powers of will and understanding, 
thus of all our powers of love and of faith, to this GLORIFIED HUMANITY, as to the 
consecrated residence of the SUPREME DEITY, in which, through which, and by which, 
he now communicates himself and all the blessings of his salvation to all his penitent 
and believing children. The anger here spoken of is the terrible effect resulting to man
from the non-acknowledgement, and consequently from the non-adoration and 
worship of GOD in this GLORIFIED HUMANITY; since, in this case, man can have no 
communication with the SUPREME FOUNTAIN of all that is good, and wise, and happy, 
and, of course, must perish in his own evils; which evils will always represent GOD to 
him as an angry Being, when yet there is no anger in him, but the purest love, and the 
anger, though ascribed to GOD in the Sacred Scriptures, is nothing else but the 
mistaken conception and idea of him, as necessarily existing in the mind of every 
impenitent and unregenerate man.

PSALM 3

A Psalm of David, when he fled from the face of Absalom his son.

1.

JEHOVAH, how are mine enemies multiplied! Many are they that rise up against
me;

2. Many that say of my soul. There is no help for him in GOD. Selah.
3. But you, O JEHOVAH, are a shield for me, my glory, and the lifter up of my 

head.

4. With my voice will I call on JEHOVAH; and he will hear me from the mountain 

5.
6.

of his holiness. Selah.
I will lie down and sleep; I will awake; because JEHOVAH sustains me.
I will not be afraid of ten thousands of the people, who set themselves round 
about against me.

7. Arise, O JEHOVAH; save me, O my GOD; for you have smitten all mine 
adversaries on the jaw bone; you have broken the teeth of the ungodly.
8. Salvation belongs to JEHOVAH; your blessing is upon your people. Selah.

The Internal Sense

Concerning the LORD, when he was in temptations and subdued the hells, and was 
then in a state of humiliation in which he prayed to the Father.

Exposition

A Psalm of David, etc. Many kinds of musical instruments were used, in sacred 
worship, with the Jewish and Israelitish nation, of which some were applied to the 
affections of celestial good, and some to the affections of spiritual good, and to the 
joys thence derived, which were thus published abroad. The stringed instruments were
applied to the affections of spiritual good, and the wind instruments to the affections 
of celestial good, to which also was added singing with songs, by which were formed 
agreements of things with sounds of the affections: of this nature were all the Psalms 
of David, wherefore they are called Psalms, (psalmi), from playing, (psallere), and 
also songs. Hence, many of the Psalms of David are in the titles called songs. See 
Psalm 18:1, Ps 33:1, 2, and many others. AE 326.

Verse 1. How are mine enemies multiplied, etc. In this, and in several other passages, 
by enemies and insurgents, or those who rise up against us, are signified the evils and
falsities which are from hell; they are called insurgents, because evils and falsities rise
up against goods and truths, but not vice versa. AC 10481.

Verse 3. Are a shield for me. That a shield signifies defence, to be confided in against 
evils and falsities, appears without explication; for it is a customary form of speech 
rendered familiar by use, to call Jehovah a shield and buckler. But what is specifically
signified by a shield, may appear from the Word, namely that in respect to the Lord it 
signifies defence, and in respect to man, confidence in the Lord's protection. As war 
signifies temptations, (see 1664), so all the arms used in war signify some particular 

28

belonging to temptation, and to defence against evils and crew falsities, or against the 
diabolical who induce temptation, and act the part of the tempter; wherefore each kind
of weapon or armour has a distinct signification peculiar to itself, whether it: be a 
shield, a buckler, a helmet, a spear, a lance, a sword, a bow and arrows, or a breast-
plate, concerning each of which, by the Divine mercy of the Lord, more will be said 
hereafter. The reason why a shield, in respect to the Lord, signifies defence against 
evils and falsities, and in respect to man, confidence in the Lord, is because it was a 
piece of armour for the security of the breast, and by the breast is signified goodness 
and truth; goodness by reason of the heart being therein, and truth, by reason of the 
lungs. That a shield has this signification appears in David: "Blessed be Jehovah, my 
rock, who teaches my hands to war, my fingers to fight, my goodness and my fortress,
my high tower, and my deliverer, my shield, and he in whom I trust." Psalm 144:1, 2. 
AC 1788.

Verse 5. I will lie down and sleep, denotes a state of tranquillity and security. For with 
those who are about to be regenerated, the case is this: First of all they are in a state of
tranquillity, or in a state of external peace; for external peace, or peace in externals, is 
called tranquillity: it is produced also from a divine state of peace, which is inmost; 
and it exists in externals in consequence of lusts and falsities being removed; for these
are what cause all unquietness. Every man, also, is in a state of tranquillity in the 
beginning of his life, or in infancy; but in proportion as he advances in life, or grows 
up, he removes himself from that state, because he plunges into worldly cares, and 
thereby into anxieties, through lusts of selfish and worldly love, and the falsities 
thence derived. The case is nearly similar with the new life belonging to the man who 
is regenerating. In the beginning he is in a state of tranquillity; but as he passes into 
new life, so also he passes into an untranquil state: for the evils and falsities which he 
had before imbibed, emerge and show themselves, and disturb him, and at length to 
such a degree, that he is immersed in temptations and vexations from the diabolical 
crew, who are in the continual endeavour to destroy the state of this new life. But still 
he has inmostly a state of peace; for unless this were the case, he would not engage in 
combat: for he looks continually at this peace, in the combats in which he is engaged, 
as the end, and unless he had that end in view, he would have no strength and power 
to fight. Hence also it is that he gains the victory, and, after combats, or temptations, 
comes into that end. AC 3696.

Verse 7. You have smitten all mine adversaries on the jaw-bone; you have broken the 
teeth of the ungodly. To smite the adversaries on the jaw-bone, signifies to destroy 
interior false principles belonging to those who are against the goods and truths of the 
church. These, and their falsities of evil, are understood in the Word by adversaries. 
And to break the teeth of the ungodly, signifies to destroy exterior false principles, 
which are those that are founded on the fallacies of the senses, and are confirmed by 
them. Hence may be manifest what is meant by smiting on the right cheek, in 
Matthew, where it is written, "You has heard that it has been said, An eye for an eye, 
and a tooth for a tooth. But I say to you. Resist not evil, but whoever shall smite you 
on your right cheek, turn to him the other also. And if any one will sue you at the law, 
and take away your coat, let him have your cloak also. And whoever shall compel you
to go a mile, go with him two. Give to every one that asks you, and from him that 
would borrow of you, turn not you away." (Matt 5:38-42.) That these words are not to 
be understood according to the letter, is evident to every one: for who is bound by 
Christian love to turn the left cheek to him who smites the right, and to give the cloak 

29

to him who desires to take away the coat? In short, who is there to whom it is not 
allowable to resist evil? But as all things that the Lord spoke were in themselves 
divine celestial things, it may be manifest that a celestial sense is contained in these 
words, as in the rest which the LORD spoke. The reason why it was enacted as a law 
amongst the sons of Israel, that they should give an eye for an eye, and a tooth for a 
tooth, (Exod 21:23, 24; Levit 22:20; Deut 19:21), was, because they were external 
men, and hence only in the representatives of heavenly things, and not in the heavenly
things themselves; hence neither in charity, patience, nor in any other spiritual good: 
therefore they were in the law of retaliation. For the heavenly law, and hence the 
Christian law, is what the LORD taught when he said in the Evangelists, "All things 
whatever you would that men should do to you, even so do you to them: for this is the
law and the prophets." (Matt 7:12, Luke 6:30.) As this is the law in heaven, and from 
heaven in the church, hence also all evil carries with it corresponding punishment 
which is called the punishment of evil, and is, as it were, inherently conjoined with 
evil itself. From this flowed the punishment of retaliation; which was dictated to the 
sons of Israel because they were external men, and not internal.

Internal men, such as are the angels of heaven, do not will the recompense of evil for 
evil, but from heavenly charity forgive. For they know that the LORD protects all who 
are in good against the evil, and that he protects them according to the good belonging
to them, and that he would not protect them, if, by reason of the evil done to 
themselves, they should be inflamed with enmity, hatred, and revenge; for these evils 
avert his protection. These therefore are the things involved in what the LORD said: 
but what they signify, it may be expedient to declare in order. An eye for an eye, and a
tooth for a tooth, signifies that so far as any one takes from another the understanding 
of truth, and the sense of truth, so far these will be taken away from him. By an eye is 
signified the understanding of truth, and by a tooth, the sense of truth; for a tooth 
signifies what is true and false as it appertains to the sensual man. That he who is in 
Christian good, will permit an evil person to take those things away so far as he can, 
is described by what the LORD replies on the same subject. That evil is not to be 
resisted, signifies that it is not to be fought with in return, nor to be repaid: for the 
angels do not fight with the evil, still less do they repay evil for evil; but they permit 
the evil to do it, because they are protected by the LORD, and hence no evil from hell 
can hurt them. "Whosoever smites you on your right jaw-bone, turn to him the other 
also," signifies that if any one be willing to do hurt to the perception and 
understanding of interior truth, it is permitted, so far as he makes the attempt. By the 
jaw-bone is signified the perception and understanding of interior truth, by the right 
jaw-bone, the affection, and thence the perception thereof, and by the left jaw-bone, 
the understanding thereof; and because mention is made of the jaw-bone, therefore 
also mention is made of smiting it, by which is meant to do hurt to it. For all things 
which belong to the mouth, as the throat, the mouth, the lips, the jaw-bones, and the 
teeth, signify such things as belong to the perception and understanding of truth, 
because they correspond to them; wherefore they are expressed by those things in the 
literal sense of the Word, which consists of mere correspondences. AE 556; see also 
AC 8223, 9048.

By teeth are signified the exterior intellectual principle, and hence natural truth; for 
this constitutes the life of that intellectual principle. The reason of this signification is 
because the teeth grind, as it were, and thus prepare the food, which is for the 
nourishment of the body, as that principle does the food, which is for the nourishment 

30

of the soul. The food which nourishes the soul is intelligence and wisdom. This is at 
first received, ground, and prepared, by the knowledges of truth and goodness in the 
natural principle, In the opposite sense, teeth signify the false principle destroying 
truth, as in David: "Arise, O JEHOVAH, save me O my GOD for you have smitten all 
mine enemies on the jaw-bone; you have broken the teeth of the ungodly." AC 9052.

The Translator's Notes and Observations

Verse 7. Arise, O JEHOVAH, save me, O my GOD. In these words the DIVINE BEING, or 
the LORD, is called and characterised by two distinct names, JEHOVAH and GOD, 
because the first name, or JEHOVAH, has more reference to the DIVINE GOOD of his 
DIVINE LOVE, whilst the second, or GOD, has more reference to the DIVINE TRUTH of 
his DIVINE WISDOM. This distinct reference of the two names, JEHOVAH and GOD, 
might be fully proved, if necessary, from their distinct application in other passages of
the Sacred Scriptures, and especially from this circumstance; that the name JEHOVAH 
is uniformly used on all occasions where the exercise of the GOOD of the DIVINE 
MERCY and LOVE is described; whilst the name GOD is used on all occasions where the
exercise of the DIVINE TRUTH is described; as in all cases of judgement, consisting in 
the separation of the evil from the good, that so the former may be removed to their 
own place, and the latter may be exalted to theirs. Accordingly, in the present 
instance, JEHOVAH, or the DIVINE GOOD of the DIVINE MERCY and LOVE, is first 
invoked, as being the first and principal object of man's interest and regard; whilst the 
invocation is expressed in the single emphatic term, ARISE, because the elevation of 
that good above all other goods in human minds, is the chief and pre-eminent end of 
their regeneration; and at the same time, is their exclusive qualification to be admitted
into the kingdom of bliss. GOD, or the DIVINE TRUTH of the DIVINE WISDOM, is next 
invoked, and the invocation is expressed in the affecting words, SAVE ME; because to 
be saved is to be delivered from the tyranny of all evil and false principles, thus from 
all the power of the enemy; which salvation can never be effected, until heavenly 
truth in the understanding be united with heavenly good in the will, and thus 
communicates to man that spiritual strength of which it is written, "The GOD of Israel 
is he that gives strength and power to his people; blessed be God." Psalm 68:35. For 
heavenly good separate from heavenly truth is powerless; as heavenly truth, separate 
from heavenly good, is lifeless; and consequently no saving effect can possibly be 
worked, except by both united.

PSALM 4

To Him that presides on Neginoth, a Psalm of David.

1.

In my cry, answer me, O GOD of my justice: in my straitness set me at large: 
have mercy upon me, and hear my prayer.

2. O you sons of man, how long shall my glory be to you shame? How long will 

you love vanity, will you seek a lie? Selah?

3. Know you that JEHOVAH has set apart him that is godly for himself: JEHOVAH 

will hear when I cry to him.

4. Tremble you, and sin not: commune with your own heart on your bed, and be 

still. Selah.

5. Sacrifice the sacrifices of justice, and put your trust in JEHOVAH.
6. Many are they who say. Who will show us good? Lift you up the light of your 

faces upon us, O JEHOVAH.

7. You have put joy in my heart, more than at the time when their corn and new 

8.

wine are multiplied.
In peace I lie down and sleep together: for you, O JEHOVAH, alone make me 
dwell secure.

The Internal Sense

Concerning the LORD when in great temptations, verses 1,2. That we are to fear him 
because he has protection from the Father, verse 3, An exhortation to repentance, 
verse 4-8.

Exposition

Title. On Neginoth. Inasmuch as instruments of every kind, by correspondence, 
signified the delights and pleasantnesses of spiritual and celestial affections; hence 
also they are mentioned in the titles of several of the Psalms of David, and it is 
indicated how they were to be played as upon Neginoth, upon Nechiloth, upon the 
Octave, Schigjon, Githith Muthlabean, Sheminith, Schuschannin, Machaleth. AC 
8337.

Verse 1. In my cry, answer me, etc. The expression, to answer, frequently occurs in the
Word, and when predicated of the LORD, it signifies influx, inspiration, perception, 
and information, likewise mercy and aid, as in the following passages: "In an 
acceptable time I answered you, and in the day of salvation I helped you;" (Isaiah 
49:8) "Answer me when I cry, O GOD of my Justice" Psalm 4:2, AE 471.

Verse 2. How long shall my glory, etc. The glory of JEHOVAH is the internal of the 
Word, of the church, and of worship, because it is predicated of light in heaven, which
is divine truth. AC 10574.

Verse 2. Love vanity-seek a lie. Vanity denotes falsity of doctrine or of religion, and a 
lie, falsity of life. AC 9248.

32

Verse 4. Commune with your own heart. In the Word throughout mention is made of 
heart and soul, and by heart is there signified the life of love, and by soul, the life of 
faith. Man has two faculties receiving life from the LORD, one is called will, the other 
understanding; to the faculty which is called will appertains love, for the goods of 
love constitute its life: these two lives belonging to man are, however, one, and when 
they are one, then the things which are of faith are also of love, for they are loved; and
on the other hand, the things which are of love are also of faith, because they are 
believed; such is the life of all in heaven.

From these considerations it may be manifest, what is properly meant in the Word by 
the heart, and what by the soul, as in the following passages:-" You shall love 
JEHOVAH your GOD with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your 
strength;" (Deut 6:5) "You shall keep the statutes and the judgements, and shall do 
them, with all your heart, and with all your soul," (Deut 26:16) and in the Evangelists,
"JESUS said, you shall love the LORD your GOD with all your heart, and with all your 
soul, and with all your strength, and with all your thought;" (Matt 22:35, Mark 12:30, 
32, Luke 10:27) heart denotes the life of love, and soul denotes the life of faith; 
strength denotes those things which proceed from the life of love, thus, which are 
from the heart or will; and thought denotes those things which proceed from the life 
of faith, thus, which are from the soul, or from an enlightened understanding. AC 
9050.

Verses 6, 7, 8. Who will show us good? Lift you up the light of your faces upon us, O 
JEHOVAH. You have put joy in my heart, more than at the time when their corn and 
new wine are multiplied. In peace I lie down and sleep together: for you, O JEHOVAH, 
alone make me dwell secure. In these words is described the peace which appertains 
to those who are in conjunction with the LORD, by the reception of Divine Good and 
Truth from him; and that peace is the principle in, and from which is heavenly joy. 
Divine Good is meant by Who will show us good; and Divine Truth by Lift you up the
light of your faces upon us. The light of the LORD'S faces is the divine light proceeding
from him as the sun in the angelic heaven, which in its essence is Divine Truth; as 
may be seen in the work concerning HEAVEN and HELL, HH 128-140. The heavenly 
joy thence derived is meant by putting joy in the heart. The multiplication of Good 
and Truth is meant by their corn and new wine being multiplied: corn signifies good, 
and new wine truth. Since peace is in and from those principles, therefore it is said, In 
peace I lie down and sleep together: for you, O JEHOVAH, alone make me dwell 
secure. By peace is signified the internal delight of heaven, by security the external 
delight, and by lying down and sleeping, and by dwelling, is signified to live. AE 365.

See the exposition at verse 5 of the foregoing chapter, where a state of tranquillity is 
described from AC 3696.

The Translator's Notes and Observations

Verse 6. Lift you up the light of your faces upon us, O JEHOVAH. In the common 
English version of the Psalms, what is here rendered faces in the plural number, is 
rendered countenance in the singular. But the original Hebrew is in the plural, 
because the ALMIGHTY has many faces, or aspects, according to the temper and 
characters of those who view him; agreeably to the Divine Testimony where it is 
written, "With the merciful you will show yourself merciful; with an upright man you 

33

will show yourself upright; with the pure you will show yourself pure, and with the 
perverse you will show yourself perverse." Psalm 18:25, 26. Nevertheless, though the 
aspect of the DIVINE MAJESTY thus varies, according to the optics through which it is 
viewed, yet his real aspect is always the same, presenting itself under the two-fold 
character of Love and Wisdom, or, what is the same thing, of the GOOD and the TRUE, 
and thus manifesting itself to the two faculties in man, namely the will and the 
understanding, created to receive it.

PSALM 5

To Him that presides upon Nechiloth, a Psalm of David.

1. Give ear to my words, O JEHOVAH; consider my moaning.
2. Hearken to the voice of my cry, my KING and my GOD: for to you will I pray.
3. O JEHOVAH, in the morning you shall hear my voice; in the morning I will set 

myself in order for you, and will watch.

4. For you are not a GOD that delight in wickedness; the evil man shall not dwell 

with you.

5. The proud shall not stand before your eyes; you hate all the workers of 

iniquity

6. You will destroy them that speak a lie: a man of bloods and of deceit JEHOVAH 

abominates.

7. But as for me, in the multitude of your mercy will I come to your house; I will 

bow myself towards the temple of your holiness in your fear.

8. O JEHOVAH, lead me in your justice, because of my foes: make your way 

straight before my face.

9. For there is nothing right in their mouth: their inward part is perdition: their 

throat is an open sepulchre: with their tongue they speak smoothly.

10. Make them guilty, O GOD: let them fall from their counsels; by reason of the 
multitude of their transgressions cast them out: for they have rebelled against 
you.

11. And let them that put their trust in you rejoice: let them ever shout for joy, 

because you will protect them: and let them exult in you that love your name.
12. For you, O JEHOVAH, will bless the just one; with favour, as with a shield, will 

you encompass him.

The Internal Sense

A prayer of the LORD to the FATHER, that he would assist, verse 1-3, 7, 8, 11, 12, 
against the wicked, false speakers, and hypocrites, verses 4-6, 9, 10.

Exposition

Verse 3. O JEHOVAH, in the morning you shall hear my voice, in the morning I will set 
myself in order for you. - As the morning signifies the LORD, his coming, also his 
kingdom and church, and likewise the good of love which is from him, it may hence 
be manifest what is meant by the morning in the following passages:-" Cause me to 
hear your loving kindness in the morning;" (Psalm 143:8) again, "I will sing aloud of 
your mercy in the morning;" (Psalm 59:16) again, "Satisfy us in the morning with 
your mercy, that we may rejoice and be glad all our days;" (Psalm 90:14) again, "O 
JEHOVAH, in the morning you shall hear my voice; in the morning I will set myself in 
order for you;" (Psalm 5:3.) Frequent mention is made of morning in the Word, and it 
has various significations according to the series in the internal sense. In the supreme 
sense it signifies the LORD, and likewise his coming: in the internal sense it signifies 
his kingdom and church, and its state of peace. It also signifies the first state of a new 

35

church, and likewise a state of love; also a state of illustration, consequently a state of 
intelligence and wisdom; and likewise a state of the conjunction of good and of truth, 
which has place when the internal man is conjoined to the external. The reason why 
morning has such various significations is because in the supreme sense it signifies 
the Divine Humanity of the LORD; hence, also, all things which proceed from him; for
the LORD is in those things which proceed from him, so that he himself is there. AE 
179.

Verse 6. You will destroy them that speak a lie, etc. The man of bloods and of deceit, 
in this verse, denotes those who are in falsities from evils, wherefore it is said, you 
will destroy them that speak a lie; a lie in the Word signifies falsities. AE 329.

Verse 9. There is nothing right in their mouth; their inward part is perdition: their 
throat is an open sepulchre: with their tongue they speak smoothly. In their mouth, 
signifies what is exterior; their inward part, signifies what is interior: that their interior
is hell, is signified by their throat being an open sepulchre; and that their exterior is 
hypocritical, and apparently sane, is signified by their speaking smoothly with their 
tongue. From this and other passages in the Word may be manifest what is signified 
by a sepulchre. When, therefore, the subject treated of is those who are in false 
principles grounded in evil, then by their sepulchre is meant hell, from which comes, 
and in which resides, that false principle; but when the subject treated of is those who 
are in truths grounded in good, then by the sepulchre is meant the removal and 
rejection of what is false grounded in evil, and by burial is meant resuscitation and 
resurrection into life, also regeneration: for with the man who is in truths grounded in 
good, what is false grounded in evil is removed, and is rejected into hell, and himself, 
as to his interiors, which are of his spirit, rises again, and enters into the life of truth 
grounded in good, which is spiritual life. AE 659.

Verse 10. By reason of the multitude of their transgressions cast them out. In the 
Word, evils are sometimes called sins, sometimes iniquities, and sometimes 
transgressions; but what is specifically meant by these terms, is not discoverable 
except from the internal sense. Such things as are done contrary to the truths of faith 
are said to be transgressions: such as are done contrary to the goods of faith are said 
to be iniquities: such as are done contrary to the goods of charity and love are said to 
be sins. The two former proceed from a perverse understanding, but the latter from a 
depraved will. Thus in David: "Wash me from mine iniquity, and cleanse me from my 
sin; for I acknowledge my transgressions, and my sin is ever before me:" (Psalm 51:4,
5) where iniquity denotes the evil which is contrary to the goods of faith; sin the evil 
which is contrary to the goods of charity and love; and transgression the evil which is 
contrary to the truths of faith. As this latter is an evil proceeding from a perverse 
understanding, and is thus known by the truths of faith, therefore it is said, I 
acknowledge my transgressions. As transgressions are things contrary to the truths of 
faith, they are also revolts; as is evident in David: "By reason of the multitude of their 
transgressions, cast them out: for they have rebelled against you;" (Psalm 5:10) they 
are said to rebel, when there is revolt and transgression. AC 9156. Verse 12. For you, 
O JEHOVAH, will bless the just one: with favour, as with a shield, will you encompass 
him. Favour here manifestly denotes the Divine Love, from which the Lord defends 
all: his protection grounded in love is signified by encompassing them as with a 
shield. AE 295.

The Translator's Notes and Observations

Verses 1, 2. Give ear to my words, O JEHOVAH, consider my moaning. Hearken to the 
voice of my cry, my KING and my GOD. In these words two distinct acts are ascribed to 
JEHOVAH, the one expressed in the supplication, Give ear to my words, the other in the
supplication, consider my moaning. Two distinct names are also given to JEHOVAH, 
namely my KING and my GOD. But what shall we say is the ground of these 
distinctions? or why should JEHOVAH be called upon both to give ear and to consider, 
and also be invoked under the two distinct appellations, my KING and my GOD? In vain
shall we attempt to account for this mode of speaking, until it be clearly seen, and 
carefully attended to, that to hearken, when applied to the GREAT JEHOVAH, has 
reference to his Divine Love, and thus to the DIVINE GOOD of that LOVE; whilst to 
consider, as applied to the same DIVINE FATHER, has more immediate reference to the 
DIVINE WISDOM of that LOVE, thus to the DIVINE TRUTH of that WISDOM. Hence may 
be discovered the reason, why this same DIVINE FATHER is called both KING and GOD; 
the former name having more relation to the truth of his DIVINE WISDOM, whilst the 
latter has more relation to the good of his DIVINE LOVE, and whilst both united are 
expressive of the eternal marriage or union of those two divine principles.

Verse 6. A man of bloods and of deceit JEHOVAH abominates. In this, and in many 
other passages of the Word, the term bloods is used in the plural number, and this by 
reason of the internal or spiritual sense of the term, in which sense it is applied to the 
mind of man as well as to his body. For to shed blood, when spoken of the mind, 
means to do violence to man's spiritual life. But man's spiritual life consists of two 
principles, the will and the understanding, and to do violence to either principle is to 
shed blood. Hence a man of bloods means one who does violence to both principles, 
by destroying in one the love of what is good, and in the other the love of what is true.

Verse 8. O JEHOVAH, lead me in your justice, because of my foes: make your way 
straight before my face. Lead me in your justice, has relation to the will, that it may be
kept always under the influence and government of the Good of the DIVINE LOVE. 
Make your way straight before my face, has relation to the understanding, that it may 
be guided by the TRUTH of the DIVINE WISDOM.

PSALM 6

To Him that presides on Neginoth, on the Sheminith, a Psalm of David.

1. O JEHOVAH, rebuke me not in your anger, correct me not in your wrath.
2. Be gracious to me, O JEHOVAH, for I am feeble; heal me, O JEHOVAH, for 

my bones tremble.

3. My soul, also, is disturbed exceedingly. But you, O JEHOVAH, how long?
4. Return, O JEHOVAH, deliver my soul: save me for your mercy's sake.
5. For in death there is no commemorating of you; in hell who shall celebrate 

6.

your praise?
I am weary with my groaning: all the night do I make my bed to swim; with 
my tears do I soak my couch.

7. Mine eye wastes away through vexation; it is sunk because of all mine 

enemies.

8. Depart from me, all you workers of iniquity; for JEHOVAH has heard the voice 

of my weeping.
9.
JEHOVAH has heard my prayer; JEHOVAH will accept my supplication.
10. All mine enemies shall be ashamed and disturbed exceedingly: they shall 

return, they shall be put to shame suddenly.

The Internal Sense

A prayer of the Lord to the Father when he was in an extreme state of temptation, 
which state is despair, verse 1-7; and that by his aid he restrained the hells, verse 8-10.

Exposition

Verse 5. for in death there is no commemorating of you; in hell who shall celebrate 
your praise? By death is signified the want of spiritual life, and the possession of 
moral life without it. The reason why this is signified by death is because life, in the 
Word, signifies the life of heaven belonging to man, which also is there called eternal 
life; and death signifies the life of hell, which life, in the Word, is called death, 
because it is the privation of the life of heaven. Moral life without spiritual life is the 
life of self-love and of the love of the world; but moral life, grounded in spiritual life, 
is the life of love to the LORD, and of love towards the neighbour. This latter life is the
life of heaven, but the former is what is called spiritual death. As death denotes 
damnation, it also denotes hell; wherefore hell, in the Word, is everywhere called 
death, as in the following passages:-" Hell cannot praise you, death cannot celebrate 
you; they that go down into the pit cannot hope in your truth: the living, the living, he 
shall praise you;" (Isaiah 38:18, 19) again, "We have made a covenant with death, and
with hell we have made a vision;" (Isaiah 28:15) and in David, "In death there is no 
commemorating of you; in hell who shall celebrate your praise?" (Psalm 6:5.) AE 
186.

In the other life, by life is signified in general, heaven, specifically eternal happiness, 
and by death is signified in general, hell, and specifically eternal unhappiness there; 

38

as is evident from several passages in the Word. The reason why heaven in general, 
and specifically eternal happiness, is called life, is because in heaven there is the 
wisdom of good and the intelligence of truth, and in the wisdom of good and the 
intelligence of truth there is life from the LORD, from whom is the all of life. But as in 
hell the case is reversed, since in the place of good there is evil, and in the place of 
truth there is what is false, and thereby spiritual life is extinguished, therefore in hell 
there is respectively death, for spiritual death is evil and falsity, and with man it 
consists in willing what is evil, and in thence thinking what is false. AC 5407.

Verse 6. With my tears do I soak my couch. By a tear from the eyes is signified grief of
mind on account of false principles, and from false principles; and the reason is 
because by the eye is signified the understanding of truth, and hence a tear signifies 
grief on account of the non-understanding of truth, consequently on account of false 
principles. The like is also signified by a tear in Isaiah: "He will swallow up death for 
ever, and the LORD JEHOVAH will wipe away the tear from off all faces," (Is 25:8), by 
which is signified that the LORD, by his coming, will remove evils and falsities with 
those who live from him, so that they shall have no grief of mind on account of those 
evils and falsities, and from them: death signifies evil, because from evil is spiritual 
death; and a tear is mentioned in regard to what is false. It is to be noted, that the 
shedding of tears and weeping, signify grief on account of false principles and from 
them; but the shedding of tears denotes grief of the mind, and weeping, grief of the 
heart, on account of those things. Grief of the mind is grief of the thought of the 
understanding, which relates to truth, and grief of the heart is grief of the affection or 
will, which relates to good; and since in the Word throughout, there is a marriage of 
truth and good, therefore mention is made of both in the Word, namely both of 
weeping and of tears, when grief is expressed on account of the false principles of 
doctrine or religion. That weeping is grief of the heart may be manifest from this 
consideration, that weeping is an outpouring from the heart, and bursts forth into 
lamentations through the mouth; and that shedding of tears is grief of the mind may 
be manifest from this consideration, that it goes forth from the thought through the 
eyes. In both cases, namely both in weeping and shedding of tears, there is an effusion
of water, but bitter and astringent, which comes forth by influx from the spiritual 
world into man's grief; and bitter water corresponds to a defect of truth by reason of 
falsities, and hence corresponds to grief; wherefore with those who are principled in 
truth, there is grief by reason of falsities. From these considerations it may be seen 
whence it is that in the Word, where mention is made of the shedding of tears, 
mention is also made of weeping, namely that it is in consequence of the marriage of 
good and of truth in every part thereof. Let the following passages confirm this 
remark: "I will weep with the weeping of Jazer, the vine of Sibmah; I will water you 
with my tears, O Heshbon and Elealeh;" (Isaiah 16:9.) and in Jeremiah, "My soul 
shall weep in secret places, - and mine eye shall run down with tears; (Jer 13:17) 
again, "O that mine eyes were a fountain of tears, that I might weep day and night;" 
(Jer 9:1) "She weeps sore in the night, and the tears are on her cheeks;" (Lam 1:2) 
"Covering the altar of JEHOVAH with tears, with weeping, and crying;" (Malachi 2:13) 
and in Jeremiah, "Refrain your voice from weeping, and your eyes from tears;" (Jer 
31:16) again, "Call for the mourning women, that they may come; - let them take up a
wailing for us, that our eyes may run down with tears; (9:17) and in David, "I am 
weary with my groaning: all the night do I make my bed to swim; with my tears do I 
soak my couch." (Psalm 6:6.) By making the bed to swim is meant, with weeping, 
which is of the mouth, because it is spoken of groaning; but to soak the couch, which 

39

yet is a similar thing, is spoken of tears. These passages are adduced, that it may also 
be known from them that two similar expressions in the Word, especially the 
prophetical, are not vain repetitions, but that the one has relation to good, and the 
other to truth. AE 484. 

By GOD'S wiping away all tears from their eyes, (Rev 7:17), is signified that they shall
no longer be in combats against evils and falsities, and thus no longer in griefs, but in 
goods and truths, and thence in heavenly joys from the LORD: the reason is because 
above, at verse 14, it is said, that these are they who come out of great tribulation, by 
which is signified that they are those who have been in temptations, and have fought 
against evils; and they who afterwards are not in combats against evils, are in goods 
and truths, and thence in heavenly joys. Similar things are signified by these words in 
Isaiah: "He shall swallow up death for ever, and the LORD JEHOVAH shall wipe away 
tears from off all faces. And it shall be said in that day, Lo! this is our GOD; we have 
waited for him, and he will save us; this is JEHOVAH; we have waited for him, we will 
be glad and rejoice in his salvation." Is 25:8, 9. AR 385.

The Translator's Notes and Observations

Verse 1. O JEHOVAH, rebuke me not in your anger, and correct me not in your wrath. 
In these words, as in many other passages, of the HOLY WORD, the distinct passions of 
anger and wrath are ascribed to JEHOVAH. But what shall we say is the true ground of 
the application of such passions to the GREAT and HOLY GOD? For is not GOD the 
purest love and goodness? How then can anger and wrath, which are in direct 
contrariety to those divine properties and characteristics, be supposed, with any show 
of reason, to apply to him? Besides, why is the divine displeasure marked by two 
distinct terms, anger and wrath, and what is the ground of this distinction? Would it 
not have been enough to say, O JEHOVAH rebuke me not in your anger, without adding,
and correct me not in your wrath? In vain shall we attempt, by any logical subtlety, to
give a satisfactory answer to these questions, until it be seen, and seen clearly, in the 
first place, that when anger and wrath are ascribed to JEHOVAH, it is owing solely to 
the appearance presented to the mind and conscience of every wicked man, who 
cannot help supposing that the ALMIGHTY is angry with him, even at the very time 
that he is regarding him with an eye of the purest mercy; and in the second place, that 
the divine displeasure is marked by the two distinct terms, anger and wrath, to denote 
that it extends both to man's will, in its opposition to the SUPREME GOOD, and to his 
understanding, in its contrariety to the SUPREME TRUTH. From this appearance, then, 
of anger and wrath in the DIVINE BEING, and from the double effect of rebuke and 
chastisement which is produced by these two apparent passions, it is again manifest, 
that even in this appearance there is contained a direct and positive indication of that 
marriage of the DIVINE GOOD and the DIVINE TRUTH, which is the grand characteristic 
of the GODHEAD of his HOLY WORD, since, otherwise, it is impossible to assign a 
reason why these distinct passions should be ascribed to him.

Verse 2. For my bones tremble. By bones are not here meant the bones of the body, 
but those principles of the mind which are in correspondence with them; and what 
these principles are, may be manifest from what is written at AC 9643 of the Arcana 
Coelestia, where we read that "bases also correspond to the feet and soles of the feet 
in man; in general to the bones, which sustain all that is fleshy in the body; and by the 
feet, and by bones, in like manner is signified sustaining truth; and by what is fleshy 

40

in the body, the good which sustains itself by truth. That all things in nature have 
reference to the human form, and are significative according to that relationship, see 
AC 9496; that flesh denotes good, AC 3813, 6968, 7850, 9127; that feet denote the 
natural principle, thus truth in powder from good, AC 5327, 5328; that the body 
denotes good, AC 6135; that bones denote truth sustaining," AC 8312, 8005.

PSALM 7

An Elegy of David, which he sung to Jehovah, on account of Cush the Benjamite.

1. O JEHOVAH, my GOD, in you have I trusted: save me from all my persecutors, 

and deliver me;

2. Lest as a lion they rend my soul, tearing it in pieces; and there be none to 

deliver.

3. O JEHOVAH, my GOD, if I have done this; if there be perverseness in my hands;
If I have requited evil to him who was at peace with me, or have stripped even 
4.
mine adversary empty;

5. Let the enemy pursue my soul and overtake it; let him tread down my life to 

the earth, and lay my glory in the dust. Selah.

6. Arise, O JEHOVAH, in your anger; raise yourself up against the fury of mine 

enemies; and awake for me, you who have commanded judgement:
7. And let the congregation of the peoples encompass you; and above them 

8.

return you on high.
JEHOVAH shall judge the peoples: judge me, O JEHOVAH, according to my 
justice, and according to mine integrity that is in me.

9. O let the evil of the wicked fail, but establish him that is just; for you who tries

the hearts and reins are a just GOD.

10. My shield is with GOD, who saves the upright in heart.
11. GOD is a just judge, and GOD is indignant every day.
12. If the wicked turn not, he sharpens his sword, he bends his bow, and makes it 

ready;

13. And he prepares for him the instruments of death; he makes him burning 

arrows.

14. Behold, he conceives iniquity, and is big with mischief, and brings forth a lie.
15. He digs a pit, and hollows it out; and he falls into the hole which he has made.
16. His mischief shall return upon his own head, and upon his own crown shall his

violence descend.

17. I will praise JEHOVAH according to his justice, and I will hymn the name of 

JEHOVAH the Most High.

The Internal Sense

A prayer of the LORD to the FATHER that he would assist against the hells, verses 1, 2, 
6-9, 10, 11, 17; because he is just and there is no evil in him, verses 3, 4, 8, 9, 10; lest 
the hells should prevail, verse 5; but they will be subdued, verses 12-16.

Exposition

Verse 2. Lest as a lion they rend my soul, tearing it in pieces, and there be none to 
deliver. By tearing in pieces is signified destruction by evils and falsities; the ground 
of which signification is because in the spiritual world there is no other tearing in 
pieces but that of good by evils and falsities. The case herein is like that of death and 
what relates to death, which in the spiritual sense do not signify natural death, but 

42

spiritual death, which is damnation; for there is no other death in the spiritual world: 
in like manner, tearing in pieces, in the spiritual sense, does not mean such tearing in 
pieces as is effected by wild beasts, but the tearing in pieces of good by evils and 
falsities. The wild beasts also, which tear in pieces, in the spiritual sense, signify the 
evils of lusts, and the falsities thence derived; which, likewise, in the other life, are 
represented by wild beasts. The good, which continually flows in with man from the 
Lord, never perishes except by evils and the falsities thence derived, for as soon as 
that good comes through the internal man to the external or natural man, it is met by 
what is evil and false, and is thus torn in pieces, as by wild beasts, in various ways, 
and is extinguished. Hence the influx of good through the internal man is hindered 
and checked; consequently, the interior mind through which it flows is closed, and 
only such a measure of what is spiritual is admitted through it, as may enable the 
natural man to reason and speak; which in such case he does only from earthly, 
corporeal, and worldly principles, and thus, in fact, in opposition to what is good and 
true, or only pretendedly or deceitfully in agreement with them. As what is torn in 
pieces, in the spiritual sense, signified what has been destroyed by falsities and evils, 
therefore it was forbidden, in the representative church, to eat anything torn in pieces;
which prohibition would not have been enjoined, had not that spiritual evil been 
meant in heaven. The tearing in pieces of what is good by falsities and evils is also 
meant, in the internal sense, in the following passages in David: "The wicked are like 
a lion that desires to tear in pieces, and as a young lion that lurks in secret places;" 
(Psalm 17:12) again, "They opened their mouths against me, as a lion tearing in 
pieces and roaring;" (Psalm 22:13) and again, "Lest as a lion they rend my soul, 
tearing it in pieces, and there be none to deliver, (Psalm 7:2) where a lion denotes 
those who devastate the church. AC 5828

Verse 9. You who tries the hearts and reins are a just God. By trying the hearts and 
reins is signified that the LORD alone knows and explores exterior and interior 
principles, also the things which are of faith and of love. this is manifest from the 
signification of trying when applied to the LORD, 'as denoting that he alone knows and
explores; and from the signification of the reins, as denoting the truths of faith and 
their purification from falsities; and from the signification of the heart, as denoting 
the good of love. The just are those who love to do what is true and good; the truths 
and goods of these are purified by the LORD, which is meant by his seeing and trying 
the reins of the heart. AE 167.

Verse 10. My shield is with GOD, who saves the upright in heart. See Psalm 3:3, 
Exposition.

Verses 11, 12, 13. GOD is a just judge, and GOD is indignant every day. If the wicked 
turn not, he sharpens his sword, he bends his bow, and makes it ready; and he 
prepares for him the instruments of death; he makes him burning arrows. It is here 
attributed to GOD, that he is angry with the wicked, that he sharpens his sword, that he
bends and makes ready his bow, that he prepares the instruments of death, and makes 
his darts burning, but in the spiritual sense it is understood, that man does this to 
himself: those things are attributed to GOD in the sense of the letter, because that sense
is natural, and for the natural man, who believes that GOD is to be feared on account 
thereof; and fear with him operates the same as love does afterwards, when he 
becomes spiritual; hence, it is evident what is here signified by those words, namely, 
that the wicked is angry with GOD, that he sharpens the sword against himself, and 

43

bends and makes ready his bow, that he prepares for himself the instruments of death, 
and makes his arrows burning. By his sharpening the sword, is meant that he procures
to himself the falsity by which he combats against truth; by his bending the bow and 
making it ready, is signified that from falsities he makes for himself doctrine against 
truths; and by his preparing the instruments of death, and making his arrows burning, 
is signified that from infernal love he makes for himself principles of falsity, by which
he destroys good and its truths. AE 357.

The Translator's Notes and Observations

Verse 1. O JEHOVAH, my God, in you have I trusted, etc. - It is remarkable that the 
DIVINE BEING, both in the book of Psalms, and in other parts of the Sacred Scriptures, 
is frequently invoked under a variety of names; being sometimes called JEHOVAH, 
sometimes GOD, sometimes SHADDAI, sometimes ADONAI, sometimes JEHOVAH GOD, 
and sometimes JEHOVAH ADONAI, and lastly, JESUS CHRIST. In the verse under 
consideration, he is addressed by the Psalmist under the combined names of JEHOVAH 
GOD. But what enlightened eye cannot discern, that there must be a divine meaning in 
this combination, and that this meaning cannot be discovered until it be seen, and seen
clearly, that all names of persons and of things, when applied in the Sacred Scriptures 
or WORD OF GOD, are expressive of qualities, and when predicated of the DIVINE 
BEING HIMSELF, are expressive of the distinct divine qualities which constitute the 
peculiar character of that BEING! But what shall we say are these distinct divine 
qualities, or rather, what can they be, but that DIVINE GOODNESS and TRUTH, or that 
DIVINE LOVE and DIVINE WISDOM, which we see stamped on all the works of that 
Being, and especially on ourselves? For how manifest is it that goodness, or love, 
forms the very essence of those works, as truth, or wisdom, forms their very existence.
How manifest again is it that in ourselves, that is to say, in the combination of will and
understanding which makes ourselves, we further discover the traces of the above 
qualities, the will being created for the reception of the DIVINE GOOD, or LOVE, as the 
understanding being created for the reception of the DIVINE TRUTH or WISDOM! The 
conclusion then is sure, namely that the DIVINE BEING is called JEHOVAH from his 
DIVINE GOODNESS or LOVE, and GOD from his DIVINE TRUTH or WISDOM, which is 
another proof of that DIVINE MARRIAGE which characterises every part of the Volume 
of Revelation,

Verse 9. You who tries the hearts and reins are a just GOD - What can be the meaning 
of these words, but that GOD, or the LORD, tries or proves the affections and thoughts 
of mankind? For the heart, as every one knows, is a bodily organ, figurative, and thus 
expressive, of man's love-affections, as the reins or kidneys are bodily organs, 
figurative, and thus expressive, of his intellectual thoughts; on which account the two 
organs are so frequently joined together in the WORD OF GOD, as the subjects of divine
trial or proof. [See Psalm 26:2; Jer 11:20; 17:10; 20:12.] The ground and origin of this
figurative character in regard to the reins or kidneys is probably this; that, according to
the testimony of the best anatomists, this organ is instrumental in purifying the blood 
from urinous impurities, and is thus representative of that organ of truth, by which the
human mind is purified from false persuasions. Here then we see another instance of 
reference to that marriage of the two divine principles, the GOOD and the TRUE, which
pervades the whole testimony of divine Revelation, and which thus has a blessed 
tendency to convince every well-disposed mind, that the Sacred Volume is written 

44

according to a law peculiar to itself, which law marks the divinity of its origin, and 
proves most satisfactorily the complete distinction of the BIBLE from all other books.

Verse 15. He digs a pit and hollows it out. In the Bible version of this passage it is 
thus rendered, He made a pit, and dug it, according to which rendering no mention is 
made of hollowing out, when yet in the original Hebrew the passage literally means 
He dug a pit and hollowed it out. A similar error occurs in the translation of the 
Gospel according to Luke 6:48, where our BLESSED LORD thus describes the true 
Christian: He is like a man which built a house and dug deep, when yet in the original
Greek the passage literally means. He is like a man building a house, who dug and 
deepened. It is of importance that the two terms, digging and hollowing out, or 
deepening, should be thus seen as expressing a distinct meaning, the former term 
having relation to the first adoption of an opinion, whether it be false or true, whilst 
the latter term has relation to the confirmation of that opinion by future reasonings 
and conclusions.

Verse 16. His mischief shall return upon his own head, and upon his own crown shall 
his violence descend. These words have manifest relation to the internals, who are 
described in the preceding verse as conceiving iniquity, and being big with mischief, 
and bringing forth a lie, and thus as endeavouring to deceive and to destroy man by 
depriving him of all good and truth. But what shall we say is to be understood by the 
mischief here spoken of, and what by the violence, and how are we to distinguish 
between the one and the other? Why also is the mischief said to return upon his own 
head, and the violence to descend on his own crown? It is impossible to give any 
satisfactory answer to these questions, unless it be well considered, that the two 
expressions, mischief and violence, have relation to the two opposites to what is TRUE 
and GOOD, that is to say, have relation to what is evil and what is false, and that by this
very opposition they point at the heavenly marriage, to which they are Opposed. 
Mischief, therefore, is said to return upon his head, and violence to descend upon the 
crown, because if infernal operation be rejected by a faithful obedience to what is 
TRUE and GOOD, the operation, in such case, falls back on the infernal operator, 
returning on his head, and descending on his crown, by causing an aggravation of the 
distinct principles, and the distinct punishment, of what is false and evil in himself.

PSALM 8

To him that presides upon the Gittith, a Psalm of David,

1.

JEHOVAH our LORD, how excellent is your name in all the earth, who have set 
your glory above the heavens!

2. Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings have you founded strength, because 

of your adversaries; to still the enemy and the self-avenger.

3. When I behold your heavens, the work of your fingers, the moon and the stars 

which you have prepared;

4. What is man, that you are mindful of him? and the son of man, that you regard

him? 

5. Yet have you made him a little less than GOD; and with glory and honour have 

you crowned him.

6. You have made him to have dominion over the works of your hands: you have 

put all things under his feet;

7. The flock and oxen, all of them; and also the beasts of the field;
8. The bird of the heavens, and the fishes of the sea; whatever traverses the paths 

of the sea.
JEHOVAH our LORD, how excellent is your name in all the earth!

9.

The Internal Sense

Celebration of the FATHER by the LORD: that he would consider his innocence, and 
assist him against the hells, verses 1, 2, 3, 9. The LORD'S state of humiliation is 
described, verses 4, 5; his state of glorification described, verses 6, 7, 8. 

Exposition

Verse 2. Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings have you founded strength. 
Sucklings and they who give suck are occasionally mentioned in the Word, and by 
them is signified the first state of infants, which state is evidently a state of innocence:
for man, as soon as he is born, is introduced into a state of innocence, that that state 
may be a plane for all his other states, and the inmost in them, which state is signified 
in the Word by a suckling; next into a state of the affection of celestial good, that is, of
love towards parents, which with them is in the place of love to the LORD, which state 
is signified by an infant; afterwards, into a state of the affection of spiritual good, or 
of mutual love, that is, of charity towards those who are in a like state, which state is 
signified by childhood; as he grows older, into a state of the affection of truth, which 
state is signified by that of young men; but the subsequent states by men, and at length
by old men. This last state, which is signified by old men, is a state of wisdom in 
which is the innocence of infancy; thus the first state and the last are united, and man, 
when old, as again an infant, but a wise one, is introduced into the LORD'S kingdom. 
That a suckling, in the Word, signifies innocence, is also evident from David: "Out of 
the mouth of babes and sucklings have you founded strength;" (Psalm 8:2, Matt 
21:16) where babes denote celestial love, sucklings denote innocence. So in Jeremiah:
"Wherefore commit you this great evil against your souls, to cut off from you man 

46

and woman, babe and suckling, out of the midst of Judah, to leave you none for 
remains?" (Jer 44:7) where the babe and suckling in like manner denote celestial love 
and its innocence, and when these no longer exist, there are no longer any remains, 
that is, no longer any good and truth remaining stored up in the internal man from the 
LORD; for all goods and truths perish with innocence, innocence being immediately 
from the Divine Being or principle Himself, thus being the very essential thing in 
them. AC 3183.

But it is to be noted, that the innocence of sucklings, of infants, and of children, is 
merely external, and that internal innocence does not exist with man, until he is born 
anew, that is, is as it were anew made a suckling, an infant, and a child. AC 5236. 

Verse 5. And with glory and honour have you crowned him. In the word, frequent 
mention is made of glory and honour, and in every case, glory signifies truth and 
honour good. The reason why both are mentioned together is because in every part of 
the Word there is a heavenly marriage, which is the conjunction of truth and good. 
The reason that this marriage is in every part of the Word, is because the Divine 
Principle which proceeds from the LORD, is Divine Truth united to Divine Good; and 
the latter with the former constitutes heaven, and likewise the church, therefore it is, 
in every part of the Word. Thus also, in every part of the Word there is a divine 
principle from the LORD, and the LORD himself. AE 287. 

Verses 6, 7, 8. You have made him to have dominion over the works of your hands; 
you have put all things under his feet; the flock and oxen, all of them; and also the 
beasts of the field, the bird of the heavens, and the fishes of the sea, etc. So long as 
man is spiritual, his dominion proceeds from the external man to the internal; but 
when he becomes celestial, and does good from love, the dominion then proceeds 
from the internal man to the external; as the LORD describes himself, and thus at the 
same time the celestial man, who is his likeness: "You have made him to have 
dominion over the works of your hands; you have put all things under his feet; the 
flock and oxen, all of them; and also the beasts of the field, the bird of the heavens, 
and the fishes of the sea, etc.;" here, therefore, beasts are first mentioned, then birds, 
then the fishes of the sea; because the celestial man proceeds from love, which is of 
the will, otherwise than the spiritual man, with whom fishes and birds have the 
precedence, which relate to the understanding which is of faith, and the beasts follow. 
AC 52.

Birds, in the Word, signify things intellectual; fishes signify scientifics, which have 
their source in things sensual; for scientifics, intellectual things, rational things, and 
sensual things, are of three kinds, all of them inseminated in the memory, or rather in 
the memories; and, in the regenerate man, they are called forth thence by the LORD 
through the internal man. AC 988, 291.

That flocks and herds have such a signification, and do not mean only flocks and 
herds, is manifest from the passages in the Word where they are mentioned, as in 
David: "You have made him to have dominion over the works of your hands; you 
have put all things under his feet; the flock and oxen, all of them; and also the beasts 
of the field," (Psalm 8:7, 8) the subject here treated of is concerning the LORD, and 
concerning his power over all things in heaven and on earth; and by the flock and 
oxen are signified interior and exterior goods belonging to man, and by beasts 

47

affections belonging to them. If this was not the case, how could the LORD'S power, 
which is divine, be described as being over the flock, oxen, and beasts? AC 10610.

The Translator's Notes and Observations

Verse 5. You have made him a little less than God, and with glory and honour have 
you crowned him. These words, it is manifest, have relation to the GREAT REDEEMER 
in his state of humiliation here on earth; and also to his state of exaltation; for we have
the authority of his own words to assure us, that all things in the Psalms, as well as in
the law of Moses and in the prophets, were written concerning him. (Luke 24:44.) His 
state of humiliation is described in the former part of the verse, where it is written, 
You have made him a little less than God, and his state of exaltation is further 
described in the latter part, where we read, and with glory and honour have you 
crowned him.

But what shall we say is to be understood by the two distinct expressions, glory and 
honour, with which this GREAT SAVIOUR is here said to be crowned? And what, also, is
the reason why these expressions are so frequently joined together in other parts of the
revealed Word; as where it is written, "JEHOVAH made the heavens; glory and honour 
are before him;" (Psalm 96:5, 8) "O LORD my GOD, you are very great; you are 
clothed with glory and honour;" (Psalm 106:1) "The works of JEHOVAH are great; 
glory and honour are his work;" (Psalm 111:2, 3) "They shall see the glory of 
JEHOVAH, and the honour of our GOD;" (Isaiah 35:2. See also Rev 4:9, 11; 21:24, 26.) 
It is impossible to give any satisfactory answer, to these questions, unless it be 
considered, and considered attentively, that the above expressions, glory and honour, 
have distinct reference to the two divine principles of WISDOM and LOVE, or of TRUTH 
and GOODNESS, which unitedly characterise the DIVINE BEING, and thus form in him a 
DIVINE MARRIAGE, and by derivation from him, a heavenly marriage. When therefore 
it is said of this GREAT SAVIOUR, With glory and honour have you crowned him, it is 
the same thing as if it had been said, that his HUMANITY was made DIVINE by virtue of
its union with the wisdom and love of his DIVINITY, and that thus GOD and man in him
are one, as soul and body are one, so that whoever approaches and adores his DIVINE 
BODY, or HUMANITY, approaches and adores, at the same time, his DIVINE SOUL, or 
DIVINITY; since they are no longer two, but ONE DIVINE PERSON. In agreement with 
this idea, glory and honour are predicated of man, since man becomes glorious and 
honourable, in the true and proper sense of the words, in proportion as he receives 
wisdom and love, or truth and good, from their DIVINE SOURCE, the GLORIFIED, or 
DIVINE HUMANITY of the LORD GOD the SAVIOUR JESUS CHRIST.

PSALM 9

To him that presides upon Muth-Labben, a Psalm of David.

1.

I will praise JEHOVAH with my whole heart; I will recount all your wonderful 
works.
I will rejoice and exult in you; I will hymn your name, O Most High

2.
3. Because mine enemies are turned backwards; they stumbled and perished at 

your presence. 

4. For you have executed my judgement and my cause; you sat on the throne 

dispensing justice.

5. You have rebuked the nations, you have destroyed the wicked; their name 

have you blotted out for ever and ever.

6. The enemy are come to an end, a perpetual desolation; and the cities have you 

overthrown; the very memory of them has perished. 

7. But JEHOVAH shall sit for ever; he has established his throne for judgement:
8. He will judge the world in justice; he will pass sentence on the peoples in 

9.

equity.
JEHOVAH, also, will be a tower of refuge for the weak, a tower of refuge for 
times of distress.

10. And they that know your name will trust in you; for you have not forsaken 

them that seek you, O JEHOVAH.

11. Sing to JEHOVAH, that dwells in Zion; declare amongst the peoples the things 

which he brings to pass.

12. For he searches out deeds of blood: he remembers them: he forgets not the cry 

of the miserable.

13. Have mercy on me, O JEHOVAH; look at my misery from them that hate me, O 

you that liftest me up from the gates of death: 

14. That I may recount all your praises in the gates of the daughter of Zion, - may 

exult in your salvation. 

15. The nations are sunk in the pit which they made; in the net which they hid is 

their own foot caught.

16. JEHOVAH is made known: he has executed judgement: in the work of his own 

hands is the wicked ensnared, Higgaion. Selah. 

17. The wicked are turned back into hell; all the nations that forget GOD.
18. For not always shall the needy be forgotten; the expectation of the poor shall 

not perish for ever more. 

19. Arise, JEHOVAH; let not man prevail; let the nations be judged at your 

presence. 

20. Inspire them, O JEHOVAH, with fear: let the nations know themselves to be but 

men. Selah.

The Internal Sense

Thanksgiving and joy of the LORD that the wicked are judged and destroyed, verses 1-
8, 19, 20; and the good delivered, verses 9-14; the thanksgiving of the good that the 
wicked are subdued and cast into hell, verses 15-17.

49

Exposition

VERSES 4, 5, 7. For you have executed my judgement and my cause; you sit on the 
throne dispensing justice. You have rebuked the nations, you have destroyed the 
wicked: their name have you blotted out for ever and ever. But JEHOVAH shall sit for 
ever; he has established his throne for judgement. In the Word, frequent mention is 
made of a throne, and by it, when applied to the LORD, is signified in general, heaven, 
specifically, the spiritual heaven, and abstractedly, the divine truth proceeding from 
the LORD, because this constitutes heaven. Hence, also, a throne is mentioned in 
reference to judgement, since all judgement is performed from truths. That these 
things are signified by a throne in the Word may be manifest from the following 
passages: "Thus says JEHOVAH, The heavens are my throne" (Isaiah 66:1) and in 
David, "JEHOVAH has established his throne in the heavens;" (Psalm 103:19) and in 
Matthew, "He that swears by heaven, swears by the throne of GOD, and by him that 
sits thereon." Matt 23:22. That by a throne is here signified heaven, is evident, for it is
said that the heavens are his throne; that he has established his throne in the heavens; 
that he that swears by heaven, swears by the throne of GOD; not that JEHOVAH, or the 
LORD, sits there on a throne, but because his Divine Principle in the heavens is called 
a throne, and likewise occasionally appears as a throne, to those to whom it is given to
look into heaven. AE 253.

VERSE 7. JEHOVAH shall sit for ever. As JEHOVAH, that is, the LORD, is the very Esse of
the life of all things, therefore it is said of him that he sits; as in David: "JEHOVAH 
shall sit for ever;" (Psalm 9:7) again, JEHOVAH sits upon the flood; yea, JEHOVAH sits 
king for ever;" (Psalm 29:10) again, "GOD reigns over the nations: GOD sits on the 
throne of his holiness;" (Psalm 47:8) and in Matthew, "When the Son of Man shall 
come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then shall he sit on the throne of 
his glory;" (Matt 25:31) where to sit on the throne of his glory, signifies to be in his 
divine truth, from which comes judgement. AE 687. 

VERSE 8. He will judge the world in justice, he will pass sentence on the peoples in 
equity. As by the world is meant the church as to good, and justice is predicated of 
good, therefore it is said, JEHOVAH will judge the world in justice; and as they are 
called peoples who are in truths and equity is truth, therefore it is said. He shall pass 
sentence on the peoples in equity. AE 741. 

VERSE 13. You that liftest me up from the gates of death. As death signifies damnation
and hell, it is evident what it signifies in the following passages: "He will swallow up 
death for ever; and the LORD JEHOVIH will wipe away tears from off all faces;" (Isaiah
25:8) again, "You liftest me up from the gates of death's" (Psalm 9:13) again, "You 
shall not be afraid of the arrow that flies by day, nor of the destruction that wastes at 
noon day;" (Psalm 91:5, 6) and in John, "If any one keep my word, he shall never see 
death:' (John 8:52.) AE 186.

VERSE 14. That I may recount all your praises in the gates of the daughter of Zion. By
doors and gates, is signified a letting-in, and specifically, the truths which let-in, 
which are truths grounded in good from the LORD; whence it is evident what is 
signified by doors and gates in the following passages; "Lift up your heads, O you 
gates, and be you lifted up, you everlasting doors; and the King of Glory shall come 
in;" (Psalm 24:7, 9) again, "That 1 may recount all your praises in the gates of the 

50

daughter of Zion;" (Psalm 9:14) again, "JEHOVAH loves the gates of Zion more than 
all the dwellings of Jacob." Psalm 87:2. By Zion, and by the daughter of Zion, is 
meant the celestial church. AE 208.

The Translator's Notes and Observations

Verse 2. - I will rejoice and exult in you. What intelligent mind, if it admits the 
testimony of revealed truth, cannot discern, and also confirm itself in the discernment,
that one idea is here suggested by rejoicing, and another by exulting, and thus that the 
two expressions involve in them distinct sensations, which ought to be seen distinctly 
and not confounded? For how frequently, in the Sacred Scriptures or WORD of GOD, 
do we find the two terms, joy and gladness, or, what amounts to the same thing, 
rejoicing and exulting, combined in close alliance, for the purpose of expressing two 
distinct kinds and degrees of bliss! Thus it is written in the book of Isaiah: "Behold 
joy and gladness, slaying oxen and killing sheep;" (Is 22:13) and again, "They shall 
attain joy and gladness, and sorrow and sighing shall flee away;" (Is 35:10; 51:11) and
in Jeremiah, "There shall be heard in this place the voice of joy and the voice of 
gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride;" (Jer 33:10, 11) and 
in Joel, "Joy and gladness is cut off from the house of our GOD;" (Joel 1:16) and in 
Zechariah, "The fast of the tenth shall be to the house of Judah and gladness;" (Zech 
8:19) and again in Isaiah, "Joy and gladness shall be found therein, thanksgiving and 
the voice of melody;" (Is 51:3) "Be glad in Jerusalem, and rejoice in her;" (Is 66:10) 
not to mention several other passages to the same effect. What intelligent mind, then, 
cannot hence see clearly, that these two terms, joy and gladness, like the two terms, 
honour and glory, spoken of in the foregoing Psalm, have reference to the two distinct
principles of Love and Wisdom in the DIVINE MIND, and of Goodness and Truth in 
every angelic and human mind, and that without such reference to the divine and 
heavenly marriage of these principles, they would constitute an unmeaning and 
superfluous tautology? 

It ought therefore to be kept in continual remembrance by every lover of REVEALED 
TRUTH, that there are two distinct sources of bliss in the human mind, namely will and
understanding, the will being receptive of the good of heavenly love, whilst the 
understanding is receptive of the truth of heavenly wisdom; and that the gratification 
resulting from the good of heavenly love is denominated joy, whilst the gratification 
resulting from the truth of heavenly wisdom is denominated gladness. It ought also to 
be further recollected, that human bliss can never be complete and full, only so far as 
it is a compound of joy and gladness, in other words, a compound of the two heavenly
principles of good in the will, and of truth in the understanding; since joy without 
gladness, or good without truth, and in like manner gladness without joy, or truth 
without good, affect only one part of the human mind, and consequently are only half 
a blessing.

Verse 18. For not always shall the needy be forgotten; the expectation of the poor 
shall not perish for ever more. Mention is here made of two distinct classes or 
characters of persons, called the needy and the poor; as also in other parts of the HOLY
WORD; for thus it is written in Isaiah: "When the poor and needy seek water, and there
is none, I JEHOVAH will hear them, I the GOD of Israel will not forsake them;" (Is 
41:17) and again, "The first-born of the poor shall feed, and the needy shall lie down 
in safety;" (Is 14:30) and again, in the book of Psalms: "All my bones shall say, 

51

JEHOVAH, who is like you, who delivers the poor from him that is too strong for him, 
yea, the poor and needy from him that spoils him?" Psalm 35:10. That the persons 
who are here described as being poor and needy, were not of this character according 
to the literal sense of the words, but only according to the spiritual sense, is evident 
from the confession of David, where he says, "I am poor and needy, yet the LORD 
thinks upon me;" (Psalm 40:17) and in another place: "I am needy and poor; make 
haste to me, O GOD;" (Psalm 70:6) for David, it is plain, was not poor and needy in 
any other sense than what related to his mind, or spirit, when he appeared to himself 
to be destitute of the true riches, the love and the wisdom of GOD; and therefore it is 
equally evident that, according to a spiritual idea, the poor and needy denote all those 
sons and daughters of men, who are destitute of the love and knowledge of the 
SUPREME.

PSALM 10

1. Wherefore, O JEHOVAH, stand you afar off? Wherefore hide you yourself in 

times of distress?

2. Through the pride of the wicked the poor is grievously anguished; they are 

taken in the devices that they have contrived.

3. For the wicked boasts over his soul's desire, and the covetous blesses himself 

therein. 

4. The wicked, in his pride, despises JEHOVAH, saying, He will not make inquiry. 

All his thoughts are, There is no GOD.

5. His ways are crooked at all times: your judgements, being high, are not before 

him: as for all his adversaries, he puffs at them. 

6. He says in his heart, I shall not be moved to generation and generation; I who 

am not in calamity. 

7. His mouth is full of cursing, and deceits, and fraud: under his tongue are 

mischief and iniquity. 

8. He sits in the lurking places of the enclosures: in his hiding-places does he 

slay the innocent: his eyes watch for the helpless. 

9. He lies in wait in his hiding-place like a lion in his covert: he lies in wait to 

make prey of the poor. He makes prey of the poor by drawing him into his net.

10. He crouches, he stoops down, and the helpless fall into his toils. 
11. He says in his heart, GOD has forgotten: he hides his face; he will never see it. 
12. Arise, JEHOVAH: O GOD, lift up your hand: forget not the poor. 
13. Wherefore does the wicked despise GOD? wherefore does he say in his heart. 

You will not make inquiry? 

14. You do see; for you behold mischief and grief, to put it in your hand. To you 

the helpless commits his cause: you are the helper of the orphan. 
15. Break you the arm of the wicked and the evil. You shall search for his 

wickedness; you shall not find it.

16. JEHOVAH is king for ever and ever: the nations are perished out of his land.
17. You have heard the desire of the poor, O JEHOVAH; you confirm their heart. 

You will incline your ear to hear. 

18. To judge the orphan and oppressed. Never more shall man expel them out of 

the land.

The Internal Sense

That the wicked do evil to the good, and deny GOD, and are hypocrites and deceivers, 
verses 1-11. A prayer to the FATHER that they may be requited and brought to 
judgement, verses 12-18.

Exposition

Verses 11, 12, 13. He says in his heart, GOD (El) has forgotten. O GOD, (El), lift up 
your hand. Wherefore does the wicked despise GOD (Elohim.) In the Word, JEHOVAH, 
or the LORD, in several places is named EL in the singular, also ELOAH, and is likewise 
named ELOHIM in the plural, each sometimes in one verse, or in one series; the reason 

53

why he is so named cannot be known, unless the internal sense of the Word be known.
That EL involves one thing and ELOAH another, and ELOHIM another, every one may 
conclude from this, that the Word is divine, that is, derives its origin from the Divine, 
and that it is hence inspired as to all expressions, yea, as to the smallest apex. What is 
involved in EL, when it is named, and what in ELOHIM, may appear from what has 
been abundantly shown above, namely that EL and ELOHIM, or GOD, is mentioned, 
when truth is treated of; see AC 709, 2586, 2769, 2807, 2822; hence it is that by EL 
and ELOHIM, in the supreme sense, is signified the Divine Spiritual, for this is the 
same with divine truth, but with the difference, that by EL is signified truth in the will 
and act, which is the same thing with the good of truth; see AC 4337. Elohim in the 
plural is used, because by the divine truth are meant all truths, which are from the 
LORD; hence, also, the angels in the Word are sometimes called elohim, or gods, (AC 
4295), as will likewise appear from the passages below, adduced from the Word. 
Inasmuch now as El and Elohim, in the supreme sense, signify the LORD as to truth, 
they also signify him as to power, for it is truth of which power is predicated, for good
acts by truth, when it exercises power; see AC 3091; therefore, wherever power 
derived from truth is treated of in the Word, the LORD is called El and Elohim, or GOD;
hence, also, it is that El in the original tongue, likewise signifies one who is powerful. 
That the names El and Elohim, or GOD, are used in the Word where the Divine 
Spiritual is treated of, or. what is the same thing, the divine truth, and thence the 
divine power, may further appear from these passages: "GOD said to Israel in the 
visions of the night, I am the GOD of the gods (El elohe) of your father: be not afraid 
of descending into Egypt; because I will make you there into a great nation;" (Gen 
46:2, 3) inasmuch as these words were spoken to Israel, whom he would make into a 
great nation, and thereby truth and the power thereof are treated of, it is said El elohe, 
which in the proximate sense signifies GOD of gods. That elohim in the proximate 
sense are gods, because they are predicated of truths and the power thence derived, is 
evident also from the following passage: "There Jacob built an altar, and called the 
place El-bethel, because there the elohim were revealed to him, in his fleeing before 
his brother;" (Genesis 35:7) and in another place, JEHOVAH our GOD, himself the GOD 
of gods, and LORD of lords, the GOD, (El), great, powerful, and formidable;" (Deut 
10:17) where GOD of gods is expressed by Elohe elohim, and afterwards GOD by El, to
whom are attributed greatness and power; and in David, "I have said You are gods 
(elohim), and you are all the sons of the Most High," (Psalm 82:6, John 10:34), where 
they are called gods from truths, for sons are truths; see AC 489, 491, 533; again, "I 
will place his hand in the sea, and his right hand in the rivers, he shall call me, You 
my FATHER, my GOD, (El), the rock of my salvation;" Psalm 89:25, 26) speaking of 
power grounded in truths; again, "The wicked says in his heart, GOD (El) has 
forgotten, he has hidden his faces, he will never see it. Arise, JEHOVAH, GOD (El) lift 
up your hand. Wherefore does the wicked one despise GOD (Elohim)," Psalm 10:11, 
12, 13; where the sense is the same. Inasmuch as several expressions in the Word have
also an opposite sense, so also have GOD and gods; and these expressions are applied, 
when the false principle is treated of, and power derived from the false principle, as in
Ezekiel, "The gods (dim) of the mighty out of the midst of hell shall accost him;" 
(Ezek 32:21) and in Isaiah, "You have heated yourselves with the gods (elim) under 
every green tree," (Is 57:5), where gods are predicated of falsities. AC 4402. 

Verse 15. Break you the arm of the wicked. The ground and reason why the hands, the 
arms, and the shoulders, correspond to power in the grand man is because the strength
and powers of the whole body, and of all its viscera, have reference thereto, for the 

54

body exercises its strength and powers by the arms and hands. Hence also it is that in 
the Word by hands, arms, and shoulders, are signified powers: that this is signified by
hands may be seen, AC 878, 3387; that it is signified by arms, is evident from several 
passages, as from the following, "Be you their arm every morning;" (Isaiah 33:2) "He 
works it by the arm of his strength;" (Isaiah 40:12; "My arms shall judge the people;" 
(Isaiah 51:5) "JEHOVAH break you the arm of the wicked." Psalm 10:15. From these 
passages also it may be manifest, that by the right hand in the Word is signified 
superior power, and by sitting on the right hand of JEHOVAH is signified omnipotence,
see Matt 26:63, 64; Luke 22:69; Mark 14:61, 62. AC 4933.

Verses 14 and 18. You are the helper of the orphan. To judge the orphan and 
oppressed. That by orphans are signified those who are in truth and not yet in good, 
and yet desire good, appears from the signification of orphan or fatherless, when 
mentioned in the Word. That orphans are those who are instructed in the truths of the 
faith of the church from the Word, and by them are afterwards led to good, is evident 
also from the LORD's words in John, "I will ask the FATHER, that He may give you 
another Comforter, that He may abide with you for ever, the Spirit of Truth, whom the
world cannot receive, because it sees Him not, neither knows Him; but you know 
Him, because He abides with you, and is amongst you; I will not leave you orphans, I 
will come to you: these things I have spoken to you, abiding with you, but the 
Comforter, the Holy Spirit, He shall teach you all things," John 14:16, 17, 18, 26. That
those are orphans, who are in truths and desire good, may be manifest from singular 
the things there spoken; for by Comforter is meant Divine Truth, which was the LORD 
when in the world, and which proceeded from the LORD, after He had glorified His 
human [principle], and departed from the world, therefore He says that He would send
the Comforter, and that Himself would come; to send the Comforter is to illustrate and
instruct in the truths of faith; and to come to them is to lead into good, therefore He 
says, I will not leave you orphans. It was said, that by the Comforter is meant the 
Divine Truth, which was the LORD when in the world, and which proceeded from the 
LORD after He had glorified His human [principle], and departed out of the world; that
this is so, the LORD occasionally has manifestly taught; but they who distinguish the 
Divine [being] into persons, and not into essences united into One, do not 
comprehend this; for the Word is explained and comprehended according to the ideas 
conceived by man; so also where the LORD says, that He is in the FATHER, and the 
FATHER in Him; that the FATHER and He are one; also that all His [things] are the 
FATHER'S, and all the FATHER'S His, John 10:30; 14:1 to 11, 20; 16:15; xvii. But to 
proceed with the further explication of what has been said above. That by Comforter 
is meant the Divine Truth, is evident from the words of the LORD themselves, for He is
called the Spirit of Truth, and it is also said, the Comforter the Holy Spirit will teach 
you all things. That the LORD was Divine Truth when in the world, is evident also 
from the words of the LORD in the above passage, for He says, that He was about to 
send another Comforter, (that is, instead of Himself), or Spirit of Truth; and 
concerning Himself, that they know Him, because He abides with you, and is amongst
you; and also, "I say the truth to you, if I shall not depart, the Comforter will not come
to you, but if I shall depart, I will send Him to you;" (John 16:7) and in another place, 
"This He said of the Spirit, whom they should receive that believed in Him; for the 
Holy Spirit was not yet, because JESUS was not yet glorified;" (John 7:39) and also in 
another place, "I am the way and the truth;" (John 14:6) it is also written, that He is 
the Word, and that GOD is the Word, and that the Word was made flesh;" (John 1:1, 2, 
3, 14) where the Word is Divine Truth; that the LORD was Divine Truth when in the 

55

world, see AC 3195, 4687. And that the Divine Truth proceeds from the LORD after 
He had glorified His human [principle], and departed out of the world, is evident also 
from the LORD'S words, "When I shall depart, I will send the Spirit of Truth to you;" to
send is to go forth and to proceed, AC 2397, 4710; and also, "When He shall come, 
He will teach you in all truth; for He shall not speak from Himself, but whatever 
things He shall hear, He shall speak; He shall glorify Me, because He shall receive of 
Mine, and shall announce it to you." (John 16:7, 13, 14, 15.) That the LORD, when He 
departed out of the world, was made Divine Good, even as to the human [principle], 
see AC 3704, 3712, 3737, and that on this occasion, from the Divine Good, which is 
Himself, proceeds the Divine Truth, as the light of the universe from the sun, see AC 
3636, 3643. AC 9199.

The Translator's Notes and Observations

Verse 4. GOD is not in all his thoughts. It is not to be supposed from these words, that 
an ungodly or wicked man never thinks about GOD, for such is the constitution of his 
nature, that he cannot avoid occasionally thinking about the GREAT CREATOR OF THE 
UNIVERSE, even against his will. GOD, however, is not in such thoughts, since GOD is 
only in the thought which proceeds from him; and therefore, though an ungodly and 
wicked man occasionally, and by compulsion thinks about GOD, yet it may truly be 
said, that GOD is not in any of his thoughts, inasmuch as there is nothing in his 
thoughts which originates in GOD.

Verse 15. Break you the arm of the wicked and the evil. As the divine principles of 
LOVE and of WISDOM united, which characterise the SUPREME BEING, give birth, in 
their descent, to the principles of good and truth in such minds as receive them 
according to their original undivided order, so, in their further descent, or when they 
come into contact with disorderly intelligences, they give birth to the principles of 
what is evil and false; what is evil being the necessary result of the perversion of 
GOOD, and what is false being the necessary result of the perversion of TRUTH. Hence 
it became expedient, in the DIVINE BOOK of REVELATION, to mark this perversion by 
distinct terms, one term having relation more to the principle of what is evil in the 
will, and the other more to the principle of what is false in the understanding. Thus we
read of what is sometimes called evil and wickedness, and sometimes sin and iniquity;
evil and sin being applied to denote the perversion of GOOD, whilst wickedness and 
iniquity are applied to denote the perversion of TRUTH. In process of time, however, 
the distinct meaning of those terms was lost sight of, so that at this day it ia scarcely 
known that any such distinct meaning exists, when yet the traces of it are to be found 
through every part of the DIVINE TESTIMONY.

PSALM 11

To Him that presides over the music. A Psalm of David.

1.

In JEHOVAH have I taken refuge: how say you to my soul, Flee to the 
mountains like a bird?

2. For lo! the wicked bend their bow, they make ready their arrow on the string, 

that they may shoot in darkness at the upright in heart. 
3. When the foundations are overturned, what shall the just do?
4.

JEHOVAH is in the temple of his holiness; JEHOVAH is in the heavens, his 
throne. His eyes behold, his eyelids prove, the sons of man. 
JEHOVAH proves the just: but the wicked, and him that loves violence, his soul 
hates.

5.

6. He will rain upon the wicked snares, fire, and brimstone; and the burning 

wind, shall be the portion of their cup

7. For just is JEHOVAH: he loves justice: his face will behold the upright.

The Internal Sense

The LORD excites himself that he may fight against the wicked for the good, verse 1-5.
That from justice the wicked will perish, verses 6, 7.

Exposition

Verse 2. For lo! the wicked bend their bow, etc. In the Word, wherever wars are 
treated of, and mentioned, no other wars are signified in the internal sense, but 
spiritual wars. There were books, also, in the ancient Church, which were entitled THE
WARS OF JEHOVAH; as is manifest in Moses, (Numb 21:17), which, being written in 
the prophetic style, had an internal sense, and treated of the LORD'S combats and 
temptations, and also of the combats and temptations of the church. As war, in the 
Word, as also in the books of the Ancient Church, signified spiritual war, so all 
weapons, as the sword, the spear, the shield, arrows, and the bow, signified such 
things, specifically, as have relation to war understood in a spiritual sense. Hence 
bows and arrows, in the opposite sense, signify the doctrinals of what is false. AC 
2686. By the wicked bending their bow, is signified that they frame doctrine; by 
making ready their arrow on the string, is signified that they apply inwardly to it 
falsities appearing as truths; to shoot in darkness at the upright in heart, signifies to 
deceive those who are in truths derived from good. A bow here denotes the doctrine of
what is false; the arrow denotes the false itself; to shoot is to deceive; and darkness 
denotes appearances: for such persons reason from appearances in the world, and 
from fallacies, by applying to them also the literal sense of the Word. AE 357.

Verse 4. His eyes behold, his eyelids prove, the sons of man. Eyes, when predicated of 
the LORD, signify the Divine Providence; the reason is because, when predicated of 
man, they signify intellect; and divine intellect, as being infinite, is divine providence:
as in David, "Behold, the eye of JEHOVAH is upon them that fear him," (Psalm 33:18) 

57

and again: "JEHOVAH is in the temple of his holiness-his eyes behold, his eyelids 
prove, the sons of man." (Psalm 11:4.) AE 68. 

Verse 5. JEHOVAH proves the just: but the wicked, and him that loves violence, his soul
hates. By the soul of JEHOVAH is here also signified Divine Truth; for by the violent, 
in the Word, is signified one who does violence to Divine Truth; and since this is done
by the false of evil, therefore the false of evil is signified by the wicked and him that 
loves violence. AE 750. 

Verse 6. He will rain upon the wicked snares, fire and brimstone; and the burning 
wind shall be the portion of their cup. By these words is signified that the wicked will 
be destroyed by their own evils grounded in what is false, and by their own falsities 
grounded in what is evil; which will destroy all the truths of the church belonging to 
them: snares, fire, and brimstone, are the evils grounded in what is false, and the 
falsities grounded in what is evil; and the burning wind, which is the portion of their 
cup, signifies the destruction of all truth. That it is not meant that fire and brimstone 
shall rain on the wicked, is evident, for it is said also, that it shall rain snares: 
wherefore, by fire and brimstone such things are signified as altogether destroy the 
truths and goods of the church. AE 578.

By snares, fire, and brimstone, are signified seducing falsities and evils; and by a 
burning wind is signified the vehement assault of truth. These are said to be the 
portion of their cup, because the cup, as containing them, signifies those things. AE 
960.

Snares derive their signification from the enticement and deceit of evils; which 
enticement and deceit proceed from this ground, that all evils originate in self-love 
and the love of the world, and these loves are connate with man, the consequence of 
which is, that man derives from them the delight of his life at its earliest birth, yea, 
derives from them his life; wherefore those loves, like the latent currents of a river, 
continually draw the thoughts and will of man from the LORD to himself, and from 
heaven to the world, thus from the truths and goods of faith to falsities and evils. 
Reasonings grounded in the fallacies of the senses, in this case, have a powerful 
influence; and this also is the reason why the literal sense of the Word is perversely 
explained and applied. These are the things, which, in the spiritual sense of the Word, 
are meant by snares, pit-falls, nets, and gins; also, by frauds and deceits. AC 9348. 

That brimstone denotes the hell of the evils of self-love, and that fire denotes the hell 
of the false principles thence derived, is manifest from the signification of brimstone, 
and thence of fire, in the Word, as denoting self-love with its lusts and consequent 
falsities. Thus it denotes hell, for hell consists of such things. AC 2446.

The Translator's Notes and Observations

Verse 7. For just is JEHOVAH: he loves justice, his face will behold the upright. A 
distinction is here made between justice and the upright; for it is said of justice, that 
JEHOVAH loves it, and of the upright, or uprightness, that his face beholds it. But what 
shall we say is the true ground of this distinction? We have a plain answer to this 
question in what is said concerning justice, that JEHOVAH loves it, and concerning the 
upright or uprightness, that his face beholds it; since we are thus taught, that justice is

58

more in agreement with the principle of the DIVINE LOVE, whose office it is to love; 
and that uprightness is more in agreement with the principle of the DIVINE WISDOM, 
whose office it is to behold or look at. It is evident, then, that in the above passage 
reference is made to the two principles of the DIVINE LOVE and DIVINE WISDOM, as 
being united, and thus forming a divine marriage in JEHOVAH, or the LORD; and that, 
at the same time, a reference is made to the two heavenly principles of justice and of 
uprightness, as existing in man by derivation from these divine principles.

PSALM 12

To Him that presides on the Sheminith, a Psalm of David.

1. Save, JEHOVAH, for the godly is come to an end: for the faithful have 

disappeared from among the sons of man.

2. They speak vanity, a man with his neighbour: with a smooth lip, with a double

heart, do they speak.
3.
JEHOVAH will cut off all smooth lips, the tongue that speaks great things;
4. Those who say, With our tongue will we prevail; our lips are our own: who is 

LORD over us?

5. Because of the oppression of the poor, because of the groaning of the needy, 

now will I arise, says JEHOVAH: I will place in safety him whom they treat with
scorn.

6. The sayings of JEHOVAH are pure sayings, as silver refined in a furnace of 

earth, purified seven times.

7. You, JEHOVAH, will keep them, you will preserve us, from this generation for 

ever.

8. The wicked walk on every side, when the vilest of the sons of man are exalted.

The Internal Sense

That there are no longer any good, but only hypocrites, verses 1—4. That the LORD 
will for ever deliver the good from the wicked, verses 5—8.

EXPOSITION

Verse 2. They speak vanity, a man with his neighbour; with a smooth lip, etc. That lips
denote doctrine is manifest from the following passages in the Word; as in Isaiah: 
"One cried to another, and said, HOLY, HOLY, HOLY, is JEHOVAH of HOSTS. Then I said, 
Woe to me, I am undone; because I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst 
of a people of unclean lips; for mine eyes have seen the KING, JEHOVAH of HOSTS. 
Then flew one of the seraphim to me, having a live coal in his hand;—and he laid it 
on my mouth, and said, Lo, this has touched your lips; and your iniquity is taken 
away, and your sin purged;" (Is 6:3, 5, 6, 7) where the lips denote the interiors of man,
thus internal worship, from which proceeds adoration; which was here represented in 
the person of the prophet. Every one may see that the touching of his lips, and the 
removal of his iniquity thereby, and the purging of his sin, was a representation of the 
interiors, which are signified by lips, and which are things belonging to charity and its
doctrine. Again, in the same prophet: "He shall smite the earth with the rod of his 
mouth, and with the breath of his lips shall he slay the wicked;" (Is 11:4) in the 
internal sense it is not here meant that Jehovah smites with the rod of his mouth, and 
slays the wicked with the breath of his lips, but that the wicked do this to themselves: 
the breath of the lips is doctrine, which, with the wicked, is false. So, in David: "Who 
say, with our tongue will we prevail; our lips are our own;" Psalm 12:4; where the lips
denote falsities; again: "My soul shall be satisfied as with marrow and fatness, and my
mouth shall praise you with joyful lips." Psalm 63:5. AC 1287.

60

Verse 6, The sayings of JEHOVAH are pure sayings; as silver refined in a furnace of 
earth, purified seven times. All numbers, in the Word, like all names, signify spiritual 
things; and since the number seven is often mentioned amongst the rest, therefore, I 
would here show that seven signifies all, and all things: likewise, what is full and 
total; for whatever signifies all, and all things, signifies also what is full and total; for 
what is full and total is predicated of the magnitude of a thing, and all, and all things, 
are predicated of the multitude. That seven has these significations, may be manifest 
from the following passages: "They that dwell in the cities of Israel—shall set on fire 
and burn the weapons, both the shields and the bucklers, the bows and the arrows, and
the handstaves and the spears; and shall burn them with fire seven years. And they 
shall bury Gog and all his multitude,— seven months"—that they may cleanse the 
land." Ezekiel 39:9, 11, 12. The subject here treated of, is concerning the desolation of
all things in the church: they that dwell in the cities of Israel signify all the goods of 
truth; to set on fire signifies to consume by evils; the weapons, shields, bucklers, 
bows, arrows, hand-staves, and spears, denote all things which relate to doctrine; to 
burn them with fire seven years, denotes to consume all, and fully, by evils; Gog 
signifies those who are in external worship, and in no internal; to bury them, and to 
cleanse the land, is to destroy them all, and to purge the church fully from them. In 
like manner, in the first book of Samuel: "The hungry ceased; so that the barren has 
borne seven, and she that has many children is waxed feeble;" 1 Sam 2:5; where the 
hungry who have ceased, denote those who desire the truths and goods of the church; 
the barren that has borne seven, signifies those who are out of the church, and do not 
know truths, because they have not the Word, thus the Gentiles, to whom all things 
will be given: she that has many children waxing feeble, signifies those who have the 
truths of the Word, from whom they will be taken away. So in David: "Seven times in 
a day do I praise you because of your righteous judgements;" Psalm 119:164; where 
seven times in a day denotes always, or at all times. Again; "The sayings of JEHOVAH 
are pure sayings, as silver refined in a furnace of earth, purified SEVEN TIMES;" Psalm 
12:6; where silver signifies truth from the Divine Being or Principle; purified seven 
times, signifies altogether and fully pure. Again, in Isaiah: "The light of the moon 
shall be as the light of the sun, and the light of the sun shall be seven-fold, as the light 
of seven days;" Is 30:26; where the light of the sun signifies Divine Truth from the 
Divine Good; that that light, shall be seven-fold, as the light of seven days, signifies 
that Divine Truth in heaven shall be without any false principle, thus altogether and 
fully pure. AE 257.

The Translator's Notes and Observations

Verse 1. Save, JEHOVAH, for the godly is come to an end; for the faithful have 
disappeared from among the sons of man. The intelligent reader will not fail here to 
note, the two distinct classes of men marked by the godly and the faithful; and how by
the former are to be understood all those who are more under the influence of 
heavenly good, or charity, in the will, whilst by the latter are to be understood those 
who are more influenced by truth, or faith, in the understanding.

Verse 7. You, JEHOVAH, will keep them, you will preserve us, from this generation for 
ever. What intelligent eye cannot discern, that the acts of keeping and of preserving, 
when predicated of JEHOVAH, or the Lord, must of necessity involve distinct ideas, 
and that the distinctness of those ideas cannot be satisfactorily explained, except on 
the ground of the marriage, in the LORD, of the two distinct principles, the DIVINE 

61

LOVE and DIVINE WISDOM; by virtue of which marriage, keeping is ascribed to the 
DIVINE LOVE, and preserving to the DIVINE WISDOM? We have here, then, a striking 
proof of that DIVINE MARRIAGE, which forms so prominent a feature in the DIVINE 
TESTIMONY, by which the book of Revelation is so eminently distinguished from all 
other books.

PSALM 13

To Him that presides over the choir; a Psalm of David.

1. How long, O JEHOVAH, will you forget me? for ever? How long will you hide 

your face from me?

2. How long shall I take counsel in my soul, having sorrow in my heart daily? 

How long shall mine enemy be exalted over me?

3. Look upon me, answer me, O JEHOVAH, my GOD! Enlighten mine eyes, lest I 

sleep the sleep of death.

4. Lest mine enemy say, I have prevailed over him; lest mine adversaries be glad 

because I am moved.

5. Yet I have trusted in your mercy; my heart shall be glad in your salvation.
6.

I will sing to JEHOVAH, because he has recompensed me.

The Internal Sense

Of the LORD'S state of temptations, and of the grievous insurrection of the infernals 
against him, verses 1—4; that he is confident of victory, verses 5, 6.

EXPOSITION

Verse 1. How long will you hide your face from me?— From what has been said 
above concerning the face of JEHOVAH or the LORD, as denoting the Divine Love, and 
every good in heaven and the church, it may be known what is signified by hiding or 
concealing the face, when spoken of JEHOVAH or the LORD, namely that it consists in 
leaving man in his own proprium or selfhood, and thence in evils and falsities which 
overflow from his proprium. For man, when viewed in himself, is nothing but evil and
the false principle thence derived; from which he is withheld by the LORD so as to be 
kept in good; which is effected by elevation out of the proprium. AE 412.

Verse 3. Enlighten my eyes—By eyes is signified the understanding; and the reason is 
because all sight of the eyes belonging to men and angels is from that source. This 
appears as a paradox to those who do not know the interior causes of things from 
which effects are produced in the body, and who therefore believe that the eye sees of 
itself, the ear bears of itself, the tongues tastes of itself, and the body has sensation of 
itself; when yet the interior life of man, which is the life of his spirit, which is the life 
of his understanding and will, or of his thought and affection, is made sensible, by the 
organs of the body, of what is passing in the world, and thus perceives things 
naturally. The whole body, with all its faculties of sensation, is merely an instrument 
of its soul or spirit; which also is the reason why, when the spirit of man is separated 
from the body, the body has no sensation whatever, whereas the spirit afterwards is 
equally sensible as before. That the spirit of man alike sees, hears, and has sensation, 
after its quitting the body, as before in the body, may be seen in the treatise on Heaven
and Hell, HH 461, 469. AE 152.

63

Verse 4. Lest I sleep the sleep of death. Inasmuch as to watch signifies to receive 
spiritual life, hence to sleep signifies natural life without spiritual, since natural life 
compared with spiritual is as sleep compared with wakefulness. AE 187.

THE TRANSLATOR'S NOTES AND OBSERVATIONS

Verse 2. How long shall I take counsel in my soul, having sorrow in my heart daily?—
A manifest distinction is here made between the soul and the heart, as likewise in 
other parts of the sacred Scriptures, particularly in the commandment, "You shall love 
the LORD your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your 
might; Deut 6:5; Matt 22:37; Mark 12:30; Luke 10:27. But whereas by the heart is to 
be understood the seat of the will, or love, and its affections, therefore by the soul is to
be understood the seat of the understanding, or thinking principle, and its thoughts; 
since these two, the will and the understanding, or affection and thought, properly 
constitute what is called man. It is accordingly said of the soul, How long shall I take 
counsel in it? because to take counsel has relation more especially to the 
understanding and thought. For the same reason it is said of the heart, having sorrow 
in it; because all sorrow, like all joy, is of the heart, or love, sorrow, being nothing 
else but what is opposed to the love and its affections. Here then our recollection is 
again excited to that divine and heavenly marriage of LOVE and WISDOM, or 
GOODNESS and TRUTH, the marks and characters of which we have already 
endeavoured to develop in the book of the Psalms; since a manifest reference is here 
made to that marriage in the two distinct terms the soul and the heart, the former of 
which has more relation to the understanding, or wisdom, or truth, whilst the latter 
has more relation to the will, or the love of good.

PSALM 14

To Him that presides over the Choir. A Psalm of David.

1. The fool has said in his heart, There is no God. They have corrupted, they 

2.

have made abominable, their actions: there is none that does good.
JEHOVAH has looked down from heaven upon the sons of men, to see if there 
were any that is intelligent, that seeks GOD.

3. All are gone aside; together are they become corrupt: there is none that does 

good, not even one.

4. Have all the workers of iniquity no knowledge, who eat up my people as they 

eat bread, and call not on JEHOVAH?

5. Then shall they be in great fear; for GOD is in the generation of the just.
6. You have despised the counsel of the poor; because JEHOVAH is his refuge.
7. O that the salvation of Israel were come out of Zion! When JEHOVAH brings 
back the captivity of his people, Jacob shall rejoice, and Israel shall be glad.

The Internal Sense

That there is no longer any understanding of truth, and will to good, verses 1, 2, 3; 
that there is no acknowledgement of GOD, verses 4, 5; but an opposition to goodness 
and truth, 6; that the LORD will save those who are of the church, whence they will 
have joy from him, verse 7.

EXPOSITION

Verse 1. They have corrupted—That to corrupt has relation to persuasions, is manifest
from Isaiah: "They shall not do hurt, and they shall not corrupt, in all my holy 
mountain: for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of JEHOVAH" Is 11:9; where to 
do hurt his relation to the will or lusts, to corrupt to the understanding, or the 
persuasions of what is false. Again: "Ah! sinful nation, a people laden with iniquity, a 
seed of evil doers, children that are corrupters," Is i, 4. And in David: "They have 
corrupted, they have made abominable, their actions; Psalm 14:1;" where they have 
corrupted relates to the dire persuasions, and they have made abominable, to the filthy
lusts, which are in their works, or from which their works are done. AC 622.

Verse 5. GOD is in the generation of the just. That generation in the word signifies 
those things which are of faith and charity, is because no other generation than what is
spiritual can be understood in the internal sense; this is meant by generation in David;
"They shall be in great fear, for GOD is in the generation of the just;" Psalm 14:5; the 
generation of the just denotes truths derived from good, for justice is predicated of 
good. AC 6239.

Verse 7. O that the salvation of Israel were come out of Zion! When JEHOVAH brings 
back the captivity of his people, Jacob shall rejoice, and Israel shall be glad.—by 
Zion are here meant those who are in the good of love from the LORD. Deliverance 
from evils by the Lord, and salvation, is understood by the words, O that the salvation

65

of Israel were come out of Zion! By bringing back the captivity of his people, is meant
from falsities and evils. By Jacob shall rejoice, and Israel shall be glad, is understood
joy on account of deliverance with those who are in the external church, and in the 
internal: those of the external church are understood by Jacob, and those of the 
internal church by Israel: and by both are meant the Gentiles. That by captivity in the 
Word is signified spiritual captivity, as denoting the being secluded from divine truths,
namely from the understanding of them in the Word; also, the destruction of them by 
evils and falsities; may be manifest from passages in the Word, where mention is 
made of captivity; as in the following, "They shall fall by the edge of the sword, and 
shall be led away captive into all nations; and Jerusalem shall be trodden down; Luke 
21:24. "In this chapter the consummation of the age is treated of, which is the last 
time of the church, when truth shall no longer remain. By falling at that time by the 
edge of the sword, is signified the destruction of truth by falsities: the sword, signifies 
the combat of what is false against what is true, and likewise the destruction of truth 
by falsities. By their being led away captive into all nations, are signified the 
persuasions and consequent obsessions of evils of every kind; for when truths are 
destroyed, not only falsities succeed in their place, but also evils: all nations, signify 
all kinds of evil. By Jerusalem being trodden down, is signified the plenary 
destruction and perversion of the doctrine of the church; Jerusalem signifying the 
church as to doctrine, and to tread down signifying altogether to destroy; which is 
principally effected by falsifications and adulterations of the Word. AE 811.

THE TRANSLATOR'S NOTES AND OBSERVATIONS

Verse 7. When JEHOVAH brings back the captivity of his people, Jacob shall rejoice, 
and Israel shall be glad—The people of the LORD, we know, are sometimes called 
Jacob, and sometimes Israel; but what is involved in this difference of names can 
only be known from a serious and attentive consideration of its origin, as it is 
recorded in Gen. xxxii. where mention is made of Jacob's wrestling with an angel; for
from this history we learn, that Jacob was called Israel in consequence of prevailing, 
or gaining the victory in that wrestling; and since this wrestling has manifest relation 
to those temptation-combats, which every man is call to undergo in the progress of his
regeneration, with a view, and for the blessed purpose, of subduing in himself the 
powers of darkness, called the devil, the world, and the flesh; therefore, it may be 
established as a sure conclusion, that under every state of temptation-combat, in which
man gains the victory, he acquires a new name, in other words a new quality, 
inasmuch us a new name cannot possibly have any meaning, only so far as it is 
indicative of a new quality. But what shall we say is the new quality which man 
derives from victory in his spiritual struggles? Let the experience of every devout 
Christian answer this question. For previous to this victory, do not the principles of 
religious speculation in the understanding exalt themselves, and gain the ascendancy, 
over the principles of religious love and life in the will? Is not faith made of more 
account than charity; knowledge than obedience; the brightness and splendour of 
intellectual truth than the simplicity and purity of voluntary good? The two names, 
then, Jacob and Israel, are striking and edifying figures, the former of truth, in its 
temporary exaltation above good in the regenerating mind; and the latter, of good, 
when the work of spiritual combat has been fully and successfully accomplished, and 
thus truth is brought into due submission to, and conjunction with, its legitimate LORD
and HUSBAND.

PSALM 15

A Psalm of David.

1.

JEHOVAH, who shall sojourn in your tabernacle? Who shall dwell in your holy 
mountain?

2. He that walks in integrity, and who does justice, and speaks the truth in his 

heart;

3. Who slanders not with his tongue, who does no evil to his fellow, nor takes up 

4.

a reproach against his neighbour;
In whose eyes the vile person is condemned, but who honours them that fear 
JEHOVAH; who, when he swears to his fellow, changes not;

5. Who puts not out his money to usury, nor takes a bribe against the innocent, 

He that does these things shall never be moved.

The Internal Sense

That they who love their neighbour and God, will be of the Lord's church, verses 1—
5.

EXPOSITION

Verses 1, 2. By the tabernacle is here signified the church as to the good of love, thus 
also the good of love; by the mountain of holiness, by which is meant Jerusalem, is 
signified the church as to the truths of doctrine derived from that good: hence is 
known what is meant by sojourning in them: he who walks in integrity, signifies one 
who is in good as to life, and in truths as to doctrine: wherefore it is said, who does 
justice, and speaks the truth; for by doing justice is signified to be in good as to life, 
and by speaking the truth is signified to be in truths as to doctrine. AE 799.

To sojourn in the tabernacle of JEHOVAH means in heaven, and in the good of love 
there. AC 10545.

Verse 5. Who puts not out his money [silver] to usury —By a usurer is signified one 
who does good for the sake of gain; for a usurer lends money to another for the sake 
of usury, and gives aid to another for the sake of recompense; and as genuine charity 
does not regard gain or recompense as an end, but the good of its neighbour, 
therefore, by not being as a usurer is signified that it shall be done from charity. So in 
David: "He who walks in integrity, and who does justice, and speaks the truth in his 
heart:—who puts not out his money to usury, nor takes a bribe against the innocent;" 
Psalm 15:2, 5; where to put out his money to usury is to teach for the sake of gain 
alone, thus to do good for the sake of recompense. AC 9210.

THE TRANSLATOR'S NOTES AND OBSERVATIONS

Verse 1. JEHOVAH, who shall sojourn in your tabernacle? Who shall dwell in your 
holy mountain?—It is evident that these words are not to be interpreted literally, as if 

67

they implied that JEHOVAH, or the LORD, had his abode in a tent, or a hill, according to
the common meanings of those terms in the language of men. For JEHOVAH, or, the 
LORD, it is plain, can only dwell in the principles which proceed from himself, thus in 
his own pure love and wisdom, as imparted from himself to its recipient subjects, 
whether in heaven above, or in the church below. Accordingly he himself thus 
testifies, where it is written: "Thus says the high and lofty one that inhabits eternity, 
whose name is holy; I dwell in the high and holy place [in what is high and holy,] 
with him also that is of a contrite and humble spirit; to revive the spirit of the humble, 
and to revive the heart of the contrite ones; Isaiah 57:15." And again: "JESUS answered
and said to him, If a man love Me, he will hear my words, and my FATHER will love 
him, and we will come to him, and make our abode with him; John 14:23." Hence it is
manifest, that the tabernacle and holy mountain, mentioned by the Psalmist as the 
abode of JEHOVAH [or the LORD,] have reference to the living principles from 
JEHOVAH [or the LORD] in man, in which he [JEHOVAH] makes his abode; and that 
these principles are of a twofold description or character, the first being signified by 
the tabernacle, and the second by the holy mountain. But what principle is distinctly 
meant by the tabernacle, and what by the holy mountain, can only be known from the 
consideration, that heavenly love and heavenly wisdom, as was above hinted at, are the
only principles in which the ALMIGHTY dwells with man, and that, consequently, the 
term tabernacle has more relation to the former principle, and the term holy mountain
[or mountain of holiness] to the latter. For it is a well-established fact, that some men 
are more distinguished by the will of good, and some by the intelligence of truth, and 
that both are capable of becoming the abodes of the divine presence and favour, 
provided they are disposed gratefully to acknowledge, that both the will of good and 
the intelligence of truth are of GOD, and not merely of man. Here, then, in the two 
significant terms, tabernacle and holy mountain, we again behold a reference to that 
marriage of the DIVINE LOVE and WISDOM, or the DIVINE GOOD and TRUE, which 
forms the very life and soul of the holy volume of the revealed WORD OF THE MOST 
HIGH.

PSALM 16

Mictam of David.

1. Preserve me, O GOD; for with you do I take refuge.
2. You have said to JEHOVAH, You are the LORD; I have no good beside you.
3. As for the saints that are in the earth, and the illustrious ones; in them is all my

delight.

4. Their sorrows shall be multiplied that hasten to go backward: I will not offer 
their drink-offerings of blood, nor will I take their names upon my lips.
JEHOVAH is the portion of my part and my cup: you uphold my lot.

5.
6. The lines have fallen to me in pleasant places: yea, a delightful inheritance is 

7.

8.

mine.
I will bless JEHOVAH, who has given me counsel: nightly, also, do my reins 
correct me.
I have set JEHOVAH continually before me: because he is at my right hand I 
shall not be moved.

9. Therefore my heart is glad, and my glory rejoices: my flesh also shall dwell 

confidently.

10. For you will not leave my soul to hell, you will not suffer your holy one to see 

corruption.

11. You will make known to me the way of life. In your presence is fullness of 

joys; at your right hand are pleasures for ever more.

The Internal Sense

The LORD'S confidence in himself, verses 1, 2. For the delivery of the good, whom the
wicked infest, verses 3, 4. That the DIVINE [ Essence or Principle] is his, verses 5—8. 
That his HUMAN [Principle] will rise again glorified, verses 9, 10, 11.

Exposition

Verse 4. I will not offer their drink-offerings of blood. By a drink-offering is signified 
the Divine Good of Truth, which is the good of faith, and is love towards the 
neighbour. For there are two universal genera of good, one which is called the good of
faith, the other which is called the good of love. The good of faith is what is signified 
by a drink-offering, and the good of love is what is signified by oil. They who are 
brought of the LORD to good by an internal way, are in the good of love; but they who 
are brought by an external way, are in the good of faith. Drink-offerings are also 
predicated of blood in David: Their sorrows shall be multiplied that hasten to go 
backward: I will not offer their drink-offerings of blood: (Psalm 16:4) and thereby are 
signified profanations of truth; for blood, in that sense, is violence offered to charity. 
AC 4581.

Verse 7. I will bless JEHOVAH who has given me counsel: nightly, also, do my reins 
correct me. By the reins are signified the truths of faith, and their purification from 
falsity; the reason is because the purification of the blood is performed in the reins or 

69

kidneys: and by blood, in the Word, is signified truth, (see AC 4735, 9127.) The like 
also is signified by the organ which purifies it: all purification from falsity is also 
effected by truths. Hence is evident what is signified in the Word, by JEHOVAH, or the 
LORD, searching the heart or reins, namely, that he explores the truths of faith and the 
goods of love, and separates them from falsities and evils. This is signified by the 
reins in the following passages: "JEHOVAH or HOSTS, the judge of justice, that tries the 
reins and the heart;" Jerem 11:20; and again: "You have planted them, they have taken
root, they grow, yea, they bring forth fruit; You are near in their mouth, and far from 
their reins;" Jerem 12:2; and in David: "I will bless JEHOVAH who has given me 
counsel: nightly, do my reins correct me;" where night signifies the state of man when
falsities arise; the combat of truths with them on this occasion by my reins correct 
me. AE 167.

Verse 9. My flesh also shall dwell confidently. Flesh, in the Word, has various 
significations; it signifies man's proprium, thus either his good or evil, and thence also
the whole man, but in the supreme sense, it signifies the Divine Human [principle] of 
the LORD, specifically the divine good of divine love which proceeds from Him. That 
flesh signifies the Divine Human [principle] as to the good of love, appears in John: 
"JESUS said, I am the living bread, which comes down from heaven; if any one eat of 
this bread, he shall live for ever. The bread which I will give is My flesh, which I will 
give for the life of the world. The Jews, therefore, strove amongst themselves, saying, 
how can this man give His flesh to eat? JESUS therefore said to them, verily, verily, I 
say to you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man, and drink His blood, you have 
no life in you: he who eats My flesh and drinks My blood, has eternal life, and I will 
raise him up at the last day. for My flesh is meat indeed and My blood is drink indeed: 
he who eats My flesh and drinks My blood, dwells in Me and I in him. This is the 
bread which comes down from heaven;" John 6:51-58: that by flesh is here meant the 
proprium of the LORD'S Divine Human [principle,] which is the divine good of divine 
love, is manifestly evident, and it is that which in the holy supper is called His body; 
that the body or flesh in the holy supper is divine good, and the blood divine truth, 
may be seen above, AE 329; and whereas bread and wine signify the same with flesh 
and blood, bread divine good and wine divine truth, therefore these were commanded 
in their place. Divine good from the LORD was also signified by the flesh of the 
sacrifices, which Aaron and his sons might eat, also they who sacrificed and others 
who were clean; and that it was holy, may be seen in Exodus 12:7, 8, 9; 29:30 to 34: 
wherefore if an unclean person ate of that flesh, he was to be cut off from his people; 
Lev. 7:21; that these things were called bread, may be seen in Lev. 22:6, 7, and other 
places: that that flesh was called the flesh of holiness, Jer. 11:15; Haggai 2:12; and the 
flesh of the offering, which was to be upon the tables in the LORD'S kingdom; Ezekiel 
40:43. The LORD'S Divine Human [principle] is also called flesh in John: "The Word 
was made flesh, and dwelt amongst us, and we saw His glory, the glory as of the Only
Begotten of the Father." John 1:14. That flesh also signified good with man, may 
appear from the following passages; thus in Ezekiel: "I will give them one heart, and I
will give a new spirit in the midst of you, and I will remove the heart of stone out of 
their flesh, and will give them a heart of flesh :" Ezek. 11:19; 36:26; the heart of flesh 
is the will and love of good. And in David: "GOD, you are my GOD, in the morning I 
seek You, my soul thirsts for You, my flesh desires You, in a land of drought, and I am
weary without waters;" Psalm 63:2; again: "My soul desires the courts of JEHOVAH, 
my heart and my flesh cry out for the living God;" Psalm 84:2; by the flesh which 
desires JEHOVAH, and which cries out for the living GOD, is signified man as to the 

70

good of the will-principle; for the flesh of man corresponds to the good or evil of his 
will, and the blood to the truth or the false of his understanding, in the present case the
good of the will is denoted by flesh, because it desires JEHOVAH, and cries out for 
GOD. So in Job: "I have known my Redeemer, He lives, and at the last shall arise upon
the dust, and afterwards these things shall be encompassed with my skin, and from my
flesh I shall see GOD:" Job 19:25, 26, 27: to see GOD from his flesh signifies from his 
voluntary proprium made new from the LORD, thus from good. And in Ezekiel: "I will
give upon the bones, which were seen in the midst of the valley, nerves, and I will 
cause flesh to come up upon them, and I will cover them with skin, and I will give 
spirit in them, that they may live:" Ezek. 37:6, 8; where also by flesh is signified the 
proprium of the will made new from the LORD, consequently good; what is there 
signified by the bones and by the rest, may be seen above, AE 418. AE 1082.

The Translator's Notes and Observations

Verse 5. JEHOVAH is the portion of my part and my cup —These two terms, my part 
and my cup, point out man's two-fold relationship to his GREAT CREATOR, who is the 
DIVINE SOURCE of all heavenly good in the will, and of all heavenly truth in the 
understanding. The term part has evident relation to the first of these blessings; and 
that the term cup has relation to the second, will be equally manifest from the spiritual
signification of the term cup. For a cup, as every one knows, is significative and 
declarative of its contents, thus of the wine with which it is filled, and by wine, 
according to the testimony of the Sacred Scriptures throughout, is represented the 
truth of faith grounded in the good of charity, thus wisdom and its life. It is therefore 
written in Psalm xxiii: "You prepare a table for me, in the presence of mine enemies: 
you anoint my head with oil, my cup runs over;" verse 5; and in Psalm cxvi: "What 
shall I render to the LORD for all his benefits to me? I will take the cup of salvation 
and call upon the name of the LORD;" verses 12, 18; where it is evident that by the 
term cup is signified some spiritual principle of man's life, and since it stands in 
connection with other expressions which relate to the good of heavenly love in the 
will, therefore, it must be understood as significative of heavenly truth in the 
understanding, this truth being properly the cup of salvation. But the true meaning of 
the term cup is rendered still more plain and explicit from what the GREAT REDEEMER 
says concerning it, when, at his last supper, he delivers it to his disciples, and marks it 
by the holy name and title of his own blood. For thus it is written on the interesting 
occasion: "And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them saying, Drink 
you all of it, for this is my blood, that of the new testament:" Matt 26:27, 28; Mark 
14:23, 24; Luke 22:20 where his blood of the new testament can admit of no other 
probable interpretation, than as denoting and representing the truths of his wisdom; 
especially when in connection with his body, by which is manifestly figured the good 
of his love.

Verse 9. Therefore my heart is glad and my glory rejoices—The intelligent reader will
not fail here to note the distinction between heart and glory, and how the former has 
relation to the will, or love, and the latter to the understanding or thought; and how 
both expressions united therefore mark the heavenly marriage of the DIVINE GOOD and
the DIVINE TRUE, which distinguishes the WORD OF THE MOST HIGH from any human 
composition whatever.

71

Verse 10. You will make known to me the way of life— What is here rendered life, in 
accommodation to the English idiom, in the original Hebrew is expressed by lives, in 
the plural, to denote that the life of GOD is two-fold, namely the life of love and the 
life of wisdom; and accordingly, in Gen. ii., where mention is made of GOD'S 
breathing into mans nostrils the breath of life, verse 7, and afterwards at verse 9, of 
his planting the tree of life in the midst of the garden, the term life is expressed in the 
plural, and it is called the breath of lives and the tree of lives. This two-fold life is 
further alluded to in the present verse, by the two expressions, fullness of joys, and 
pleasures for ever more;—fullness of joys, which is said to be in the Lord's presence, 
being intended to mark also the blessings of his love; and pleasures for ever more, 
which are said to be at his right hand, being intended to mark also the blessings of his 
wisdom. For a similar reason, the term face, here rendered presence, when applied to 
the ALMIGHTY in the WORD of the Old Testament, is always in the plural number, to 
instruct us that he has two faces, the face of his love, and the face of his wisdom, and 
that he is seen accordingly by the celestial and the spiritual, or by those who are 
principled more in the good of his love, and those who are principled more in the 
truth of his wisdom.

PSALM 17

A Prayer of David.

1. Hear justice, O JEHOVAH, attend to my cry; give ear to my prayers, that 

proceed not from deceitful lips.

2. Let my judgement come forth from your presence; let your eyes look upon 

rectitude.

3. You have proved my heart; you have visited me by night; you have tried me: 

you find no wicked device in me; my mouth transgresses not.

4. As for the doings of man: by the word of your lips I take heed of the ways of 

the violent.

5. Sustain my steps in your paths, that my footsteps be not moved.
6.

I call upon you, for you will answer me, O GOD: incline your ear to me; hear 
my speech.

7. Display wonderfully your mercy, O you that save those who trust in you, from 

them that rise up against your right hand.

8. Keep me as the pupil of the eye; hide me under the shadow of your wings,
9. From the wicked that oppress me; my deadly enemies who beset me round 

about.

10. They are inclosed in their fat; with their mouth they speak proudly.
11. Already have they encompassed us in our steps; they have set their eyes to 

bring us down to the earth.

12. He is like a lion that is eager to tear in pieces, and as a young lion couching in 

secret places.

13. Arise, O JEHOVAH, prevent him; lay him low; deliver my soul from the wicked

by your sword,

14. From men, with your hand, O JEHOVAH, from men of the world, whose portion
is in life, and whose belly you fill with your treasure: who feed to the full their
children, and leave their residue to their little ones.

15. As for me, in justice shall I see your face; I shall be fed to the full, when I 

awake, with your image.

The Internal Sense

The LORD concerning the integrity of his life, verses 1—5; through the Divine 
principle within him, verse 6; whereby he is supported against the wicked who rise up
against him, verses 6-10; and desire to kill him, verses 11, 12; by whom, nevertheless,
he cannot be hurt, verse 13; who are, notwithstanding, in possession of the Word, 
verse 14; that he shall be glorified, verse 15.

EXPOSITION

Verse 8. Hide me under the shadow of your wings. That wings signify the divine 
spiritual principle, which in its essence is truth derived from good, may be manifest 
from the following passages: "GOD rode upon a cherub, he did fly; he was carried on 
the wings of the wind;" Psalm 18:10. GOD rode upon a cherub, signifies the Divine 

73

Providence of the LORD; he did fly, signifies omnipresence in the spiritual world; 
carried on the wings of the wind, signifies omnipresence in the natural world: the 
wings of the wind are spiritual things from which natural things are derived. Hence it 
it is also evident what is signified by being hidden under the wings of GOD; Psalm 
17:8; by trusting in the shadow of his wings; Psalm 57:2; also, what by singing under 
the shadow of his wings; Psalm 63:7. That wings, when applied to the LORD, signify 
the divine spiritual principle, is further manifest from the following passages: "When I
passed by you, and looked upon you, behold your time was the time of love; and I 
spread my wing over you, and covered your nakedness;" Ezekiel 16:8; speaking of 
Jerusalem, by which is signified the church, in this passage concerning its 
reformation: the time of love signifies the state when it might be reformed; I spread 
my wing over you, signifies spiritual truth, by which reformation was effected; I 
covered your nakedness, signifies by it, the concealment of evil; for evil, which man 
has hereditarily, and afterwards from the proprium or self-hood, is concealed, that is, 
is removed, so as not to appear, by spiritual truths, which are truths derived from 
good. So in David: "Who cover yourself with light as with a garment; who stretch out 
the heavens like a curtain: who lays the beams of his chambers in the waters: who 
makes the clouds his chariot: who walks on the wings of the wind;" Psalm 104:2, 3, 4. 
By the light with which JEHOVAH covers himself, is signified Divine Truth in the 
heavens, which is called his garment, because it proceeds from Him as a sun, and is 
thus out of and around Him; by this the like is signified as by the light and clothing of 
the LORD when he was transfigured; Matt 17:2; Mark 9:3; Luke 9:28 to 37: who 
stretch out the heavens like a curtain, signifies to fill with divine truth, and by it with 
intelligence, those who are there: to lay the beams of his chambers in the waters, 
signifies to fill with the knowledge of truth and good, those who are in the ultimate 
heaven, and who are in the church: to make the clouds his chariot, signifies the 
doctrine of truth from the literal sense of the Word: a cloud is that sense, and a chariot
is doctrine: to walk on the wings of the wind, signifies the spiritual sense which is in 
the literal sense. AE 283.

Verse 10. They are inclosed in their fat. Inasmuch as by fat and fatness was signified 
the good of love, and as all worship, which is truly worship, must be from the good of
love, therefore it was appointed that all the fat in the sacrifices should be burnt upon 
the altar; Exodus 29:13, 22; Lev 1:8; for by the sacrifices and burnt-offerings was 
signified worship. Since the Jewish and Israelitish nation was only in external 
worship, and not, at the same time, in internal worship, and consequently was not in 
any good of love, nor in any good of charity and faith, therefore it was prohibited 
them to eat the fat and blood, and it was declared, that if they should eat them, they 
would be cut off; Lev 3:17. But to those who are in internal worship, and thence in 
external worship, such as they are to be, who should be of the LORD'S new church, it is
said, that they should eat fat to satiety, and drink blood to inebriety ; Ezekiel 39:19. 
By fat is there signified all the good of heaven and the church, and by blood, all the 
truth thereof. In the opposite sense, by the fat ones are signified those who nauseate 
good, or who at least despise or reject it, as in Psalm 17:10, They are inclosed, in their
fat. See Deut 32:15; Jer 5:28. AE 1159.

Verse 14. Whose belly you fill with your treasure: who feed to the full their children, 
and, leave their residue to their little ones. By treasure is signified the truth of the 
Word; by the belly, interior understanding; hence, by filling their belly with treasure, 
is signified to instruct their interior understanding with the truths of the Word; that 

74

hence, they who are affected with truths are fully instructed, is signified by their 
children being fed to the full,—children [sons] signifying those who are in the 
affection of truths; and as their little ones signify nascent truths, of them it is said, that
they leave their residue to their little ones: it is said the interior understanding; for 
there appertains to man exterior understanding and interior; the exterior understanding
is of the natural mind, and the interior understanding is of the spiritual mind: the 
interior understanding is signified by the belly; so in John: "JESUS said, if any one 
thirst, let him come to me and drink: whoever believes in me, as the Scripture has 
said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water. This he said of the spirit, which 
they that believe on him should receive;" John 7:37, 38, 39. Thus the LORD describes, 
divine truth, interiorly perceived by those who are in the spiritual affection of truth: 
these are understood by those who thirst, and come to the LORD and drink: that they 
have the understanding of divine truth, is signified by rivers of living water flowing 
out of their belly: rivers from the belly are understanding, or interior intelligence, and 
living water is divine truth from the LORD. By the Holy Spirit is meant the divine truth
proceeding from the LORD, it is said, that This he said of the Spirit, which they that 
believe on Him should receive; and in Mark: "Whatsoever thing from without enters 
into a man, cannot defile him, because it enters not into his heart, but into the belly, 
and goes out into the drain, purging all meats: but that which comes out of the man, 
this defiles the man; for within, out of the heart of man, proceed," etc; Mark 7:18, 19, 
20; Matt 15:17, 18, 19, 20. These words are thus to be understood; that all things, 
whether they be false or evil, which flow into the thought of the understanding from 
what is seen and heard, and not into the affection of the will, do not affect and infect 
the man, since the thought of man's understanding, so far as it does not proceed from 
the affection of his will, is not in the man but out of him, wherefore it is not 
appropriated to him: the same in the case with truth and good. These things the LORD 
teaches by correspondences, saying, that "what enters by the mouth into the belly, 
does not defile a man, since it does not enter into the heart, for that which enters into 
the belly is cast out into the drain;" by which is meant, that what enters from without, 
or outwardly, whether it be from the objects of sight, or from the objects of discourse, 
or from the objects of memory, into the thought of man's understanding, does not 
render him unclean, but (so far as it is not of his affection or will) is separated and 
cast out, like what is taken by the belly, into the drain. These spiritual things the LORD 
explains by natural things, since meats, which are taken by the mouth, and are let 
down into the belly, signify such things as man imbibes spiritually for the nourishment
of the soul. Hence it is that the belly corresponds to the thought of the understanding, 
and also signifies it. AE 622

The Translator's Notes and Observations

Verses 1, 2. Hear justice, O JEHOVAH; attend to my cry; give ear to my prayers, that 
proceed not from deceitful lips. Let my judgement come forth from your presence. 
Justice and judgement are here, it is manifest, the grand objects of the prayer of the 
Psalmist, who is eager to receive those Divine and heavenly principles from their 
proper Divine Source, the GOD of JUSTICE and of JUDGEMENT, But justice, as must be 
obvious to every enlightened mind, has more immediate reference to the Divine Will, 
or love of GOD, whilst judgement relates principally to the Divine wisdom, or love of 
truth, and both united to the union of such love and wisdom; on which account the 
two terms, justice and judgement, are found to be so frequently combined together in 
the volume of Revelation. In the above prayer then of the Psalmist, we are again 

75

delighted with the interesting discovery, that the union of LOVE and WISDOM, or of the
GOOD and the TRUE, forms a distinguished feature in the Divine testimony contained 
in that volume. In the above prayer too we are taught the edifying lesson, that justice 
and judgement ought never to be separated, since each is necessary to the existence of 
the other, justice being a mere nothing without judgement, and judgement a mere 
nothing without justice; in like manner as charity is nothing without faith, and faith is 
nothing without charity.

From the above words we learn, that the attention of the ALMIGHTY to the wants of his
children is of three degrees, which are here expressed by hearing, attending to, and 
giving ear to; and that the first degree is excited by the principle of justice, or by the 
want of this principle in the will, as it is discovered by man; the second is excited by a
cry, which is nothing but an eager exertion of man's understanding to attain that 
principle; and the third is excited by prayer, which is a joint effect of the will and 
understanding united for the purpose of attaining what they want. What an attention 
should this consideration excite on the part of man, to explore well the purposes of his
will and the thoughts of his understanding whenever he prays!

76

PSALM 18

To him that presides over the music, a Psalm of David, the servant of JEHOVAH, who 
spoke to JEHOVAH the words of this song, in the day in which JEHOVAH delivered him 
from the hand of all his enemies, especially from the hand of Saul.

1. And he said, I will love you, O JEHOVAH, my strength.
2.

JEHOVAH is my rock, my fortress, and my deliverer; my GOD, my rock with

from mine enemies.

afraid.

5. The cords of hell encompassed me, the snares of death beset me.

wind.

11. He made darkness his hiding-place, his pavilion round about him were dark 

waters, clouds of the skies.

12. At the brightness before him his thick clouds passed away; there were 

hailstones and coals of fire!

there were hailstones and coals of fire!

14. And he sent forth his arrows, and scattered them, and he shot forth his 

lightnings and dispersed them.

15. Then the channels of waters were seen, and the foundations of the world were 
laid bare at your rebuke, O JEHOVAH, at the blast of the breath of your nostrils.

16. He put forth his hand from above, he took hold of me and drew me out of 

many waters.

17. He delivered me from my strong enemy, and from them that hate me, for they 

were too strong for me.

18. They prevented me in the day of my calamity, but JEHOVAH was my staff.
19. He brought me forth also into a broad place, he delivered me because he 

delighted in me.

20. JEHOVAH has rewarded me according to my justice; according to the cleanness 

of my hands has he recompensed me.

21. Because I have kept the ways of JEHOVAH, and have not acted wickedly 

against my GOD;

22. Because all his judgements were before me, and I did not put away his statutes

from me;

23. I was also upright before him, and was on my guard against mine iniquity;

77

24. Therefore JEHOVAH has recompensed me according to my justice, according to

the cleanness of my hands before his eyes.

25. With the merciful you will show yourself merciful; with the upright man you 

will show yourself upright.

all who take refuge with him.

31. For who is GOD except JEHOVAH? or who is a rock besides our GOD?
32. It is GOD that girds me with strength, and makes my way perfect.

trample them down as the dirt in the streets.

43. You will deliver me from the contentions of the people; you will set me for the

head of the nations: a people I have not known shall serve me.

44. As soon as their ear has heard they shall obey me; the sons of the stranger

rise up against me; You have delivered me from the man of violence.

49. Therefore will I confess You among the nations, O JEHOVAH, and will sing to 

your name.

50. Great deliverance works He for his king, and He shows mercy to his anointed, 

to David, and to his seed for ever more.

78

The Internal Sense

The LORD'S confidence from his Divine principle against the hells, verses 1 to 3, 6; the
LORD'S combats with the hells, verses 4, 5, 6; that in his zeal he subdued and 
overthrew them, verse 7 to 14; that so Divine truth appears, verse 15; that through his 
Divine principle he prevailed over them, verses 10 to 19; that the LORD was possessed
of justice and integrity, verses 20 to 27, 30, 32; and Divine truth, verses 28, 29; that 
He is the only GOD, verse 31; that he fights from his Divine principle, verses 32 to 36; 
and subjugates the hells, verses 37 to 40; that they have no Saviour, verse 41; 
wherefore they shall be destroyed, verses 42, 45; then there will be a new church 
which will acknowledge and worship the LORD, verses 43, 44; celebration of the LORD
by that church by reason of redemption, verses 46 to 50.

Exposition

Verses 1, 2. JEHOVAH is my strength, my rock, my fortress, and my deliverer, my GOD, 
with whom I take refuge; my shield, and the horn of my salvation. Strength and a rock,
when applied to JEHOVAH, or the LORD, as in the present case, signify Omnipotence; a 
fortress and a rock in which to take refuge, signify protection; shield and a horn of 
salvation, signify salvation thence; strength and fortress, and a shield in the Word are 
predicated of the Divine good, a rock and a horn are predicated of Divine truth; hence 
by the above words are signified Omnipotence, protection, and salvation, which 
appertain to the Divine good by divine truth. AE 316. See also AC 2832.

Verse 1. My rock (sela) and my rock (tsur) That the good of natural love, and the good 
of spiritual love, with their delights, were given to those who constituted the ancient 
church, by means of truths from which their intelligence was derived, and according 
to which they lived is signified by "He made them to suck honey out of the rock, and 
oil out of the stone of the rock," Deut 32:13; honey denoting the delight of natural 
love, oil the delight of spiritual love, and the rock (sela) and the stone of the rock 
(tsur) truth from the Lord. AE 619.

Verses 4, 5. The cords of death encompassed me, the snares of death prevented me. 
The cords and snares of death, which encompassed and prevented, signify 
temptations, which being from hell are also called the cords of hell: These, and the 
other things said in the whole of that Psalm, treat of the LORD'S combats and victories,
wherefore it is also said, verse 43, "You shall set me for a head of the nations, a 
people whom I have not known shall serve me." Treatise on the Lord, verse 14.

Verse 6. He will hear my voice out of his temple. Temple, in the supreme sense, 
signifies the DIVINE HUMAN PRINCIPLE of the LORD, and in a respective sense, heaven;
and since it signifies heaven, it signifies also the church, for the church is the LORD'S 
heaven upon earth, and whereas temple signifies heaven and the church, it signifies 
also the Divine truth proceeding from the Lord; the reason is because this truth makes 
heaven and the church, for they who receive it with the soul and heart, that is, with 
faith and love, constitute heaven and the church. That temple in the word signifies the 
DIVINE HUMAN PRINCIPLE OF THE LORD, and in a respective sense heaven and the 
church, consequently also the Divine truth, may be manifest from the following 
passages: "The Jews said to Jesus, What sign show you to us, that you do these 

79

things? JESUS answered and said to them, Dissolve this temple, and in three days I 
will raise it up again. Then said the Jews, Forty and six years was this temple in 
building, and will you raise it up in three days? But he spoke of the temple of his 
body." John 2:18 to 23. It is here expressly said, that temple signifies the DIVINE 
HUMAN PRINCIPLE OF THE LORD, for by the dissolution of the temple, and its being 
raised again in three days, is understood his death, burial, and resurrection. That 
temple signifies heaven, is evident from the following passages: "I called to JEHOVAH,
and cried to my God, he heard my voice out of his temple." Psalm 18:7. Again, "For a 
day in your courts is better than a thousand; I had rather be a door-keeper in the house
of my GOD, than to dwell in the tents of ungodliness;" Psalm 84:10. That by temple is 
signified the divine truth proceeding from the LORD, is manifest from the following 
passages, "the glory of JEHOVAH lifted up itself above the cherub over the threshold of
the house, and the house was filled with the cloud, and the court was full of the 
brightness of the glory of JEHOVAH;" Ezek 10:4; by house is there meant heaven and 
the church; and by the cloud and by glory, the Divine Truth. And in Isaiah, "a voice of
the tumult of JEHOVAH from the city, a voice of JEHOVAH from the temple;" Is 56:6; by
city in meant the doctrine of truth, by temple the church, and by the voice of JEHOVAH 
from the temple Divine Truth. AE 220.

Verses 7. 8. In my distress I called on JEHOVAH, and cried to my GOD; and the earth 
trembled, and the foundations of the mountains were moved and shaken because he 
was angry. The earth here denotes the church, which is said to be moved and shaken, 
when it is perverted by the falsification of truths; and in this ease the foundations of 
the mountains are said to tremble and be moved, since the goods of love, which are 
founded on the truths of faith, vanish, for mountains are the goods of love, and their 
foundations are the truths of faith. AE 304.

Verse 7. The earth shook and trembled, and the foundations of the mountains were 
moved and shaken, because he was angry. By these words is not meant that the earth 
and its foundations are shaken and moved, but that this is the case with the church, 
and with the truths on which it is founded, for the earth signifies the church, and the 
foundations of the mountains signify the truths on which it is founded, which are 
truths grounded in good. AE 400. Mountains denote the good things of love, their 
foundation signify the truths of faith. AC 9643.

Verse 8. There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and a devouring fire out of his 
mouth, coals were kindled at it. Smoke denotes the false principle, from the kindling 
of which comes anger: Fire out of his mouth, denotes anger from the affection of evil; 
the reason why anger grounded in the affection of evil is fire, is because anger is from 
that source, for when man's love is assaulted, the fiery principle bursts forth, and, as it
were, burns. In this and in several other passages, anger is described by fire, and is 
attributed to JEHOVAH, that is, to the Lord, but it appertains to man, see AC 5798, 
6997. AC 9143.

It is not meant that smoke and devouring fire ascended from JEHOVAH, or the Lord, 
because he has no anger, but it is so said, because the LORD appears such to those who
are in falsities and evils, for they view him from their own falsities and evils. AE 539.

The state of an evil man when he is angry, is like smoke, which, when fire is applied 
to it, becomes flame, for the false of evil in the intellectual principle is as smoke, and 

80

anger is as the flame of kindled smoke; there is also a correspondence between them. 
AC 9144.

Verses 9, 10. He bowed the heavens and came down, and thick darkness was under 
his feet, and he rode upon a cherub and did fly, and was carried on the wings of the 
wind. By JEHOVAH bowing the heavens and coming down, is signified the visitation 
which precedes the last judgement; by thick darkness under his feet, are signified the 
falsities of evil in lower principles; by riding on a cherub, flying, and being carried 
on the wings of the wind, is signified Omnipresence with the Divine principle; the 
wings of the wind are the Divine truths in ultimates, as above. AE 439.

Darkness is here put for clouds: to ride upon a cherub denotes the LORD'S providence,
to prevent man's entering of himself into the mysteries of faith contained in the Word. 
A. C. 2761.

The subject here treated of is concerning the coming and presence of the LORD in the 
Word; thick darkness under his feet, denotes the sense of the letter of The Word; in 
like manner, the darkness of waters and the clouds of the skies; that nevertheless the 
Divine Truth, such as it is in the heavens, is in that sense, is signified by setting 
darkness for his hiding-place; and that at the presence of the LORD, the internal sense 
appears such as it is in heaven, in its glory, is signified by his clouds passing away 
from before him. AC 9406.

Verse 9. Thick darkness was under his feet. The dust of the feet signifies things natural
and corporeal belonging to man; the same thing also is signified by David in these 
words, JEHOVAH bowed the heavens and came down, and thick darkness was under 
his feet, Psalm 18:9. AC 2162.

Verse 10. He rode upon a cherub, and did fly. He rode upon a cherub, signifies the 
Divine providence; did fly, signifies Omnipresence in the spiritual world; and was 
carried on the wings of the wind, signifies Omnipresence in the natural world, the 
wings of the wind are spiritual things, from which natural things are derived. AE 282, 
283.

By the above words is also described the illustration of the Word, and thereby of the 
church; illustration by the influx of Divine truth out of the heavens is signified by GOD
riding on a cherub and flying; Divine Truth in ultimates, which is illustrated, is 
signified by the wings of the wind, darkness of and clouds of the skies; various 
degrees of the understanding receiving illustration are signified by the above words; 
that the obscurities of the ultimate, or literal sense are thence dissipated, is understood
by the clouds passing away from the brightness before him. AE 594.

Verses 12, 13, 14. At the brightness before Him his thick clouds passed, hail and coals
of fire; JEHOVAH thundered in the heavens, and the MOST HIGH uttered his voice, hail 
and, coals of fire; he sent out his arrows and scattered them, and many lightnings and
dispersed them. By hail and fire are here signified falsities and evils destroying the 
truths and goods of the church; the reason why it is said that those things are from 
JEHOVAH is because Divine Truth descending from heaven is changed into infernal 
falsities with the wicked, as was said above, from which change exist several 
appearances, as that hail and fire flow down, when yet these things are not out of 

81

heaven from the LORD, but from those who are in the falsities of evil, who change the 
influx of Divine Truth and Good into the falsity of evil. It has been also given me to 
perceive those changes; when Divine Truth out, of heaven flowed down into any hell, 
it was changed in the way successively into the falsity of evil, such as prevailed 
amongst the inhabitants, in like manner as the sun's heat when it falls into dunghills 
and the sun's light into subjects, which change his rays into disagreeable colours, or as
the light, and heat of the sun in fenny ground produce noxious plants, which nourish 
serpents, whilst in good ground they produce trees and grapes, for the nourishment of 
men and useful animals. From those considerations it may be manifest from what 
origin there is an appearance of hail and fire in the spiritual world, and whence it is 
that JEHOVAH causes them to rain, when yet from JEHOVAH there comes nothing but 
what is good; and when JEHOVAH, that is, the LORD, renders the influx strong, it is not 
that he may destroy the wicked, but that he may deliver and defend the good, for thus 
he conjoins the good more closely and interiorly to himself, and the consequence is, 
that they are separated from the wicked, and the wicked perish; for if the wicked were
not separated, the good would perish, and the angelic heaven also. AE 503.

Verses 13, 14. JEHOVAH also thundered in the heavens, and the MOST HIGH uttered his 
voice; and he sent out his arrows and scattered them, and many lightnings and 
dispersed them. Thunders are here expressed by thundering out of heaven, and by 
uttering a voice. Lightnings by arrows, and by the latter and the former are signified 
Divine Truths, and by lightning their light, which truths, in proportion as they vivify 
and enlighten the good, in the same proportion terrify and blind the wicked, which is 
understood by sending out arrows and scattering them, and lightnings and dispersing 
them; for the wicked cannot endure Divine Truths or any light at all from heaven, 
wherefore they flee away at their presence. AE 273.

Verse 15. The channels of the waters were seen, and the foundations of the world 
were laid bare at your rebuke, O JEHOVAH, at the blast of the breath of your nostrils. 
That all things of the church, as to its truth and good, were utterly overturned, is 
signified by the channels of waters being seen, and the foundations of the world being
laid bare, the channels of water, denoting truths, and the foundations of the world 
denoting its goods; to be seen and to be laid bare, signifies their entire overthrow; that
this overthrow is from the hatred and fury of the wicked against things Divine, is 
signified by at your rebuke, O JEHOVAH, and at the blast of the breath of your nostrils.
AE 741.

Verse 15. The foundations of the world were laid bare at the blast of the breath of 
your nostrils, Inasmuch as Divine Truth consumes and vastates the wicked, hence it is
said in David, "The foundations of the world were laid bare at the blast, of the breath 
of your nostrils." AC 9818.

Inasmuch as the Spirit of GOD signifies Divine Truth, therefore it is called the spirit of
the mouth of JEHOVAH. AE 183.

Verses 18. 19. They prevented me in the day of my calamity. JEHOVAH was my staff. 
He brought me forth also into a broad place. The day of calamity denotes a weak state
as to the faith of truth, JEHOVAH being for a staff, denotes ability in such case; to bring
forth into a broad place [breadth] denotes into the truths which are of faith, that this is
meant by bringing forth into a broad place, [breadth], see 4482. AC 9028.

82

Verse 25. With the merciful than will show yourself merciful, with the upright man you
will show yourself upright. Upright signifies truth which is grounded in charity, for 
truth is derived from various other origins, but what is grounded in the good of charity
from the LORD is called upright, and the man who possesses it is called upright. AC 
612.

Verse 33. He makes my feet like hind's feet. Deliverance from a state of temptation is 
compared to a hind let loose, because the hind is an animal of the forest, loving liberty
more than other animals, in which property the natural principle also resembles it, for 
this principle loves to be in the delight of its affections, consequently in liberty, for 
liberty is what is of the affections. The reason why by a hind is signified natural 
affections is because it is amongst the beasts significative of the affections, as all 
those are which are for food and useful, such as lambs, sheep, she-goats, kids, he-
goats, also oxen, heifers, and cows. AC 6413.

Verse 34. He teaches my hands to war, so that a bow of brass is bent by my arms. By 
war is here signified spiritual war, which is against evils and falsities, this war GOD 
teaches; and by a bow of brass is signified the doctrine of charity, this God causes the
arms to bend, that is, enables it to prevail. AE 357.

By teaching the hands to war, is not meant war against enemies in the world, but 
against enemies in hell, which is effected by combats of truth against falsities and 
against evils; it appears indeed as if by war is there meant war such as David waged 
against his enemies, and thus that JEHOVAH taught him by such war, and how he 
caused a bow of brass to be bent by his arms, but still spiritual war is meant, and 
likewise a spiritual bow, which is the Doctrine of Truth, and a bow of brass the 
Doctrine of the Good of Life, and this because the Word in its essence is spiritual. AE 
734.

Verse 35. Your right hand supports me. By the right hand, when applied to the LORD, 
is signified both Omnipotence and Omniscience, and the reason is because to the 
right hand in heaven is the south, and to the left hand the north, and by the south is 
signified Divine Truth in light, and by the north Divine Truth in shade, and whereas 
Divine Good has all power by Divine Truth, therefore by the right hand, when applied
to the LORD, is signified Omnipotence; and whereas Divine Good has all intelligence 
and wisdom by Divine Truth, and to the right hand in heaven Divine Truth is in light, 
as was said, therefore by the right hand, when applied to the LORD, is also signified 
Omniscience. AE 298.

Verse 42. I will trample them as the dirt in the streets. By a street is signified the Truth
of Doctrine, and in the opposite sense the falsity of doctrine, and the reason is because
by way in the spiritual sense is signified Truth leading to good, and in the opposite 
sense what is false leading to evil, see above, AE 97; and streets are ways in a city, 
and since by a city is signified doctrine, therefore by a street is signified what is true 
and false of doctrine. In the spiritual world also there are cities, and in the cities there 
are streets as in cities in the world, and every one is known as to his quality, in regard 
to the affection of Truth and thence of intelligence, merely from the places there 
where they dwell, also from the streets in which they walk; they who are in a clear 
perception of truth, dwell in the southern quarter of the city, and likewise walk there; 
they who are in the clear affection of the Good of Love dwell in the eastern quarter, 

83

and also walk there; they who are in an obscure affection of the Good of Love dwell 
in the western quarter and likewise walk there; and they who are in an obscure 
perception of Truth dwell in the northern quarter, and there also walk. Inasmuch as 
street signifies the leading Truth of Doctrine, and in the opposite sense the principle of
what is false, therefore by the dirt, the mire, and the dung of streets, is signified the 
false principle of the love of evil in the following passages, "Their carcasses became 
as the dung of the streets" Isaiah 5:25. Again, "I will give him to tread them down like
the mire in the streets," Is 10:6. And in Micah, "Now shall she be trodden down as the 
mire of the streets," Mic 7:10. And in David, "I will trample them as the dirt of the 
streets." Psalm 18:42. AE 652.

Verses 31. 46. For who is God except Jehovah? The reason of its being said who is 
God besides JEHOVAH, or who is a rock except my God: is because where the subject 
treated of is concerning Divine Good, the Lord is called JEHOVAH, and where it is 
concerning Divine Truth he is called GOD, and also rock, as in the present case; in like
manner afterwards, "Jehovah lives and blessed be my rock; the God of my salvation 
shall be exalted," signifies worship by truths from good, whence is salvation; to be 
exalted when predicated of God denoting worship from good by truths. AE 411.

Verse 43. You will set me for the head of the nations, a people whom I have not known
shall serve me. That by people and nation are signified those who are of the LORD'S 
spiritual church and who are of his celestial church, is manifest from the signification 
of people and of nations in the Word, people signifying those who are in spiritual 
good, and nations those who are in celestial good, thus who are of the Lord's spiritual 
church, and who are of his celestial church. AC 1159.

Few persons know what is specifically signified by people, and what specifically by 
nations, therefore I wish to adduce some passages from the Word, where they are 
together named, from which it will be evident that something distinct is signified by 
people, and something distinct by nation, for unless something distinct was signified 
they would not both have been named together. Thus in Isaiah: "Therefore shall the 
strong people glorify you, the city of the terrible nations shall fear you. JEHOVAH will 
swallow up in this mountain the face of the covering cast over all peoples, and the veil
that is spread over all nations," Is 25:3, 7, 8. A distinction is here made between 
people and nations, because people signify those who are of the LORD'S spiritual 
kingdom, and nations those who are of his celestial kingdom: thus those who are in 
spiritual good and who are in celestial good; spiritual good is the good of charity 
towards our neighbour, and thence the good of faith, and celestial good is the good of 
love to the LORD, and thence the good of mutual love; the Truth of this latter good is 
what is meant by a city of strong nations, for city signifies the Doctrine of Truth or the
Truths of Doctrine; by swallowing up the covering over all peoples and the veil 
spread over all nations is signified that the shadow will be dissipated which has 
covered the understanding and prevented its seeing the truths, and perceiving the 
goods which are of the church and of heaven. Again: " Come near you nations to hear,
and you peoples hearken, let the earth hear and the fullness thereof," Is 34:1, 
inasmuch as nations signify those who are in the good of love, and peoples those who
are in the good of charity, and thence in the good of faith, therefore it is said of the 
nations that they should come near, and of peoples that they should hearken, to draw 
near signifying to be conjoined by love, and to hearken signifying to obey and be 

84

instructed; and therefore it is said, let the earth hear and its fullness, earth signifying 
the church as to good, and its fullness signifying truths. AE 331.

THE TRANSLATOR'S NOTES AND OBSERVATIONS

Verse 2. JEHOVAH is my rock, my strong hold, and my deliverer, my GOD, my strength 
in whom I confide, my shield and the horn of my salvation, my high tower. The 
SUPREME BEING is here designated by two distinct names, JEHOVAH and GOD, and 
under the former name is called a rock, a strong hold, and deliverer, and under the 
latter name is styled strength, a shield, a horn of salvation, and a strong tower, and 
under both is described as an ALMIGHTY SAVIOUR. But how inexplicable are the 
words, unless interpreted according to the idea suggested in the heavenly Doctrine of 
the New Jerusalem, namely: that by JEHOVAH is meant the SUPREME as to DIVINE 
GOOD, and by GOD the same SUPREME as to DIVINE TRUTH, and by both united the 
Divine Marriage of both! For, according to any other idea, it must of necessity be 
concluded that there are two distinct sources of divine power, strength, and salvation, 
the one called JEHOVAH, and the other called GOD, and that thus in reality there are 
two ALMIGHTIES, which is a conclusion in direct opposition both to the revelation of 
GOD, and the reason of man; whereas, when it is considered that the two names, 
JEHOVAH and GOD, are expressive of the two distinct principles, the GOOD and the 
TRUE, which enter into the composition of the ONE ALMIGHTY FATHER OF ALL BEING, 
all difficulties vanish, and the above words are then seen to confirm the Divine 
authority and plenary inspiration of the Book of the Psalms, as resulting from the 
DIVINE and HEAVENLY MARRIAGE of these principles.

Verse 42. I will beat them small as dust before the wind. These words manifestly 
apply to the spiritual enemies here spoken of, "Which are no other than the principles 
of what is false and evil. But the question is, what is to be understood by beating 
small these principles? It may be said perhaps that to beat them small is to regard 
them as things of small importance, when opposed to the power of the ALMIGHTY, and
that this is a full proof of a conquest over them. But may not the expression, I will 
beat small, as above applied, have a still further meaning by pointing at the 
particularising of evils and falsities, in other words, by learning to view them in the 
particular, as well as in the general? Certain it is, that the more minutely we regard 
any evil, the more detestable it appears, and consequently we have more power over it
than when we view it only in the gross. Every wise man therefore will see it to be an 
important duty to enlarge his ideas of every evil and false principle, under a 
conviction that the more the ideas of their deformity are enlarged, the more extended 
is his power over those principles.

PSALM 19

To him that presides over the music, a Psalm of David.

1. The heavens declare the glory of GOD, and the firmament displays the work of 

his hands.

2. Day to day utters speech, and night to night shows knowledge.
3. There is no speech, nor language in which their voice is not heard.
4. Their line is gone out through all the earth, and their words to the end of the 

world; in them has he set a tabernacle for the sun;

5. Which, as a bridegroom, goes forth from his chamber, and rejoices as a strong 

man to run his course.

6. His going forth is from one end of the heavens, and his circuit to the other end 

thereof; and there is nothing hidden from his heat.

7. The law of JEHOVAH is perfect, restoring the soul; the testimony of JEHOVAH is 

sure, making wise the simple.

8. The statutes of JEHOVAH are right, rejoicing the heart; the commandment of 

JEHOVAH is pure, enlightening the eyes.

9. The fear of JEHOVAH is clean, enduring for ever; the judgements of JEHOVAH 

are truth; they are altogether just.

10. More to be desired are they than gold, yea, than much pure gold; sweeter also 

than honey and the dropping of honey-combs.

11. Also by them is your servant clearly instructed, in keeping them there is great 

reward. 

12. Who observes his errors? Cleanse you me from secret sins.
13. Keep back your servant also from wanton sins, that they may not have 
dominion over me; then shall I be upright and innocent from much 
transgression.

14. Let the words of my mouth, and the meditation of my heart be acceptable in 

your sight, O JEHOVAH, my rock and my redeemer.

The Internal Sense

That Divine Truth shall go forth on all sides, verses 1 to 4; that this will proceed from 
the LORD from first principles to the ultimates of heaven and the church, verses 5, 6; 
that that Divine Truth perfects man, because it is wisdom, verses 7 to 11; and not self-
conceit, verses 12, 13; therefore it is pure and accepted, verse 14.

EXPOSITION

Verse 1. The heavens declare the glory of God. By heavens are signified the angelic 
heavens; and whereas the heaven of the Lord in the earth is the church, by heaven is 
also signified the church; but by the angelic heavens are signified Truths Divine, 
inasmuch as the angels are receptions of Truths Divine proceeding from the Lord. 
Divine truth proceeding from the Lord as a sun is the light in heaven, which gives 
sight to the angels there, and at the same time intelligence and wisdom; from that 

86

Divine light is all glory in heaven, which is such as to exceed all human apprehension.
AC 9408. 9429.

Verse 4. In them has he set a tabernacle for the sun. By the sun is here meant the 
LORD as to Divine Love, because in the good of his love he dwells in the heavens, 
therefore it is said, "He set for the sun a tabernacle in the heavens." Tabernacle being 
there the LORD'S heaven from the good of love. AE 799.

Verses 7, 8, 9. The law of JEHOVAH is perfect, restoring the soul; the testimony of 
JEHOVAH is sure, making wise he simple; the statutes of JEHOVAH are right, rejoicing 
the heart; the commandment of JEHOVAH is pure, enlightening the eyes; the 
judgements of JEHOVAH are truth, they are altogether just. In several passages 
mention is made of testimonies, and at the same time of law, precepts, 
commandments, statutes and judgements, and by testimonies and commandments are 
signified such things as teach life, by law and precepts such things as teach doctrine, 
and by statutes and judgements such things as teach ceremonies. AE 392.

Verses 9, 10. The judgements of JEHOVAH are truth, and are altogether just; more to 
be desired are they than gold, yea than much fine gold, and sweeter than honey and 
the dropping of honey-combs. By judgements are signified the truths and goods of 
worship, wherefore it is said that the judgements of JEHOVAH are Truth, and 
altogether just, just signifying the good of life, and thence of worship; and whereas 
good is also signified by gold and fine gold, therefore it is said, that they are more to 
be desired than gold, and than much fine gold, gold denoting celestial good, and fine 
gold spiritual good; desirable denotes what is of the affection and love; inasmuch as 
the goods with which man is affected are also delightful, therefore it is said, that they 
are sweeter than honey and the dropping of honey-combs. AE 619.

Verses 9, 10. The fear of JEHOVAH is clean, enduring for ever, the judgements of 
JEHOVAH are Truth, they are altogether just. The fear of JEHOVAH being clean denotes 
love, and the judgements of JEHOVAH being truth denotes faith. AC 2826.

Verse 14. Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable in 
your sight, O JEHOVAH, my rock and my redeemer. By JEHOVAH a rock the same thing 
is signified as by JEHOVAH GOD, namely: the LORD as to Divine Good and Divine 
Truth, and he is called redeemer from regeneration which its effected by Divine Truth:
the words of the mouth signify the understanding of truth, and the meditation of the 
heart the perception of Good. AE 411.

THE TRANSLATOR'S NOTES AND OBSERVATIONS

Verses 7, 8, 9. The law of JEHOVAH is perfect, restoring the soul; the testimony of 
JEHOVAH is sure, making wise the simple; the statutes of JEHOVAH are right, rejoicing 
the heart, the commandment of JEHOVAH is pure, enlightening the eyes; the fear of 
JEHOVAH is clean, enduring for ever; the judgements of JEHOVAH are truth, they are 
altogether just. It must be plain to every intelligent reader, that the HOLY WORD is here
described under the several titles and characters of the law, the testimony, the statutes,
the commandment, the fear, the judgements of JEHOVAH, as that Word has respect to 
the several orders and degrees of DIVINE GOOD and TRUTH contained in it, and 
expressed by it. It must also be equally plain to every such reader, that in all these 

87

orders and degrees of GOOD and of TRUTH, a reference is made to the marriage of 
those principles, or to that undivided union, by which they subsist in GOD Himself, 
and in all that comes from Him, Thus, when the HOLY WORD is called the law of 
JEHOVAH, it is marked by the two distinct names of perfect, and giving rest to the soul,
the first name being intended to denote the principle of GOOD, and the second the 
principle of TRUTH which enter into its composition: When again this HOLY WORD is 
called a testimony, it is marked by the two distinct titles of sure, and making wise the 
simple, the first title having respect to the principle of GOOD, and the second to the 
principle of TRUTH: and both titles united being intended to mark the Divine and 
Heavenly Marriage of both those principles: Again, when this HOLY WORD is 
described by the term statutes, it is denominated as being right and rejoicing the 
heart, because the term right has relation to the principle of TRUTH, whilst the term 
rejoicing the heart has more relation to the principle of GOOD, and both terms united 
are expressive of the Marriage of TRUTH with its GOOD, and of GOOD with its TRUTH. 
Again, when this HOLY WORD is called the commandment of JEHOVAH, it is said to be 
pure and to enlighten the eyes, and thus to be a compound of the above principles of 
DIVINE Good and DIVINE TRUTH, inasmuch as to be pure is a title more characteristic 
of the former principle, and to enlighten the eyes is more characteristic of the latter, 
and thus both titles united are figurative of the above Divine and Heavenly Marriage: 
The HOLY WORD is further announced under another title, the fear of JEHOVAH, and it 
is said of it, under this title, that it is clean and endures for ever, presenting again a 
two-fold reference to the distinct principles of the GOOD and the TRUE, and thus a 
reference to the union or marriage of those principles; the principle of GOOD being 
more marked by the term clean, and the principle of TRUTH by enduring for ever: 
Lastly, the HOLY WORD is characterised under the title of the judgements of JEHOVAH, 
which judgements are said to be true and altogether just, impressing thus on the 
reader's mind the interesting idea of the marriage referred to above, one party in the 
above marriage being TRUTH and the other GOOD, the former being unequivocally 
designated by the term true, and the latter by the term just.

Thus then it is that the HOLY WORD, whether regarded as a law, or as a testimony, or as
statutes, or as a commandment, or as the fear of JEHOVAH, or as judgements, in short, 
as a rule of life for the direction either of man's will, or of his understanding, or of his 
actions, and this in reference both to spiritual, moral, and civil life, bears indisputable 
evidence of its being written in relation to a DIVINE and HEAVENLY MARRIAGE, and of 
thus carrying along with it a proof of its DIVINE ORIGINAL, which is not to be found in 
any other writings whatever.

PSALM 20

To him that presides over the music, a Psalm of David.

1. May JEHOVAH answer you in the day of trouble! may the name of the GOD of 

Jacob exalt you!

2. May he send you help from the sanctuary! and strengthen you out of Zion!
3. May he remember all your offerings, and make fat your burnt-sacrifice! Selah.
4. May he give you according to your heart, and fulfill all your counsel!
5. We will rejoice in your salvation, and in the name of our GOD we will set up 

banners; JEHOVAH will fulfill all your petitions.

6. Now know I that JEHOVAH saves his anointed; He will answer him from the 

heavens of his holiness, with the saving strength of his right hand.

7. Some glory in chariots and some in horses, but we will glory in the name of 

JEHOVAH our GOD.

8. They are brought down and fallen; but we are risen and stand upright.
9. Save, O JEHOVAH, let the king answer us in the day when we call.

The Internal Sense

Celebration of the LORD because he sustains the church, verses 1 to 4; that salvation is
from him, verses 5, 6, 9; that they will be saved who trust in him, and that they will 
perish who trust in themselves, verses 7, 8.

EXPOSITION

Verses 1, 2. May JEHOVAH send you help from the sanctuary, and strengthen you out 
of Zion. Sanctuary denotes the heaven where the truth of faith is, and Zion where the 
good of love is. AC 8330.

Verse 3. Remember all your offerings, and make fat your burnt-sacrifice. That burnt-
offerings in one complex signify representative worship, is manifest from the 
prophets, as in David, "Let JEHOVAH send you aid out of the sanctuary, and strengthen 
you out of Zion; remember all your offerings, and make fat your burnt-sacrifice;" 
Psalm 20:3, 4; and in Isaiah, "Every one that keeps the Sabbath from polluting it, even
them will I introduce to the mountain of my holiness; their burnt-offerings and their 
sacrifices shall be accepted upon mine altar;" Is 56:6, 7; where burnt-offerings and 
sacrifices denote all worship,—burnt-offerings, worship from love; sacrifices, 
worship from faith thence derived. AC 923.

Verse 3. Make fat your burnt-sacrifice. To make fat the burnt-sacrifice is, to make 
worship good, and the reason is because fat denotes the celestial principle of good, as 
is manifest from several passages in the Word; and not only the fat which was in the 
animal, but also the fat which is from other sources, as butter and oil; and those things
which partake at all of fatness, so far as they partake, so much of good they signify, as
milk, honey, gums. That fatness was a representative of celestial good, thus of the 
love which is from the LORD, is manifest from the burnt-offerings and sacrifices, in 

89

that all the fat was to be burnt on the altar, and that hence was an odour of rest to 
JEHOVAH. AC 5943.

Verses 2, 5, 6. JEHOVAH will send you help from the sanctuary, and strengthen you out
of Zion; we will sing in your salvation, and in the name of our God, will we set up our
banners. Now know I that JEHOVAH saves his ANOINTED. He will answer him from the 
heaven of his holiness, with the saving strength of his right hand. These words have 
relation to the LORD, and his victory over the hells, and the consequent salvation of 
men: combats and victories are understood by answering his ANOINTED from the 
heaven of his holiness with the saving strength of his right hand; and the consequent 
salvation of the faithful, by strengthening us out of Zion, and singing in his salvation. 
AE 850.

Verse 7. Some glory in chariots and some in horses, but we will glory in the name of 
JEHOVAH our GOD. By glorying in a chariot and in horses are signified all things 
which are from man's own intelligence. AE 355.

The Translator's Notes and Observations

Verses 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. It is remarkable that, in all these verses, a manifest reference is 
made to the DIVINE and HEAVENLY MARRIAGE of the GOOD and the TRUE, which we 
have had occasion to note in all the preceding Psalms. Thus, in the first verse, 
JEHOVAH is expressive of the SUPREME BEING as to his DIVINE GOOD, and the name of 
the GOD of JACOB is expressive of the same DIVINE BEING as to his DIVINE TRUTH. In 
the second verse, again, mention is made of the sanctuary and of Zion, because the 
sanctuary signifies the source of all that is TRUE, and Zion the source of all that is 
GOOD. The same observation may be extended to the third, the fourth, and the fifth 
verses, where we find distinct mention made of offerings and burnt-sacrifice, of heart
and counsel; of salvation and the name of our GOD; the proper meaning of which 
expressions, in their conjoined state, can only be known, by referring them to that 
eternal law stamped on all the pages of DIVINE REVELATION, by which they are 
compelled to bear witness to the above DIVINE and HEAVENLY MARRIAGE.

Verse 5. JEHOVAH, will fulfill all your petitions. In the original the term (yimala), 
fulfill, properly means to fill, or make full, and suggests an idea perfectly distinct from
granting. If it be asked what the idea is, which is here intended to be expressed by 
filling, it may be replied, that all petition, or prayer, may be of two descriptions, either
full or empty, and that it is of the first description, when it is from the LORD, and thus 
filled with his SPIRIT, but that it is of the second description when it is from the man 
himself, and thus has nothing in it but the man's own spirit, and is consequently empty
of the DIVINE SPIRIT. When therefore it is here said, "JEHOVAH will fulfill all your 
petitions, it is the same thing as if it had been said, your petitions shall no longer be 
empty, having nothing in them but the selfish spirit of man, but shall be full, being 
derived from and replenished with a DIVINE SPIRIT from the MOST HIGH GOD.

PSALM 21

To him that presides over the music, a Psalm of David.

1. The king shall be glad in your strength, O JEHOVAH, and in your salvation how

greatly shall he exult.

2. You have given him his heart's desire, and have not withheld the request of his

lips. Selah.

3. For you present him with the blessings of goodness; you will place a crown of 

pure gold on his head.

4. He asked life of you, and you have given him length of days for ever and ever.
5. His glory is great through your salvation; glory and honour have you laid upon

him.

6. For you make him a blessing forever, you will make him glad with joy before 

your face.

7. For the king trusts in JEHOVAH, and through the mercy of the MOST HIGH he 

shall not be moved.

8. Your hand shall find out all your enemies; your right hand shall find out them 

that hate you.

9. You shall make them as a fiery oven in the time of your presence; JEHOVAH 

shall swallow them up in his wrath, and the fire shall consume them. 

10. Their fruit shall you destroy from the earth, and their seed from the sons of 

man.

11. For they intended evil against you; they imagined a mischievous device; they 

have not prevailed.

12. Truly you shall make them turn their back; you shall make ready your arrows 

upon your strings against the face of them.

13. Be you exalted, O JEHOVAH, in your own strength; we will sing and praise 

your power.

The Internal Sense

Concerning the LORD; that from his Divine (principle) he possesses all good and truth,
consequently honour and glory, verses 1—7; that he will cast down all who are 
against him at, the day of judgement, verses 8—12; that they who are with him shall 
be saved through his power, verse 13.

EXPOSITION

Verse 1. The king shall be glad in your strength, O Jehovah. There are two things 
which are predicated of the LORD, namely: that he is a king and that he is a priest; 
king or royalty signifies Holy Truth, priest, or priesthood, signifies Holy Good; the 
former is the Divine spiritual, the latter the Divine celestial principle. The LORD, as a 
king, governs all and singular things in the universe from Divine Truth, and as a 
priest, from Divine Good: Divine Truth is the order itself of his universal kingdom, all
the laws of which are truths, or eternal verities; Divine Good is the very essential 
principle of order, all things of which are mercies; both are predicated of the LORD; if 

91

only Divine Truth was predicable of him, no man could be saved, for Truths condemn 
every one to hell; but Divine Good, which is of mercy, elevates out of hell into 
heaven. AC 1728.

Verse 3, 5. You present him with the blessings of goodness, you will set a crown of 
pure gold on his head; glory and honour have you laid upon him. By the king here is 
not meant David, but the LORD, who is called a king from the Divine spiritual 
principle which proceeds from his DIVINE HUMANITY; and whereas blessing signifies 
acknowledgements, glorification and thanksgiving, that all good and truth, and thence 
heaven and eternal happiness are from him, hence it is evident what is signified by 
you have prevented him with the blessings of goodness, and by making him blessings 
for ever; the blessings of goodness signify truths derived from good; a crown of pure 
gold signifies the good from which those Truths are derived; honour and glory signify
Divine Good and Divine Truth. AE 340.

Verse 5. Glory and honour have you laid upon him. These words are spoken of the 
LORD, and by glory and honour upon him is meant all Divine Truth and Divine Good. 
AE 288.

Verse 10. Their fruit shall you destroy from the earth, and their seed from the sons of 
man. By the fruit of the ground are signified works of faith without charity; but that 
such fruit is no fruit, or that the work is dead, and that both the fruit and root perish, is
thus declared in Amos: "I destroyed the Amorite before them, whose height was like 
the height of the cedars, and he was strong as the oaks; yet I destroyed his fruit from 
above, and his roots from beneath;" Amos 2:9; and in David: "Their fruit shall you 
destroy from the earth, and their seed from amongst the sons of man," Psalm 21:10. 
AE 448.

THE TRANSLATOR'S NOTES AND OBSERVATIONS

Verse 8. Your hand shall find out all your enemies; your right hand shall find out them
that hate you. A manifest distinction is here made between hand and right hand, also 
between enemies and those that hate, which can only be accounted for by the 
consideration, that hand has reference to the power of DIVINE TRUTH, and right hand 
to the power of DIVINE GOOD, and that enemies denote those who are opposed to the 
former, and they that hate denote those who are opposed to the latter. 

Verse 13. We will sing and praise your power. These words are expressed in the 
original Hebrew by two words, which both denote singing, the one probably having 
reference to the joy or singing of the will, and the other to the delight or singing of the 
understanding, and both to the marriage of the GOOD and the TRUE, which, we have 
had occasion to observe as the continual mark of distinction which meets us in almost 
every page of the sacred collection of the Psalms, and in no Psalm more remarkably 
than the present, as may be seen by an attentive review of the first, second, third, 
fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth verses.

PSALM 22

To him that presides upon Aijeleth Shahar, a Psalm of David.

1. My God, my God, why have you forsaken me! The words of my roaring are 

far away from my salvation.

2. O my God! I cry by day and you answer not; and by night, and have no rest.
3. Yet you are Holy, you that inhabit the praises of Israel.
4.
In you our fathers trusted; they trusted in you, and you did deliver them.
5. They cried aloud to you, and were delivered; they trusted in you and were not 

ashamed.

6. And I am a worm, and no man; a reproach of man and despised of the people.
7. All they that see me laugh me to scorn; they open wide their lips, they shake 

the head, saying.

8. He trusted in JEHOVAH, let him deliver him, let him protect him, since he 

delighted in him.

9. For you are he that took me out of the womb; you did make me hope on my 

mother's breasts.

10. I was cast upon you from the womb; you are my GOD from my mother's belly.
11. Be not you far from me, for trouble is near, for there is no helper.
12. Many bulls have encompassed me; the strong bulls of Bashan have beset me 

round about.

13. They gaped upon me with their mouths, as a ravenous and roaring lion.
14. I am poured out like water, and all my bones are out of joint; my heart is like 

wax, it is melted in the midst of my bowels.

15. My strength is dried up like an earthen vessel; and my tongue cleaves to my 

jaws; and you have laid me in the dust of death.

16. For dogs have encompassed me, the assembly of the wicked have enclosed 

me; they have pierced my hands and my feet.

17. I can count all my bones: they look—they stare upon me.
18. They part my garments among them; and cast lots upon my clothing.
19. But you, O JEHOVAH, be not far off; O my strength! hasten to help me.
20. Deliver my soul from the sword; my only one from the hand of the dog.
21. Save me from the lion's mouth; and answer me from the horns of the unicorn.
22. I will declare your name to my brethren; in the midst of the congregation will I

praise you.

23. You that fear JEHOVAH praise him; all you the seed of Jacob glorify him; and 

stand in awe of him all you the seed of Israel.

24. For he has not despised nor abhorred the affliction of the afflicted, neither has 

he hid his face from him; and when he cried to him, he heard him.

25. Of you shall be my praise in the great congregation; my vows will I pay before

them that fear him.

26. The afflicted shall eat and be satisfied; they shall praise JEHOVAH that seek 

him; your heart shall live for ever.

27. All the ends of the earth shall remember and turn to JEHOVAH, and all the 

families of the nations shall worship before you.

28. For the kingdom is JEHOVAH'S, and he is the governor among the nations.

93

29. All the fat of the earth shall eat and prostrate themselves; all they that go down
to the dust, and he that cannot keep his soul alive, shall bow down before him.

30. A seed shall serve him; it shall be counted to the LORD for a generation.
31. They shall come and shall declare his justice to a people to be born, that he has

accomplished it.

The Internal Sense

Of the state of the LORD'S passion. A prayer to the FATHER that he may not he deserted,
verses 1 to 5, 8, 11; that he is despised above all men, verses 6, 7; that he is His by 
conception, verses 9, 10; that they who are of the church where the Word is have 
condemned him to death, verses 12 to 15; and crucified him, verses 16, 17; that they 
have divided his garments, or dispersed the Truths of his Word, verse 18; a prayer that
he may not be deserted, verses 19, 20, 21; that thence the church will be established, 
verses 22, 23, 25; which he sustained through the power of his Divine principle, verse 
24; that thereby there will be a church, which will be gathered from all parts, and will 
worship him, verses 26 to 31.

EXPOSITION

Verses 9, 10. You are he that look me out of the womb; you did make me hope on my 
mother's breasts, I have been cast upon you from my mother's belly, you are my GOD. 
The regeneration of the spiritual man is here described by such things as relate to 
natural generation from the mother; hence by the words, you are he that took me out 
of the womb, is signified that by the LORD he is regenerated and made a man of the 
church; by making me to hope from my mother's breasts, is signified that he was 
afterwards led, and spiritually educated, the breasts of the mother signifying such 
things as regard spiritual nourishment in what relates to the church; the mother is the 
church; by being cast upon you from the womb, is signified that the LORD operated all 
things from the good of love; and by you are my GOD from my mother's belly, is 
signified that He operated all things by truths, for, as was said above, the womb is 
predicated of the good of love, and the belly of the truths from that good; hence it is 
said, you are my GOD, for where the good of love is treated of, the LORD is called 
JEHOVAH, and where truths are treated of, he is called GOD. AE 710.

Verses 14, 17, 18. All my bones are out of joint; my heart is like wax, I can number all
my bones; they part my garments amongst them, and cast lots on my clothing. These 
Words relate to the LORD'S temptations as to Divine Truths, which were the LORD'S 
proprium [selfhood], and hence are called my bones, and as to Divine Good which 
was the LORD'S proprium, and hence is called my heart; that heart denotes good, see 
AC 3813, 3635, and whereas bones signify these truths, to number which is to desire 
to dissipate them by reasonings and false principles, therefore also it immediately 
follows, that they divided his garments and cast lots upon his clothing, for garments 
also denote Truths, but of an exterior order. AC 3812.

Verses 16, 20. Dogs have compassed me about, the assembly of the wicked have 
enclosed me, they have pierced my hands and my feet, deliver my soul from the sword,
my only one from the hand of the dog. Dogs here denote those who destroy the goods 
of faith, who on that account are called the assembly, of the wicked; to deliver the soul

94

from the sword, denotes from the false principle vastating the truth of faith; that sword
is the false principle vastating the truth of faith, see AC 2799, 4499, 6353, 7102, 8294;
and that soul is the life of faith, AC 9050; hence also it is evident, that to deliver my 
only one from the hand of the dog denotes from the false principle vastating the good 
of faith. That good falsified and thereby made unclean is signified by dogs, is also 
evident in Matthew, "Give not that which is holy to dogs, neither cast your pearls 
before swine," Matt 7:6. The reason why dogs signify those who render the good of 
faith unclean by falsifications is because dogs eat unclean things, and also bark at and 
bite men. AC 9231.

Verse 18. They part my garments amongst them, and cast lots upon my clothing. Thus 
it is written in David, and in Matthew, "They divided his garments, casting lots, that it
might be fulfilled what was said by the prophet," Matt 27:35; also in John, "The 
soldiers took the garments, and made four parts; and the coat; the coat was without 
seam, woven from the top throughout; they said concerning it, let us not divide it, but 
let us cast lots for it whose it shall be, that the Scripture might be fulfilled," John 
19:23, 24. He who reads these Words, and knows nothing of the internal sense of the 
Word, is not aware that any arcanum lies concealed in them, when yet in singular the 
words there is a Divine Arcanum. The arcanum was, that, Divine Truths wore 
dissipated by the Jews; for the LORD was Divine Truth, whence He is called the Word,
John 1:1. and following verses: the WORD is Divine Truth; his garments represented 
Truths in the external form, and his coat [or clothing] Truths in the internal form; the 
division of the garments represented the dissipation of the Truths of Faith by the Jews;
that garments denote Truths in the external form, see AC 2576, 5248, 5954, 6918; and
that a coat [or clothing] denotes Truth in the internal form, see AC 4677; Truths in the 
external form are such as are Truths of the Word in the literal sense; but Truths in the 
internal form are such as are the Truths of the Word in the spiritual sense; the division 
of the garments into four parts signified total dissipation, in like manner as the 
division in Zechariah 14:4. and in other places; in like manner division into two parts, 
as is written concerning the veil of the temple, Matt 27:51; Mark 15:28; the rending 
of the rocks also on that occasion, Matt 27:52, represented the dissipation of all things 
of faith, for a rock denotes the LORD as to faith, and hence denotes faith from the 
LORD. AC 9093; see also AE 195.

Verse 21. Save me from the lion's mouth, and answer me from the horns of the 
unicorn. By horns are signified the power of Truth which is grounded in good, and in 
an opposite sense the power of the false principle which is grounded in evil. Divine 
Truths are here called the horns of the unicorn by reason of their height; hence 
mention is so often made of the horn being exalted, for exaltation signifies power 
from an interior principle. AC 2832.

By a lion is signified the false principle with great might destroying Truths; and by 
the horns of the unicorn are signified Truths which prevail against falsities. AE 316.

Verse 23. You that fear JEHOVAH praise him; all you seed of Jacob glorify him; stand 
in awe of him all you seed of Israel. In many passages in the Word mention is made of
fearing JEHOVAH GOD, and by it is meant to worship, wherefore it shall be briefly said 
what is specifically meant by fearing GOD; all worship of JEHOVAH GOD must be from 
the love of good by truths; worship from the good of love alone is not worship, 
neither is that worship which is from truths alone without the good of love; there must

95

be both, for the good of love is the essential principle of worship; but good exists and 
in formed by truths, hence all worship must be by truths grounded in good. AE 696.

Verse 23. Stand in awe of him all you seed of Israel. By the seed of Israel is meant the
spiritual church, for seed in the literal sense signifies posterity, but in the internal 
sense Faith, and since, as has been frequently said, there is no Faith unless where 
there is charity, therefore it is charity itself which is meant by seed in the internal 
sense. AC 1025.

Verse 24. For he has not despised nor abhorred the affliction of the afflicted, neither 
has he hid his faces from him, and when he cried to him he heard him. It is said in 
many passages of the Word, that JEHOVAH, that is, the LORD, conceals and hides his 
faces on account of iniquities and sins, and that he is entreated not to conceal and 
hide, when yet he never in any case conceals and hides, namely: his Divine Good and 
Divine Truth, for the LORD is Divine love itself, and mercy itself, and wills the 
salvation of all, wherefore he is present with all and every one, even with those who 
are in iniquities and sins, by which presence he gives them the liberty of receiving 
him, that is. Truth and Good from Him, wherefore if they freely will it, they also 
receive. The reason why it must be done freely is, that goods and truths may remain 
with man, and may appertain to him as his; for what a man does from freedom, this he
does from affection, since all freedom is of the affection; affection also is his will, 
wherefore what is received in freedom, or from affection, this enters the man's will 
and remains; the reason why it then remains is because the will is the man himself; for
in it primarily resides his life, but in thought and understanding secondarily. This 
therefore is the reason why man ought to receive Divine Good and Divine Truth, with 
which the Lord is always present: this also is meant by the words, "Behold, I stand at 
the door and knock; if anyone hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to 
him, and dine with him, and he with me," Rev 3:20. But when man from freedom 
chooses evil, he then shuts the door against himself, and thus does not admit the good 
and truth which is from the LORD; wherefore the LORD in such case appears as absent: 
from this appearance it is that it is said, that JEHOVAH conceals and hides his faces, 
although he does not conceal and hide: moreover, man in such case, as to his spirit, 
turns himself away from the LORD, whence also he does not perceive the good, nor 
see the truth which is from the Lord, the consequence is, that it also appears as if the 
LORD does not see him, when yet he sees all and every thing belonging to him; from 
this appearance it also is, that the LORD is said to conceal and hide his faces, yea, that 
he is said to set his faces against the wicked. AE 412.

Verses 27, 28. All the ends of the earth shall remember and turn to JEHOVAH, and all 
the families of the nations shall worship before him, for the kingdom is JEHOVAH'S and
he is the governor among the nations; and in Isaiah, "All the nations shall see your 
justice, and all things your glory," Isaiah 62:2. In these passages no mention is made 
of nations and people, but of nations and kings, because by kings the like is signified 
as by people, namely: those who are in truths, see AC 31; and whereas by nations are 
signified those who are in good, and by kings those who are in truths, therefore it is 
said of the nations, that they shall see your justice, and of kings that they shall see 
your glory, justice in the Word being predicated of Good, and glory of Truth. AE 331. 
See also AC 126.

96

Verse 29. All they that go down to the dust shall kneel before him, and he that cannot 
keep his soul alive. That dust signifies what is damned and infernal, is manifest from 
what has been said of the serpent, of whom, because he was cursed, it is said that he 
should eat dust, besides what is there shown concerning the signification of dust, it is 
allowed to add what is written in David, "All they that go down to the dust shall kneel
before JEHOVAH, and he that cannot keep his soul alive;" Psalm 22:29; and in another 
place, "You hide your faces, they are troubled; you gather their spirit, they expire, and 
return to their dust," Psalm 104:24, which means that when they turn themselves away
from the face of the LORD, they expire or die, and thus return to dust, that is, become 
damned and infernal. AC 278.

Verse 30. A seed shall serve him; it shall be counted to the LORD for a generation. The
LORD is here treated of; and by the seed which shall serve him, are meant those who 
are in the truths of doctrine from the Word; and being counted to the LORD for a 
generation is signified that they shall be his to eternity, to be counted signifying to be 
placed in order and arranged; in this case, to be numbered to, or added to, thus to be 
his. AE 708.

97

PSALM 23

A Psalm of David.

JEHOVAH is my shepherd, I shall not want.

1.
2. He makes me lie down in green pastures; he leads me to the waters of rest.
3. He restores my soul; he leads me in the paths of justice, for his name's sake.
4. Yea, though I walk in the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for 

you are with me; your rod and your staff they comfort me.

5. You prepare a table before me in the presence of mine enemies; you anoint my

head with oil; my cup runs over.

6. Surely goodness and mercy will follow me all the days of my life; and I shall 

dwell in the house of JEHOVAH for ever.

The Internal Sense

Concerning the LORD, that he teaches and leads to the truths and goods of heaven and 
the church, verses 1 to 3; thence there is no fear of the hells, because he preserves and 
gives good and truth in abundance, verses 4, 5; in heaven with the LORD to eternity, 
verse 6.

EXPOSITION

Verse 1, 2, 5. JEHOVAH is my shepherd I shall not want; he makes me lie down in 
green pastures; he leads me to waters of rest; he prepares before me a table in the 
presence of mine enemies; you make fat my head with oil; my cup runs over. By these 
words in the internal sense is meant, that whoever trusts in the LORD, is led into all the
goods and truths of heaven, and abounds in their delights; by my shepherd is meant 
the LORD; by pastures of herb are signified the knowledges of truth and good; by 
waters of rest are signified the truths of heaven thence derived; by a table is signified 
spiritual nourishment; by making fat the head with oil, is signified the wisdom which 
is from good; by my cup runs over, is signified the intelligence which is from truths; 
for by cup the like is signified as by wine. Mention is made of pastures of herb and 
waters of rest, as if they were comparisons, by reason of the LORD being called a 
shepherd, and the flock of a shepherd is led into pastures of herb, and to clear waters, 
but still they are correspondences. AE 375. See also AC 3120.

Verse 2. He makes me lie down in green pastures. From this passage it is evident that 
by lying down is signified a state of peace and tranquillity, and that by lying down in 
the present passage is signified tranquillity of state, for place in the internal sense is 
state. AC 3696.

Verse 4, 5. Yea, though I walk in the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, 
for you are with me; your rod and your staff they comfort me; you prepare a table 
before me in the presence of mine enemies; you make fat my head with oil; my cup 
runs over. To walk in the valley of the shadow of death, in a spiritual sense, signifies 
an obscure understanding, to which truths do not appear from light; your rod and your

98

staff shall comfort me, signifies that Divine Truth spiritual together with Divine Truth 
natural will protect, because they have power; a rod is Divine Truth spiritual, a staff 
Divine Truth natural, both together as to the power of protecting, for to comfort is to 
protect: inasmuch as a rod and a staff signify Divine Truth as to power, it, therefore 
follows, you prepare a table before me, you make fat my head with oil, and my cup 
runs over, by which words is signified spiritual nourishment by Divine Truth, for by 
preparing a table is signified to nourish spiritually, by making fat the head with oil is 
signified by the good of love, and by the cup running over is signified the Truth of 
Doctrine from the Word. AE 726.

Verse 6. I shall dwelt in the house of JEHOVAH for length of days. Length, when 
applied to time, signifies what is perpetual and eternal, as length of days, Psalm 23:6. 
but when applied to space signifies what is holy. AC 650. Verse 6. Length of days. The
prolongation of days upon the earth does not signify a lengthening of the days of life 
in the world, but the state of the life in the church, consequently in heaven; for to be 
prolonged is predicated of good and its augmentation, and days signify the state of the
life. AE 304.

THE TRANSLATOR'S NOTES AND OBSERVATIONS

The attentive reader will not fail to remark, in the foregoing Psalm, an evident 
allusion to that DIVINE and HEAVENLY MARRIAGE of the GOOD and the TRUE, which 
has so frequently been above noted, as constituting a striking proof of the Divine 
inspiration of the sacred writings. For when he reads at verse 2. of lying down in 
green pastures, and of being led to the watery of rest, and at verse 5, of the head 
being made fat with oil, and of the cup running over, he will want no one to instruct 
him, that to lie down in green pastures, and to have the head made fat with oil, are 
expressions, which have more especial reference to the GOOD of Love and Charity, 
whilst being led to the waters of rest, and having the cup running over, have a similar 
reference to the TRUTH of wisdom and intelligence, and that all the expressions united 
point manifestly at the above DIVINE AND HEAVENLY MARRIAGE, and thus demonstrate
the DIVINE ORIGIN of the Holy Record which contains them.

99

PSALM 24

A Psalm of David.

1. The earth is JEHOVAH'S, and the fullness thereof; the world and they that dwell 

therein.

2. For he has founded it on the seas, and established it on the rivers.
3. Who shall ascend the mountain of JEHOVAH, and who shall stand in the place 

of his Holiness?

4. He that has clean hands and a pure heart; who has not lifted up his soul to 

vanity, nor sworn deceitfully.

5. He shall receive a blessing from JEHOVAH, and justice from the GOD of his 

salvation.

6. This is the generation of them that seek Him, that seek your face, O Jacob. 

Selah.

7. Lift up your heads, O you gates! and be you lifted up you everlasting doors! 

and the king of glory shall come in.

8. Who is this king of glory? JEHOVAH strong and mighty, JEHOVAH mighty in 

battle.

9. Lift up your heads, O you gates! yea, lift them up you everlasting doors! and 

the king of glory shall come in.

10. Who is this king of glory? JEHOVAH of Hosts, he is the king of glory. Selah.

The Internal Sense

Concerning the church, which is from the LORD through the Word, verses 1 to 3; that 
they will be in it, who are not in falsities and evils, verses 4, 5, 6; that they will 
receive the LORD who overcame the hells and glorified his humanity, verses 7 to 10.

EXPOSITION

There is a speech of good spirits, and of angelic spirits, composed of several speaking 
at the same time, particularly in circling companies or choirs; concerning which by 
the Divine mercy of the LORD more will be said elsewhere. The speech of those who 
discourse in choirs has often been heard by me: it flows with a sort of rythmical 
cadence. In speaking they do not at all think either of words or ideas; their meaning 
flows into those spontaneously: and no words or ideas flow into the discourse which 
multiply the sense, or divert it to any thing else, or to which there adheres any thing 
artificial, or which seems to themselves elegant as proceeding from self, or from self-
love; for this would immediately create confusion. They do not fix their attention 
upon any word; they think only of the sense; and the words follow spontaneously 
upon the sense. The closes fall upon expressions implying unity, for the most part 
simple unity, but when upon an expression implying compound unity, they glide on, 
by an accent, to the following clause. The reason of these peculiarities is because they 
think and speak in society, and hence the form of discourse has a cadence, according 
to the connection and unanimity of the society. Such in old time was the form of 
canticles; and such is that of the Psalms of David. AC 1648.

100

Verses 1, 2. The earth is JEHOVAH'S, and the fullness thereof, the world and they that 
dwell therein; for he has founded it upon the seas, and established it on the rivers, 
Fullness here denotes truth and good; earth denotes the church in a specific sense; 
world denotes the church in a universal sense; JEHOVAH founding the world upon the 
seas, denotes on those things which are of science, AC 28; and founding it upon 
rivers, denotes on those things which are of intelligence, AC 3051; that it is not meant
that JEHOVAH founded the world upon the seas, and established it on the rivers, who 
cannot see, for the world is not founded and established on them; wherefore every 
considerate person may see, that by seas and by rivers, something else is signified and
that this something else is spiritual, or the internal principle of the Word. AC 697; see 
also AC 9755.

The earth, and the world denote the church, and fullness denotes all things belonging 
to it; the seas on which he founded it are the knowledge of truth in general; rivers are 
doctrinals; inasmuch as the church is founded on the latter and the former, therefore it 
is said that he founded it on the seas, and established it on the rivers; that this cannot 
be said of the earth and the world, is obvious to every one. AE 304.

By the earth is here signified the church as to truth; its fullness signifies all truths in 
the complex, and by the world is signified the church as to good; they that dwell 
therein signify goods in the complex. AE 741.

By the world is signified heaven and the church in the whole complex; by seas are 
signified knowledges and sciences, which are the ultimates of the church, specifically 
the knowledges of truth and good, such as are in the sense of the letter of the Word; by
rivers is signified introduction by those knowledges to celestial intelligence; hence it 
may be manifest what is meant by the above words in the spiritual sense, namely: that
the interior things of heaven and the church, which are called celestial and spiritual, 
are founded on the knowledges of truth and good, which are in the sense of the letter 
of the Word, rationally understood: it is said that JEHOVAH founded the world on the 
seas, and established it on the rivers, because seas and rivers are in the boundaries of 
heaven, represented by the sea, Suph, the sea of the Philistines, the river Euphrates, 
and the river Jordan, which were the boundaries of the Land of Canaan; and since 
ultimates in the Word signify lowest things, it is said that JEHOVAH founded and 
established it, upon them. AE 518.

Verse 3. Who shall ascend the mountain of JEHOVAH, and who shall stand in the place
of his holiness? That the establishment of the Church is described by founding the 
earth and the world upon the seas, and establishing them upon the rivers, may be 
seen above; that the establishment of the Church is signified is evident from what 
follows, namely Who shall ascend the mountain of JEHOVAH, and who shall stand in 
the place of his holiness! for, by the mountain of JEHOVAH is meant Zion, by which is 
signified where the LORD reigns by divine truth; and by the place of his holiness is 
meant Jerusalem, where the temple was, by which is signified the Church as to 
doctrine: hence it is evident, that by the foundation of the world is meant the 
establishment of the Church. AE 2057.

Verse 8. Who is this King of Glory? The LORD is here called the King of Glory from 
the divine truth, from which he fought, conquered, and subdued the hells; hence it us, 
that he is called JEHOVAH mighty, and the hero of war. AC 10053.

101

Verse 5. He shall receive a blessing from JEHOVAH. For the proper signification of the 
term blessing see Exposition, Psalm 21:3, 5.

Verse 6. This is the generation. See Psalm 14:5, Exposition.

Verses 7, 9. Lift up your heads, O you gates! and he you lifted up, you everlasting 
doors, and the King of Glory shall come in. The everlasting doors being lifted up 
denotes the opening and elevation of hearts to the LORD, who is the King of Glory, and
thereby the giving communication, that is, that he may flow in with the good of 
charity and the truth of faith: the Lord is called the King of Glory from truth, which is 
derived from good. AC 8989.

Verse 4. Who has not lifted up his soul to vanity. See Psalm 4:2, Exposition.

Inasmuch, as was above said, by doors and gates is signified introduction, and 
specifically are signified the truths which introduce, which are truths grounded in 
good from the LORD, hence it is evident what is signified by doors and gales in this 
passage, "Lift up your heads, O you gates! and be you lifted up, you everlasting 
doors, and the King of Glory shall come in." AE 208.

THE TRANSLATOR'S NOTES AND OBSERVATIONS

Verse 5. He shall receive a blessing from JEHOVAH, and justice from the GOD of his 
salvation. The attentive reader will not fail to remark, in this passage, a reference to 
the marriage of the GOOD and the TRUE, so frequently referred to in the preceding 
Psalms, fits forming a characteristic proof of the divine inspiration of the Holy Word; 
JEHOVAH having more distinct relation to the principle of Divine Good, and GOD to 
the principle of Divine Truth. The same observation may be extended also to the sixth 
verse, where the principle of the Divine Good is again marked by Him who is sought, 
and the principle of the Divine True, by your faces, O Jacob.

Verse 6. This is the generation of them that seek him, that seek your faces, O Jacob. 
That by Jacob is represented the LORD, as to the DIVINE TRUE of the natural principle, 
see AC 4428, 4667, 6236.

Verse 7. Lift up your heads, O you gates! and be you lifted up, you everlasting doors. 
A singular distinction is here made between the gates and the doors, for it is said of 
the former, lift up your heads, and of the latter, be you lifted up, as if the former were 
to lift up their heads by some power of their own, whereas the latter were to be 
dependent for their elevation on the power of another. This distinction may, perhaps, 
be accounted for from the consideration, that the gates have more particular reference 
to the external man in his admission of divine truth, whereas the doors have more 
reference to the internal man in his admission of divine good, and in the former state 
man is led to suppose that his elevation is from some power of his own, whereas, in 
the latter, he is willing to acknowledge that it is from another.

Verses 8, 10. Who is this King of Glory? The two different answers here given to this 
question are striking illustrations of the truth of the heavenly doctrine of the New 
Jerusalem on the subject of redemption. For we are taught in that doctrine, that 
redemption consists in the two distinct acts of subduing the powers of darkness, and 

102

of glorifying the Lord's HUMANITY; and how forcibly is the first of these acts 
described by the first answer to the above question, JEHOVAH strong and mighty, 
JEHOVAH mighty in battle, whilst the second is described with equal force by the 
second answer, JEHOVAH of HOSTS, he is the King of Glory.

PSALM 25

A Psalm of David.

1. Unto you, O JEHOVAH, do I lift up my soul,
2. O my GOD, I trust in you, let me not be ashamed, let not mine enemies triumph

over me.

3. Yea, let none that hope in you be ashamed; let them be ashamed that act 

treacherously without a cause.

4. Cause me to know your ways, O JEHOVAH, teach me your paths.
5. Lead me in your truth, and teach me, for you are the God of my salvation; in 

you do I hope all the day.

6. Remember, O JEHOVAH, your mercies and your compassions, for they are from

eternity.

7. Remember not the sins of my youth, nor my transgressions; according to your 

mercy remember you me, for your goodness sake, O JEHOVAH.

8. Good and upright is JEHOVAH, therefore will he teach sinners in the way.
9. The afflicted will he guide in judgement, and the afflicted will he teach his 

way.

10. All the paths of JEHOVAH are mercy and truth to those who keep his covenant 

and his testimonies.

11. For your name's sake, O JEHOVAH, pardon mine iniquity, for it is great.
12. What man is he that fears JEHOVAH? Him shall he teach in the way he shall 

choose.

13. His soul shall abide in goodness, and his seed shall inherit the earth.
14. Communion with JEHOVAH have they that fear him, and his covenant makes he

known to them.

15. Mine eyes are continually towards JEHOVAH, for he shall pluck my feet out of 

the net.

16. Look upon me, and be merciful to me, for I am solitary and afflicted.
17. The troubles of my heart are enlarged; O bring you me out of my distresses.
18. Look upon mine affliction and my pain, and take away all my sin.
19. Consider mine enemies; for they are many, and they hate me with cruel hatred.
20. O keep my soul and deliver me; let me not be ashamed, for I have taken refuge

with you.

21. Let integrity and uprightness preserve me, for I have hoped in you.
22. Redeem Israel, O GOD, out of all his distresses.

The Internal Sense

The prayers of the church to the LORD, that they may he preserved from the hells, 
verses 1 to 3; that they may be instructed in truths, verses 4 to 6; that from mercy their
sins may be remitted, verses 7 to 11; thus they will have good and conjunction, verses 
12 to 14; a prayer of the church to the LORD, and in the supreme sense, of the LORD to 
the FATHER, that seeing he alone fights against the hells, he may be assisted, verses 15 
to 20; that he has integrity, verse 21; whence comes redemption, verse 22.

104

EXPOSITION

Verse 7. Remember not the sins of my youth, nor my transgressions. In the Word, evils
are sometimes called sins, sometimes iniquities, and sometimes transgressions but 
what is meant specifically by the latter and the former, is only made evident from the 
internal sense, those evils are called transgressions, which are done contrary to the 
truths of faith; those are called iniquities, which are done contrary to the goods of 
faith, and those sins, which are done contrary to the goods of charity and love; the two
former proceed from a perverted understanding, but the latter from a depraved will; as
in David, "Wash me from mine iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin; for I 
acknowledge my transgressions, and my sins are continually before you," Psalm 51:2,
3; iniquity denotes evil against the goods of faith, sin denotes evil against the goods of
charity and love, and transgression denotes evil against the truths of faith; inasmuch 
as this latter is evil proceeding from a perverse understanding, and is thus known from
the truths of faith, it is therefore said, I acknowledge my transgressions. Again, 
"Remember your mercies, JEHOVAH, and your compassions; remember not the sins of 
my youth and my transgressions," Psalm 25:6, 7; where sins denote evils derived from
a depraved will, and transgressions denote evils derived from a perverse 
understanding. AC 9156.

Verse 7. Remember not the sins of my youth. In the Word it is said of JEHOVAH, that is,
of the LORD, that he remembers, and that he does not remember, and by it is signified 
that in such case it is done of mercy, whether it be preservation or deliverance; in like 
manner as that he sees, hears, knows, and that he does not see, does not hear, and does
not know, by which expressions also are signified compassions and non-compassions;
the reason why it is so expressed is grounded in what passes in a similar way with 
man, and in appearance; for. when man averts himself from the LORD, as is the case 
when he does evil, then, because the LORD is to his back, it appears to him as if the 
LORD did not see him, did not hear and know him, neither remember him, when yet 
this is what appertains to the man, and hence from appearance it is so expressed in the
Word; but the case is changed when man turns himself to the LORD, as he does when 
he does well: every one may know that recollection or remembrance cannot he 
predicated of the LORD, inasmuch as things past and future in him are eternal, that is, 
are present from eternity to eternity. That to remember, when concerning the LORD, 
denotes to have compassion, and thus to preserve or deliver from a principle of mercy 
is manifest from the following passages, "JEHOVAH has remembered us in our 
humility, because his mercy is for ever," Psalm 136:23. Again, "Remember not the 
sins of my youth, nor my transgressions, according to your mercy remember you me, 
because of your goodness, O JEHOVAH," Psalm 25:7. AC 9849.

Verse 10. All the paths of JEHOVAH are mercy and truth to those who keep his 
covenant. Doing mercy denotes the good of love, because all mercy is of love, for he 
who is principled in love or charity, is also principled in mercy; and in this case love 
and charity with him become mercy, when a neighbour is in want or misery, and in 
that state he affords him help; hence it is that by mercy is signified the good of love. 
Truth denotes the truth of faith, because all truth is of faith, on which account also, in 
the original tongue, faith is signified by the same expression. Inasmuch as the good of
love and the truth of faith are in the closest conjunction, and the one is not given 
without the other, therefore, those two principles are frequently in the Word spoken of

105

conjointly, as in David, "All the paths of JEHOVAH are mercy and truth to those who 
keep his covenant," Psalm 25:10. AC 6180.

The Word is the Divine Truth revealed from the LORD, and inasmuch as by it the LORD
conjoins himself with the man of the church, therefore also it is the book of a 
covenant, because a covenant denotes conjunction. AC 9396.

Verse 12. What man is he that fears JEHOVAH? Him shall he teach in the way that he 
shall choose. What is signi-fied in the Word by fearing God, may appear from very 
many passages therein understood as to the internal sense; the fear of God, as used in 
the Word, signifies worship, and indeed worship either grounded in fear, or in the 
good of faith, or in the good of love; worship grounded in fear, when the subject 
treated of is concerning the unregenerate; worship grounded in the good of faith, 
when the subject treated of is concerning the spiritual regenerate; and worship 
grounded in the good of love, when the subject treated of is concerning the celestial 
regenerate. In the above passage the fear of JEHOVAH is spoken of the spiritual man, as
is evident from this consideration, that it is said, he shall teach him in the way, for that
way is Truth, may be seen, AC 627. 2333. AC 2826.

Verse 22. Redeem Israel, O GOD, out of all his distresses. To redeem Israel from his 
distresses here denotes to deliver those who are of the church from the falsities which 
distress. AE 328. See also in this number what is properly meant by redemption; that 
it consists in deliverance from hell, conjunction with the LORD, and salvation, and that
it is not therefore to be confounded with the passion of the cross, which was the last 
temptation by which the LORD subdued the powers of darkness, and at the same time 
glorified his HUMANITY, or united it with his DIVINITY, and thus gave the penitent 
continual access to himself.

THE TRANSLATOR'S NOTES AND OBSERVATIONS

Verse 4. Cause me to know your ways, O JEHOVAH, teach me your paths. A distinction
is here made between ways and paths, and though our enlightened Expositor has not 
told us what this distinction is, yet there can be little difficulty in discovering it, if it 
be considered, that paths are more particular ways, and that ways are more general 
paths. Supposing then that ways and paths are significative of Truths, it will then be 
seen clearly, that ways are figurative of general Truths, and paths of particular ones. 
Thus a way may be expressive of a general Truth, such as you shall not commit 
murder, or you shall not steal, whilst paths may be expressive of all the particular 
ideas which enter into the notion of murder and of theft.

Verses 17, 18. The troubles of my heart are enlarged, O bring you me out of my 
distresses; look upon mine affliction and my pain, and take away all my sin. There is 
every reason to believe, that in the original Hebrew all these four terms, namely: 
troubles, distresses, affliction and pain, have a definite meaning, being intended to 
express some species of sorrow manifesting itself in some distinct region of the 
human mind, whether it be the will, the understanding, the operation, or all united. It 
is to be lamented that in our English language the terms expressive of sorrow are not 
so definite in their meaning, so that in the application of the above four terms we use 
them promiscuously, without any regard to their peculiar meaning, as applied to the 
sorrow of any one region of the mind more than of another. The case is the same in 

106

regard to our expressions of joy, which we thus use indiscriminately, making no 
internal distinction between a delight, a gratification, a pleasure, a satisfaction, etc. 
Yet it is plain that in the Book of revealed Wisdom, called the WORD OF GOD, we meet
with no such confusion of terms, but expressions are applied which determine at once 
to what region of the mind both our joys and our sorrows belong. Thus we read 
perpetually of joy and gladness, one expression being intended to denote a 
gratification of the will in its reception of the good of love and charity, and the other 
being intended to express the gratification of the understanding in its reception of the 
Truth of heavenly wisdom. JESUS CHRIST too makes a similar distinction respecting 
our sorrows, when he says to his disciples, "You shall weep and lament, but the world 
shall rejoice, and you shall be sorrowful, but your sorrow shall be turned into joy," 
John 16:20. where it must be plain to every serious reader, that by weeping, 
lamenting, and being sorrowful, the DIVINE SPEAKER meant to express distinct degrees
of sorrow, as manifested in the distinct degrees of the human mind.

107

PSALM 26

A Psalm of David.

1. Judge me, O JEHOVAH, for I have walked in mine integrity, and in JEHOVAH 

have I trusted; I shall not slide.

2. Prove me, O JEHOVAH, and try me; explore my reins and my heart.
3. For your mercy is before mine eyes, and I have walked in your truth.
4.
I have not sat with lying men, neither have I gone with dissemblers.
5. For I have hated the assembly of evil doers, and will not sit with the wicked.
6.
I will wash my hands in innocence; and will compass your altar, O JEHOVAH.
7. That I may publish with the voice of thanksgiving, and recount all your 

8.

wondrous works.
JEHOVAH, I love the habitation of your house, and the place of the tabernacle 
of your glory.

9. Gather not my soul with sinners, nor my life with men of blood;
10. In whose hands is mischief, and their right hand is full of bribes.
11. But I walk in mine integrity; redeem me, and be merciful to me.
12. My foot stands in an even place; in the congregations will I bless JEHOVAH.

The Internal Sense

That the LORD has integrity, purity, and innocence, verses 1 to 6, 11; that he has the 
divine love of saving, verses 7, 8; that he is in combat with the wicked, verses 9, 10; 
that redemption comes when he conquers, verses 11, 12.

Exposition

Verse 2. Prove me, O JEHOVAH, and try me, explore my reins, and my heart. Inasmuch 
as truths are separated from falsities, and goods from evils, by temptations, therefore 
it is here said, try me. AE 167.

Verse 8. JEHOVAH, I love the habitation of your house. Habitation signifies heaven, 
where the LORD is; it also signifies the good of love and faith, for these constitute 
heaven; and whereas all good is from the LORD, and heaven is called heaven from 
love and faith in the LORD; hence, also, habitation, in the supreme sense, signifies the 
LORD, as is evident from Isaiah 63:15, Psalm 26:8, and in other places; hence it is 
manifest, that the tabernacle was called the sanctuary and habitation of JEHOVAH from
this ground, that things above mentioned were representative. AC 9481.

Verses 6, 7. I will wash my hands in innocence, and will compass your altar, O 
JEHOVAH, that I may publish with the voice of thanksgiving, etc. To wash the hands in 
innocence, signifies to be purified from evils and falsities; to compass your altar, O 
JEHOVAH, signifies conjunction with the Lord by worship, grounded in the good of 
love, which worship, since it is performed by truths derived from good, therefore it is 
added, that I may publish with the voice of thanksgiving, etc. AE 1391.

108

Verse 2. Explore my reins (kidneys), and my heart. To search and to prove the kidneys,
denotes to explore the truths of faith; and to search and prove the heart, denotes, to 
explore the goods of love, for the heart denotes the good of love, and the truths of 
faith are signified by the kidneys. AC 10032.

Innocence is the very essential principle of love and charity, consequently of good, 
and consists in knowing, acknowledging, and believing, not with the mouth, but with 
the heart, that nothing but evil is from self, and that all good is from the LORD; when 
man is in this confession of faith from the heart, then the LORD flows in with good and
truth, and insinuates into him a celestial proprium, which is bright and shining; it is 
impossible for any one to be in true humiliation, unless he be in this 
acknowledgement and faith from the heart, for in this case he is in self-annihilation, 
yea, in self-aversion, and thereby in absence from himself, and thus in a state of 
receiving the divine principle of the LORD; hence it is, that the LORD with good flows 
in into an humble and contrite heart. AC 3994; see also AC 3183, 3519, 5608.

All the rites of the ancient Church were representative of the LORD, as were also the 
rites of the Jewish Church; but the principal representative afterwards was the altar, 
also the burnt-offering, which, being made of clean beasts and clean birds, 
represented, as it signified the clean beasts, the goods of charity, and the clean birds, 
the truths of faith. AC 921. See also AC 1298, 2777, 2814, 2832.

109

PSALM 27

A Psalm of David.

1.

JEHOVAH is my light and my salvation, whom shall I fear? JEHOVAH is the 
strength of my life, of whom shall I be afraid?

2. When the wicked, even mine enemies and my foes, came upon me to eat up 

3.

my flesh, they stumbled and fell.
If a host encamp against me, my heart shall not fear; when war shall rise 
against me, in this will I be confident.

4. One thing have I asked of JEHOVAH, that will I earnestly seek; that I may dwell

in the house of JEHOVAH all the days of my life, to behold the beauty of 
JEHOVAH, and to inquire in his temple.

5. For he will hide me in his tabernacle in the day of evil; he will conceal me in 

the secret place of his tent; he will set me high upon a rock.

6. And now shall my head be lifted up above mine enemies round about me; and 

I will offer in his tabernacle sacrifices of shouting; I will sing hymns to 
JEHOVAH.

7. Hear my voice, O JEHOVAH; I will cry, be merciful to me, and answer me.
8. Unto you, my heart, Jehovah has said, Seek my face; your face, O JEHOVAH, 

will I seek.

9. Hide not your face from me; put not away your servant in anger; you have 
been my help; leave me not, neither forsake me, O GOD of my salvation.
10. For my father and my mother have forsaken me, but JEHOVAH will gather me.
11. Teach me your way, O JEHOVAH, and lead me in the path of rectitude because 

of mine enemies.

12. Deliver me not over to the lust of mine enemies; for false witnesses are risen 

up against me, and such as breathe violence;

13. Nevertheless, I firmly believe I shall see the goodness of JEHOVAH in the land 

of the living.

14. Hope in JEHOVAH, be of good courage, and he shall strengthen your heart; yea,

hope you in JEHOVAH.

The Internal Sense

The LORD'S discourse with the FATHER, that he is not afraid of the hells which fight 
against him, verses 1 to 3; of his union with the FATHER, verses 4 to 10, 13, 14; that 
thereby he will subdue the hells, verses 11, 12.

EXPOSITION

Verse 3. If a host encamp against me. Army signifies truths and goods; see AC 3348; 
and truths and goods are arranged by the LORD according to heavenly order; hence, 
arrangement according to order is the encamping of an army, and the heavenly order 
itself, which is heaven, is the camp; this camp, or this order, is such that it cannot 
possibly be broken into by hell, although hell is in a continual endeavour to break into
it; hence also that order or heaven is called a camp, and the truths and goods, that is, 

110

the angels, who are arranged according to that order, are called armies. Inasmuch as 
several expressions in the Word have an opposite sense, so also has camp, and, 
according to such sense, signifies evils and falsities, consequently hell, as in David, 
"If a host encamp against me, my heart shall not fear, Psalm 27:3. AC 4236.

Verses 4, 5. One thing have I asked of JEHOVAH, that will I earnestly seek, that I may 
dwell in the house of JEHOVAH all the days of my life, to behold the beauty of 
JEHOVAH, and to enquire in his temple; for he will, hide me in his tabernacle in the 
day of evil; he will conceal me in the secret place of his tent; he will set me high upon 
a rock. Mention is here made of the house of JEHOVAH, of his temple, tent, and 
tabernacle, and by the house, of JEHOVAH is signified the church which is in the good 
of love to the LORD, by the temple the church which is in truths grounded in that good;
by the tent of JEHOVAH is signified Divine Truth, and by the tabernacle Divine Good; 
hence it is evident that by dwelling in the house of JEHOVAH all the days of my life is 
not meant to dwell in the house of JEHOVAH, but in the good of love to the LORD, and 
that by visiting in the morning the temple of JEHOVAH is not meant to visit it every 
morning, but to enquire after and seek the truths of that good; hence by hiding in the 
tent is signified to keep in Divine Truth, and to be protected from falsities, and by 
being concealed in the secret place of the tabernacle is signified to keep in Divine 
good, and to be protected from evils; by being set up high on a rock is signified to 
instruct in the interior truths. AE 799.

In the supreme sense the LORD, as to his Human Essence, is the tent, the tabernacle, 
and the temple. AC 414.

Verse 6. I will offer in his tabernacle the sacrifices of shouting. In the Word mention 
is made of various instruments, and each of them has its distinct signification, of 
which, by the Divine mercy of the LORD, we shall speak in their proper places. At the 
present we shall confine ourselves to what is said in David, "I will sacrifice in the 
tabernacle of JEHOVAH the sacrifices of shouting," where by the tabernacle is meant 
the celestial principle, and by shouting, singing, and chanting is expressed the 
spiritual principle thence derived. AC 420.

Verse 9. Hide not your face from me; put not away your servant in anger. From the 
above explications it may be known what the face of JEHOVAH, or the LORD, signifies 
namely: the Divine love, and every good in heaven and the church thence derived; 
hence also may be known what is signified by hiding or concealing the face, where 
JEHOVAH or the LORD is treated of, namely: that it is to leave man in his own 
proprium, and thence in evils and falsities which gush out from the proprium. For 
man, viewed in himself, is nothing but evil and the falsities thence derived, and is 
withheld from them by the LORD that he may be in good, which is effected by an 
elevation from the proprium. Hence it may be manifest that by hiding and concealing 
the face, when it relates to the LORD, is signified to leave man in evils and falsities, as 
in the following passages, "On account of all their wickedness I have concealed my 
faces from this city," Jeremiah 33:5: and in Isaiah, "Your sins have hid the faces of 
GOD from you, that he did not hear," Is 59:2; and in David, "Hide not your faces from 
me, put not away your servant in anger," Psalm xxvii. AE 412.

Verse 10. For my father and mother have forsaken me, and JEHOVAH will gather me. 
Father and mother here denote good and truth, which are said to have forsaken, when 

111

man observes that of himself he is not able to do any thing good, or to know any thing
true; that it is not to be understood as if David was forsaken by his father and mother 
is manifest. AC 3703.

Verse 13. I nevertheless firmly believe I shall see the goodness of JEHOVAH in the land
of the living. Inasmuch as death signifies damnation and hell, hence life on the other 
hand signifies salvation and heaven, as in Matthew, "Strait is the gate and narrow is 
the way that leads to life," Matt 7:14: again, "If you will enter into life, keep the 
commandments," Matt 19:17. Hence it is that salvation is called eternal life, as in 
Matthew 19:24; Mark 10:24; 30; Luke 10:25; and that heaven is called the land of the
living, as in David, "JEHOVAH, you are my confidence, my portion in the land of the 
living," Psalm 142:5; again, "That you may see the goodness of JEHOVAH in the land 
of the living." AE 186.

THE TRANSLATOR'S NOTES AND OBSERVATIONS

Verse 1. JEHOVAH is my light and my salvation, whom shall I fear? JEHOVAH is the 
strength of my life, of whom shall I be afraid? In the original Hebrew two distinct 
terms are used to express what is here rendered I fear and shall be afraid, and hence 
we may safely conclude that two distinct ideas were intended to be suggested. It is not
easy to say what these two distinct ideas are, but it appears most probable, from the 
proper sense of the two Hebrew terms which are here rendered I fear and am afraid, 
that the former term has more respect to fear, as an internal principle manifesting 
itself in the human heart, and the latter term has relation to the external effect of that 
fear in causing symptoms of outward trembling and agitation.

Verse 2. When the wicked, even mine enemies and my foes, came upon me to eat my 
flesh, they stumbled and fell. The wicked are here called enemies and foes, probably 
for the purpose of expressing their two fold opposition to the DIVINE GOOD and the 
DIVINE TRUTH, and thus their two fold purpose of destroying in man both the love of 
good, and the understanding of truth, which is to eat up his flesh.

Verse 6. I will offer in his tabernacle the sacrifices of shouting. In the received 
English version of the Psalms, what is here rendered shouting is expressed by the 
term joy, but in the original Hebrew the term is derived from a root expressive of the 
elevation of the voice in the way of shouting, and accordingly it follows, "I will sing a
hymn to JEHOVAH."

Verse 11. Teach me your way, O JEHOVAH, and lead me in the path of rectitude. For 
the distinct meaning of the two terms way and path, see the Translator's notes and 
observations on Psalm xxv.

112

PSALM 28

A Psalm of David.

1. Unto you, O JEHOVAH will I cry; O my rock, turn not away in silence from me,

lest, if you be silent I become like them that go down into the pit.

2. Hear the voice of my supplications, when I cry to you; when I lift up my hands

towards the oracle of your holiness.

3. Draw me not away with the wicked, and with the workers of iniquity, who 

speak peace with their fellows, but evil is in their hearts.

4. Give them according to their deeds, and according to the wickedness of their 
doings; give them according to the work of their hands; render to them their 
reward.

5. Because they consider not the works of JEHOVAH, nor the operation of his 

hands, he will destroy them, and not build them up. 

6. Blessed be JEHOVAH, because he has heard the voice of my supplications.
JEHOVAH is my strength and my shield; my heart trusts in him, and I am 
7.
helped; therefore my heart greatly rejoices, and with my song will I praise 
him.
JEHOVAH is their strength, and he is the saving strength of his anointed.

8.
9. Save your people, and bless your inheritance; feed them, and uphold them for 

ever.

The Internal Sense

A prayer of the LORD to the FATHER, that hypocrites may be subdued, verses 1 to 4; 
that he would assist, and he shall prevail, verses 6 to 8; that they who are in the truths 
and goods of the church may be saved, verse 9.

EXPOSITION

Verse 1. Unto you, O JEHOVAH do I cry, O my rock, turn not away in silence from me, 
lest, if you be silent to me, etc. Mention is here made of JEHOVAH and a rock, because 
by JEHOVAH is meant the LORD as to the DIVINE Good, and by rock, the Lord as to 
DIVINE TRUTH, and since both the latter and the former are meant, therefore also it is 
here said, turn not away in silence from me, lest if you be silent to me, for one has 
relation to the DIVINE GOOD, and the other to the DIVINE TRUTH, since in every part of 
the Word there is a Heavenly Marriage, which is the marriage of GOOD and TRUTH. 
AE 411.

Verse 7. Therefore my heart greatly rejoices, and with my song will I praise him. The 
reason why singing a song signifies confession from joy of heart is because joy of 
heart expresses itself by singing, when it is in its fullness, for when the heart is full of 
joy, and thence also the thought, it then pours itself forth by a song, the joy of heart 
itself by the sound of the song, and the consequent joy of the thought by singing; the 
quality of the joy of the thought by the words of the song conformable and agreeable 
to the subject which is in the thought from the heart, and the quality of the joy of the 

113

heart by the harmony, and the quantity of its joy by the elevation of the sound and in it
of the words, all those things flow as it were spontaneously from the joy itself, and 
this by reason that all heaven is formed according to the affections of good and truth; 
the highest heaven according to the affections of good, and the middle heaven 
according to the affections of truth; thus also it is formed to joys, for every joy is from
affection or from love: hence it is evident that the harmony of singing, and likewise 
that the are of music, can express various kinds of affections. From this cause it is that
several kinds of musical instruments were applied in holy worship by the Jewish and 
Israelitish nation, each of which was expressive of the affections of celestial good, and
of the affections of spiritual good, and thence of the joys, which were the subjects of 
their discourses; the stringed instruments were applied to the affections of spiritual 
good, and the wind-instruments to the affections of celestial good. AE 326.

THE TRANSLATOR'S NOTES AND OBSERVATIONS

Verse 1. Unto you, O JEHOVAH, do I cry, O my rock. These words not only teach the 
interesting lesson, above referred to in the Exposition, respecting the Divine and 
Heavenly Marriage of the GOOD and the TRUE, which forms a distinguishing 
characteristic of the Divine Authority of the sacred writings, but they inculcate also a 
doctrine which ought never to be forgotten by every sincere worshipper of the GREAT 
ALMIGHTY. The doctrine is, that GOOD derives all its power and strength from TRUTH, 
and that consequently the cultivation of TRUTH in the understanding ought never to be
neglected as a thing of indifference, since the quality of GOOD in the will will ever 
depend on the quantity and quality of the knowledge of TRUTH from GOOD, which has 
been received in the understanding. This doctrine demands the particular attention of 
those well-disposed persons, who are apt to rest their acceptance with GOD on the 
sincerity of their purposes, without any regard to their opinions, urging in their 
excuse, that if the life be right, of what consequence is their belief? But the question 
is, can the life be right, if the belief be wrong, in other words, can the good of love and
charity in the will be equally pure and equally operative in the case of its receiving no 
aid from an enlightened understanding, as it might have been if JEHOVAH and the 
ROCK had been united, and thus a well-disposed mind has the advantage of the 
strength of the latter and of the goodness of the former?

PSALM 29

A Psalm of David,

1. Give to JEHOVAH, O you sons of the gods, give to JEHOVAH glory and strength.
2. Give to JEHOVAH the glory of his name; bow down to JEHOVAH in the 

ornament of holiness.

3. The voice of JEHOVAH is upon the waters; the GOD of glory thunders; JEHOVAH

is on great waters.

4. The voice of JEHOVAH is full of power; the voice of JEHOVAH is full of majesty.
5. The voice of JEHOVAH breaks the cedars, yea, JEHOVAH breaks in pieces the 

cedars of Lebanon.

6. And he makes them skip like a calf, Lebanon and Sirion like the young of 

Unicorns.

7. The voice of JEHOVAH divides the flames of fire.
8. The voice of JEHOVAH shakes the wilderness; JEHOVAH shakes the wilderness 

of Kadish.

9. The voice of JEHOVAH makes the hinds to bring forth; and makes bare the 

forests; and in his temple does every one speak of glory.
10. JEHOVAH sits on the flood, yea, JEHOVAH sits a king for ever.
11. JEHOVAH gives strength to his people; JEHOVAH will bless his people with 

peace.

The Internal Sense

That they who are in truths from the Word will adore the LORD, who is the Word, 
verses 1 to 4; of the power of Divine Truth from the LORD, verses 5 to 11.

EXPOSITION

Verses 3 to 9. The voice of JEHOVAH is upon the waters, the GOD of glory thunders, 
JEHOVAH is on great waters; the voice of JEHOVAH breaks the cedars, JEHOVAH breaks 
the cedars of Lebanon, and makes them to dance as a calf; Lebanon and, Sirion as a 
son of Unicorns; the voice of JEHOVAH divides the flames of fire; the voice of JEHOVAH
makes the wilderness to tremble, makes to tremble the wilderness of Kadish; the voice
of JEHOVAH makes the hinds to bring forth, and makes bare the forests; but in his 
temple every one says glory. He who is not aware that singular things in the above 
words, as to every expression, are HOLY and DIVINE, may say within himself, if he be 
a mere natural man, what can this mean, that JEHOVAH sits on the waters, that, by his 
voice he breaks the cedars, makes them to dance us a calf, and Lebanon as a son of 
unicorns; that he makes the lands to bring forth, with several other particulars; for he 
knows not that the power of Divine Truth, or the Word, is described by those things in
the spiritual sense; for in that sense, by the voice of JEHOVAH, which is there thunder, 
is meant Divine Truth or the Word in its power; by the great waters, on which 
JEHOVAH sits, are meant its truths; by the cedars and by Lebanon, which he breaks, 
are meant the false principles of the rational man; by a calf and a son of unicorns the 
false principles of the natural and sensual man; by a flame of fire the affection of what

115

is false; by a wilderness and the wilderness of Kadish the church where there is 
neither truth nor good; by hinds which JEHOVAH makes to bring forth are meant the 
Gentiles who are in natural good; and by the forests which he makes bare are meant 
the sciences and knowledges which the Word opens to them; wherefore it follows, "In 
his temple every one says glory," by which is meant, that in singular the things of the 
Word there are Divine Truths, for temple signifies the LORD, and hence the Word, also 
heaven and the church, and glory signifies Divine Truth. From these considerations it 
is evident, that in the Word there is not an expression which does not describe the 
Divine power of the Word against false principles of every kind amongst natural men, 
and the Divine power of reforming the nations. S. S. 18.

Verse 9. The voice of JEHOVAH makes the hinds to bring forth, etc. That there is an 
internal sense in this expression, is manifest from this consideration, that immediately 
afterwards it is said, In his temple every one says glory, which words, without a 
spiritual sense, do not cohere with the preceding. AC 6413. 

The subject treated of in the above Psalm is concerning the Divine Truth which 
destroys falsities and evils; this Divine Truth is the voice of JEHOVAH; but the glory 
which is said is the Divine Truth which is in heaven and the church. AC 9926. see also
AC 10182; sec also AE 201.

Verse 10. JEHOVAH sits on the flood. Walkings and journeyings relate to the 
movements of man, and thence signify progressions of life, or progressions of the 
thought from the intention of the thought from the intention of the will; but standings 
and sittings appertain to the rest of man, and thence signify the esse of life, from 
which is the existere thereof, thus to cause to live: wherefore to sit upon thrones, when
predicated of judgement, signifies to be in operation to judge, consequently also to 
judge, whence comes the expression of sitting in judgement, which denotes to do 
judgement; to sit upon a throne likewise, when treating of a kingdom, signifies to he 
king or to reign. Inasmuch as JEHOVAH, that is, the LORD, is the very esse of the life of
all, therefore to sit is predicated of him in various parts of the Word, as in David, 
"JEHOVAH shall sit upon the flood, and he shall sit a king to eternity." Psalm 29:10.

Verse 11. JEHOVAH will bless his people with peace. Here is described the peace which
they have who are in conjunction with the LORD by the reception of Divine Good and 
Divine Truth from him, and that it is peace in which and from which is heavenly joy. 
AE 365.

THE TRANSLATOR'S NOTES AND OBSERVATIONS

The above is one of those Psalms, which leave no doubt on the well-disposed mind 
respecting the spiritual and internal sense contained in and conveyed by the sense of 
the letter. For in the description here given of what is called the voice of JEHOVAH, 
how plain it is to see, that it cannot be true, if its meaning be limited to the mere literal
expressions by which it is announced? Whilst then the interpretation of this Psalm is 
earnestly recommended to the reader's attention as a satisfactory proof of the heavenly
light by which the mind of the interpreter was illuminated, it is further pressed on his 
observation as a decisive and full demonstration, that the WORD OF THE MOST HIGH is 
replete with a wisdom worthy of its DIVINE AUTHOR, and at the same time is 

116

calculated to elevate the human understanding to see by a light at once clear, edifying,
and highly conducive to the promotion of its eternal happiness.

Verse 1. Give to JEHOVAH, O you sons of the gods, give to JEHOVAH glory and 
strength. What is here rendered O you sons of the gods, is expressed, in the received 
English version of the Psalms, by the term, mighty; but in the original Hebrew there is
no such term, and it is merely said, O you sons of the gods. What is the proper sense 
and meaning of this expression, cannot perhaps be better understood than by the 
explanation of the original term, which is here rendered gods, as it is given in n. AC 
8301 of the Arcana Coelestia. The words of the enlightened author are as follows:—" 
By gods, are meant the truths of good, and the reason is because by gods in a good 
sense are meant the angels, who are called gods, because they are substances or forms
receptive of truth, in which is good from the LORD. The angels, consequently the 
truths of good which are from the LORD, are also meant by gods in the following 
passages:— 'GOD stands in the company of GOD, in the midst of the gods he shall 
judge: I said you are gods, and you are all the sons of the Most High.' Psalm 82:1, 6. 
That the truths which proceed from the LORD are what are here meant by gods, is 
manifest from the consideration that it is first said, the company of GOD, and 
afterwards, in the midst of gods; That the term, GOD, is used in the WORD, where truth 
is treated of, see AC 2769, 2807, 2822, and that GOD in the supreme sense is the 
Divine Truth proceeding from the LORD, AC 7268. Again, "I will confess to you in my
whole heart, before the gods I will sing psalms to you," Psalm 138:1; again, "There is 
none as you amongst the gods, O LORD," Psalm 86:8; again, "The GREAT GOD is 
JEHOVAH, and a GREAT KING over all gods," Psalm 14:3. The reason why it is so often 
said that JEHOVAH is above all gods, and that he is GOD of Gods, is because at that 
time several gods were worshipped, and the nations were distinguished by the gods 
whom they worshipped, and each nation believed that its own god was the supreme of
all, and because hence a plurality of gods had a place in all minds.

The intelligent reader will not fail to discover, in the glory and strength which he is 
here required to give to JEHOVAH, evident traces of that Marriage of the GOOD and the 
TRUE, which has been so repeatedly referred to in the preceding pages, for he will see 
intuitively, that glory has more immediate reference to the DIVINE TRUTH, and 
strength to the DIVINE GOOD.

PSALM 30

A Psalm, a Song at the dedication of the house of David,

1.

I will extol you, O JEHOVAH, for you have raised me up, and not suffered my 
foes to rejoice over me.

2. O JEHOVAH, my GOD, I cried to you, and you have healed me.
3. O JEHOVAH, you have brought up my soul from hell; you have kept me alive 

from them that go down to the pit.

4. Sing to JEHOVAH, O you his saints, and give thanks at the remembrance of his 

holiness.

5. For his anger is but for a moment, in his favour is life; weeping may endure 

for a night, but in the morning there is singing.
6. And in my security I said, I shall never be moved.
7. O JEHOVAH, in your favour you have made my mountain to stand strong; you 

did hide your face, I was troubled.

8. Unto you, O JEHOVAH, I cried, and to you, O JEHOVAH, did I make my 

supplication.

9. What profit is there in my blood when I go down to the pit? Shall dust praise 

you? Shall it declare your truth?

10. Hear, O JEHOVAH, have mercy upon me; O JEHOVAH, be you my helper.
11. You have turned for me my mourning into dancing; you have put off my sack-

cloth and girded me with joy.

12. Therefore my glory shall sing praise to you and not be silent; O JEHOVAH my 

GOD, I will give thanks to you for ever.

The Internal Sense

Of the glorification of the LORD'S humanity after he had suffered temptation, and the 
last, which was that of the cross, Verses 1 to 12.

Exposition

Verse 2. You have healed me. That hereby is signified that the LORD alone preserves 
from evils, appears from the signification of healing, as denoting to cure and also to 
preserve from evils, for when diseases signify evils, to heal signifies their cure and 
preservation from them; as also in several passages in the Word; thus in Moses, "I kill 
and make alive, I smite and heal," Deut 32:39: and in Jeremiah, "Heal me JEHOVAH, 
that I may be healed, preserve me that I may be preserved," Jer 17:14; again, "I will 
cause health to come up upon you, and I will heal you of your plagues," Jer 30:17. 
And in David, "You have turned his whole bed in his disease; I said, JEHOVAH have 
mercy upon me, heal my soul because I have sinned against you" Psalm 41:3, 4; 
besides in many other passages, as Isaiah 6:10; 53:5; 57:18, 19. Jer 3:22; and because 
to heal has this signification, the LORD also calls himself a physician, "They that be 
whole need not a physician, but they that are sick; I came not to call the just but 
sinners to repentance," Matt 9:12, 13; Mark 2:17. Luke 5:31, 32. AC 8365.

118

There were three reasons why faith in the LORD healed the sick in the gospel, the first 
was, their acknowledging his Divine Omnipotence, and that he was GOD; the second 
was, because faith is acknowledgement and from acknowledgement contemplation, 
and all contemplation from acknowledgement causes another to be present, which is a
common thing in the spiritual world, in this case therefore contemplation from the 
acknowledgement of the LORD'S Omnipotence, which was the acknowledgement from
which they were first to view the LORD, when a new church should be established by 
him; hence it may appear, what is there understood by faith: the third reason was, that 
all the diseases which the LORD healed, represented and thence signified spiritual 
diseases, to which natural diseases correspond, and spiritual diseases cannot be healed
except by the LORD, and indeed by looking to his Divine Omnipotence, and by 
repentance of the life, wherefore also he sometimes said, your sins are remitted you, 
go and sin no more; this faith also was represented and signified by their miraculous 
faith: but the faith whereby spiritual diseases are healed by the LORD, can only be 
given by truths from the Word, and by a life according to them, the truths themselves 
and the life according to them constituting the quality of the faith. AE 815. 

Verse 7. You did hide your faces and I was troubled. For the proper signification of 
hiding the face, when applied to JEHOVAH, or the LORD, see the extract from the AE at 
verse 9 of chap. xxvii.

Verse 11. You have turned for me my mourning into dancing; you have put off my 
sackcloth, and girded me with joy. Dancing is here predicated of truths, and joy of 
goods, as also in other passages of the Word;. thus to put off sackcloth denotes to take 
away mourning over destroyed good, for by putting on sackcloth is signified 
mourning on account of the destruction of good. AC 4779.

119

PSALM 31

To him that presides over the music, a Psalm of David. 

1. With you, O JEHOVAH, do I take refuge; let me never be ashamed; deliver me 

2.

in your justice.
Incline your ear to me, deliver me speedily; be to me a rock of strength,—a 
house of defence to save me.

3. For you are my rock and my fortress, therefore for your name's sake lead me 

and guide me.

4. Take me out of the net which they have hid for me, for you are my strength.
5.

Into your hands I commit my spirit; you have redeemed me, O JEHOVAH GOD 
of truth!
I hate them that regard lying vanities; and I trust in JEHOVAH.
I will rejoice and be glad in your mercy, for you have considered my affliction;
you have known my soul in distress;

6.
7.

8. And have not shut me up in the hand of the enemy; you have made my feet to 

stand in a broad place.

9. Have mercy upon me, O JEHOVAH, for I am in distress; mine eye is consumed 

with grief, even my soul and my belly.

10. For my life is consumed with sorrow, and my years with sighing; my strength 

fails because of mine iniquity, and my bones are consumed.

11. I am become a reproach amongst all mine enemies, and especially amongst 

my neighbours, and a terror to mine

12. I am forgotten as a dead man out of mind; I am become like a broken vessel.
13. For I have heard the slander of many; terror was on every side, while they 

consulted together against me; they devised to take away my life.

14. But I trusted in you, O JEHOVAH, I said you are my GOD.
15. In your hand are my times; deliver me from the hand of mine enemies, and 

from them that persecute me.

16. Cause your face to shine upon your servant; save me for your mercy's sake.
17. Let me not be ashamed, O JEHOVAH, for I have called upon you; let the wicked

be ashamed, let them be silent in hell.

18. Let lying lips be silent, which speak harsh things against the righteous, with 

pride and scorn.

19. How great is your goodness which you have reserved for them that fear you! 
which you have worked for them that take refuge with you, before the sons of 
man.

20. You shall hide them in the secret of your presence from the pride of man; you 

shall conceal them in a tabernacle from the strife of tongues.

21. Blessed be JEHOVAH, for he makes his mercy wonderful to me in a fenced city.
22. But I said in my terror, I am cut off from before your eyes; nevertheless you 

heard the voice of my prayers when I cried to you.

23. O love JEHOVAH all you his saints; JEHOVAH preserved the faithful, and 

abundantly recompenses the proud doer.

24. Be of good courage; he will strengthen your heart, all you that hope in 

JEHOVAH.

120

The Internal Sense

A prayer of the LORD to the FATHER that he will protect him against those who 
contrive mischief, verses 1 to 4; and who wish to kill him, verse 5; that thence he has 
grief of heart, verses 6 to 10; that they assault him with reproaches, as upon the cross, 
verses 11 to 13; that through his trust in the FATHER is delivered, verses 14 to 21; in 
despair thinking himself deserted, but he is not, verse 22; put your trust in the LORD, 
verses 23, 24.

Exposition

Verse 5. Into your hands I commit my spirit; you have redeemed me, O JEHOVAH GOD 
of truth. To redeem denotes to deliver from falsities, and to reform by truths, this 
being the signification of redeeming, it is therefore said, O JEHOVAH GOD of Truth. AE
328.

Verse 8. You have made my feet to stand in a broad place, That by these Words is 
signified new life such as appertains to the regenerate man of the church, is manifest 
from the signification of standing, as denoting to be and to live, and also to sustain, 
concerning which see above, AE 414; and from the signification feet, as denoting the 
natural principle, which is the ultimate of Divine order, and the basis on which prior 
and superior things rest, and on which they subsist, concerning which see also above, 
AE 69, 600, 606; hence by standing on the feet is signified life in the full, because in 
the ultimate; and life is then in the full, when what is natural lives from what is 
spiritual; for the ultimate of man's life is in his natural principle; this ultimate is as a 
basis to his interior and superior principles, for these close in the ultimate and there 
subsist, wherefore unless the life be in the ultimate, it is not full, thus neither is it 
perfect. Moreover all interior or superior principles co-exist in the ultimate, as in their 
simultaneous abode, hence such as the ultimate is, such are the interior or superior 
principles, for these accommodate themselves to the ultimate, because it receives 
them. The like is signified by standing on the feet in David, "You have made my feet 
to stand in the breadth," Psalm 31:8; by breadth, is signified the Truth of doctrine 
from the Word, wherefore to make my feet to stand in the breadth, signifies to cause to
live according to Divine Truths. AE 666.

By standing on the feet is signified natural life in agreement with spiritual life, and 
thus vivified by the LORD; the reason why this is signified is because by the spirit of 
life is meant the internal principle of man, which is called the internal man, which 
viewed in itself is spiritual, for the spirit of man thinks and wills, and to think and will
in itself is spiritual; by standing on the feet is signified the external principle of man, 
which is also called the external man, which in itself is natural, for the body speaks 
and performs what its spirit thinks and wills, and to speak and to perform is natural. 
Every man who is reformed, is first reformed as to the internal man, and afterwards as
to the external; the internal man is not reformed by merely knowing and 
understanding the truths and goods by which man is saved, but by willing and loving 
them, but the external man by speaking and doing those things which the internal man
wills and loves, and in proportion as this is done, in the same proportion man is 
regenerated; the reason why he is not previously regenerated is because his internal 
principle is not previously in effects, but only in causes, and causes, unless they be in 

121

effect, are dissipated, being like a house founded on ice, which falls when the ice is 
melted by the sun, in a word, he is like a man without feet, on which to stand and 
walk; the case is the same with the internal or spiritual man unless he be founded in 
the external or natural. AR 5, 10.

By breadth is signified the Truth of the Church, and the reason is because in the 
spiritual world there are four quarters, the east, the west, the south and the north, and 
the east and west make its length, and the south and north its breadth; and because in 
the east and west they dwell who are in the good of love, and therefore by east and 
west is signified good, hence in like manner by length; and because in the south and 
north they dwell who are in the Truths of wisdom, and therefore by south and north is 
signified Truth, hence in like manner by breadth. That by breadth is signified Truth, 
may be manifest from the following passages in the Word, "JEHOVAH, you have not 
shut me up into the hand of the enemy, you have made my feet to stand in a broad 
place," Psalm 31:8. "I called upon JEHOVAH from my distress, he answered me in the 
breadth," Psalm 67:5. "JEHOVAH brought me forth into the breadth; he delivered me," 
Psalm 17:20. "Ashur shall pass through Judah, he shall over-flow and pass through, 
and the stretching-out of his wings shall be the fullness of breadth," Isaiah 8:8. Nor is 
any thing else meant by the breadth of the City New Jerusalem, Apocr 21:16; for 
since by the New Jerusalem is meant a new church, by its breadth and length it is 
impossible to suppose that breadth and length can be signified but only truth and its 
good, for these are what constitute a church; as likewise in Zechariah, "I said to the 
angel, whither go you? He said, to measure Jerusalem, that I may see what is the 
breadth thereof and the length thereof," Zech 2:2. In like manner by the breadths and 
lengths of the now temple and new earth in Ezekiel, xl. xlii. xliii. xliv. xlv. xlvi. xlvii. 
AR 861.

Verse 9. Have mercy upon me, O JEHOVAH, for I am in distress, mine eye is consumed 
with grief, my soul and my belly. By the eye, the soul, and the belly is here signified 
the understanding and thence the exterior and interior thought of Truth, thus by belly 
are signified the interior things of the understanding, which are said to be consumed 
with grief, when they perish by falsities. AE 622.

A state of temptations is also described by the above Words; by the eye is signified the
understanding; by the soul faith and the understanding of truth; by the belly faith and 
the understanding of good; the reason why this is signified by the belly is because the 
belly receives food, and by food and bread is signified nutritive good; in this case 
understanding and faith; their defect in temptation is signified by being consumed 
with grief. AE 750.

Verse 16. Cause your face to shine upon your servant, etc. To cause the face to shine, 
signifies to illustrate with Divine truth from Divine love; that this is meant by causing
the face to shine, is because Divine Truth, which proceeds from the LORD as the sun 
of the angelic heaven gives all light there, and also illustrates the minds of angels and 
fills them with wisdom, wherefore the face of the LORD, in a proper sense, is the sun 
of heaven, for the LORD appears to the angels of the interior heavens as a sun, and this
from his Divine love, for love in heaven, when presented to view appears as fire, but 
the Divine love as a sun. From that sun proceed both heat and light, the heat is the 
Divine Good, and the light the Divine Truth. Hence it is evident that to cause your 
face to shine upon your servant is meant to illustrate with Divine truth from Divine 

122

good, wherefore it is added, save me for your mercy's sake, mercy is of Divine 
goodness. AE 412.

Verse 20. You shall hide them in the secret of your faces from the pride of man; you 
shall conceal them in the tabernacle from the strife of tongues. To hide them in the 
secret of your faces is in the Divine good not apparent before others; and to conceal 
them in your tabernacle is in the Divine truth, the pride of men and the strife of 
tongues are the evils of what is false and the falsities of what is evil, for pride is 
predicated of evils, because they are of self-love, and man signifies what is true and 
what is false; the strife of tongues is the false of evil. AE 412.

By the secret of faces, in which JEHOVAH hides himself, is signified the Divine good of
the Divine love, for the face of JEHOVAH signifies the good of love, and what is 
hidden what is interior belonging to man; by the pride of man is signified the proud 
conceit of self-intelligence; by tabernacle is signified Divine truth; by the strife of 
tongues is signified the false principle of religion, from which men reason against 
truths. AE 455.

123

PSALM 32

A Psalm of David, (Mashkil) Instructive.

1. Blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is covered.
2. Blessed is the man to whom JEHOVAH imputes not iniquity, and in whose spirit

there is no guile.

3. When I kept silence, my bones were consumed, through my roaring all the 

day.

4. For day and night your hand was heavy upon me; my moisture is turned into 

5.

the dryness of summer. Selah.
I acknowledge my sin to you, and mine iniquity have I not hid; I said, I will 
confess my transgressions to JEHOVAH, and you forgave the iniquity of my sin.
Selah.

6. Upon this account shall every one that is godly pray to you, in the season 
when you may be found; truly, in the floods of great waters they shall not 
reach to him.

7. You are my hiding-place; you do preserve me from trouble; you do encompass

8.

me with songs of deliverance. Selah.
I will instruct you, I will teach you the way in which you shall walk; I will 
counsel you; mine eye shall be upon you,

9. Be not as the horse and mule which have no understanding; whose mouth 

must be held in with bit and bridle, lest they come near to you.

10. Many are the sorrows of the wicked, but mercy shall encompass him that 

trusts in JEHOVAH.

11. Rejoice in JEHOVAH, and exult you just; and sing aloud all you upright in heart.

The Internal Sense

That the just is blessed, verses 1, 2; the grievousness of his temptations is described, 
verses 3, 4; confession of infirmities, and that he is delivered, verses 5 to 7; that he is 
wise, verses 8, 9; that he has confidence, verses 10, 11.

Exposition

Verse 1. He whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is covered. Mention is made of
transgressions, also of sin, by reason of the marriage of truth and good in singular the 
things of the Word, for transgression signifies evil against, truth, which is the lesser 
evil, and sin evil against good, which is the greater; hence it is that mention is made of
both. AC 6563.

Verse 3. When I kept silence my bones were consumed through my roaring all the day.
That roaring signifies grievous lamentation arising from grief of heart, is manifest 
from these words, also from these, "I am feeble and sore broken, I have roared by 
reason of the disquietness of my heart." Psalm 38:8. AE 601.

124

Verse 6. For this shall every one that is godly pray to you when you may be found, but
in the floods of great waters they shall not reach him. That a flood of waters, or an 
inundation, signifies temptation, is manifest from these Words in Ezekiel, "Thus says 
the LORD JEHOVAH, I will rend it with a stormy wind in my wrath, and there shall be 
an overflowing rain in mine anger, and great hail stones in my fury to consume it; that
I may destroy the wall which you have daubed with what is untempered," Ezek 13:13,
14; where a stormy wind and an overflowing rain denote the desolation of what is 
false; a wall daubed with what is untempered, denotes what is feigned appearing as 
true; and in Isaiah, "JEHOVAH GOD a protection from inundation, a shade from the 
heat, for the spirit of the violent is as an inundation against a wall," Is 25:5, 
inundation here denotes temptation as to things intellectual, and is distinguished from 
temptation as to things voluntary, which is called heat. Again, "Behold the LORD has a
strong and mighty one, as an inundation of hail, a storm of destruction, as an 
inundation of strong waters over-inundating," Is 28:2; the degrees of temptation are 
here described; again, in the same prophet, "When you passest through the waters, I 
will be with you, and through the rivers, they shall not overflow you; when you 
walkest through the fire you shall not be burned, neither shall the flame kindle upon 
you," Is 43:3; where waters and rivers denote falsities and phantasies; fire and flame 
denote evils and cravings; and in David, "Upon this every one that is godly shall pray 
to you, when you may be found, but in the floods of great waters they shall not reach 
him," Psalm 32:6; where an inundation of waters denotes temptation, which is also 
called a flood. AC 739.

THE TRANSLATOR'S NOTES AND OBSERVATIONS

Transgression is an offence against the purity of DIVINE TRUTH, and therefore its 
remission, or what amounts to the same thing, its removal, cannot be effected but by 
the implantation of DIVINE TRUTH in its place; sin again is an offence against the 
DIVINE GOOD, and consequently its covering will require the presence and operation 
of the DIVINE GOOD to hide its pollutions. The blessedness then here announced is 
manifestly the communication of the DIVINE TRUTH and the DIVINE GOOD to the 
humble and sincere, who are desirous to have their natural errors of understanding 
supplanted by the one, and their natural corruptions of the will covered by the other.

Verse 3. When I kept silence my bones were consumed through my roaring all the day.
If the reader be content with the mere literal meaning of this passage, he will find a 
difficulty in discovering the connection here insisted on between the silence of the 
tongue and the consumption of the bones, for there does not appear to be any 
connection between the one and the other. But this difficulty vanishes, whenever the 
views of the mind are elevated above the letter, to contemplate the spiritual sense of 
the passage, and by the bright light of correspondence to behold and to delight in the 
instructive and proper meaning of the two terms silence and bones. For what is 
spiritual silence but the torpor and inactivity of spiritual thought, occasioned in the 
present instances by a state of spiritual temptation? And what are spiritual bones but 
those principles in the human mind, on which all thought rests, and by which it 
exercises its activity, and thus gives utterance to the truth in which it principally 
delights? Here then we discover at once a connection between silence, or inactive 
thought, and bones, or the principles on which thought rests, and by which it gives 
utterance to its ideas. We see, therefore, at the same time, how a state of spiritual 

125

temptation must always have a joint effect on the tongue and the bones, by checking 
the activity of thought in the one, and its exercise in the other.

That by bones is figuratively signified something intellectual proper to man, both as 
to what is true and what is false, may be seen confirmed by a variety of passages from
the HOLY WORD collected together in AC 3812, of the Arcana Coelestia, to which the 
reader is referred for the fullest and most satisfactory information on the subject.

The Internal Sense

Celebration of the LORD because the church is from him by means of the Word, verses
1 to 9; however the wicked may oppose, yet so it will be, verses 10, 11; blessed are 
they who are of that church, verses 12 to 15; that self-derived intelligence will effect 
nothing, verses 16, 17; that they will be saved who trust in the LORD, verses 18 to 22.

Exposition

Verses 1, 2, 3. Sing you just in JEHOVAH; praise is becoming to the upright; praise 
JEHOVAH on the harp, sing to him with an instrument of ten strings; sing to him a new 
song, play excellently to him with a loud noise. Inasmuch as joy of heart is from 
celestial love and from spiritual love, therefore it is said, "Sing you just in JEHOVAH, 
praise JEHOVAH on the harp, play to him on an instrument of ten strings; sing you just,

127

is said of those who are in celestial love; praise on the harp and play on the psaltery," 
of those who are in spiritual love; that they are called just who are in celestial love, 
may be seen above, AE 204; and that the harp and an instrument often strings, are 
predicated of those who are in spiritual love, see also above, AE 323; and whereas a 
song is confession from joy originating in those lines, therefore it is said, "Confess to 
JEHOVAH, sing to him a new song; the exaltation of joy arising from fullness is 
signified by playing excellently to him with a loud noise." AE 326. See also AE 323.

Verses 1 to 4. In the word mention is made of various instruments, and each has its 
particular signification, as will be shown, by the divine mercy of the LORD, in its 
proper place: at present we shall only adduce some passages from David in relation 
thereto; as for instance, "I will offer in the tent of JEHOVAH sacrifices of shouting, I 
will sing and play to JEHOVAH," Psalm 27:6; where by tent is expressed what is 
celestial, and by shouting, singing, and playing, what is spiritual. Again, "Sing to 
JEHOVAH, you just, for praise is becoming to the upright: confess to JEHOVAH on the 
harp, play to him on the psaltery, an instrument of ten strings; sing to him a new song,
play skilfully with a loud noise, because the word of JEHOVAH is right, and all his 
work is in truth," Psalm 33:1 - 4; signifying the truths of faith whereof such things are
predicated: things spiritual, or the truths and good things of faith were celebrated by 
the harp and psaltery, by singing and the like; whereas things holy, or the celestial 
things of faith, were celebrated by wind instruments, as trumpets and the like: hence 
so many instruments were used about the temple, and it was ordained so frequently, 
that this or that should be celebrated with particular instruments, and this is the reason
why instruments were applied and understood to signify the things themselves which 
were celebrated by them. It is worthy to be remarked, that angels and spirits, 
according to their differences with respect to goodness and truth, distinguish tones, 
and this not only in the case of singing and of instruments, but also in the words of 
speech, and admit only such tones as are in concord, so that there is an agreement of 
tones, consequently of instruments, with the nature and essence of goodness and truth.
AC 420.

Verse 6. By the word of JEHOVAH were the heavens made, and all the host of them by 
the breath of his mouth. The armies of them, or of the heavens, denote truths, and 
whereas by host or armies are signified truths, therefore the sons of the kingdom and 
angels, by virtue of the truths in which they are principled, are called the armies of the
heavens, as in Luke, "Suddenly there was present with the angel a multitude of the 
heavenly army praising GOD," Luke 2:13. So in David, "Bless you JEHOVAH, all his 
armies; you ministers of his that do his will," Psalm 103:21; and again, "Praise 
JEHOVAH, all you his angels; praise him, all you his armies," Psalm 148:2. AC 448.

The Word of JEHOVAH is the Divine Truth proceeding from the LORD; the breath [or 
spirit] of the mouth of JEHOVAH is life thence derived; the heavens thence made, and 
all the armies of them, are the angels so far as they are receptions of the Divine Truth; 
the reason why the heavens denote angels is because angels constitute heaven; and 
since angels are receptions of Divine Truth, therefore by angels, in the abstract sense, 
are signified the Divine Truths which are from the LORD, see AC 8192; and that the 
armies of heaven in the same sense denote Divine Truths, see AC 3448, 7230, 7988; 
hence it may be manifest what is signified by the Word in John, "In the beginning was
the Word, and the Word was with God, and GOD was the Word; all things were made 
by him, and without him was nothing made that was made; and the Word was made 

128

flesh and dwelt among us, and we have seen his glory," John 1:13; that the LORD is 
here meant by the Word, is evident, for it is said, that the Word was made flesh. AC 
9987.

The Word of JEHOVAH by which the heavens were made, and the breath [or spirit] of 
his mouth by which their armies, signify the Divine Truth proceeding from the LORD; 
the armies of the heavens are all things of love and faith; the waters of the sea which 
he gathers into a heap, signify the knowledges of truth, and truths in general, which 
are together in the natural man; the depths which he gives for treasures signify sensual
scientifics, which are the most general and ultimate things of the natural man, and in 
which together are interior or superior truths, whence they are called treasures AE 
275.

Without the Divine Truth of the Word, which in its essence is the Divine good of the 
Divine love and the Divine truth of the Divine wisdom of the LORD, man cannot have 
life; by the Word there is conjunction of the LORD with man, and of man with the 
LORD, and by that conjunction there is life; there must be something from the LORD 
which can be received by man, by which there may be conjunction, and thence eternal
life. AR 200.

Verse 8. Let all the earth fear JEHOVAH; let all the inhabitants of the world stand in 
awe of him. By world in general is signified the church as to all things belonging 
thereto, as well goods as truths, but specifically it signifies the church as to good, as is
the case more especially when the earth is mentioned at the same time: that by the 
earth, in the word, is signified the church, was shown above, AE 304, 697; but when 
the world is mentioned at the same time, then by the earth is signified the church as to
truth; for there are two things which constitute the church, namely truth and good, and
these two are signified by the earth and world: thus in Isaiah, "With my soul have I 
desired you in the night; with my spirit also in the midst of me have I expected you in 
the morning; for when you teach the earth your judgements, the inhabitants of the 
world learn justice," Is 26:9; and in David: "Let all the earth fear JEHOVAH, let all the 
inhabitants of the world stand in awe of him:" here by the earth are signified those 
who are in the truths of the church, and by the inhabitants of the world those who are 
in the goods of the church. AE 741.

Verse 10. JEHOVAH frustrates the counsel of the nations, etc. People denote those who 
are against the truths of the spiritual church, thus who are in falsities, and nations 
those who are against the goods of the celestial church, thus who are in evils, these 
things are signified also by the people and nations who were driven out, of the land of 
Canaan. AE 331.

Verse 11. Generations denote what is eternal, because by theirs, in the internal sense, 
are meant the generations of faith and charity, thus which are of heaven and the 
church, which are eternal; by the sons of Israel, of whom generations are predicated, 
is also signified the church. That by generations is signified what is eternal, is evident
from the following passages in the word, "My justice shall be to eternity, and my 
salvation to generations of generations; awake according to the days of antiquity, 
generations of eternities," Isaiah 51:8, 9; again, "The counsel of JEHOVAH shall stand 
to eternity, the thoughts of his heart to generations and generations," Psalm 33:11. It 
is said to eternity, and generation to generations, and eternity is predicated of the 

129

divine celestial principle or good, and generations of the divine spiritual principle or 
truth; for in the Word, especially the prophetic, there are generally two expressions 
concerning one and the same thing, as in the passage's above quoted, to eternity and to
generation and generation, and this on account of the celestial marriage in all and 
singular things of the Word; the celestial marriage is the marriage of good and of 
truth, or the conjunction of the LORD and of heaven. AC 9263.

Verse 18. Behold the eye of JEHOVAH is on them that fear him, etc. Inasmuch as the 
fear of JEHOVAH signifies the reception of Divine truth, and mercy the reception of 
Divine good, therefore it is said that the eye and the good pleasure of JEHOVAH are 
upon them that fear him, upon them that hope in his mercy. AE 696.

Verse 18. Behold the eye of JEHOVAH is on them that fear him. Eyes, when predicated 
of the LORD, signify the Divine Providence, and the reason is because when 
predicated of man, they signify the understanding, and the Divine understanding, as 
being infinite, is the Divine Providence. AE 88.

Verses 18, 19. Behold the eye of JEHOVAH is on them that fear him, to deliver their 
soul from death, and to keep them alive in famine. By those that fear JEHOVAH are 
meant those who love to do his commandments; by delivering their soul from death is
signified from evils and falsities, and thereby from damnation: by keeping them alive 
in famine is signified to give spiritual life according to desire; desire for the 
knowledges of truth and good is the affection of spiritual truth, which is given only to 
those who are in the good of life, that is, who do the commandments of the LORD, 
who, as was said, are meant by those that fear the LORD. That by famine is signified 
the privation, defect, and ignorance of the knowledges of truth and good, is manifest 
from the signification of famine, as being the privation of the knowledges of truth and 
good, also a defect and ignorance of those knowledges. AE 386.

The Translator's Notes and Observations

Verse 17. A horse is a vain thing for safety. What is here called a vain thing is 
expressed in the original Hebrew by a term, which properly signifies a lie, intimating 
that the natural understanding of man, which is figured by a horse, is in direct 
opposition to the Divine Truth, and thus not to be depended on for salvation.

PSALM XXXIV. 

A Psalm of David, when he changed his behaviour towards Abimelech, and drove him
away, and he departed.

I will bless JEHOVAH at all times; his praise shall be continually in my mouth.
In JEHOVAH my soul shall boast; the afflicted shall hear and be glad.

distresses.

7. The angel of JEHOVAH camps round about them that fear him, and delivers 

them.

130

8. O taste and see how good JEHOVAH is! Blessed is the man that trusted in him.
9. O fear JEHOVAH you his saints, for there is no lack to them that fear him.
10. The young lions do lack and suffer hunger; but they who seek JEHOVAH shall 

not lack any good.

11. Come you children hearken to me, I will teach you the fear of JEHOVAH.
12. Who is the man that desires life, that loves many days to see good?
13. Keep your tongue from evil, and your lips from speaking deceit.
14. Depart from evil, and do good; seek peace, and pursue it.
15. The eyes of JEHOVAH are upon the just, and his ears are open to their cry.
16. The face of JEHOVAH is against them that do evil, to cut off the remembrance 

of them from the earth.

17. They cry, and JEHOVAH hears, and delivers them out of all their distresses.
18. JEHOVAH is near to them that are of a broken heart, and he saves them that are 

of a contrite spirit.

19. Many are the evils of the just, and JEHOVAH delivers him out of them all.
20. He preserves all his bones; not one of them is broken.
21. Evil shall slay the wicked, and they that hate the just shall he condemned.
22. JEHOVAH redeems the soul of his servants; and none of them that trust in him 

shall be condemned.

The Internal Sense

Celebration of the LORD, because he delivers them that trust in him from all evil, 
verses 1 to 11; that he will preserve the good, and that the wicked will perish, verses 
12 to 22.

Exposition

Verses 4, 6. I sought JEHOVAH, and he answered me. etc. It is a general [rule or law] in
all divine worship, that man should first will, desire, and pray, and then that the LORD 
should answer, inform, and do, otherwise man does not receive any thing divine. We 
read frequently in the Word, that the LORD answers when they call upon and cry to 
him, as in Psalm 34:4, 6; but yet the LORD gives them to ask and what to ask, 
wherefore the LORD knows it before, but still the LORD wills that man should ask first,
to the end that he may do it as from himself, and thus it is appropriated to him; 
otherwise if the petition itself were not from the LORD, it would not be said that they 
should receive what they asked. AE 376.

Verses 9, 10. O fear JEHOVAH you his saints, for there is no want to them that fear 
him. The young lions do lack and suffer hunger, but they who seek JEHOVAH shall not 
lack any good. They who fear JEHOVAH and have no want, here signify those who 
love to do the commandments of the LORD, and they who seek JEHOVAH and shall not 
lack any good, signify those who are therefore loved by the LORD, and receive from 
him truths and goods; the young lions who lack and suffer hunger, signify those who 
are knowing and wise from themselves; to lack and be hungry denotes that they have 
neither truth nor good. AE 386.

Verse 12. Who is the man that desires life, [lives]. In this and in other passages 
mention is made of lives in the plural, because there are two faculties of life in man, 

131

one which is called understanding, and which is of truth, and the other which is called 
will, and is of good; these two lives or faculties of life make one, when the 
understanding is of the will, or, what is the same thing, when truth is of good; hence it
is that in the Hebrew tongue so frequent mention is made of life and also of lives. In 
respect to lives, they signify in the plural both what is of the will and what is of the 
understanding, consequently what is of good, and what is of truth; for the life of man 
is nothing else but good and truth wherein is life from the LORD, inasmuch as man, 
without good and truth and the life therein, is no man; for man without these 
principles would not be able to will any thing or to think any thing, all his faculty of 
willing being derived from what is good or not good; and all his faculty of thinking 
being derived from what is true or not true; hence man has lives, which are one life 
when his thought is derived from his will-principle, that is, when truth which is of 
faith is derived from good which is of love. AC 3623.

Verse 13. Keep your tongue from evil, etc. By the lips and tongue, with which they 
speak a lie and guile, is signified the thought with intention of persuading falsities 
against truths, and of seducing. AE 866.

Verse 14. Depart from evil, and do good; seek peace and pursue it. Peace is a blessed 
principle of the heart and soul arising from conjunction of the LORD with heaven and 
the church, and this from the conjunction of good and truth with those who are there, 
hence there is no longer any combat of what is evil and false against what is good and 
true, or no disagreement or war in a spiritual sense; the consequence is peace, in 
which is effected all fructification of good and multiplication of truth, consequently 
all wisdom and intelligence: and whereas this peace is from the LORD alone, and from 
him with the angels in heaven and with men in the church, therefore by peace in the 
supreme sense is meant the LORD, and in a respective sense heaven and the church, 
consequently good conjoined to truth with those who are there. From this description 
of peace an idea may he formed of the signification of peace in the following 
passages, "Depart from evil and do good, seek peace and pursue it," Psalm 34:14; 
where peace denotes all things which are; of heaven and the church, whence comes 
the happiness of eternal life; and since this happiness appertains only to those who are
in good, therefore it, is said, "Depart from evil and do good, seek peace and pursue 
it," again: "Much peace have they who love your law, and nothing shall offend them; I
have hoped for your salvation, and done your commandments," Psalm 119:165, 166; 
where peace denotes what is celestially blessed, happy, and delightful, and since these
blessings are given only to those who love to do the commandments of the LORD, 
therefore it is said, "Much peace have they who love your law, I have hoped for your 
salvation O JEHOVAH, and have done your commandments." Salvation denotes eternal 
life, that they have no infestation from evils and falsities, is signified by nothing 
offending them. AE 365.

Verse 16. The face of JEHOVAH is against them that do evil, to cut off the 
remembrance of them from the earth, Inasmuch as the wicked, in the other world, are 
in the evil of punishment, therefore it is supposed by them that this is from the LORD, 
and that he looks at them with an angry look, and casts them into hell and punishes, 
like a man in a passion, when yet the LORD never regards any one but from love and 
mercy. AE 412.

132

Verse 20. He keeps all his bones, not one of them is broken. That by these Words is 
signified scientific truth, and that it shall be entire, appears from the signification of 
bone, as denoting the ultimate in which interior things terminate as in their bases, that 
they may be supported to prevent their being severed to pieces; such an ultimate in 
spiritual things is the scientific principle, for all spiritual truths and goods flow down 
according to order into inferior things [or principles], and terminate at length in 
scientifics, and there present themselves visibly to man; that not to break denotes that 
it shall he entire, is evident. The scientific principle is said to be entire, when it admits
into itself nothing but truths which are in agreement with their good, for the scientific 
principle is the common receptacle. Moreover scientifics are circumstanced like the 
bones in man; if they be not entire, or in their order, as when they are out of joint, or 
distorted, the form of the body hence varies, and according to it the actions. AC 8005.

The Translator's Notes and Observations

Verse 7. The angel of JEHOVAH camps round about them that fear him, and delivers 
them. The doctrine of the ministration of angels is here insisted on and expressed in 
the strongest terms, being called an encampment round about them that fear him, 
which manifestly implies that man, as to his soul or spirit, is in the midst of them, and 
is thus guarded by their angelic protection. It may be objected perhaps, that the Divine
protection of the LORD alone, is a sufficient security for man against all the attempts 
of his spiritual adversaries, and that consequently then; is no need of additional 
succour from the above ministration. This objection is specious, because it is certainly
true that the LORD alone is a guardian both willing and able to defend his creature 
man; but then it surely merits consideration, that the ministration of angels is not so 
much for the purpose of lending aid to the LORD in his administration of the concerns 
of mankind, as with a view to extend his mercy by finding an employment for the 
innumerable host of his angelic kingdom, which is to them at once the most delightful
and the most beneficial. It is not then necessity, but the superabundance of the Divine 
mercy, to which we are indebted for the above angelic encampment, which at once 
makes manifest the adorable love of our HEAVENLY FATHER, brings into fuller exercise
the affection and thoughts of his ministering spirits, and provides more fully for the 
guardianship and comfort of mankind.

Verse 8. O taste and see how good JEHOVAH is. Tasting has relation to the will of man,
and seeing to his understanding, consequently the injunction to taste and see that 
JEHOVAH is good, implies the combined exercise of these two faculties. It is not 
sufficient therefore that man only tastes the Divine goodness in his will, unless he also
seen it with his understanding, nor that he sees it with his understanding, unless he at 
the same time tastes it in his will, consequently it is an imperative duty binding on 
every Christian, to apply both his will and understanding unitedly to the sublime and 
momentous purpose here pointed at, to taste and see that JEHOVAH is good.

Verse 20. He keeps all his bones, and not one of them is broken. This passage is a 
proof, amongst a thousand others, of the internal sense contained in the letter of the 
Sacred Volume of Revelation, for what eye cannot see that the bones here spoken of 
cannot possibly mean the natural bones of the material body? We are compelled then 
to interpret the expression as relating to the interior bones of the spirit of man, and 
that these bones are the scientific principle of the human mind, will appear in the 

133

plainest and most satisfactory manner from consulting what has been just above said 
on the subject in the Exposition.

134

PSALM 35

A Psalm of David.

1. Contend, O JEHOVAH, with them that contend with me; fight against them that 

fight against me.

2. Take hold of shield and buckler, and arise for my help.
3. Draw out also the spear, and stand between me and my persecutors; say to my 

soul, I am your salvation.

4. Let them be ashamed and blush that seek my soul; let them be turned back, 

and brought to confusion that devise my hurt.

5. Let them be as chaff before the wind, and let the Angel of JEHOVAH drive them

away.

6. Let their way be dark and slippery, and let the Angel of JEHOVAH pursue them.
7. For without cause have they hid for me their net; without cause have they dug 

a pit for my soul.

8. Let destruction come upon him unawares, and let his net which he has hid 

catch himself; let him fall into destruction.

9. And my soul shall exult in JEHOVAH, it shall be glad in his salvation.
10. All my bones shall say, O JEHOVAH, who is like you, delivering the afflicted 

from him that is too strong for him, yea, the afflicted and needy from him that 
spoils him?

11. Fierce witnesses have risen up; they question me concerning things that I 

know not.

12. They recompense me evil for good,—the spoiling of my soul.
13. But as for me, when they were sick, my clothing was sackcloth; I humbled my

soul with fasting, and my prayer returned into my own bosom.

14. I conducted myself as if it were for my companion and my brother; I bowed 

myself in mourning as bewailing a mother.

15. And when I halted they were glad and gathered themselves together; the 

abjects, whom I knew not, gathered themselves together against me; they did 
rend me, nor were they silent.

16. With profane mockers at feasts they gnashed upon me with their teeth.
17. LORD, how long will you look on? Rescue my soul from their destructions, my

only one from the lions.

18. I will celebrate you in the great congregation; I will praise you among many 

people.

19. Let not my enemies unjustly rejoice over me; let them not wink with their eye 

that hate me without a cause;

20. For they speak not peace, and devise words of deceit against those that are 

peaceable in the earth;

21. They open their mouth wide against me; they say, Aha! aha! our eye has 

beheld.

22. You have seen, O JEHOVAH! be not silent, O LORD, be not far from me.
23. Arouse yourself, and awake to my judgement, O my GOD, and my LORD, to 

plead my cause.

24. Judge me according to your justice, O JEHOVAH my GOD, and let them not 

rejoice over me.

135

25. Let them not say in their hearts, Aha! that is our desire; let them not say, we 

have swallowed him up.

26. Let them be ashamed and blush together that rejoice in my hurt; let them be 

clothed with shame and ignominy that exalt themselves against me.

27. Let them sing and be glad that delight in my justice; let them say continually, 
let JEHOVAH be magnified! who has pleasure in the peace of his servant.
28. And my tongue shall proclaim your justice, and your praise, all the day long.

The Internal Sense

Of the LORD'S combats against the hells, and their subjugation and prostration, verses 
1 to 9; that they seek to put him to death, because he wishes to do them good, whence 
he is grieved, verses 10 to 16; a prayer to be preserved from them that he may rejoice, 
verses 17, 18; that they blaspheme him, verses 19 to 21, 25; that through his Divine 
[principle] He will overcome them, verses 22, 23, 24, 26; wherefore the justice of the 
LORD will be praised, verses 27, 28.

Exposition

Verses 1, 2, 3. Contend O JEHOVAH, with them that contend with me; fight against 
them that fight against me. Take hold of shield and buckler, and arise for my help; 
draw out also the spear, and stand between me and my persecutors; say to my soul, I 
am your salvation. That in this passage by fighting, taking hold of shield and buckler, 
and drawing out the spear, is not signified to lay hold of those warlike arms, is 
evident, for it is spoken of JEHOVAH, but it is so expressed because all the weapons of 
war signify such things as have relation to spiritual war; by a shield inasmuch as it 
protects the head, is signified defence against falsities destroying the understanding of
truth; by a buckler, inasmuch as it protects the breast is signified protection against the
falsities destructive of charity, which is the will of good; and by a spear, since it 
protects all things of the body, is signified protection in general; inasmuch as such 
things are signified therefore it is added, "Say to my soul, I am your salvation."

Since JEHOVAH, that is, the LORD, protects man from the hells, that is, from the evils 
and falsities continually arising thence, therefore the LORD is called Jehovah Zebaoth,
that is, JEHOVAH of Armies, and by armies are signified the truths and goods of heaven
and of the church in the complex, by which the LORD removes the hells in general, 
and with every individual in particular; hence it is that fighting and warfare are 
attributed to JEHOVAH as a hero and a man of war in combat, as may be manifest from 
the following passages, "JEHOVAH ZEBAOTH descends to fight on Mount Zion and 
upon its hill," and in Zechariah, "JEHOVAH shall go forth and fight against those 
nations as when he fought in the day of battle," Zech 14:3; and in Isaiah, "JEHOVAH 
shall go forth as a mighty man, he shall stir up zeal as a man of war, he shall prevail 
over his enemies," Is 42:13; and in Moses, "JEHOVAH will wage war against Amalek 
from generation to generation," Exod 17:10; this was said, because by Amalek are 
signified those falsities of evil, which continually infest the truths and goods of the 
church. AE 734.

Verse 10. All my bones shall say, O JEHOVAH, who is as you, delivering the poor from 
him that is too strong for him, the poor and needy from him that spoils him? Bones 

136

here denote scientific truths, see AC 8005; the needy in this passage denote those who 
are in little truth, and the poor denote those who are in little good, and are infested by 
evils and falsities, from those infestations also the needy are called afflicted in the 
original tongue, for to be afflicted is to be infested by falsities. AC 9209.

The reason why mention is here made of both poor and needy is because it is 
according to the style of the WORD, that where truth is spoken of, good is also spoken 
of, and in the opposite sense, where the false is spoken of, evil is also spoken of, 
because they make one, and are as a marriage, wherefore poor and needy are named 
together, for by poor are meant those who are deficient: in the knowledges of good, 
and by needy those who are deficient in the knowledges of truth. AE 238.

Verse 13. But as for me, when they ware sick, my clothing was sackcloth, etc. By 
being clothed in sackcloth, is signified lamentation on account of the devastation of 
truth in the church; for garments signify truths, wherefore to be clothed in sackcloth, 
which is not a garment, signifies lamentation, because there is no truth, and where 
there is no truth there is no church. The children of Israel represented lamentation by 
various things, which, owing to their correspondences were significative, as by 
putting ashes on their heads, by rolling themselves in the dust, by sitting a long time 
silent upon the ground, by shaving themselves, by mourning and howling, by tearing 
their garments, and also by putting on sackcloth, besides other particulars; and each of
these signifies some evil of the church among them, for which they were punished; 
and when they were punished, by these methods they represented repentance, and by 
reason of this representation of repentance and at the same time of humiliation, they 
were heard. AR 492.

Verse 14. I bowed myself in mourning [in black], as bewailing a mother. Since 
mourning in the churches before the LORD'S coming, which were representative 
churches, represented spiritual grief of mind on account of the want of truth and good,
mourning being used on occasions of oppression from an enemy, of the death of a 
father and mother, and other similar cases, and by oppression from an enemy was 
signified oppression from evils which are from hell, and by father and mother was 
signified the church as to good and as to truth, these things being represented by 
mourning amongst them, therefore on such occasion they were clothed in black, as in 
David, "I will say to GOD my rock, why have you forgotten, why go I in black because
of the oppression of the enemy?" Psalm 42:9; again, "I bowed myself in black as one 
that mourns for a mother," Psalm 35:14; and in Jeremiah, "Judah mourns, and the 
gates thereof languish; they are black to the earth, and the cry of Jerusalem is gone up;
for their nobles have sent their little ones for water; they came to the pit, they found 
no water; they returned with their vessels empty," Jer 14:2, 3 — That being black [or 
clothed in black] here signifies spiritual grief of mind on account of the want of truth 
in the church, is manifest from every particular expression in the internal sense; for by
Judah is signified the church as to the affection of good, and by Jerusalem the church 
as to the affection of truth; by gates is signified admission to them; that there were no 
longer any truths, is described, by the nobles sending their little ones for water, by 
their coming to the pits, not finding waters, and their vessels returning empty; waters 
signify truths; pits those things which contain, which things are doctrinals from the 
Word, and the Word itself, in which they no longer see truths. From these passages it 
may be manifest that black in the Word signifies what is not true, in like manner as 

137

diskness, cloud, obscurity, and several other things from which comes blackness. AE 
372.

Verse 16. They gnashed upon me with their teeth. He, who is not acquainted with the 
spiritual sense of the Word, may suppose that the expression of gnashing the teeth is 
here applied to denote anger and evil intention, because on such occasions the teeth 
are pressed together; but mention is made of gnashing of teeth in the Word, because 
the teeth signify falsities in the extremes, and gnashing the vehemence of combating 
in favour of them; this attempt and act is also from correspondence. Such also was the
quality of the deaf and dumb spirit whom the LORD cast out; for all spirits are from the
human race; he was of that class of men, who had vehemently combated in favour of 
falsities against truths; hence it is that the person possessed by him foamed and 
gnashed with his teeth; he is called by the LORD deaf and dumb, because he was not 
willing to perceive and understand the truth; for the deaf and dumb signify such 
persons; whereas he was determined and obstinate in his opposition to truths, and had 
confirmed himself in falsities, that spirit could not be cast out by the disciples, for the 
falsities, in favour of which he had combated, could not as yet be dispersed by them, 
for they were not as yet qualified to disperse them, on which account they were 
moreover blamed by the LORD: that the spirit was of such a quality, and that the 
person possessed by him was not of such a quality, is signified by the spirit tearing 
him, and by the person possessed pining away, and by the LORD saying to the spirit, 
that he should no more enter into him. Hence it may be manifest what is signified by 
gnashing of teeth, Matt 8:12; 13:42, 50; 22:13; 24:51; 25:30; Luke 13:28. Inasmuch as
teeth correspond to the ultimates of the life of the intellectual man, which are called 
sensual, and as these are in the falsities of evil when they are separated from the truths
of the interior understanding, which are called spiritual, yet, the same correspond to 
the truths of good in sensual things when they are not separated, hence it is that teeth 
in the Word also signify ultimate Truths. AE 556.

Verses 20, 21. For they speak not peace, and devise works of deceit, etc. By month is 
signified speech, preaching, and doctrine, AR 453, and by guile, is signified 
persuasion to evil by means of falsehood, properly speaking from cunning and design;
for he who persuades another to something from cunning or guile, the same also 
persuades from design, for cunning or guile proposes something to itself, conceals its 
purpose or design, and when there is an opportunity puts it into execution. AR 624.

Verse 28. My tongue shall meditate on your justice, your praise, all the day. By 
tongue is here signified confession from the doctrine of the church, for it is said that it
meditates; justice is predicated of its good, and praise of its truth. In the Word 
frequent mention is made of the lip, the mouth, and the tongue, and by the lip is 
signified doctrine, by the mouth thought, and by the tongue confession. The reason 
why the lip, the mouth, and the tongue have such significations is because they are the
externals of men, by which publication is made of things internal, and internal things 
are what are signified in the internal or spiritual sense; for the Word in the letter 
consists of external things which appear before the eyes and are perceived by the 
senses, hence the WORD in the letter is natural, and this for the reason that the Divine 
Truth which it contains may be there in the ultimate, and then in its fullness: but those
external things, which are natural comprehend in them internal things which are 
spiritual, which therefore are the things signified. AE 455.

138

THE TRANSLATOR'S NOTES AND OBSERVATIONS

Verse 1. Contend, O JEHOVAH, with them that contend with me, and fight against them
that fight against me. To a person unacquainted with the internal sense of the WORD it 
will appear, that to contend and to fight in this passage, is a mere tautology, and has no
other meaning. But to a person, whose intellectual eyes are open to see, that the 
ALMIGHTY never deals in such tautology, it will be manifest, that the two terms, 
contending and fighting, have relation to the heavenly marriage of the GOOD and the 
TRUE, which pervades the Book of Revelation, and that thus to contend, when 
predicated of the ALMIGHTY, has reference to the DIVINE GOOD of his love, and when 
predicated of the wicked, has reference to the infernal evil of an opposite love. In like 
manner to fight is not a repetition of the same thing, but, when applied to the 
ALMIGHTY, has respect to the DIVINE TRUTH of his most holy wisdom, and when 
applied to the wicked, has respect to the principles of what is false in their opposition 
to that wisdom. The two terms then mark that Divine union of love and wisdom which
prevails in heaven, and that infernal conjunction of what is evil and false which rules 
in hell. A similar observation may be extended to the two expressions ashamed and 
blush, and also to being turned back and brought to confusion, which occur at the 
subsequent verse 4.

139

PSALM 36

To him that presides over the music, a Psalm of David, the servant of JEHOVAH.

1. The saying of transgression to the wicked: in the midst of his heart, there is no 

fear of GOD before his eyes.

2. For he flatters himself in his own eyes: to find out his iniquity is hateful to 

him.

3. The words of his mouth are iniquity and deceit; he ceases to understand to do 

good.

4. He devises iniquity upon his bed; he persists in a way not good; he abhors not 

evil.

5. O JEHOVAH, your mercy is in the heavens, your truth is even to the skies.
6. Your justice is as the mountains of GOD; your judgements are a great deep; 

you, O JEHOVAH, preserve man and beast.

7. How precious is your mercy, O GOD! and the sons of man shall put their trust 

under the shadow of your wings.

8. They shall be filled with the fatness of your house, and you shall make them 

drink of the stream of your delights.

9. For with you is the fountain of life; by your light we see light.
10. O continue your mercy to them that know you, and your justice to the upright 

in heart.

11. Let not the foot of pride come against me; and let not the hand of the wicked 

remove me.

12. Then shall the workers of iniquity fall; they shall be thrust down, and shall not 

be able to rise.

The Internal Sense

Of hypocrites, that they think evil; verses 1 to 4; that it is to be acknowledged that all 
good and truth are from the LORD, verses 5 to 9; that good and truth are with those 
who acknowledge the LORD, verse 10; that the LORD protects from evil, and that the 
wicked perish, verses 11, 12.

Exposition

Verse 1. The saying of transgression to the wicked: in the midst of his heart there is 
no fear of GOD before his eyes. In the midst here signifies in the whole because in the 
inmost; for such as the inmost is, such is the whole, for from the inmost all other 
things are produced and derived, as the body from its soul; the inmost of every thing 
is also what is called soul; as for example, the inmost of man is his will and thence his
understanding, and such as the will is and thence the understanding, such is the whole 
man; the inmost of man is also his love and thence his faith, and such as his love is 
and thence his faith, such is the whole. That the whole man is such as his middle or 
internal, is also understood by the LORD'S Words in Matthew, "The light of the body is
the eye; if the eye be good, the whole body is lucid, if the eye be evil, the whole body 
is full of darkness," Matt 6:22, 23; where by the eye is signified the understanding of 

140

man, see AE 37 and 52, which, if good, that is, if grounded in truths derived from 
good, in such case affects the quality of the whole man, which is signified by the 
whole body in such case being lucid; but on the other hand if the understanding be 
grounded in the falsities of evil, the whole man in such case acquires a similar quality,
which is signified by the whole body in such case being darkened. AE 313.

Verses 5, 6. Your justice is as the mountains of GOD, your judgements are a great 
deep. Both mercy and justice have relation to love; and truth and judgements have 
relation to faith. That justice has relation to good, and judgement to truth, may be 
manifest from the signification of justice and from the signification of judgement: 
justice and judgement are frequently mentioned together in the Word; but what they 
signify in the internal sense, is not yet known: in a proximate sense, justice is 
predicated of what is just, and judgement of what is right; just is, when any thing is 
judged from a principle of good, and this according to conscience; but right is, when 
any thing is judged from a principle of law, consequently also according to 
conscience, because law is in this case the rule of judgement: but in the internal sense,
justice is what is derived from good, and judgement what is derived from truth; good 
is all that appertains to love and charity; truth is all that which appertains to faith 
grounded in charity; truth derives all its essence from good, and is called truth 
grounded in good, as faith is grounded in charity, consequently also judgement is 
grounded in justice. That justice and judgement have this signification, is evident 
from the various passages in the Word where they are mentioned together. AC 2235.

Mercy signifies the DIVINE GOOD of the Divine Love, and Truth the DIVINE TRUE, and 
since the DIVINE TRUE is the light of heaven, it is therefore said, your truth is even to 
the aethers; by aethers therefore in the plural is signified Divine light even to the 
highest heaven, that is, in the highest degree. Similar things are signified by aethers, 
Psalm 77:17; Psalm 78:23, 24. AE 541.

In many passages of the WORD mention is made of judgements, of precepts, and of 
statutes, and by judgements are there signified civil law, by precepts laws of spiritual 
life, and by statutes laws of worship. AE 946.

Verse 6. You preserve man and beast, O JEHOVAH. By man and beast is signified 
interior affection which is spiritual, from which is derived intelligence, and exterior 
affection which is natural, from which is derived the science corresponding to 
intelligence. AE 650.

Verse 8. They shall be filled with the fatness of your house, and you shall make them 
drink of the stream of your delights. By the fatness of your house with which they are 
filled, is signified the good of love and its properties, house denotes those things 
which are of the mind, by the stream of delights which you give them to drink, is 
signified intelligence and the happiness thence derived. AE 1159.

Verse 9. For with you is the fountain of Huts, by your light we shall see light. With 
you is the fountain of lives, signifies that with the LORD and from him is Divine Truth;
inasmuch as this is signified by the fountain of lives, therefore also it is said, by your 
light we see light; by the LORD'S light is signified Divine Truth. AE 483.

141

The light, which is life from the LORD in heaven, is there called the Divine Truth, 
since it is lucid in the minds of those who are there, and thence is lucid before their 
eyes; hence it is, that light in the Word signifies the Divine Truth, and thence 
intelligence and wisdom; and that the LORD Himself is called light. The reason why 
the LORD is the source of all life is because he is the sun of the angelic heaven, and the
light of that sun is the Divine Truth, and the heat of that sun is the Divine Good, each 
is life; hence is the origin of all life in heaven and in the world. AE 186.

THE TRANSLATOR'S NOTES AND OBSERVATIONS

Verse 1. The saying of transgression to the wicked, etc. In the received English 
version of the Psalms a different construction is put on these Words, for in those 
versions it is supposed that transgression speaks to some other person, and not to the 
wicked man himself, but in the original Hebrew it is expressly said that transgression 
speaks to the wicked, for the Words are literally as it is here expressed, "The saying of
transgression to the wicked." Besides, the words which immediately follow, in the 
midst of his heart, are an additional proof that the saying of transgression was 
addressed to the wicked, in order to convince him that his whole man was wicked, and
that thus, whatever appearances might be presented to the contrary in his external 
man, there was in reality no fear of GOD before his eyes.

142

PSALM 37

A Psalm of David.

1. Be not angry with the ungodly, and be not envious against the workers of 

iniquity.

2. For they shall speedily be cut down like the grass, and be withered as the 

green herb.

3. Trust in JEHOVAH and do good; dwell in the land, and feed on Truth.
4. And delight yourself in JEHOVAH, and he will give you the desires of your 

heart.

to pass.

6. And he will bring forth your justice as the light, and your judgement as the 

noon-day.

7. Trust quietly in JEHOVAH, and wait patiently for him; be not angry with him 

who prospered in his way, with the man who does wicked devices.
8. Refrain from anger, and forsake wrath; be not angry lest you do evil.
9. For evil doers shall be cut off; but they that hope in JEHOVAH, shall inherit the 

earth.

10. But yet a little while, and the wicked shall not exist; and you shall diligently 

consider his place, and it shall not be found.

11. And the afflicted shall inherit the earth, and shall be delighted with the 

abundance of peace.

12. The wicked plots against the just, and gnashes upon him with his teeth.
13. The LORD shall laugh at him, for he sees that his day is coming.
14. The wicked draw out the sword, and bend their bow, to cast down the afflicted 

and needy, to slay the upright in the way.

15. Their sword shall enter into their own heart, and their bows shall be broken.
16. The little good of the just is better than the wealth of many wicked.
17. For the arms of the wicked shall be broken; but JEHOVAH upholds the just.
18. JEHOVAH knows the days of the upright, and their inheritance shall be for ever.
19. They shall not be ashamed in the time of evil, and in the days of famine they 

shall be satisfied.

20. For the wicked shall perish; and the enemies of JEHOVAH shall be consumed as

the fat of lambs; in smoke shall they be consumed.

21. The wicked borrows, and pays not again, but the just man is merciful and 

gives.

22. For the blessed of him shall inherit the earth, and the cursed of him shall be 

cut off.

23. By JEHOVAH the steps of that man are made firm, and his way is pleasing to 

him.

24. Though he fall, he shall not be laid prostrate, for JEHOVAH supports his hand.
25. I have been young and am become old, but I never saw the just forsaken, or 

his seed begging bread.

26. He is ever merciful and lends, and his seed is blessed.
27. Depart from evil and do good, and you shall dwell in the land for ever.

143

28. For JEHOVAH loves judgement, and forsakes not his saints; they are preserved 

for ever, but the seed of the wicked shall be cut off.

29. The just shall inherit the earth, and shall dwell therein for ever.
30. The mouth of the just meditates wisdom, and his tongue pronounces 

judgement,

31. The law of his GOD is in his heart; his steps shall not falter.
32. The wicked watches the just and seeks to slay him.
33. JEHOVAH will not leave him in his hand, nor condemn him when he is judged.
34. Trust in JEHOVAH and keep his way, and he will exalt you to possess the earth; 

when the wicked are cut off, you shall behold.

35. I have seen the wicked an object of dread, spreading himself like a green 

native tree;

36. Yet he passed away, and lo, he was not; and I sought him, but he could not be 

found.

37. Mark the perfect man, and behold the upright, for the end of that man is peace.
38. But the transgressors shall be destroyed together; the end of the wicked shall 

be cut off.

39. But the salvation of the just is from JEHOVAH; he is their strength in the time of

distress.

40. And JEHOVAH shall help them and deliver them; he will deliver them from the 

wicked and will save them, because they trust in him.

The Internal Sense

A comparison between the lot of the wicked and the good; that the wicked, though 
they flourish for a short time, at last perish and are cast into hell, verses 1, 2, 8, 9, 10, 
12 to 15, 17, 20, 21, 28, 32, 35, 36, 38; that the good are saved by the LORD, and taken
up into heaven, verses 3 to 7, 11, 16, 18, 19, 22 to 31, 33, 34, 37, 39, 40.

Exposition

Verse 2. For they shall soon be cut down like the grass, and be withered like the green
herb. The vile principles of delights are called the green herb, because they are 
merely worldly and corporeal, or external; for, as was said, the pleasures, which are in
things corporeal or external, derive their origin from delights more interior in order; 
the delights, which are perceived in outermost or corporeal things, are respectively 
vile; for every delight is such, that it becomes viler, the more it approaches to things 
external, and happier in proportion as it accedes to things internal, wherefore, as was 
said, in proportion as they are unfolded in order, or external things are separated, in 
the same proportion delights become more gratifying and happy; this may be 
sufficiently manifest from the consideration, that the delight of man's pleasures, 
during his life in the body, is vile when compared with his delight after the life of the 
body, when he comes into the world of spirits, yea, so vile, that good spirits altogether
despise the delights of the body, nor are they willing to return into them, even 
supposing them to be gifted with every delight which the whole world could supply: 
the delight of these spirits, in like manner, becomes vile when they are elevated by the
LORD into the heaven of angelic spirits, for in such case they put off those interior 

144

 
delights, and put on delights still more interior; in like manner the delight, which 
angelic spirits have enjoyed in their heaven, becomes comparatively vile, when they 
are elevated by the LORD into the angelic: or third heaven, in which heaven the 
happiness is inexpressible, because internal things are alive, and nothing but mutual 
love prevails. AC 996.

Verse 6. And he shall bring forth your justice, etc. See Exposition, Psalm xxxvi. verse 
6.

Verses 10, 37. The afflicted shall inherit the earth, and shall be delighted with the 
abundance of peace. Mark the perfect man, and behold the upright, for the end of that
man is peace. By the afflicted are here meant those who are in temptations in the 
world, by the abundance of peace with which they shall be delighted, are signified the
delights which succeed temptations, for after temptations are given delights from the 
LORD resulting from the conjunction of good and truth on the occasion, and from 
conjunction thence with the LORD; that from the conjunction of good and truth man 
has the delight of peace, is meant by mark the perfect man, and behold the upright, 
for the end of that man is peace; the perfect man who is to be marked, is predicated of
good in the Word, and the upright who is to be seen, is predicated of truth; the end is 
the termination of combat when peace comes. AE 365.

Verse 12. The wicked plots against the just, and gnashes upon him with his teeth. 
Teeth signify the ultimates of the life of the natural man; there are two kinds of 
sensuals, the one of the will, and the other of the understanding; the sensuals of the 
understanding are signified by teeth; these last sensuals, that is, sensual men who are 
in them, or in falsities from confirmation, seem to themselves to be in power over all 
things, so as to be altogether invincible; for which reason the teeth of the locusts, Rev 
9:8, by which such sensuals are signified were like the teeth of lions, for by lion is 
signified power. AR 435.

The sensual man, or he who thinks and acts from the sensual principle, is one who 
believes nothing but what is obvious to the external senses, and who is led merely by 
corporeal appetites, pleasures, and cravings; such being the quality of the sensual 
man, he therefore rejects every thing internal, till at length he is unwilling even to 
hear it named; hence he in heart denies whatever is of heaven; the life after death he 
certainly does not believe, because he places life solely in the body, wherefore he 
supposes that he himself shall die in like manner as a beast: he thinks as it were in the 
surface, that is, in ultimates or extremes, and is altogether ignorant that there is given 
interior thought, according to the perception of truth and good; the ground of this 
ignorance, and the reason why he does not even know that there is an internal man, is 
because his interiors look downwards to those things which are of the world, of the 
body, and of the earth, with which they act in unity, hence they are diverted from 
looking upwards or to heaven, for they are in a contrary direction. To look upwards, 
or to heaven, does not consist in thinking about the things which are of heaven, but in 
regarding them as an end, that is, in loving them above all other things, for whither 
the love turns itself, thither the interiors of the man are also turned; hence also the 
thought. From these considerations it may be manifest what is the quality of man's 
sensual principle, or of the natural principle in the extremes, for he is called a sensual 
man, who thinks from the sensual principle. AC 7693.

145

Verse 14. The wicked draw the sword, and bend their bow, to cast down the poor and 
needy. That by the poor and needy are here meant those who are spiritually such, but 
who still desire the knowledges of truth and good, is evident, for it is said that the 
wicked draw the sword and bend the bow; for by the sword is signified the false 
principle combating against truth, and attempting to destroy it; and by the low the 
doctrine of what is false in opposition to the doctrine of what is true; hence it is that it 
is said, that they do this to cast down the poor and needy. AE 238.

Verse 15. Their sword shall enter into their own heart, and their bow shall be broken. 
Their sword shall enter into their own heart, signifies that they will perish by their 
own false principle, and their bow shall be broken signifies that their doctrine of what 
is false will he dissipated, which is also the case after their departure out of the world, 
on which occasion falsities destroy them, and their doctrine, so far as it has been 
applied to truth, is dissipated by falsities. AE 357.

Verses 18, 19. JEHOVAH knows the days of the perfect, and their inheritance shall be 
for ever. They shall not be ashamed in the time of evil, and in the days of famine they 
shall be satisfied. The days of the perfect signify the states of those who are in good 
and thence in truths, or those who are in charity and thence in faith; by JEHOVAH 
being their inheritance for ever is signified that they are his own and in heaven; by 
their not being ashamed in the time of evil is signified that they conquer when they are
tempted by evils; and by being satisfied in the days of famine is signified that they 
will be sustained by truths when they are tempted and infested by falsities, the time of
evil and the days of famine signify states of temptations, and temptations are from 
evils and falsities. AE 386.

Verse 20. The wicked shall perish, and the enemies of JEHOVAH shall he consumed as 
the fat of lambs; in smoke shall they be consumed. That the wicked and the enemies of
JEHOVAH shall be consumed in smoke, signifies that they will perish by the falsities of 
evil: they are called wicked who are in falsities, enemies who are in evil, and smoke is 
the false principle of evil. AE 539.

Verse 21. The wicked borrows and pays not again, but the just man is merciful and 
gives. In the WORD, where mention is made of borrowing and lending, it signifies to 
be instructed, and to instruct, from the affection of charity, as in Matthew, "Give to 
every one that asks of you, and from him that is desirous to borrow of you, turn not 
away," Matt 5:42. That, in this passage, by asking is not meant to ask, is evident, for it
is said, give to every one that asks; thus, neither by desiring to borrow is meant to 
desire to borrow; for, if a man were to give to every one that asks, and also to every 
one that is desirous to borrow, he would be deprived of all his property; but, inasmuch
as the LORD spoke from the Divine [Being or principle] by asking and being desirous 
to borrow, and by giving and receiving what is borrowed, is meant the communication
of celestial goods, which are the knowledges of good and truth; for in regard to this 
communication the case is this,—the more an angel gives to another from the 
affection of charity, the more flows in with him from the common good out of heaven,
that is, from the LORD, AC 6478; thus, by giving to him that asks, an angel is not 
deprived but enriched with goods. The case is the same also with man, when he does 
good to another from the affection of charity. This affection consists in 
communicating good, without having recompense as an end; but the non-affection of 

146

charity consists in communicating good for the sake of recompense as an end. AC 
9174.

Verse 30. The mouth of the just meditates wisdom. That the mouth from 
correspondence, thus in the spiritual sense, signifies thought, but in the natural sense, 
utterance, may be manifest from the following passages: The mouth of the just 
meditates wisdom, Psalm 37:30, where, by mouth is signified thought grounded in 
affection, for man, from that thought, meditates wisdom, but not from the mouth and 
its speech; and in Luke, "JESUS said, I will give you a mouth and a wisdom, which all 
your adversaries shall not be able to deny and resist," Luke 21:15, where mouth 
denotes speech grounded in understanding, thus the thought from which man speaks; 
and in Matthew, "Not that which enters into the mouth renders a man unclean, but 
what comes forth from the mouth, this renders man unclean: what enters into the 
mouth goes into the belly, and is cast out into the drought; but those things which 
proceed out of the mouth come forth from the heart; for out of the heart proceed evil 
thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies;" Matt 
15:11, 17, 18, 19; by those things which enter into the mouth, in the sense of the letter,
are meant foods of every kind, which, after use in the body, go through the belly into 
the drought; but in the spiritual sense, by the things which enter into the mouth are 
signified all things, which from the memory, and likewise from the world, enter into 
the thought; these things also correspond to foods, and those which enter into the 
thought, and not at the same time into the will, do not render man unclean, for the 
memory and the thought thence derived are only as an entrance to him, since the will 
is the man himself, the things therefore, which enter the thought and no further, are 
rejected as it were by the belly, and cast into the drought; the belly from 
correspondence signifies the world of spirits, whence thoughts flow in with man, and 
the drought signifies hell. It is to be noted that man cannot be purified from evils and 
consequent falsities, unless the unclean things belonging to him emerge even to the 
thought, and are there seen, acknowledged, distinguished, and rejected. From these 
considerations it is evident, that by what enters into the mouth, in a spiritual sense, is 
signified what enters into the thought from the memory, and from the world; but that 
by what comes forth from the mouth, in a spiritual sense, is signified thought from the
will, or from the love; for, by the heart, from which it comes forth into the mouth, and 
from the mouth, is signified the will of man and the love; and since the love and the 
will make the whole man, for man is such as his love is, hence those things, which go 
forth thence into the mouth and from the mouth, make man unclean, which, that they 
are evils of every kind is evident from their enumeration above. In this manner are 
these words of the LORD understood in the heavens. AE 580.

THE TRANSLATOR'S NOTES AND OBSERVATIONS

Verse 3. Trust in JEHOVAH and do good, dwell in the land and feed on truth. In the 
received version of the Psalms, what is here rendered feed on truth, is expressed by 
these words, verily you shall be fed; but the translation here given is in perfect accord 
with the original Hebrew.

The pious reader will not fail to note the several distinct degrees of love and adoration
of the ALMIGHTY, to which he is called by the several distinct precepts here presented 

147

 
of trusting in JEHOVAH, of delighting in him, of committing our way to him, of resting 
in him, and of waiting patiently for him, and he will perceive that the observance of 
these precepts has a manifest tendency to lead him gradually to a closer conjunction 
with the Divine mercy and blessing of the MOST HIGH.

PSALM 38

A Psalm of David, to bring to remembrance.

1. O JEHOVAH, rebuke me not in your anger, and chasten me not in your wrath.
2. For your arrows penetrate me, and your hand presses upon me.
3. There is no soundness in my flesh because of your indignation, nor peace in 

my bones because of my sin.

4. For mine iniquities are gone over my head; as a weighty burden they are too 

heavy for me.

5. My wounds stink, they are putrid, because of my foolishness.
6.
I am bent and bowed down greatly, I go mourning all the day.
7. For my loins are filled with burning, and there is no soundness in my flesh.
8.

I am enfeebled and exceedingly broken; I roar by reason of the disquietness of 
my heart.

9. O LORD, all my desire is before you, and my groaning is not hidden from you.
10. My heart is greatly agitated; my strength fails me; and even the light of mine 

eyes is not with me.

11. My friends and companions stand aloof from my plague, and my neighbours 

stand afar off.

12. And they that seek my soul lay snares, and they that intend my hurt speak 

mischievous things, and imagine deceit all the day.

13. And I am as a deaf man that hears not; and as a dumb man that opens not his 

mouth.

14. And I am as a man that does not hear; and in whose mouth are no reproofs.
15. For in you, O JEHOVAH, do I hope; you will answer O LORD my GOD.
16. Truly I speak, lest they should rejoice over me; when my foot is moved, they 

magnify themselves against me.

17. For I am ready to fall, and my grief is continually before me,
18. For I will declare mine iniquity; I am troubled for my sin.
19. And mine enemies are lively; they are strong; and they that hate me 

wrongfully are multiplied.

20. They also that render evil for good are mine adversaries, because I follow 

what is good.

21. Forsake me not, O JEHOVAH; O my GOD, be not far from me.
22. Make haste to help me, O LORD my salvation.

The Internal Sense

The grievousness of the LORD'S temptations described, verses 1 to 10; that they of the 
church seek his life, verses 11, 12; that he bears all with patience, verses 13, 14; his 
trust in the Father that the infernals will not prevail, verses 9, 15 to 22.

Exposition

Verse 3. Nor peace in my bones because of my sin. There is no peace belonging to 
those who are in evils and falsities; it appears indeed as if they were in peace when 

149

they succeed in the world, and they also seem to themselves on such occasions to be 
of a contented mind; but this apparent peace is only in things the most external, whilst
interiorly there is no peace; for they think of honour and gain without an end, and 
cherish in their minds cunning, deceit, enmity, hatred, revenge, and many similar 
evils, which, whilst they are not aware of it, distract and devour the interiors of their 
mind, and thence also the interiors of the body; that this is the case appears clearly 
with them after death, when they come into those interiors, on which occasion the 
delights of their mind are changed into the contrary, as may be manifest from what is 
shown in the work on HEAVEN and HELL, HH 485 to 490. AE 365.

Verses 4, 5, 7. For mine iniquities are gone over my head, etc. Disease denotes evil, 
because in its internal sense are signified such things as affect the spiritual life; the 
diseases, which affect that life are evils, and are called lusts and cravings: charity and 
faith constitute spiritual life, which life sickens when the false takes place of the truth 
which is of faith, and evil takes place of the good which is of charity, for these things 
[the false and evil] bring that life to death, which is called spiritual death, and is 
damnation, as diseases bring the natural life to its death; hence it is that by disease in 
the internal sense is signified evil, as in Moses, "If you shall reject my statutes, and if 
your soul shall loathe my judgements that you will not do all my precepts, whilst you 
make my covenant of none effect, I will visit upon you with terror, with consumption, 
and with a burning fever, which shall consume the eyes and torment the soul," Lev 
26:15, 16. And in David, "Mine iniquities have gone over my head, my wounds are 
putrid and corrupt, because of my foolishness, for my loins are filled with burning, 
there is no soundness in my flesh," Psalm 38:4, 5, 7. Inasmuch as by diseases are 
signified the corruptions and evils of spiritual life, therefore by the various kinds of 
diseases are signified the various kinds of corruptions and evils of that life. AC 8364.

Verse 5. My wounds stink, they are putrid because of my foolishness. Wounds denote 
evils of the will, which are evil works, which are said to stink and be putrid because 
of foolishness, when it is the delight of the will and thence of the thought to do them. 
AE 962.

Verse 6. I go mourning [in black] all the day. For the proper meaning of mourning, 
see note at verse 14 of chap. xxxv. AE 372.

Verses 5,7,11. My wound—burning—plague. All diseases belonging to man have 
correspondence with the spiritual world; for whatever in universal nature has not 
correspondence with the spiritual world, it has not existence, having no cause from 
which it can exist, consequently from which it can subsist; the things which are in 
nature, are nothing but effects, their causes are in the spiritual world, and the causes of
those causes, which are ends, are in the interior heaven. An effect cannot subsist, 
unless the cause be continually in it, for on the cessation of the cause the effect ceases;
an effect considered in itself is nothing but the cause, but the cause so intrinsically 
clothed, as may serve to enable it to act as a cause in an inferior sphere; and as the 
case is with an effect in respect to the cause, so also is it with the cause in respect to 
the end; unless the cause also exist from its cause, which is the end, it is not a cause, 
for a cause without end is a cause in no order, and where there is no order, there is not 
any thing effected. Hence then it is evident, that an effect considered in itself is a 
cause, and that a cause considered in itself is an end, and that the end of good is in 
heaven, and proceeds from the LORD, consequently that an effect is not an effect 

150

unless the cause be in it, and be continually in it, and that a cause is not a cause, 
unless the end be in it, and be continually in it; and that an end is not an end of good, 
unless the Divine [principle] which proceeds from the LORD be in it. Hence also it is 
evident, that all and singular things in the world, as they have existed from the divine 
[being or principle], exist also from the divine [being or principle.] AC 5711.

These observations are made in order that it may be known, that diseases also have 
correspondence with the spiritual world, not correspondence with heaven, which is 
the grand man, but with those who are in the opposite, thus with those who are in the 
hells. By the spiritual world in the universal sense is meant both heaven and hell, for 
man, when he dies, passes out of the natural world into the spiritual world. The reason
why diseases have correspondence with those who are in the hells is because diseases 
correspond to the lusts and passions of the mind (animus), these therefore are the 
origins of diseases; for the origins of diseases in common are intemperance, luxuries 
of various kinds, pleasures merely corporeal, also envyings, hatreds, revenges, 
lasciviousness, and the like, which destroy the interiors of man, and when these are 
destroyed, the exteriors suffer, and draw man into disease, and thereby into death; that
man is subject to death by reason of evils, or on account of sin, is a thing known in the
church, thus also he is subject to diseases, for these are of death. From these 
considerations it may be manifest, that diseases also have correspondence with the 
spiritual world, but with unclean things there, for diseases in themselves are unclean, 
inasmuch as they originate in things unclean, according to what was said above. AC 
5712.

All the infernals induce diseases, but with a difference, by reason that all the hells are 
in the lusts and cravings of evil, consequently contrary to those things which are of 
heaven, wherefore they act upon (or into) man from an opposite principle; heaven, 
which is the grand man, contains all things in connection and safety; hell, as being in 
the opposite principle, destroys and rends all things to pieces; consequently if the 
infernals are applied, they induce diseases, and at length death. But it is not permitted 
them to flow-in even into the solid parts of the body, or into the parts which constitute
the viscera, the organs, and members of man, but only into the lusts and falsities: only
when man falls into disease, they then flow-in into such unclean things as appertain to
the disease; for, as was said, nothing in any wise exists with man, unless the cause 
also be in the spiritual world; the natural principle belonging to man, if it was 
separated from a spiritual principle, would be separated from all cause of existence, 
thus also from every principle of life. Nevertheless this is no hindrance to man's being
healed naturally, for the Divine Providence concurs with such means of healing. That 
the case is thus, has been given to know by much experience, and this so frequently 
and of so long continuance, as not to leave a doubt remaining; for evil spirits from 
such places have been often and for a long time applied to me, and according to their 
presence they induced pains, and also diseases; it was shown me where they were, and
what was their quality, and it was also told me whence they were. AC 5713.

Verse 12. And they that seek my soul lay snares. That a snare in the spiritual world is 
enticement and deception by the delights of the love of self and of the world, thus the 
enticement and deception of evils, and this by reasonings grounded in the fallacies of 
the senses, which favour those delights, is evident to every one, for ensnarings and 
entrappings are from no other source: neither do the diabolical crew assault any thing 
else with man except those his loves, which they render delightful by every method, 

151

until he is taken, and when he is taken, the man reasons from falsities against truths, 
and from evils against goods; and in such case he is not content herewith, but also 
takes delight in ensnaring and enticing others to falsities and evils; the reason why he 
also takes this delight is because in such case he is one of the diabolical crew. AC 
9348.

THE TRANSLATOR'S NOTES AND OBSERVATIONS

Verse 1. O JEHOVAH, rebuke me not in your anger, and chasten me not in your wrath. 
Is it asked in what sense the passions of anger and wrath are here ascribed to 
JEHOVAH, and what is the difference between them, and further, what is the proper 
distinction between the rebuke of anger and the chastisement of wrath? It is 
impossible to give a satisfactory answer to these questions, until it be first seriously 
considered, that JEHOVAH ever was and ever will be the purest mercy and love, and 
that when anger and wrath are ascribed to him, it is merely from appearance, or 
because to a wicked and thoughtless person he seems to be angry and wrathful, 
whenever his own pure laws of mercy and wisdom are opposed and violated by the 
sin and folly of mankind. According to this idea, the rebuke of anger is imputed to the 
ALMIGHTY, whenever his mercy's thwarted by the evils of man's will; and again, the 
chastisement of wrath is imputed to him, whenever the benevolent and wise counsels 
of his wisdom are made light of and rejected by the false principles which naturally 
prevail in man's understanding. Let man then only oppose evil and error in himself 
through the DIVINE POWER with which he is continually supplied for that blessed 
purpose, and from that moment he will begin to rise out of and above appearances, 
and to rejoice in the delightful acknowledgement of the ETERNAL TRUTH, that God is 
LOVE and must ever remain so.

152

PSALM 39

"To him that presides over the music, to Jeduthun, a Psalm of David.

1.

2.

I said, I will take heed to my ways, that I sin not with my tongue; I will keep a 
check upon my mouth, while the wicked is before me.
I was dumb with silence, I refrained from speaking even of good; my sorrow 
was stirred.

3. My heart was hot in the midst of me, in my moaning the fire kindled; I spoke 

with my tongue:

4. Make known to me, O JEHOVAH, my end, and the measure of my days what it 

is; that I may know how frail I am.

5. Behold, you have made my days as a hand-breadth, and my age is as nothing 
before you; verily every man at his best state is altogether vanity. Selah.
6. Surely man walks as a shadowy image, surely they are disquieted in vain; he 

heaps up riches and knows not who shall gather them.
7. And now, O LORD, what wait I for? My hope is in you.
8. Deliver me from all my transgressions; make me not the reproach of the 

foolish.
I will be dumb; I will open not my mouth; for you have done it.

9.
10. Remove your plague away from me; I am consumed by the stroke of your 

hand.

11. With rebukes do you chastise man for iniquity; you make his beauty to waste 

away like a moth; surely every man is vanity. Selah.

12. Hear my prayer, O JEHOVAH, and give ear to my cry; be not silent at my tears; 

for I am a sojourner with you, a stranger as all my fathers were.

13. Look upon me that I may recover strength, before I go hence and be no more.

The Internal Sense

The LORD'S patience in a state of temptations, verses 1 to 3, 8 to 11; that he wishes the
end of them, verses 4 to 7; a prayer to the FATHER that he may not be deserted, verses 
12, 13.

Exposition

Verses 4, 5, Make known to me, O JEHOVAH, my end, and the measure of my days, 
what it is, that I may know how frail I am. Behold, you have made my days as a hand-
breadth, and mine age is as nothing before you. It appears as if by these words were 
meant only times of life, the end of which he is desirous to know, and that they 
quickly pass away: but in the spiritual sense, are not meant times, but instead of times,
states of life, wherefore by make known to me, O JEHOVAH, my end, the measure of 
my days, what it is, is signified that he may know the state of his life and its quality, 
thus what would continue to be the quality of his life; by behold, you have made my 
days as a hand-breadth, is signified that the quality of the state of his life is of little 
moment; and by my time being as nothing before you, is signified that the state of his 
life is of no avail: for time and days signify states of life as to truth and as to good, 

153

and hence as to intelligence and wisdom, consequently that the former and the latter, 
so far as they are from himself, are of no account: that this is the meaning of the 
words cannot be seen by those who only think naturally, because natural thought 
cannot be separated from the idea of time, but spiritual thought, such as angelic 
thought is, has nothing in common with time, nor with space, nor with person. AE 
629.

Verse 10, Remove your plague away from me, I am consumed by the stroke of your 
hand. By plagues, in the Word, are signified such things as destroy spiritual life with 
men, and consequently the church, and of course things which induce death, 
understood in a spiritual sense, which in general, have reference to the cupidities 
arising from the loves of self and of the world; for these loves are the roots from 
which evils and falsities of every genus and species bud forth and are born. AE 584.

In the Word in many passages it is said of JEHOVAH, that he burns with anger, and is 
angry, and also that he consumes and destroys; but it is so expressed because it so 
appears to man, who turns himself away from the LORD, as is the case when he does 
evil; and whereas on such occasions he is not heard, and is also punished, he believes 
that the LORD is in anger with him, when yet the LORD is in no case angry, and in no 
case consumes, for he is mercy itself, and good itself: hence it is evident what the 
quality of the Word is as to the letter, namely that it is according to appearance with 
man. In like manner, when it is said that, JEHOVAH repents, as in what follows, when 
yet, JEHOVAH in no case repents, for he foresees all things from eternity: hence also it 
may be manifest into how many errors they fall, who do not think beyond the sense of
the letter, when they read the Word, thus who read it without doctrine from the Word, 
which doctrine teaches how the case is: for they who read the Word from doctrine, 
know that JEHOVAH is mercy itself, and good itself, and that it cannot in any way be 
said of infinite mercy, and of infinite goodness, that it burns with anger and consumes;
wherefore from that doctrine they know and see that it is so said according to the 
appearance presented to man. AC 10431.

Verse 12, For I am a sojourner, with you, a stranger as all my fathers were. By a 
sojourner are signified those who were instructed in the truths of the church, and who 
received those truths, but by a stranger are meant those who were not willing to be 
instructed in the truths of the church, because they were not willing to receive them. 
AC 8002.

THE TRANSLATOR'S NOTES AND OBSERVATIONS

Verse 12, Hear my prayer, O JEHOVAH, give ear to my cry. A distinction is here made 
between prayers and a cry, also, between hearing and giving ear to: the distinction 
probably is grounded in what subsists between the will and the understanding, prayer 
having relation to the affection of the will in its application to the ALMIGHTY, and cry 
having relation to the thought of the understanding on the same occasion. The 
ALMIGHTY therefore is said to hear the former, and to give ear to the latter, to instruct 
us, that though he is attentive to both, yet his attention is more fixed on a devout 
desire of the heart, than on an enlightened application of the intellect. 

154

 
PSALM 40

To him that presides over the music, a Psalm of David.

I waited patiently for JEHOVAH, and he inclined to me, and heard my cry.

1.
2. And he brought me up out of the pit of devastation, out of the mire of clay, and

set my feet upon a rock; he has established my steps. 

3. And he has put a new song in my mouth, even praise to our GOD; many shall 

see it and fear, and shall put their trust in JEHOVAH.

4. Blessed is the man that makes JEHOVAH his confidence, and respects not the 

proud, and such as turn aside to a lie.

5. Many are your wonderful works, O JEHOVAH, my GOD, which you have done, 
and many are your thoughts towards us; no one can be compared with you; I 
would declare and speak of them, but they exceed all enumeration.
In sacrifice and offering you have not delighted; mine ears have you opened; 
burnt-offering and sin-offering have you not required.

6.

7. Then said I, Lo! I come, in the volume of the book it is written of me.
I delight to do your will, O my GOD, and your law is in my inner parts.
8.
I preach the glad tidings of justice in the great congregation; behold, my lips I 
9.
will not refrain, O JEHOVAH, you know.

10. Your justice I have not hid in the midst of my heart; your faithfulness and your
salvation I have declared; I have not concealed your mercy and your truth 
from the great congregation.

11. You, O JEHOVAH, will not withhold your mercies from me; your loving-

kindness and your truth will continually preserve me.

12. For innumerable evils have encompassed me; mine iniquities have taken hold 
of me, so that I am not able to see; they are more than the hairs of my head, 
and my heart fails me.

13. Be pleased, O JEHOVAH, to deliver me; O JEHOVAH, make haste to help me.
14. Let them be ashamed and blush together that seek my soul to destroy it; let 

them be turned backward and put to shame that wish me evil.

15. Let them be desolate as the reward of their shame, that say to me, Aha! Aha!
16. Let all those that seek you rejoice and be glad in you; let such as love your 

salvation say continually, may JEHOVAH be magnified!

17. As for me, I am afflicted and needy, but the LORD cares for me; you are my 

help and my deliverer, O my GOD, do not tarry.

The Internal Sense

A thanksgiving and celebration of the FATHER because he had assisted him, verses 1 to
5; that he came into the world as it is written in the Word, that he might do the will of 
the FATHER, verses 6 to 8; that he also preached the kingdom of GOD and taught, 
verses 9, 10; his confidence through his Divine principle as to those who seek his life, 
verses 11 to 15, 17; they will have joy in the LORD, who worship him, verse 16.

155

EXPOSITION

Verse 2. He brought me up out of the pit of devastation, out of the mire of clay, and set
my feet upon a rock. By a pit of devastation is signified the false principle of doctrine, 
and by the mire of clay the evil of life; and by setting the fact upon a rock the like is 
signified as above by making the feet to stand in the breadth, or in a broad place, since
by rock is signified the Truth of doctrine from the Word, and in the supreme sense the 
LORD as to Divine Truth. The very life itself, when it is in its fullness, is signified by 
standing on the feet, and it is then in its fullness, when the natural principle lives from
the spiritual; for the ultimate of the life of man is in his natural principle; this ultimate 
is as a basis to his interior and superior principles, for these close in the ultimate and 
there subsist; wherefore unless the life be in the ultimate, it is not full, thus neither is 
it perfect; and moreover, all interior and superior principles exist together in the 
ultimate, as in their simultaneous principle, hence, such as the ultimate is, such are 
interior and superior principles, for these accommodate themselves to the ultimate, 
because it receives them. AE 666.

Verse 3. And he has put a song into my mouth, even praise to our GOD. Songs in the 
ancient church, and afterwards in the Jewish, were prophetic, and treated of the LORD,
especially of his coming into the world, and destroying the diabolical crew at that 
time more raging than ever, and liberating the faithful from their assaults; and 
inasmuch as the prophetics of songs contained such things in the internal sense, hence
by them is signified the glorification of the LORD, that is, the celebration of him from 
gladness of heart, is especially expressed by a song, inasmuch as gladness in a song, 
breaks forth as it were of itself into sound: hence it is that JEHOVAH, that is, the LORD, 
in songs is called hero, a man of war, the God of armies, the conqueror, strength, 
defence, the only shield; and the diabolical crew, which was destroyed, is called the 
enemy which was smitten, swallowed up, overwhelmed, cast into hell. AC 8261.

Verses 6, 8. In sacrifice and offering you have not delighted; burnt-offering and sin-
offering you have not required: I delight to do your will, O GOD, and your law is in 
my inner parts. It is evident from these Words, that burnt-offerings and sacrifices 
were merely representative of internal worship, and that when they were separated 
from internal worship, they were idolatrous; this must be plain to every man of sound 
reason, for what is an altar, but something of stone, and what is burnt-offering and 
sacrifice but the slaying of a beast? If worship be Divine, it must represent the 
celestial principle which should be known and acknowledged, and from which 
worship should be paid to him whom they represent. AC 922.

That sacrifices were by no means acceptable to JEHOVAH, consequently that they were
only tolerated and permitted for the reason just now mentioned, appears plainly from 
the prophets, as in Jeremiah, "Thus says JEHOVAH of Hosts, the God of Israel, put your
burnt-offerings on your sacrifices and eat flesh. I did not speak with your fathers, nor 
commanded them in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt, concerning 
burnt-offerings and sacrifices; but this word I commanded them, saying, obey my 
voice, and I will be your GOD."Jer 7:21, 22, 23. And in David, "In sacrifice and 
offering have you not delighted; burnt-offerings and sacrifices for sin have you not 
required; I have desired to do your will O my God," Psalm 40:6, 8. AC 2180.

156

Verse 7. In the volume of the book it is written of me. It is to be noted that here, and in 
other passages in the Word, mention is made of a book, but that by it is meant a 
volume; for in ancient times writing was on parchment which was rolled together, and
the parchment was called a book, and the volume [or roll] of a book. AE 299.

The Word is Divine Truth, which in common constitutes heaven and the church, and 
in particular each angel, that heaven may be in him, and man, that the church may be 
in him. That by the book is understood the Word, may be seen in the Psalms of David,
"In the volume of the book it is written of me," Psalm 40:7; and Ezekiel, "I looked, 
and behold a hand was put forth to me, and in it was a volume of a book, written 
within and without," Ezek 2:8, 9. AR 256.

Verse 8. I delight to do your will, O my God. To do the will [or good pleasure] of GOD 
signifies to live according to his precepts; this is his good pleasure, or will, because 
from his Divine love he wills that all should be saved, and by it they are saved. The 
term good pleasure, in the Hebrew language, also signifies will, for whatever is done 
according to his. will, this is well-pleasing, and the Divine love wills nothing else then
that love from him should be with angels and men, and his love is then with them, 
when they love to live according to his precepts. AE 293.

Verse 17. I am poor and needy, remember me, O LORD, [ADONAI]. That by poor and 
needy are not meant poor and needy as to worldly riches, but as to spiritual riches, is 
evident, since David, who was a king, speaks this of him-self, wherefore also he said, 
"O JEHOVAH, incline your ear and answer." AE 238.

THE TRANSLATOR'S NOTES AND OBSERVATIONS.

Verse 14. Let them be ashamed and blush together that seek my soul to destroy it. It 
will appear that there is tautology in these words, until it be recollected, that to be 
ashamed has relation to the will, and to blush to the understanding and that both 
terms are here applied to denote that those two faculties are in the closest connection 
with each other.

Verse 17, O my GOD do not tarry. GOD never tarries, because he is in the continual act 
of exercising his divine mercy and providence for the general good of his creatures, 
but he appears to tarry when his creatures are in trial and temptation, on which 
occasion they cannot discern the rapidity with which he hastens for their deliverance.

PSALM 41

To him that presides, a Psalm of David.

1. Blessed is he that considers the poor, in the day of evil JEHOVAH will deliver 

2.

3.

him.
JEHOVAH will guard him, and keep him alive, and he shall be blessed upon the 
earth; and you will not give him up to the lust of his enemies.
JEHOVAH will support him on the couch of infirmity; you will make his bed in 
his sickness.

4. As for me, I said, JEHOVAH be merciful to me, heal my soul for I have sinned 

against you.

5. Mine enemies speak evil against me, saying, when shall he die, and his name 

perish?

6. And if he comes to see me, he speaks vanity; his heart gathers iniquity, he 

goes abroad, and tells it.

7. All that hate me whisper together against me: against me do they devise evil, 

saying:

8. May a cursed thing cleave fast to him, and now that he lies down, may he no 

more rise up.

9. Even the man of my peace, in whom I trust, and who did eat of my bread, has 

lifted up his heel against me.

10. But you, O JEHOVAH, be merciful to me, and raise me up, that I may requite 

them.

11. By this I know that you delight in me, because mine enemy does not triumph 

over me.

12. And as for me, you uphold me in mine integrity, and set me before your face 

for ever.

13. Blessed be JEHOVAH the GOD of Israel from age to age, Amen and Amen.

The Internal Sense

That he who is in temptations, and thence in affliction, is always supported and 
vivified thereby, verses 1 to 3; that the infernals among themselves contrive mischief 
against the LORD, verses 5 to 7; and think he is absolutely to be destroyed, verse 8, 
and even they also of the church where the Word is, verse 9; that they will not 
succeed, but will be destroyed, verses 10, 11. That the LORD has integrity, verses 12, 
13.

EXPOSITION

Verse 9. He that did eat of my bread has lifted up his heel against me. These words 
were spoken of the Jews, with whom were Divine Truths, because they had the Word, 
as may be manifest from John 13:18, where those Words were applied to the Jews, 
wherefore by eating the LORD'S bread is signified the appropriation of Divine Truth, 
in this case its communication, because it could not be appropriated to them; bread 
signifies the Word, from which comes spiritual nourishment: to lift up the heel against

158

him signifies to pervert the sense of the letter of the Word even to the denial of the 
LORD, and to the falsification of all truth; for Divine Truth is presented in an image as 
a man, whence heaven in the whole complex is called the grand man, and corresponds
to all things of man, for heaven is formed according to the Divine Truth proceeding 
from the LORD, and whereas the Word is Divine Truth, therefore also this before the 
LORD is in an image as a Divine man; therefore its ultimate sense, which is the sense 
of the letter, corresponds to the heel; the perversion of the Word, or of Divine Truth, 
by the application of the sense of the letter to falsities, such as were the traditions of 
the Jews; is signified by lifting up the heel against the LORD. AE 617.

Verse 13. From age to age. By ages of ages, when predicated of the LORD, is signified
eternity; the reason why eternity is not mentioned, but ages of ages, is because the 
latter is a natural expression, and the former a spiritual, and the literal sense of the 
Word is natural, and the internal sense spiritual, and the latter is contained in the 
former. AE 468.

Verse 13. Amen. Amen signifies the truth, and inasmuch as the LORD is truth itself 
therefore he so often says: Amen, (verily) I say to you. The LORD is called the Amen in
the Apocalypse: these things says the Amen, the faithful and true witness; Rev 3:14. 
That the LORD is Truth itself he himself teaches in John 14:6; 17:19. Amen, therefore, 
signifies the divine confirmation from the Truth, consequently from the LORD himself.
AR 23.

PSALM 42

To him that presides; instruction for the sons of Korah.

1. As the hart cries after the streams of water, so cries my soul after you, O GOD.
2. My soul thirsts for GOD, the living GOD; when shall I come and behold the face

of GOD?

3. My tears have been my bread day and night, while they every day said to me, 

where is your GOD?

4. When I remember those things, I pour out my soul within me; for I was wont 
to go with the multitude, to walk solemnly with them to the house of GOD, 
with the voice of praise and thanksgiving; the multitude celebrating a festival.
5. Why are you cast down, O my soul, why are you disquieted within me? Hope 

you in GOD, for I shall yet praise him; his countenance is salvation.

6. O my GOD, my soul is cast down within me, therefore will I remember you 
from the land of Jordan, and of the Hermonites from the mountain of Mitzar.
7. Abyss shouts to abyss at the noise of your waterspouts; all your billows and 

your waves are gone over me.

8. By day JEHOVAH will command his mercy; and by night his song will be with 

9.

me, even prayer to the GOD of my life.
I will say to GOD my rock, why have you forgotten me? Why go I mourning 
because of the oppression of the enemy?

10. As the crushing of my bones are the reproaches of mine enemies, whilst, they 

daily say to me, where is your GOD?

11. Why are you cast down, O my soul, and why are you disquieted within me? 
Hope you in God, for I shall yet praise him, the salvation of my countenance 
and my GOD.

The Internal Sense

Of the LORD'S state of grief and perturbation from his temptations, with his confidence
in his Divine principle, verses 1 to 6; the grievousness of his temptations even to 
despair, verses 7 to 10; his confidence through his Divine principle of being raised up,
verse 11.

EXPOSITION

Verse 1. As the hart cries after the streams of water, so cries my soul after you, O GOD.
Hart in this passage denotes the affection of truth; to cry after the streams of water, 
denotes to desire truth. AC 6413.

Verse 4. I walked solemnly with them to the house of GOD, with the voice of praise 
and thanksgiving. Since joy of heart is from celestial love and from spiritual love, it is
said, "Confess to JEHOVAH, sing to him a new song." AE 826.

Verse 5. Why are you cast down, O my soul, why are you disquieted within me? Hope 
you in GOD, for I shall yet praise him, his countenance is salvation. By the faces of 

160

JEHOVAH, of GOD, or the LORD, are meant the interior things of the church, of the 
Word, and of worship, because in those things is divine good and divine truth, thus the
LORD himself, and he is in things internal from them, and not in things external, 
namely: of the church, of the Word, and of worship, without them. AE 412.

Verse 6. Therefore will I remember You from the land of Jordan. The land of Jordan 
denotes that which is lowly, and thus what is distant from the celestial principle, as the
external things of man are from the internal, for the land of Canaan signifies the 
LORD'S kingdom and church, and indeed its celestial and spiritual principles, 
wherefore it was also called the holy land and the heavenly Canaan, and whereas it 
signified the LORD'S kingdom and church, it signifies in the supreme sense, the LORD 
himself, who is the all in all of his kingdom and church; hence all things, which were 
in the land of Canaan, were representative; the things in the midst of the land, or 
which were inmost, represented his internal man, as Mount Zion and Jerusalem, the 
former celestial things, and the latter spiritual; the things at a greater distance 
represented things more remote from internal; the ultimate things, or those which 
were the boundaries, represented the external man; the boundaries of Canaan were 
several in number, in general the two rivers, Euphrates and Jordan, also the sea; hence
Euphrates and Jordan represented external things. AC 1585.

That Jordan has the above signification, may be manifest also from these passages in 
the Word, as in David, "My GOD, my soul is cast down within me, therefore will I 
remember you from the land of Jordan, and of the Hermonites from the mount of 
littleness;" where to remember from the land of Jordan denotes from what is last, thus 
from what is low. AC 4255.

Verse 7. Abyss shouts to abyss at the noise of your waterspouts. By abyss in old time 
was signified hell, and the phantasies and persuasions of what is false, were likened to
waters and streams, also to smoke thence issuing; evil spirits, who devastate man, also
those who tempt, are from that, source; and their phantasies which they infuse, and 
the lusts with which they inflame man, are like inundations and exhalations issuing 
thence. AC 756.

By waves and billows are signified evils and falsities. AE 538.

Verse 9. I will say to GOD my rock, why have you forgotten me? By GOD the rock, is 
understood the LORD as to Divine Truth, in this passage as to defence. AE 411.

Verse 9. Why go I mourning [in black] because of the oppression of the enemy? Since 
mourning in the churches before the coming of the LORD, which were representative 
churches, represented spiritual grief of mind on account of the want of truth and good,
for mourning was for oppression by an enemy, for the death of a father or mother, and
similar reasons, and by oppression from an enemy was signified oppression from evils
which are from hell, and by father and mother was signified the church as to good and
as to truth; therefore these things were represented by mourning amongst them, and 
on those occasions they went in black. AE 372.

Verse 11. For I will yet praise him, the salvations of my countenance and my God. 
The salvations of my countenance signify all things which are within, thus which are 

161

of the mind and affections, consequently which are of the love and faith, which, as 
being saving, are called salvations. AE 412.

THE TRANSLATOR'S NOTES AND OBSERVATIONS

Verse 5. Why are you cast down, O my soul, why are you disquieted within me? To be 
cast down has relation to the will and its affections, to be disquieted within me has 
relation to the understanding and its thoughts, thus both expressions united point to 
the heavenly Marriage of the GOOD and the TRUE, which is a distinguishing 
characteristic of the HOLY WORD.

Verse 11. For I will yet praise him, the salvations of my countenance and my GOD. It 
was said above, at verse 5, I shall yet praise him; his faces are salvations. It is here 
said, I will yet praise him, the salvations of my countenance and my GOD, which is a 
plain proof that the faces of God, or his Divine love and wisdom, were the salvations 
spoken of in both cases.

162

PSALM 43

1. Judge me, O GOD, and plead my cause against an unmerciful nation; O deliver 

me from the man of deceit and iniquity.

2. For you are the GOD of my strength, why have you cast me off? Why go I 

mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?

3. Send out your light and your truth, let them guide me, let them bring me to the

mountain of your holiness and to your habitations.

4. And I will go to the altar of GOD, to GOD the joy of my exultation, and upon 

the harp will I praise you O GOD, my GOD.

5. Why are you cast down, O my soul, and why are you disquieted within me; 
hope you in GOD, for I will yet praise him, the salvation of my countenance 
and my GOD.

The Internal Sense

The grievousness of the LORD'S temptations even to despair, verses 1, 2. His prayer to 
the Father that Divine Truth may comfort him, verses 3, 4. His consolation, verse 5.

EXPOSITION

Verse 2. Why go I mourning [in black] because of the oppression of the enemy? See 
Exposition, at verse 9, of Psalm xlii.

Verses 3, 4. Send out your light and your truth, let them guide me, let them bring me 
to the mountain of your holiness, and to your habitations, and I will go to the altar of 
GOD, to GOD. That by the altar of GOD is here meant the LORD as to the DIVINE HUMAN
principle, is very manifest, for the subject treated of is concerning the way to heaven, 
and to the LORD there, the way to heaven is meant by send out your light and your 
truth, let them guide me, light is illustration in which truths appear; heaven to which 
they were to lead, is meant by the mountain of holiness and your habitations; the 
mountain of holiness is the heaven where the LORD'S celestial kingdom is, in which 
the good of love reigns; habitations are those heavens where the LORD'S spiritual 
kingdom is, in which truth grounded in that good prevails; and since both are meant, 
therefore it is said, that I may enter to the altar of GOD, to GOD, and by the altar of 
GOD is meant where the LORD is with the good of love, and by GOD is meant where 
the LORD is with truth derived from that good, for the LORD is called GOD from Divine
Truth, and JEHOVAH from Divine Good. AE 391.

Verse 4. Upon the harp will I praise you, O GOD, my GOD. That the harp signifies 
praise from spiritual truths, is evident, for it is said, upon the harp will I praise you, O
GOD, my GOD; and it is also before said, send out your light and your truth, they shall 
guide me. AE 323.

Verse 5. O my soul. It is impossible that any thing should be known, or even thought, 
respecting influx and the commerce of the soul with the body, unless it be known 
what the soul is, and also somewhat concerning its quality; if the soul be a thing 

163

unknown, nothing can be said concerning its influx and commerce; for how can the 
communication of two parts be a subject of thought, when the mind is in total 
ignorance concerning the quality of one of them? That ignorance prevails as to every 
quality of the soul, especially in the learned world, may be manifest from this 
consideration, that some believe it to be a certain aethereal principle, some a principle 
of flame or fire, some a principle of pure thought, some a principle of general vitality, 
some a principle of natural activity; and what is still a further proof of the prevailing 
ignorance concerning the nature of the soul is, that various places in the body are 
assigned it, some placing it in the heart, some in the brain, and in the fibres there, 
others in the striated bodies, others in the ventricles, and others in the small gland, 
some in every part; but in this case they conceive of a vital principle such as is 
common to every living thing; from which considerations it is evident, that nothing is 
known concerning the soul, and this is the reason why all that has been asserted on the
subject is grounded in mere conjecture. And whereas it was impossible thus to form 
any idea respecting the soul, the generality of mankind could not but believe, that the 
soul is a mere principle of vitality, which when the body dies, is dissipated; and hence 
it is, that the learned have less belief in a life after death than the simple, and in 
consequence of such unbelief, neither can they believe in the things belonging to that 
life, which are the celestial and spiritual things of faith and love; this is also evident 
from the LORD'S words in Matthew, "You have hid these things, from the wise and 
intelligent, and have revealed them to infants," Matt 11:25; and again, "Seeing they do
not see, and hearing they do not hear, neither do they understand," Matt 13:13; for the 
simple think no such thing concerning the soul, but believe that they shall live after 
death, in which simple faith lies concealed, although they are not aware of it, a belief 
that they shall live there as men, shall see angels, shall discourse with them, and enjoy
happiness. AC 6053.

As to what concerns the soul, of which it is said that it shall live after death, it is 
nothing else but the man himself, who lives in the body, that is, the interior man, who 
by the body acts in the world, and who gives to the body to live; this man, when he is 
loosed from the body, is called a spirit, and appears in this case altogether in a human 
form, yet cannot in any wise be seen by the eyes of the body, but by the eyes of the 
spirit, and before the eyes of the latter appears as a man in the world, has senses, 
namely of touch, of smell, of hearing, of seeing, much more exquisite than in the 
world; has appetites, cupidities, desires, affections, loves, such as in the world, but in 
a more excellent degree; thinks also as in the world, but more perfectly; discourses 
with others; in a word, he is there as in the world, insomuch that if he does not reflect 
upon the circumstance of his being in the other life, he knows no other than that he is 
in the world, which I have occasionally heard from spirits; for the life after death is a 
continuation of the life in the world. This then is the soul of man which lives after 
death. But lest the idea should fall upon somewhat unknown by using the term soul, in
consequence of the conjectures and hypotheses concerning it, it is better to say the 
spirit of man, or if you prefer it, the interior man, for it appears there altogether as a 
man, with all the members and organs that man has, and it is also the real man himself
in the body; that this is the case, may also be manifest from the angels seen, as 
recorded in the Word, who were all seen, in the human form, for all the angels in 
heaven have a human form, because the LORD has, who after his resurrection appeared
so often as a man. The ground and reason why an angel and the spirit of a man is a 
man in form is because the universal heaven from the LORD has a tendency to 
conspire to a human form, whence the universal heaven is called the grand man, 

164

which man, and the correspondence of all things of man therewith, have been treated 
of at the close of several chapters; and whereas the LORD lives in every individual in 
heaven, and by influx from the universal heaven acts upon every individual, therefore 
every angel is an image thereof, that is, a form most perfectly human, in like manner 
man after death. All the spirits, as many as I have seen, which are thousands and 
thousands, have been seen by me altogether as men, and some of them have said that 
they are men as in the world, and have added, that in the life of the body they had not 
the least belief that it would be so; many have expressed concern, that mankind are in 
such ignorance respecting their state after death, and that they entertain such vain and 
empty thoughts concerning the soul, and that several, who have thought more deeply 
on the subject, have made the soul into somewhat as it were of a subtle aerial 
principle, which idea must needs lead into that insane error, that it is dissipated after 
death. AC 5054.

Verse 5. I will yet praise him the salvations of my countenance [or faces] and my GOD.
The salvations of the faces signify all things which are within, thus which are of the 
mind and affections, consequently which are of the love and faith, which, as being 
saving, are called salvations. Evil affections, which are lusts, are also expressed by the
faces, because they appear in the face, for the face is the external or natural form of 
the interiors which are of the mind [anima] and of the mind [mens]; also in the 
spiritual world they make one, for it is not there allowed to assume the semblance of 
any other face than what is of the affections, thus which corresponds to the interiors of
the mind; hence it is that the angels of heaven have dignified and beautiful faces, 
whereas the infernal spirits have faces dark and deformed. AE 412.

The Translator's Notes and Observations

Verse 3. Send out your light and your truth. A distinction appears here to be made 
between light and truth, when yet they are one and the same, light being the internal 
of truth, and truth the external. It is possible to have truth without light, as is the case 
with those who read the letter of the WORD without attending to its spiritual meaning, 
which is properly the light of the letter, and without which the letter is darkness.

165

PSALM 44

To him that presides over the music; a Psalm of instruction for the sons of Korah.

1. O God, we have heard with our ears, our fathers have told us the works you 

did in their days,—in the days of old.

2. You did drive out the nations with your hand, but them you did plant; you did 

destroy the peoples, but them you did cause to spread.

3. For they got not the land in possession by their own sword, and their own arm 
did not save them; but your right hand, and your arm, and the light of your 
countenance, because you did favour them.

4. You are my king O GOD, command salvations for JACOB.
5. Through you we will push down our oppressors; through your name will we 

tread them under that rise up against us.

6. For I will not trust in my bow, and my sword shall not save me.
7. For you have saved us from our oppressors, and have put them to shame that 

hate us.
In GOD we glory all the day, and will praise your name for ever. Selah.

8.
9. But now you have cast us off, and have put us to shame, and go not forth with 

our armies.

10. You make us to turn back from the enemy, and they who hate us spoil for 

themselves.

11. You have given us like sheep for meat, and have scattered us among the 

nations.

12. You have sold your people for nought, and have not become rich by their 

price.

13. You make us a reproach to our neighbours, a scorn and derision to them that 

are round about us.

14. You make us a proverb amongst the nations, a shaking of the head amongst the

peoples.

15. Every day my disgrace is before me, and the shame of my face has covered 

me.

16. Because of the voice of him that reviles and blasphemes, by reason of the 

enemy and the self-avenger.

17. All this is come upon us, yet have we not forgotten you, nor dealt falsely with 

your covenant.

18. Our heart is not turned back, and our steps have not declined from your way.
19. For you have bruised us in the place of dragons, and have covered us with the 

shadow of death.

20. If we have forgotten the name of our GOD, and stretched out our hands to any 

strange God;

21. Will not God search this out? For he knows the secrets of the heart.
22. For on your account, are we killed every day, we are reputed as sheep 

appointed for slaughter.

23. Awake, why sleep you, O LORD? Arise, cast us not off for ever.
24. Wherefore hide you your face? Wherefore forget you our afflictions and our 

oppression?

25. For our soul is bowed down to the dust, our belly cleaves to the earth.

166

26. Arise for our help, deliver us for your mercy's sake.

The Internal Sense

That the church was established by the Lord among the ancients, after ejecting the 
evil, verses 1 to 4; that this was done by God and not by men, verses 5 to 8; that 
nevertheless the hells now prevail over him, as though there were no Divine presence,
whence it comes, that there is no church, verses 9 to 12, 19; that he is blasphemed by 
the evil in the church, verses 13 to 16; notwithstanding his integrity, verses 17 to 21; 
that he endures, this for the sake of the Divine principle, verse 22; a prayer that the 
Divine principle may therefore assist him, verses 23, 26; that he is an extreme state of 
temptations, as though he were deserted, verses 24, 25.

Exposition

Verse 3. Their own arm did not save them, but your right hand, and your arm, and the
light of your faces. It is said, your right hand, and your arm, and the light of your 
faces, because the right hand denotes power, the arm denotes strength, and the light 
of your faces denotes the Divine Truth from the Divine Good. AC 10019.

Verse 5. Through you will we push dawn (as an ox with his horns) our enemies. 
Striking with the horn in the Word is said of the destruction of the false by the power 
of truth, and in the opposite sense, of the destruction of truth by the power of the 
false; and this by reason that by horn is signified the power of truth derived from 
good, and of the false derived from evil, AC 2832, as in Ezekiel, "You push with side 
and shoulder, and with your horns you strike all that are infirm," Ezek 34:21, speaking
of those who with all force and power destroy the truths and goods of the church by 
fallacious reasoning grounded in things sensual; to push with the side and shoulder 
denotes with all force and power, AC 1085, 4931 to 4937; hence it is evident why 
mention is made of striking with the horn in Moses, "The first-begotten of his ox, he 
has honour, and his horns are the horns of a unicorn, with these shall he strike the 
people together to the ends of the earth," Deut 33:17; these words are in the prophecy 
of Moses concerning Joseph, where by Joseph in the internal sense is meant the LORD 
as to the Divine spiritual [principle], and in the representative sense his spiritual 
kingdom; the horns of a unicorn denote those things which are of power derived from 
the good and truth of faith; to strike the people denotes to destroy falsities by truths; to
the ends of the earth denotes from all sides where the church is. And in David, "You 
are my king, O GOD, by you will we strike with the horn our enemies" Psalm 44:4, 5, 
where to strike enemies with the horn denotes also to destroy falsities by the power of 
the truth and good of faith: who cannot see, that in the above passages no mention 
would have been made of striking with the horn, as being done by men, unless on 
account of the signification of horn, as denoting power. AC 9081.

Verse 9. But you have cast us off, and put us to shame, and go not forth with our 
armies. That God did not go forth with their armies, signifies that he did not protect 
them, because they were in the falsities of evil, for armies denote the falsities of evil, 
wherefore also it is said, that he forsook them and put them to shame, and that he 
made them return from the enemy, the enemy being evil which is from hell. AE 573.

167

Verse 14. You make us a proverb among the nations, and a shaking of the head 
amongst the peoples. In this passage, peoples denote those who are against the truths 
of the spiritual church, thus who are in falsities, and nations those who are against the 
goods of the celestial church, thus who are in evils. AE 331.

Verse 19. For you have bruised us in the place of dragons, and have covered us with 
the shadow of death. These words also relate to temptations; that man in such case is 
precluded from influx out of heaven, like the sensual man; that he does not perceive 
what is good and what is true, is signified by GOD bruising him in a place of dragons, 
and, covering him with, the shadow of death, a place of dragons denoting the abode 
of those who are dragons in hell, namely: who have destroyed in themselves all good;
the false principle, in which the same are, is called the shadow of death. AE 714.

Verses 22, 23. For on your account we are killed all the day, we are reputed as the 
flock of slaughter. Awake, why sleep you, O LORD? forsake us not for ever. We are 
killed all the day, signifies that of ourselves, we are always falling into falsities, and 
are seduced by them, especially in the time when falsities reign; hence it is evident 
what is signified by the flock of slaughter, that we may be elevated from them by the 
LORD, is signified by Awake, O Lord, forsake us not for ever. AE 314.

Verses 25, 26. Our soul is bowed down to the dust, our belly cleaves to the earth. 
Arise for our help. In old time, by the belly were signified things which are nearest to 
the earth, by the breast those things which are above the earth, and by the head things 
supreme; this was also signified in the Jewish church by the depression of the belly to 
the earth, and by the sprinkling of dust upon the head; so in David, "Wherefore hide 
you your faces, wherefore forget you our affliction and our oppression, for our soul is 
bowed down to the dust, and our belly cleaves to the earth. "Arise for our help," Ps 
44:24, 25, 26, where it is also manifest that when man averts himself from the faces of
JEHOVAH, he adheres with the belly to the dust and the earth. AC 247.

By the soul and by the belly in the spiritual sense is here also signified the thought of 
the understanding, and by being bowed down to the dust and cleaving to the earth, is 
signified that it was tainted with falsities, for by dust and the earth is signified what is 
infernal and damned. AE 622.

PSALM 45

To him that presides upon Shoshannim; for the sons of Korah, instruction, a Song of 
Loves.

1. My heart swells with a noble theme; I will speak of my works to the king; my 

tongue is the pen of a ready writer.

therefore GOD has blessed you for ever.

3. Gird your sword upon your thigh, O most mighty, with your glory and your 

majesty.

the heart of the king's enemies.

6. Your throne, O GOD, is for ever and ever, a sceptre of rectitude is the sceptre of

your kingdom.

7. You love justice, and hate iniquity; therefore GOD, your GOD, has anointed you

with the oil of gladness above your companions.

8. All your garments are anointed with myrrh, aloes, and casia; out of the ivory 

palaces they have made you glad with stringed instruments.

9. King's daughters are among your excellent women, on your right hand stands 

the queen in the best gold of Ophir.

your father's house.

11. Then shall the king greatly desire your beauty, for he is your LORD, and bow 

yourself down before him.

12. And the daughter of Tyre shall come with a gift; the rich among your people 

shall entreat your favour.

13. The king's daughter is all glorious within; her clothing is embroidered with 

gold.

king's palace.

16. In the place of your fathers shall be your sons; you shall make them princes in 

all the earth.

17. I will make your name to be remembered in all generations; therefore shall the

people praise you for ever and ever.

The Internal Sense

Of the glorification of the LORD'S humanity and of heaven and the church from him. A
magnificent saying concerning the LORD and conjunction with him, verse, 1, 2; that 
Divine Truth belongs to him alone, verse 2; that by Divine Truth he powerfully 
overcame the hells, verses 3 to 5; that his kingdom is eternal, verse 6; that he made his
Humanity divine thereby, verses 7, 8; whence heaven and the church are his, which 
are in Divine Truths from him, verse 8; that thence come the affections of truth, in 

169

which the heavenly societies are, verse 9; of the church where the Word is, that it 
must recede from the affections of the natural man, verse 10; that so it will be the 
LORD'S church, verse 11; and will possess knowledges of truth and good, with 
sciences subservient, verses 12 to 14; that thus there will be conjunction with the 
LORD in heaven, verse 15; that all primary truths are his, verse 16; that the universal 
church will serve the LORD, verse 17.

Exposition

Verses 1, 2, 3, 5. A song of love, my heart swells with a noble theme; my tongue is the 
pen of a ready writer; you are more beautiful than the son of man; grace is poured 
into your lips; ride on the Word of truth, of meekness and of justice; your right hand 
shall teach you wonderful things. To ride on the Word of Truth, of meekness and if 
justice, is to teach the doctrine of truth and of good; in this, as in other parts of the 
Word, a distinct signification is affixed to word, mouth, lip, and tongue; that they have
reference to the doctrine concerning charity, is manifest, because it is called a song of 
loves, of which doctrine is predicated a beauty superior to the sons of man, grace of 
the lip, a right hand which teaches wonderful things. AC 1288.

To ride on the Word of truth manifestly denotes the intelligence of truth, and upon the 
Word of meekness and of justice, denotes the wisdom of good. AC 2761.

Verses 2 to 9. That the contents of these verses have relation to the LORD, is evident 
from singular the things contained in this Psalm, and hence that he it is of whom it is 
written, GOD has anointed you, your GOD, with the oil of gladness, with myrrh, aloes, 
and casia, are all your garments: from the series it may be manifest what is signified 
by these words, namely: that he has divine wisdom, and that from him is the doctrine 
of divine truth; this is signified by being more beautiful than the sons of man, by 
grace being poured on your lips; beautiful signifies being wise, the sons of man 
signify their intelligence in divine truth, and lips signify doctrinals: his omnipotence 
from divine truth grounded in divine good, and hence the destruction of falsities and 
of evils, and the subjugation of the hells, is signified by gird your sword upon your 
thigh, O most mighty, with your glory and majesty and in your majesty ride 
prosperously on the word of truth, of meekness and of justice, your right hand shall 
teach you wonderful things, your arrows are sharp; the people shall fall under you; 
they penetrate the heart of the king's enemies: by a sword is signified truth fighting 
against what is false and destroying it; by chariot the doctrine of Truth in like manner 
by the Word of Truth; by riding is signified to instruct and to combat; by the right 
hand Omnipotence; by arrows are signified Truths combating, by people those who 
are in the false principles of evil, and by the king's enemies those who are against 
Truths, thus the hells; that hence he has a kingdom and dominion, is signified by your
throne O GOD, is for ever and ever, a sceptre of rectitude is the sceptre of your 
kingdom; a sceptre of rectitude is the Divine Truth which has power and a kingdom; 
that in consequence of delivering the good from damnation by destroying the evil, the 
essential Divine [principle] united itself to its Human [principle], is signified by you 
have loved justice and hated iniquity, therefore GOD has anointed you, your GOD, with
the oil of gladness above your companions; to love justice and to hate iniquity, 
signifies to deliver the good from damnation by destroying the evil; to anoint with the
oil of gladness signifies to unite himself by victories in temptations; GOD, your God, 
signifies the reciprocal union of the Human [principle] with the Divine, and of the 

170

Divine with the Human-Divine Truths united with Divine Goods are signified by he 
anointed with myrrh, aloes and casia all your garments, myrrh signifying the good of 
the ultimate degree, aloes the good of the second, and casia the good of the third; in 
like manner as those three aromatics mixed with oil of olive whence the oil of 
holiness by which anointing was made' Exod 30:23, 24; this oil signified the Divine 
good of the Divine love, and the garments which were anointed signify Divine Truths;
that the spiritual affections of truth are for those who are of his kingdom, is signified 
by the daughters of kings being among your excellent women, the daughters of kings 
being the spiritual affections of truth, which are said to be excellent when the truths 
are genuine; and that heaven and the church are in his protection and conjoined to 
him, because in love to him from him, is signified by the queen standing at his right 
hand in the best gold of Ophir; queen signifying heaven and the church; at the right 
hand [signifying in protection and conjunction with him, find the best gold of Ophir 
denoting love to the LORD. AE 684.

Verse 3. Gird your sword upon your thigh, O most mighty, with your glory and 
majesty, ride upon the Word of Truth. To gird the sword upon the thigh signifies divine
truth combating from divine good, that this is signified by sword upon the thigh, see 
AC 10485; and whereas from divine truth he subdued the hells, and arranged the 
heavens into order, therefore it is said, O most mighty, with your glory and majesty, 
and also, ride on the Word of Truth; to ride on the Word of Truth signifies to act from 
divine good by divine truth. AE 288. See also AE 298.

Inasmuch as chariots and horses signify doctrine from the Word and the 
understanding of it, and all doctrine of truth and its understanding is out of heaven 
from the LORD, therefore it is said of him, that he rides on the Word, on the clouds, on 
heaven, on a cherub, and that he causes to ride. AE 355.

Verses 7, 8. That odoriferous myrrh denotes sensual truth, is manifest from David, 
"You have loved justice, therefore GOD has anointed you, your GOD, with the oil of 
gladness above your companions, with myrrh, aloes, and casia; all your garments," 
those things are said of the LORD, who alone is the anointed of JEHOVAH, since the 
divine good of the divine love, which is signified by the oil of anointing, was in him; 
by his garments, which are said to be anointed with myrrh, aloes, and casia, are 
signified divine truths from divine good in the natural principle. AC 10262.

Verse 9. On your right hand did stand the queen in the best gold of Ophir. In the Word
throughout it is said of angels and of the men of the church, that they stand before 
GOD, also that they walk before him, and in the spiritual sense by standing before him 
is signified to be from him, and by walking before GOD is signified to live according 
to being from him. AE 639.

By a queen, who stood at the right hand in the gold of Ophir, is signified the church 
from the reception of good from the LORD; inasmuch as all things belonging to man, 
which are on the right side, have reference to good from which truth is derived, and 
those on the left side to truth derived from good, therefore it is said that the queen 
stands on the right hand. AC 9941, and AR 620, and AC 9688.

Verse 11. Hear, O daughter, and see, incline your ear, then shall the king greatly 
desire your beauty. To hear, to see, and to incline the ear, which are said of the king's 

171

daughter, signifies to hearken, to perceive, and to obey, thus to understand, to do, and 
to be wise from the LORD; that in such case she will be accepted of the LORD, is 
signified by then shall the king greatly desire your beauty; beauty is predicated of the 
affection of truth, for this makes the beauty of angels; therefore bow down yourself to 
him signifies worship from a humble heart; and the daughter of Tyre shall send a gift 
signifies worship from those who are in the knowledges of truth; the rich among the 
people shall entreat your favour signifies adoration from those who are in intelligence
derived from those knowledges; the king's daughter is all glorious within, signifies 
the spiritual affection of truth, which is said to be glorious from the abundance of 
truth, and within signifies what is spiritual; her clothing of the foldings of gold 
signifies truths formed from the good of love; she shall be brought to the king in 
needlework, signifies appearances of truth, such as are in the sense of the letter of the 
Word; her friends that follow her signify the spiritual and natural affections 
subservient; with gladness and exultation shall they be brought, they shall enter into 
the king's palace, signifies with heavenly joy into heaven, where the LORD is. AE 863.
See also AE 242 and AE 412.

Verses 14, 15. The king's daughter is all glorious within, her clothing is embroidered 
with gold, she shall be brought to the king in clothing of needlework. By the king's 
daughter is signified the spiritual affection of truth, and hence the church consisting 
of those who are in that affection; king signifies the Lord as to divine truth; clothing 
embroidered with gold signifies intelligence and wisdom from that truth; the 
needlework in which she shall be brought to the king are the knowledges of truth. AE 
195.

172

PSALM 46

To him that presides; a song for the sons of Korah, upon Alamoth.

1. GOD is our refuge and strength; he is found to be a powerful help in trouble.
2. Therefore we will not fear though the earth be moved, and the mountains be 

cast into the heart of the seas.

3. Though the waters thereof roar and foam; though the mountains shake with the

swellings thereof. Selah.

4. There is a river, the streams whereof shall make glad the city of GOD, the holy 

place of the tabernacles of the Most High.

5. GOD is in the midst of her, she shall not be moved; GOD shall help her at the 

return of the morning.

6. The nations rage, the kingdoms are moved; he utters his voice, and the earth 

melts away.
JEHOVAH of Hosts is with us, the GOD of Jacob is our defence. Selah.

7.
8. Come you, behold the works of JEHOVAH, who makes desolations in the earth.
9. He makes wars to cease to the end of the earth; he breaks the bow, and cuts the

spear to pieces, he burns the chariot with fire.

10. Be still, and know that I am GOD; I will be exalted among the nations, I will be

exalted in the earth.

11. JEHOVAH of Hosts is with us; the GOD of Jacob is our defence. Selah.

The Internal Sense

That there will be protection from the LORD when the last judgement comes and 
continues, verses 1 to 3, 6, 7; that they who are of the church, and in the doctrine of 
truth, will be saved by the LORD when he comes, verses 4, 5; that they will have 
nothing to fear from the infernals and their infestations, verses 8, 9; that this comes of 
the LORD, verses 10, 11.

EXPOSITION

Verses 2, 3, 4. Therefore we will not fear, though the earth be moved, and the 
mountains be cast into the heart of the seas; though the waters thereof roar and foam;
though the mountains shake with the swelling thereof: [There is] a river, the streams 
whereof shall make glad the city of GOD, the holy [place] of the tabernacles of the 
MOST HIGH, GOD is in the midst of her, she shall not be moved. These Words in the 
spiritual sense involve, that although the church, with all things belonging to it, 
perishes, still the Word and the Divine Truth contained in it will not perish, for by the 
earth is signified the church, by the mountains its goods of love, by the waters truths, 
and by the waters thereof roaring and foaming, their states when they perish, and 
falsities and evils enter in their place; consequently the state of the church, when it is 
vastated as to goods, and desolated as to truths; but see above, AE 304, 405, where 
those things are more fully explained. That the Word, or Divine Truth for the church, 
will not perish, is signified by a river, whose streams shall make glad the city of God, 
not being moved; river here signifies the same as fountain, namely the Word, because 

173

mention is made of its streams, by which are signified truths; the city of GOD signifies 
the church as to doctrine; to make glad, signifies influx and reception from joy of 
heart, and not to be moved signifies not to perish as to any thing. AE 518.

By the mountains which shall be cast into the heart of the seas, are signified the evils 
of the love of self, and of the world. AE 405.

By waters are signified the truths of the church, which are said to roar or be disturbed
when they are falsified; by nations are signified the goods of the church, and in the 
opposite sense its evils; and by kingdoms the truths of the church, and in the opposite 
sense its falsities, likewise those who are principled in the latter and the former. AE 
304.

Jerusalem was called the holy city, because it signified the church as to the doctrine of 
Truth, and the Divine Truth proceeding from the LORD is what is called holy. That the 
city, without such representation and consequent signification, would on no account 
have been called holy, but rather profane, may be manifest from this consideration, 
that they rejected the LORD and crucified him there, wherefore also it is called Sodom 
and Egypt, Rev 11:8, but since it signified the church as to the doctrine of truth, it was
called not only the holy city, but also the city of God and the city of the GREAT KING. 
AE 223.

Verse 5. God shall help her at the, return of the morning. Inasmuch as morning 
signifies the LORD, his coming, also his kingdom and church, and likewise the good of
love which is from him, it may hence be manifest what is meant by morning in the 
following passages, "Make me to hear your mercy in the morning," Psalm 142:8: 
again, "I will sing of your mercy in the morning," 59:17; again, "GOD shall help her at 
the return of the morning." AE 179.

Verse 9. He makes wars to cease to the end of the earth, he breaks the bow, and cuts 
the spear to pieces, he burns the chariot with fire. In this passage by JEHOVAH making
wars to cease to the end of the earth, is signified that he makes combats to cease, 
understood in a spiritual sense, which are of falsities against the truths and goods of 
the church. See above, AE 357. AE 734.

Inasmuch as by wars are signified spiritual combats, which are of what is false against
the truth and good of the church, it is hence evident what is signified by JEHOVAH 
making wars to cease to the end of the earth, namely: that he makes to cease all 
combat and all disagreement from the first principles to the last of the truth of the 
church; the end [extremity] of the earth signifies its last principles; that there shall be 
no combat of doctrine against doctrine, is signified by his breaking the bow; that there
will be no combat from any false principles of evil, is signified by cutting the spear to
pieces; and that he will entirely destroy the doctrine of what is false, by his burning 
the chariots with fire. AE 357.

174

PSALM 47

To him that presides; a Psalm of the sons of Korah.

1. O clap your hands all you peoples; sing to God with the voice of triumph.
2. For JEHOVAH is most High; he is greatly to be feared; he is a great king over 

all the earth.

3. He will subdue the peoples under us, and the nations under our feet.
4. He shall choose for us our inheritance, even the excellency of Jacob whom he 

loved. Selah.

5. GOD is gone up with a shout; JEHOVAH with the voice of a trumpet.
6. Sing praises to GOD, sing praises; sing praises to our king, sing praises.
7. For GOD is the king of all the earth; sing you praises with understanding.
8. GOD reigns over the nations; GOD sits on the throne of his holiness.
9. The princes of the people are gathered together, the people of the GOD of 
Abraham; for the shields of the earth are GOD'S; he is greatly exalted.

The Internal Sense

Of the LORD'S kingdom, celebration of the LORD, in that he reigns over the church, 
verses 1, 2; that he will remove falsities and evils, verse 3; that, he will restore the 
church, verses 4, 5; that he will therefore be celebrated, verse 6; because the 
government of the universal church is his, verses 7, 8; and of the heavens, verse 9.

Exposition

Verses 1, 5, 6, 7, 8. O clap your hands all you peoples, sing to GOD with the voice of 
triumph. GOD is gone up with a shout, JEHOVAH with the voice of a trumpet. Sing 
praises to GOD, sing praises to our king, sing praises. For GOD is the king of all the 
earth, sing you praises with understanding. Inasmuch as there are various affections 
of good and truth, and each affection is uttered by a suitable tone, therefore in the 
WORD various kinds of instruments are mentioned, especially in David, by which 
similar affections are signified. He who is acquainted with the internal sense of the 
Word, and at the same time with the tones of the instruments there mentioned, may 
know what affection is there signified and described: the angels know this from the 
bare mention of them, and at the same time from the thing with its expressions there 
described, when man reads the WORD, as for example in David, "Clap your hands all 
you peoples, sing to GOD with the voice of triumph; GOD is gone up with a shout, 
JEHOVAH with the voice of a trumpet; sing to GOD, sing to our king, for GOD is the 
king of all the earth, sing with understanding." Again, "They have seen your goings, O
GOD, the goings of my GOD; the singers went before, the minstrels follow after, in the 
midst of the virgins playing with the timbrels," Psalm 68:25, 26, 27. Again, "Sing you 
aloud to GOD our strength, make a joyful noise to the GOD of Jacob; lift up a song, and
bring here the timbrel, the pleasant harp, with the psaltery; blow up the trumpet in the 
new moon," Psalm 81:1, 2, 3. Again, "Praise GOD with the sound of the trumpet, 
praise him with the psaltery and harp, praise him with the timbrel and dance; praise 
him with stringed instruments and organs; praise him with the loud cymbals, praise 

175

him upon the high-sounding cymbals." Psalm 150:3, 4, 5. All the instruments here 
named, signify affections, each its particular one, and this from the agreement of their 
sound, for affections are what produce varieties of tones with men, whence also from 
the tones affections are known. To the above I will add this arcanum: the angels, who 
in heaven constitute the LORD'S celestial kingdom, draw the internal sense of the Word
from the affection alone of man when he reads the Word, resulting also from the 
sound of the expressions in the original tongue; but the angels, who are in the LORD'S 
spiritual kingdom, draw the internal sense from the truths which the expressions 
contain; hence from the celestial kingdom man has heartfelt joy who is in spiritual 
affection, and from the spiritual kingdom confession from that joy; the sounds of 
musical instruments, which are there named, elevate the affection, and truths form it. 
AE 326.

Verse 5. God is gone up with a shout, JEHOVAH with the voice of a trumpet. Truth 
divine itself in heaven is signified by voices and lightnings, but celestial or angelic 
truth adjoined to divine, which is beneath or around, is signified by the voice of a 
trumpet; as in Zech. "JEHOVAH shall appear over them, and his weapon shall go forth 
as lightning, and the LORD JEHOVAH shall sound with a trumpet, and shall advance in 
the storms of the south," Zech 9:14; and in David, "God is gone up with a shout; 
JEHOVAH with the voice of a trumpet," Psalm 47:5; where shout denotes the truth of 
spiritual good, the voice of a trumpet denotes the truth of celestial good. AC 8815.

Verse 8. GOD sits on the throne of his holiness. Inasmuch as by the angels, also by the 
twelve apostles, and likewise by the twelve tribes of Israel, are signified all the truths 
of the church, and in the supreme sense the Divine Truth, therefore by sitting on 
thrones is not meant that they themselves will sit, but that the LORD as to Divine 
Truth, from which is judgement; and by judging the twelve tribes of Israel, is signified
to judge all according to the truths of their church: hence it is evident that sitting on a 
throne, when predicated of the LORD, is signified to be judging, thus to judge; it is 
called a throne of glory, because glory signifies Divine Truth. AR 687.

Verse 9. The shields of the earth are GOD'S, he is greatly exalted. Shield in respect to 
JEHOVAH is defence, and in respect to man is confidence; as in David, "My shield is 
with GOD, who saves the upright in heart," Psalm 7:9, 10; where shield denotes 
confidence; again, "The shields of the earth are GOD'S, he is greatly exalted," Psalm 
47:9; in like manner denoting confidence. AC 1788.

The Translator's Notes and Observations

Verse 1. O clap your hands all you people. This expression the clapping of hands will 
suggest to the intelligent reader not only a sufficient mark of joy and delight, but also 
a lesson of instruction arising from the correspondence of the two hands, when it is 
considered that the right hand is a figure of good, and the left of truth, consequently 
that clapping has here relation to the conjunction of those two principles, and the 
necessity of such conjunction, as the proper legitimate source of all true joy. 

The same intelligent reader will not fail to observe, that the two names JEHOVAH and 
KING, as applied to the DIVINE BEING, at verse 2, and the two names GOD and 
JEHOVAH, which occur at verse 5, and further proofs of the DIVINE MARRIAGE of the 

176

GOOD and TRUE, so often above pointed at, as the sure and certain marks of the Divine
origin of revealed truth.

177

PSALM 48

A Song, a Psalm of the sons of Korah.

1. Great is JEHOVAH, and greatly to he praised, in the city of our God, the 

mountain of his holiness.

2. Beautifully elevated, the joy of the whole earth is Mount Zion; on the sides of 

the north is the city of the GREAT KING.
3. GOD is known in her palaces as a refuge.
4. For lo! the kings were assembled, they passed by together;
5. They saw it, then they marvelled; they were troubled, they hastened away.
6. Terror seized upon them there, even pain as of a woman in travail.
7. You break in pieces the ships of Tarshish by an east-wind.
8. As we have heard, so have we seen, in the city of JEHOVAH of hosts, in the city

of our GOD; GOD will establish it for ever.

9. We considered your mercy, O GOD, in the midst of your temple.
10. According to your name, O God, so is your praise to the ends of the earth; 

your right hand is full of justice.

11. Mount Zion shall be glad, the daughters of Judah shall exult, because of your 

judgements.

12. Walk about Zion, go round about her, number her towers.
13. Set your heart to her bulwarks, observe distinctly her palaces, that you may 

tell it to the generation following.

14. Truly, this GOD is our GOD for ever and ever; he shall lead us even to death.

The Internal Sense

Of the LORD'S spiritual kingdom, how admirable, verses 1 to 3, 8; that he dissipates all
falsities, verses 4 to 7; that his DIVINE HUMAN [principle] does this, verses 9, 10; that 
thence are all things of heaven and the church, because the LORD reigns there, verses 
12 to 13.

Exposition

Verses 1, 2, 3. Great is JEHOVAH, and greatly to be praised in the city of our GOD, the 
mountain of his holiness. Beautifully elevated, the joy of the whole earth is mount 
Zion, on the sides of the north is the city of the GREAT KING. GOD is known in her 
palaces as a refuge. By these words is described the worship of the LORD from truths 
derived from good; the worship of him from spiritual truths and goods, and the 
pleasantness thence derived to the soul, is signified by great is JEHOVAH, and greatly 
to he praised in, the city of our GOD, the mountain of his holiness, beautifully elevated
is mount Zion; worship is meant by being great, and greatly to be praised; spiritual 
truth from spiritual good by in the city of our God, the Mountain of his holiness, and 
the pleasantness of soul thence derived by beautifully elevated; the worship of the 
LORD from celestial goods and truths is described by the joy of the whole earth, mount
Zion, the sides of the north, the city of the GREAT KING; worship from celestial good is 
meant by the joy of the whole earth, the mountain of Zion, the sides of the north, the 

178

city of the GREAT KING; the sides of the north are truths from celestial good, and the 
city of the GREAT KING is the doctrine of truth thence derived; that truths are inscribed 
on those who are in celestial good, is signified by GOD is known in her palaces. The 
reason why the sides of the north signify truths from celestial good, is because they 
who are in the LORD'S celestial kingdom, dwell in the east in heaven, and they who are
in truths from that good dwell towards the north there. AE 405.

Verse 7. You break in pieces the ships of Tarshish by an east wind. The winds, which 
exist in the spiritual world, appear to arise there from different quarters, some from 
the south, some from the north, and some from the east; those from the south disperse 
truths with those who are in falsities, and those from the east disperse goods with 
those who are in evils; the reason why winds disperse them is because they exist from 
a powerful and strong influx of the Divine [principle] through the heavens into things 
inferior, and where this influx has place, it fills truths and goods, that is the minds 
[mentes] and the minds [animos] of those who are in truths and goods with the Divine
[principle], wherefore they, with whom the interiors of the mind [mens] and of the 
mind [animus] are mere falsities and evils, and exteriorly truths are mixed with 
falsities and goods with evils, do not endure such influx from the Divine [being or 
principle], consequently they take themselves to their own falsities and evils which 
they love, and reject the truths and goods which they do not love except for 
themselves and for the sake of appearance: from these considerations it is evident 
what effect is produced by a wind coming from the east; which is called an east wind, 
namely that with the evil it disperses all goods and truths, which they have exhibited 
in an external form before the world, and which they have spoken for the sake of 
appearance. AE 219.

The ships of Tarshish denote rituals or doctrinals, AC 1156.

That wind, specifically an east wind, signifies nothing else but the dispersion of 
falsities and evils, or, what is the same thing, of evil spirits and genii, and afterwards 
arrangement into order, may be manifest from the WORD, as in Isaiah, "You will 
disperse them, and the wind will take them away, and the storm will dissipate them," 
Is 41:16; and in David, "Lo! the kings gathered themselves together, they passed 
together, they saw, then they marvelled, they were troubled, they hastened away, 
terror seized upon them there, even pain as of a woman in travail; you break in pieces 
as by an east wind the ships of Tarshish." Here is described the terror and confusion 
occasioned by an east wind. This description is taken from those things which occur 
in the world of spirits, for the internal sense of the Word involves it. AC 482.

By an east wind is signified devastation and desolation, for by wind, which comes 
from the east in the spiritual world, the habitations of the wicked are entirely 
overthrown, and themselves with the treasures, on which they have set their hearts, 
are cast into hell; by the ships of Tarshish are here signified false doctrinals. AE 514.

Verse 9. We have considered your mercy, O GOD, in the midst of your temple; as is 
your name, so is your praise to the ends of the earth. By temple is signified the church
which is in truths derived from good; in the midst of it means in its inmost principle 
and thence in the whole of it: wherefore it is said, as is your praise so is your name to
the ends of the earth, to the ends of the earth means to the ultimates of the church, the 
earth denoting the church. AE 313.

179

Verse 10. Your right hand is full of justice. By the right hand is signified omnipotence 
and omniscience, which appertain to the LORD from divine good by divine truth. AE 
298.

Verses 11, 12, 13. Mount Zion shall be glad, and the daughters of Judah shall exult 
because of your judgements. Walk about Zion, go round about her, number her 
towers, set your heart to her bulwarks, observe distinctly her palaces, that you may 
tell it to the generation following. By Mount Zion which shall be glad is signified the 
celestial church, in which are those who are principled in love to the LORD; by the 
daughters of Judah, who shall exult, are signified the affections of good and of truth 
in which they are principled who are of that church; because of your judgements 
signifies by reason of Divine Truths which they have from the LORD; to walk about 
Zion, and to go round about her, signifies to embrace from love those things which are
of that church; to number her towers, signifies to consider well the superior or interior
truths which are of that church, to number signifying to see and consider well their 
quality, and towers signifying superior or interior truths; to set the heart to her 
bulwarks signifies to love the exterior truths which defend that church against 
falsities; to observe distinctly her palaces signifies to perceive the goods of truth, for 
houses denote goods, and palaces are the more noble goods of truth; that you may tell
it to the generation following signifies their permanence to eternity. AE 453.

THE TRANSLATOR'S NOTES AND OBSERVATIONS

Verse 8. As we have heard, so have we seen. It is plain from these words that there is a
secret connection between seeing and hearing, which may easily be accounted for on 
this principle, that seeing has more relation to the under-standing, and hearing more 
relation to the will, seeing therefore has more relation to knowledge, and hearing more
relation to obedience; as therefore the understanding is connected with the will, and 
knowledge with obedience, it is plain that the seeing of the eye will depend on the 
hearing of the ear, when spiritually understood, and thus that it is eternally true that as
we have heard, so have we seen.

The intelligent reader will not fail to note the divine and heavenly marriage of the 
GOOD and the TRUE in the two expressions the city of JEHOVAH, and the city of our 
GOD, as they recur at verse 8.

PSALM 49

To him that presides; a Psalm for the sons of Korah.

1. Hear this all you peoples; give ear all you inhabitants of the world.
2. Both low and high, rich and poor together.
3. My mouth shall speak wisdom, and the meditation of my heart shall be of 

understanding.
4.
I will incline mine ear to a proverb, I will open my dark saying on the harp:
5. Wherefore should I fear in the days of evil? When the iniquity of my heels 

does encompass me?

6. Of them that trust in their wealth, and boast of the multitude of their riches.
7. No man shall by any means redeem his brother, or give to GOD a ransom for 

him;

8. For the redemption of their soul is precious; and he live on for ever.
9. Though he continue to live, and not see the grave;
10. Yet he will see the wise die, likewise the fool and brutish perish, and leave 

their wealth to others.

11. Their inward thought is, that their houses are for ever, their dwelling-places to 

all generations; they call lands after their own names;

12. Yet that man shall not abide in glory, he is like the beasts that perish.
13. This their way is their foolish confidence, and they who go after them approve 

their sayings. Selah.

14. Like sheep they are laid in hell; death shall feed on them; the upright shall 

have dominion over them in the morning; their beauty shall be consumed; hell 
shall be their dwelling.

15. But GOD shall redeem my soul from the hand of hell, for he shall receive me. 

Selah.

16. Be not you afraid when a man is made rich, when the glory of his house is 

increased.

17. For at his death he shall take nothing away, his glory shall not descend after 

him.

18. Though he blessed his soul in his life time, and they praised you, because you 

do well to yourself;

19. Yet he shall go to the generation of his fathers; they shall never see light.
20. Man that is in honour, and understands not, is like the beasts that perish.

The Internal Sense

An exhortation to attend to what follows, verses 1 to 4; of those who are merely 
natural, and glory in scientifics and in their self-derived intelligence, verses 5, 6; there
is no salvation thence, verses 7 to 9; that they, however they may glory in such things,
perish nevertheless, verses 10 to 13; and go into hell, verse 14; that salvation is in the 
LORD alone, verse 15; that learning and self-derived intelligence do not save after 
death, verses 16 to 20.

181

EXPOSITION

Verses 1, 2, 3. Hear this, all you peoples, give ear all you inhabitants of the world, 
both you sons of man [homo], and you sons of man [vir]; both rich and poor together;
my mouth shall speak wisdom, and the meditation of my heart shall be of 
understanding. By the sons of man [homo] are signified spiritual truths which are 
from the LORD by the WORD, which truths are doctrinals; and by the sons of man [vir] 
are signified rational and natural truths, which are from the understanding of the 
WORD, thus the understanding of the WORD; by rich and poor are signified those who 
derive thence much wisdom and who derive little. AE 724.

Verse 5. When the iniquity of my heels does encompass me. That by the heel is meant 
the lowest natural or corporeal principle cannot be known, unless it be understood, 
how the most ancient people considered the things that are in man; they referred his 
celestial and spiritual things to the head and face: the things which derive existence 
thence as mercy and charity, they referred to the breast; his natural things to the soles 
of the feet; and the lowest natural or corporeal things to the heel; nor did they 
consider them only according to such reference, but also gave them names agreeable 
thereto. The lowest things relating to reason, such as things scientific, were also 
understood by what Jacob prophesied concerning Dan, "Dan shall be a serpent in the 
way, an adder in the path that bites the horses' heels, so that his rider shall fall 
backward," Gen 49:17; and also by what is written in David, "The iniquity of my 
heels does encompass me," Psalm 49:5. AC 259.

THE TRANSLATOR'S NOTES AND OBSERVATIONS

Verse 2, Both you sons of man, [homo] and you sons of man. [vir] In the commonly 
received English version of the Psalms, these words are rendered high and low; but it 
is plain from the exposition given by the enlightened expositor above, that this 
rendering does not give the full meaning of the original Hebrew, which literally is, 
both you sons of man, [homo] and you sons of man. [vir].

PSALM 50

A Psalm of Asaph.

1. The GOD of GODS, JEHOVAH speaks, he calls the earth from the rising of the 

sun to the setting thereof.

2. Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty, GOD shines forth.
3. Our GOD shall come, and shall not keep silence: a fire shall devour before him,

and it shall be very tempestuous round about him.

4. He shall call to the heavens from above, and to the earth, to judge his people:
5. Gather my saints to me, those that have made a covenant with me by sacrifice.
6. And the heavens shall declare his justice, for GOD is judge. Selah.
7. Hear, O my people, and I will speak; O Israel, and I will witness against you; I

8.

am GOD, yea, your GOD.
I will not reprove you for your sacrifices and your burnt-offerings, which are 
continually before me.
I will take no bullock out of your house, nor he-goats out of your folds;
9.
10. For every beast of the forest is mine, and the cattle on a thousand mountains.
11. I know all the birds of the mountains, and the beasts of the field are mine.
12. If I were hungry, I would not tell you: for the world is mine, and the fullness 

thereof.

13. Shall I eat the flesh of bulls, or drink the blood of goats?
14. Offer to GOD thanksgiving, and pay your vows to the MOST HIGH.
15. And call upon me in the day of trouble; I will deliver you, and you shall 

glorify me.

16. But to the wicked GOD says, what have you to do to declare my statutes, or 

that them should take my covenant in your mouth?

17. While you hate correction, and cast my words behind you?
18. If you see a thief, you consent with him; and with adulterers is your portion.
19. You open your mouth to evil, and your tongue frames deceit.
20. You sit and speak against your brother; you do slander your own mother's son.
21. These things have you done, and I kept silence; you think that I am altogether 

like yourself; I will reprove you, and I will array them before your eyes.
22. Now consider this, O you that forget GOD, lest I tear you in pieces, and there 

be none to deliver.

23. Whoever offers praise, glorifies me; and to him that orders his way right, will I

show the salvation of GOD.

The Internal Sense

That the coming of the LORD to those of the church to judgement is at hand, verses 1 
to 6; that the LORD desires not sacrifices and external worship, verses 7 to 13; that he 
desires confession of heart, verses 14, 15; that external worship avails nothing when 
sins are committed, verses 16 to 20; that they do such things, and therefore evil will 
come upon them, verses 21, 22, 23.

183

EXPOSITION

Verse 1. The GOD of GODS, JEHOVAH speaks, he calls the earth from the rising of the 
sun to the setting thereof. Inasmuch as the sun signifies the good of love to the LORD 
belonging to man, hence by from the rising of the sun to its setting, are signified all 
who are in the good of love to the LORD from the first to the last, from the rising of the
sun the first, and to the setting of the sun the last. AE 401.

Verses 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. JEHOVAH will speak, and will call the earth from the rising of the 
sun to its setting; out of Zion, the perfection of beauty, GOD shines forth; our GOD will
come; he will call to the heavens above, and to the earth, to judge his people; gather 
my saints to me. The subject here treated of is manifestly concerning a judgement 
upon all from Zion, thus from the LORD by divine truth; the separation of the good 
from the evil is meant by he shall call the earth from the rising of the sun to its 
setting; judgement upon all by he shall call to the heavens above, and to the earth to 
judge the people; the gathering together of the good and their salvation, is meant by 
gather together my saints to me; the divine truth, in which the LORD is in his glory, is 
meant by out of Zion, the perfection of beauty, GOD shines forth. AE 850.

Verse 3. A fire shall go before him, and it shall be very tempestuous round about him. 
In the spiritual world, as in the natural, there exist, strong winds and storms, but the 
storms in the spiritual world exist from the LORD'S influx into lower things, where 
they dwell who are in evils and falsities: this influx, as it descends from the heavens 
towards the earths beneath, becomes proportionably denser, and appears as a cloud, 
and with the wicked dense and opaque, according to the quantity and quality of evil; 
these clouds are appearances of what is false grounded in what is evil, arising from 
the spheres of their life, for around every spirit and angel there is a sphere of life; 
when the Divine [principle] is powerfully emitted from the LORD as a sun, and when it
flows into these dense and opaque clouds, there arises a storm, which the spirits 
perceive in like manner as men perceive storms on earth; it has been granted me 
occasionally to perceive those storms, and likewise the east wind by which the wicked
are dispersed and cast into hell, when the last judgement was accomplished. AE 419.

Verse 10. For every wild beast of the forest is mine. The expression wild beast, in the 
original tongue, properly signifies life, or what is living, but in the Word, not only 
what is living, but also as it were what is not living, or a wild beast, wherefore unless 
a man be acquainted with the internal sense of the Word, he cannot at times know 
what is signified; the reason why each is signified is because the man of the most 
ancient church, in self-humiliation before the LORD, acknowledged himself to be not 
living, not even to be a beast, but a wild beast, for he knew that man in himself is 
such, or when viewed in his own proprium; hence the same expression signifies what 
is alive, and signifies also a wild beast. AC 908.

Hitherto it has been shown from the WORD that wild beasts signify evil lusts and 
falsities, specifically the lusts of destroying goods and truths by falsities, thus the 
spiritual life of man; it shall now also be shown that wild beasts in the WORD likewise 
signify the affections of truth and good, which are opposite to the affections of what is
false derived from evil which are called lusts; the reason is because the term, from 
which they are denominated and called, in the original tongue signifies life, for wild 
beast in that tongue is called chajah, and chajah signifies life, and in the affection of 

184

good and of truth is the essential spiritual life belonging to man; wherefore when a 
wild beast is mentioned in the WORD in this good sense, it ought rather to be called an 
animal, which signifies a living soul: but when mention is made of wild beast in this 
sense, then it is necessary to put off the idea which adheres to the term wild beast 
(fera) in the Latin tongue, for in this tongue to the term wild beast there adheres an 
idea of wildness and ferocity, thus an unfavourable and evil idea: it is otherwise in the
Hebrew language, where wild beast signifies life, and in general a living soul or 
animal. AE 388.

Verses 10, 11. Every wild beast of the forest is mine, the cattle on a thousand 
mountains; I know all the birds of the mountains, and all the wild beasts of the field 
are mine. These words indeed have relation to sacrifices, and were intended to teach 
that the LORD is not delighted with them, but with confession of heart and invocation; 
nevertheless by wild beast of the forest, by beasts of the mountains, by the birds of the
mountains, and wild beasts of the field, are signified similar things as above, namely 
the things belonging to the man of the church; thus by mountains the good things of 
love; by beasts the affections of the natural man. AE 650.

Verse 12. If I were hungry, I would not tell you, for the world is mine, and the fullness 
thereof. These words have relation to sacrifices, being intended to teach, that the LORD
is not delighted with them, but with confession and works; for it follows, shall I eat 
the flesh of bulls, or drink the blood of goals? offer to GOD thanksgiving, and pay 
your vows to the MOST HIGH, wherefore by " If I were hungry," is signified: if I desired
sacrifices; but whereas the LORD wills worship from goods and truths, it is said, for 
the world is mine and the fullness thereof; fullness signifies goods and truths in the 
whole complex, as above; this is said indeed of the beasts which were to be sacrificed,
but by them, in the spiritual sense, are signified the various kinds of good and truth. 
AE 741.

Verses 14, 23. Offer to GOD thanksgiving, and pay your vows, etc. Real confession of 
the heart, inasmuch as it is grounded in celestial love, is in a general sense confession;
the man, who is in this confession, acknowledges that all good is from the LORD, and 
that all evil is from himself, and when he is in this acknowledgement he is in a state of
humiliation, for he acknowledges in such case that the LORD is every thing belonging 
to him, and that he himself is respectively nothing, and when confession is made from
this state, it is then grounded in celestial love. But sacrifices of confession, which 
were offered in the Jewish church, were thanksgivings, and were called in a universal 
sense eucharistic and retributory sacrifices, which were of a two-fold kind, namely 
confessional and votive: that sacrifices of confession involved the celestial principle 
of love, may appear from their institution, Levit 7:11, 12, 13, 14. But the votive 
sacrifices, which were another kind of eucharistics, in an external sense signified 
retribution, in an internal sense the will that the LORD would provide, and in a 
supreme sense a state of providence; hence it is that mention is made of each in the 
Word throughout, as in David, "Offer to GOD thanksgiving, and pay your vows to the 
Most High; he who sacrifices confession honours me, and he who orders his way to 
him will I show the salvation of GOD," Psalm 1:14, 23; 56:12; 116:17, 18. AC 3880.

The Translator's Notes and Observations

Verse 1. The GOD of GODS, JEHOVAH speaks. In the commonly received English 
version of the Psalms, these Words are thus rendered, the mighty God even the LORD 
has spoken, but in the original Hebrew they are expressed as they are here rendered.

186

PSALM 51

To him that presides; a Psalm of David, when Nathan the prophet came to him, after 
he had gone into Bathsheba.

1. Have mercy upon me, O GOD, according to your mercy; according to the 

multitude of your compassions blot out my transgressions.

2. Wash me thoroughly from mine iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin.
3. For I acknowledge my transgressions, and my sin is continually before me.
4. Against you, you only have I sinned, and have done evil in your eyes; so that 

you are just, in your sentence, you are clear in your judgement.

5. Behold I was shaped in iniquity, and in sin did my mother conceive me.
6. Behold you desire truth in the reins, and in the hidden part you make me to 

know wisdom.

7. You shall purge me with hyssop that I may be clean; you shall wash me that I 

may be whiter than snow.

8. You shall make me to hear joy and gladness; that the bones which you have 

broken may exult.

9. Hide your face from my sins, and blot out all mine iniquities.
10. Create in me a clean heart, O GOD, and renew a right spirit within me.
11. Cast me not away from your presence, and take not your spirit of holiness 

from me.

12. Restore to me the joy of your salvation, and let a willing spirit support me.
13. I will teach transgressors your ways, and sinners shall be converted to you.
14. Deliver me from deeds of blood, O GOD, you GOD of my salvation; and my 

tongue shall celebrate your justice.

15. O LORD, open you my lips, and my mouth shall show forth your praise.
16. For you are not delighted with sacrifice, else would I give it; you have no 

pleasure in burnt-offering.

17. The sacrifices of GOD are a broken spirit; a broken and a contrite heart, O 

GOD! you will not despise.

18. Do good in your good pleasure to Zion, build you the walls of Jerusalem.
19. Then shall you be delighted with the sacrifices of justice, with burnt-offerings 
and whole burnt-offerings; then shall they offer bullocks upon your altar. 

The Internal Sense

A prayer that he may be purified from the infirmities derived from the mother, verses 
1 to 5; that if he be cleansed from them, he shall be pure, verses 6 to 10; and holy, 
verses 11, 12; and will teach divine truths, verses 13 to 15; not external, but internal 
worship, verses 16, 17; that he will establish a church in which there will be worship 
from good, verses 18, 19.

Exposition

Verse 2. Wash me from mine iniquity, cleanse me from my sin. The sins which man 
commits are inrooted in his very life, and constitute it; wherefore no one is liberated 

187

from them, unless he receives new life from the LORD, which is effected by 
regeneration.

That man cannot do good, nor think truth, from himself, but from the LORD, is 
manifest from John, "A man cannot do any thing unless it be given him from heaven,"
John 3:27; "He that abides in me and I in him, the same bears much fruit, because 
without me you can do nothing," John 15:5. Hence it is evident, that no one can lead 
away any one from sins, thus remit them, but the LORD alone.

The LORD continually flows into man with the good of love, and with the truths of 
faith, but they are differently received, in one way by one, and in another way by 
another; by those who are regenerated, well; but by those who do not suffer 
themselves to be regenerated, ill.

They who are regenerated are continually held by the LORD in the good of faith and of
love, and in such case are withheld from evils and falsities; but they who do not suffer
themselves to be regenerated by the LORD, are withheld also from evil, and held in 
good; for from the LORD continually flows in good and truth with every man, but 
infernal loves, which are the loves of self and of the world, in which they are 
principled, oppose and turn the influx of good into evil, and of truth into the false.

From these considerations, it is manifest what remission of sins is: To be able from 
the LORD to be held in the good of love, and the truth of faith, and to be withheld from
evils and falsities, is remission of sins: and in this case to shun what is evil and false, 
and to hold them in aversion, is repentance. But these things are not given, except 
with those who have received from the LORD new life by regeneration; for those 
things are of new life.

The signs that sins are remitted, are those which follow: there is a delight perceived in
worshipping God for the sake of GOD, in serving the neighbour for the sake of the 
neighbour, thus in doing good for the sake of good, and in believing truth for the sake 
of truth; there is an unwillingness to merit by any thing of charity and faith; evils are 
shunned and held in aversion, as enmities, hatreds, revenges, unmercifulness, 
adulteries, in a word, all things which are against GOD and against the neighbour.

But the signs that sins are not remitted, are those which follow. GOD is worshipped not
for the sake of GOD, and the neighbour is served not for the sake of the neighbour, 
thus good is not done and truth not spoken for the sake of good and truth, but for the 
sake of self and the world; there is a willingness to merit by actions; others are 
despised in comparison with self; delight is perceived in evils, as in enmity, in hatred, 
in revenge, in cruelty, in adulteries; moreover the holy things of the church are 
despised, and in heart are denied.

Sins are believed to he wiped away, and washed away, when they are remitted, as filth
is washed away by water; nevertheless they remain with man, and when they are said 
to be wiped away, it is from the appearance, when man is withheld from them? AC 
9444 to 9451.

The LORD out of divine mercy regenerates man, which effect is worked from his 
infancy even to the last [moment] of his life in the world, and afterwards to eternity; 

188

thus out of divine mercy, he leads man away from evils and falsities, and leads him to 
the truths of faith and the goods of love, and then keeps him in those principles: and 
afterwards out of divine mercy elevates him to himself into heaven, and renders him 
happy; these are the things which are meant by the remission of sins out of mercy. 
They who believe that sins are otherwise remitted, are altogether deceived, for it 
would be of unmercifulness to see a multitude of men in the hells, and not to save 
them, if it could have been done otherwise; when yet the LORD is mercy itself, and 
wills not the death of any one, but that he may live.

They therefore who do not suffer themselves to be regenerated, thus not to be 
withheld from evils and falsities, remove from themselves and reject the above 
mercies of the LORD; hence it is, that the impossibility of being saved is chargeable 
upon themselves.

These are the things that are meant in John, "As many as received him, to them gave 
he power to be the sons of GOD, believing in his name, who were born not of bloods, 
nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of GOD," John 1:12, 13; of 
bloods denotes those who are against the goods of faith and charity; of the will of the 
flesh, denotes those who are in evils derived from the loves of self and of the world; 
of the will of man, denotes those who are in the falsities thence derived; to be born of 
GOD is to be regenerated. That no one can come into heaven unless he be regenerated, 
is thus taught in the same evangelist, "Verily, verily, I say to you unless a man be born
again, he cannot see the kingdom of GOD: Verily, verily, I say to you, unless a man be 
born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of GOD," John 3:3, 5;
to be born of water, denotes by the truth of faith; and to be born of the spirit, denotes 
by the good of love. From these considerations, it may now be manifest, who they are 
to whom sins are remitted, and who to whom they are not remitted. AC 9452 to 9454.

Verses 2, 3. In the Word evils are sometimes called sins, sometimes iniquities, and 
sometimes transgressions. See Psalm 5:10. Exposition.

Verses 2, 7. Inasmuch as to wash signifies to remove falsities and evils, therefore it is 
said in David, "Wash me from mine iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin; you shall 
purge me with hyssop that I may be clean, you shall wash me that I may be whiter 
than snow," Psalm 51:2, 7; where to wash manifestly denotes to purify from falsities 
and evils, for it is said, wash me. from iniquity, and cleanse me from sin, and 
afterwards, you shall wash me that I may be whiter than snow, where to wash from 
iniquity denotes from falsities, and from sin denotes from evils; for iniquity is 
predicated of falsities, and sin of evils; inasmuch as the waters of expiation were 
prepared from hyssop, therefore it is said, you shall purge me with hyssop and I shall 
be clean. AE 475.

Verse 6. Behold you desires truth in the reins, etc, The reins signify the truths of faith, 
and purification of them from falsities, because the purification of the blood is 
performed in the reins (kidneys), and by blood in the Word is signified truth; the same
also is signified by the organ which purifies; all purifications also from falsities are 
effected by truths. Hence it is evident what is signified in the WORD by JEHOVAH, or 
the LORD, searching the hearts and reins, namely that he explores the goods of love 
and truths of faith, and separates them from evils and falsities. This is signified by 
reins in Jeremiah, "JEHOVAH Zebaoth, judge of justice, proving the reins and the 

189

heart," Jer 11:20; and in David, "Behold you desires truth in the reins, and in what is 
hidden you make wisdom known to me," Psalm 51:6; reins are here expressed by 
another word in the original tongue, which involves the separation both of falsities 
from truths, and of evils from goods; hence it is evident, that the reins signify 
purification and separation. AE 167.

Verse 10. Create in me a clean heart, O GOD, and renew a right spirit within me. To 
create a clean heart signifies to reform as to the good of love; to renew a right spirit 
within me signifies to reform as to the truth of faith; for heart signifies the good of 
love; and spirit signifies a life according to Divine Truth, which is the faith of truth. 
AE 294.

By a new heart is meant the will of good, and by a new spirit the understanding of 
truth; that the LORD operates these things with those who do what is good and believe 
what is true, thus with those who are in the faith of charity, is evident. AR 143.

Verse 11. Take not your spirit of holiness from me. It deserves to be particularly 
noticed, that in the Word of the Old Testament there is no mention made of the Holy 
Spirit., but only of the Spirit of Holiness in three places, once in David, Psalm 51:11; 
and twice in Isaiah 63:10, 11; whereas in the Word of the New Testament, both in the 
Gospels, the Acts of the Apostles, and the Epistles it, is mentioned frequently; the 
reason is because there was no Holy Spirit before the coming of the Lord, inasmuch 
as it proceeds out of the LORD from the Father; for the LORD only is holy, Rev 15:4; 
wherefore also it is said by the angel Gabriel to the mother Mary, the HOLY THING 
which shall be born of you, Luke 1:35. It is written, that the Holy Spirit was not yet, 
because JESUS was not yet glorified, John 7:39; and yet it is said before, that the Holy 
Spirit filled Elizabeth, Luke 1:41; and Zechariah, Luke 1:67; and Simeon, Luke 2:25; 
the reason of which seeming contradiction is because those three persons were filled 
with the spirit of JEHOVAH the FATHER, which was called the Holy Spirit, on account 
of the LORD, who was already in the world. This is the reason too, why in the Word of 
the Old Testament, it is nowhere said that the prophets spoke from the Holy Spirit, but
from JEHOVAH; for in expressing themselves on this subject, they constantly use some 
of these terms: JEHOVAH SPOKE TO ME; THE WORD or JEHOVAH CAME TO ME; JEHOVAH 
HAS SPOKEN; THE SAYING OF JEHOVAH. AR 158.

Verse 17. The sacrifices of GOD are a broken spirit; a broken and contrite heart you, 
O GOD, will not despise. A broken spirit, and a broken and contrite heart, denote a 
state of temptation, and the consequent humiliation both of spirit and heart. AC 9818.

Verses 18, 19. Do good in your good pleasure to Zion, build you the walls of 
Jerusalem. Then shall you be delighted with sacrifices of justice, with burnt-offerings,
and whole burnt-offerings; then shall they offer bullocks on your altar. By Zion is 
here meant the church which is in the good of love; and by Jerusalem the church 
which is in the truths of doctrine; hence by doing good in good pleasure to Zion, and 
building the walls of Jerusalem, is signified to restore the church by leading it into the
good of love; and by teaching it the truths of doctrine; worship in such case from the 
good of love is signified by then shall you be delighted with the sacrifices of justice, 
and with burnt-offerings; justice is predicated of celestial good, and burnt-offering 
signifies love; and worship in such case from the good of charity is signified by then 

190

shall they offer bullocks on your altar; bullocks signify natural spiritual good, which 
good is the good of charity. AE 391.

The Translator's Notes and Observations

Verse 2. Wash me often from mine iniquity. What is here rendered wash me often, is 
expressed in the received English version of the Psalms, by wash me thoroughly from 
mine iniquity, but it deserves consideration, that the original Hebrew may with as 
much propriety be rendered wash me often, which implies, that spiritual washing is 
not a single act, but requires repetition, before the washing can be complete.

PSALM 52

To him that presides; an instructive Psalm of David, when Doeg, the Edomite came 
and told Saul, and said to him, David is come to the house of Ahimelech.

1. Why do you glory in wickedness, you mighty man? The mercy of GOD is 

continual.

2. Your tongue devises mischief, like a sharp razor, working deceit.
3. You love evil more than good, lying more than speaking justice. Selah.
4. You love all destructive words, O deceitful tongue.
5. Therefore GOD shall destroy you for ever; he shall seize upon you and pluck 

you out of the tent, and root you out of the land of the living. Selah.

6. And the just shall see and fear, and shall laugh at him, saying:
7. Behold the man that made not GOD his strength, but trusted in the abundance 

of his riches; who was strong by his mischief.

8. But as for me I am like a green olive tree in the house of GOD; I trust in the 

9.

mercy of GOD for ever and ever.
I will praise you because you have done it; and I will hope in your name, for it
is good before your saints.

The Internal Sense

Of hypocrites, that their portion will be in hell, and they will perish, verses 1 to 5; also
they who confide in their own understanding, verse 7; that they will flourish who trust
in the LORD, verses 8, 9.

EXPOSITION. Verses 2, 3, 4. Your tongue devises mischief like a sharp razor, working 
deceit, etc. Deceit signifies malice grounded in the will with previous thought or 
premeditation. Evils are done either from enmity, or from hatred, or from revenge, 
and either by deceit or without deceit; but evils by deceit are the worst, because deceit
is as poison which infects and destroys with infernal venom, for it goes through the 
whole mind, even to its interiors; the reason is because he who is in deceit, meditates 
evil, and thereby nourishes his understanding, and delights it, and thus destroys every 
thing therein which is of man, that is, which is of life derived from the good of faith 
and charity. They who in the world have ensnared a neighbour by deceit as to worldly 
and terrestrial things, in the other life ensnare him by deceit as to spiritual and 
celestial things; and inasmuch as they do this in secret, they are committed to hells 
behind the back, at a depth according to the malignity and mischievousness of the 
deceit. AC 9013.

Verse 5. He shall pluck you out of the tent, and root you out of the land of the Living. 
This was said of Doeg the Edomite; that he was expelled from every good of the 
church, is signified by his being plucked out of the tent; that he was also expelled 
from the truths of the church, is signified by his being rooted out of the land of the 
living; earth is the church and they are said to be living, who are in truths derived 
from good. AE 799.

192

Verse 7. I am like a green olive tree in the house of GOD ; I trust in the mercy of GOD 
for ever and ever. It is said, as a green olive tree in the house of GOD, because by a 
green olive tree is signified the good of love springing up by the truth of the Word, 
and by the house of GOD is signified the church. AE 638.

The Translator's Notes and Observations

Verse 6. He became strong by his mischief. What is here rendered mischief is called 
wickedness in the received English version of the Psalms, but in the original Hebrew 
it is expressed by a term which rather means the consequence of wickedness, which 
consequence is the total ruin and desolation of all the principles of goodness and truth,
in which mischief man is here said to become strong, because it appears to him that 
goodness and truth are weakness, and that he becomes strong in proportion as he 
cherishes in himself the opposite principles of evil and error.

PSALM 53

To him that presides upon Machalath; an instructive Psalm of David.

1. The fool has said in his heart, There is no GOD. They are corrupt, they have 

done abominable iniquity; there is none that does good.

2. GOD has looked down from heaven upon the sons of man, to see if there were 

any that is intelligent, that seeks GOD.

3. Every one is gone back; together are they become corrupt: there is none that 

does good, not even one.

4. Have the workers of iniquity no knowledge, who eat up my people as they eat 

bread, and call not upon GOD?

5. Then shall they, who had no fear, be greatly afraid; for GOD will scatter the 

bones of them that encamp against you; you shall put them to shame, because 
GOD has rejected them.

6. O that the salvation of Israel were come out of Zion! When GOD shall bring 
back the captivity of his people, Jacob shall rejoice, and Israel shall be glad.

The Internal Sense

That every one has forsaken GOD, none remaining, verses 1 to 3; that they have 
destroyed the church without any cause, verses 4, 5; that therefore there will be a new 
church from the LORD, verse 6.

EXPOSITION

See Psalm xiv. Exposition.

Verse 5. Then shall they, who had no fear, be greatly afraid, that is, when they come to
know (see former verse) or to experience the punishment of evil, then, etc. See Psalm 
14:4, Note.

194

PSALM 54

To him that presides on Neginoth; an instructive Psalm of David, when the Zephims 
came and said to Saul, does not David hide himself with us?

1. Save me, O GOD, by your name; and judge me by your strength.
2. Hear my prayer, O GOD, and give ear to the words of my mouth.
3. For strangers rise up against me, and oppressors seek after my soul; they have 

not set GOD before them. Selah.

4. Behold GOD is my helper; the LORD is amongst them that uphold my soul.
5. He shall repay evil to mine enemies; cut them off in your truth.
6.

I will willingly sacrifice to you; I will praise your name, O JEHOVAH, for it is 
good.

7. For he has delivered me out of all trouble, and mine eye has beheld mine 

enemies.

The Internal Sense

A prayer to the FATHER that he would assist against those who wish to destroy him, 
verses 1 to 3; that he will assist, and that they will perish, verses 4, 5; a thanksgiving 
for assistance, verses 6, 7.

Exposition

Verse 3. For strangers rise up against me, and oppressors seek after my soul. 
Strangers here denote evils and the falsities of evil; oppressors denote the same 
offering violence to goods and truths: they who look at the sense of the letter of the 
Word alone, understand nothing else by strangers but those who are out of the church,
and that they rose up against David, nevertheless there does not any thing of person 
enter into the heavens, but the things which are signified see AC 8343, 8985, 9007, 
thus not strangers, but, instead of them, strange things, which are things alienated 
from the church, thus evils and the falsities of evils, which destroy the church; by 
David also, against whom they arose, is perceived the LORD, see AC 1888, 9954. AC 
10287.

Verse 6. I will willingly sacrifice to you. It is an acknowledged truth collected from 
the Word of the LORD, that worship, proceeding from a free principle is true and 
acceptable worship, and that the LORD is well pleased with whatever is spontaneous or
voluntary, wherefore it is said in the Psalms, "I will willingly sacrifice to you," 54:6; 
and in another place, "The voluntary of the people are gathered together, the people of
the GOD of Abraham," 47:9. Hence amongst the children of Israel spontaneous or free-
will sacrifices were instituted, and their sacred worship consisted principally in 
sacrifices. AR 495.

All liberty is of love, for what a man loves, this he does freely; hence also all liberty is
of the will, for what a man loves, this he also wills; and for as much as love and the 
will constitute the life of man, so also does liberty. From these considerations, it may 

195

appear what liberty is, namely, that it is that which is of the love and the will, and 
thence of the life of man: hence it is that what a man does from liberty, appears to him
as if he did it from his own proprium. To do evil from liberty appears as if it were 
liberty, but it is slavery, because that liberty is from the love of self, and from the love 
of the world, and these loves are from hell: such liberty is actually turned into slavery 
after death, for the man, who has been in such liberty, then becomes a vile slave in 
hell. But to do good from liberty is liberty itself, because it proceeds from love to the 
LORD, and from love towards our neighbour, and these loves are from heaven; this 
liberty also remains after death, and then becomes liberty indeed, for the man who has
been in such liberty, becomes in heaven, like a son in the house of his father: this the 
LORD thus teaches, "Every one that does sin is the servant of sin; the servant abides 
not in the house for ever: the son abides for ever; if the Son shall have made you free, 
you shall be truly free," John 8:34, 35, 36. Now for as much as all good is from the 
LORD, and all evil from hell, it follows, that liberty consists in being led by the LORD, 
and slavery in being led by hell. That man has the liberty of thinking what is evil and 
false, and also of doing it, so far as the laws do not withhold him, is in order that he 
may be capable of being reformed: for goods and truths are to be implanted in his love
and will, so that they may become of his life, and this cannot be done unless he have 
the liberty of thinking what is evil and false as well as what is good and true: this 
liberty is given to every man by the LORD, and so far as he does not love evil and the 
false, so far, when he thinks what is good and true, the LORD implants them in his love
and will, consequently in his life, and thus reforms him. What is inseminated in 
liberty, this also remains, but what is inseminated in a state of compulsion, this does 
not remain, because what is from compulsion is not from the will of the man, but from
the will of him who compels. Hence also it is, that worship from liberty is pleasing to 
the LORD, but not worship from compulsion; for worship from liberty is worship from 
love, but worship from compulsion is not so. The liberty of doing good, and the 
liberty of doing evil, though they appear alike in the external form, are as different 
and distant from each other as heaven and hell are: the liberty of doing good also is 
from heaven, and is called heavenly liberty, but the liberty of doing evil is from hell, 
and is called infernal liberty: so far likewise as man is in the one, so far he is not in 
the other, for no man can serve two lords, Matthew 6:24; which also appears from 
here, that they who are in infernal liberty believe that it is slavery and compulsion not 
to be allowed to will evil and think what is false at their pleasure, whereas they who 
are in heavenly liberty abhor willing evil and thinking what is false, and would be 
tormented if they were compelled to do so. For as much as acting from liberty appears
to man like acting from his own proprium, therefore heavenly liberty may also be 
called the heavenly proprium, and infernal liberty may be called the infernal 
proprium: the infernal proprium is that into which man is born, and this is evil; but the
heavenly proprium is that into which man is reformed, and this is good. Hence it may 
appear what Free-will is; namely that it consists in doing good from choice or will, 
and that they are in that freedom who are led by the LORD; and they are led by the 
LORD who love good and truth for the sake of good and truth. Man may know what is 
the quality of the liberty in which he is, from the delight which he feels when he 
thinks, speaks, acts, hears, and sees; for all delight is of love. N. J. H. 141—147.

That liberty originates from the equilibrium between heaven and hell, and that man, 
without liberty, cannot be reformed, is shown in the Treatise on Heaven and Hell; in 
the articles concerning that equilibrium, HH 589 to 596, and concerning liberty, HH 
597 to the end: but for the sake of instruction respecting what, liberty is, and to show 

196

that man is reformed by means of it, I will here adduce the following extract from, 
that Treatise: "It has been shown that the equilibrium between heaven and hell is an 
equilibrium between the good that is from heaven and the evil that is from hell, thus 
that it is a spiritual equilibrium, which in its essence is liberty. The reason that 
spiritual equilibrium in its essence is liberty, is because it is an equilibrium between 
good and evil, and between truth and the false, and these are spiritual; wherefore the 
power of willing good or evil, or of thinking what is true or what is false, and of 
choosing one in preference to the other, is liberty. This liberty is given to every man 
by the LORD, nor is it ever taken away; in its origin indeed it is not of man but of the 
LORD, because it is from the LORD, but still it is given to man together with life as his 
own, in order that man may be capable of being reformed and saved, for without 
liberty there is no reformation and salvation. Every one may see from any rational 
contemplation, that man is at liberty to think either well or ill, sincerely or insincerely,
justly or unjustly; and also that he may speak and act well, sincerely and justly, but 
not ill, insincerely and unjustly, on account of moral and civil laws, by which his 
external is kept in bonds: hence it is plain, that the spirit of man, which is what thinks 
and wills, is in liberty, but not man's external, which speaks and acts, unless it speak 
and act according to the above-named laws. That man cannot be reformed, unless he 
be in liberty, is because he is born into evils of every kind, which must nevertheless be
removed, in order that he may be saved; and they cannot be removed unless he sees 
them in himself, and acknowledges them, and afterwards ceases to will them, and at 
length is averse to them; then are they first removed; and this cannot be done, unless 
man be in good as well as in evil, for he can see evils from good, but cannot see goods
from evil: the spiritual goods, which man may think he learns from infancy, from the 
reading of the Word, and from preaching; and he learns civil and moral goods from 
his life in the world; this is the first reason why man ought to be in liberty. Another 
reason is because nothing is appropriated to man, except what is done from an 
affection which is of the love; other things may indeed enter, but no further than into 
the thought, and not into the will, and what does not also enter into the will of man 
does not become his, for the thought derives what belongs to it from the memory, but 
the will from the life itself; nothing ever partakes of liberty, which does not proceed 
from an affection which is of the love, for whatever a man wills or loves, this he does 
freely; hence it is that the liberty of man, and the affection which is of his love or will,
are one: man therefore is endowed with liberty, that he may be capable of being 
affected with truth and good, or of loving them, whereby they may become as his 
own. In a word, whatever does not enter in with man in liberty, does not remain, 
because it is not of his love or will, and the things which are not of man's love or will, 
are not of his spirit; for the esse of man's spirit is love or will. In order that man may 
be in liberty, to the end that he may be reformed, he is conjoined as to his spirit with 
heaven and with hell, for there are with every man spirits from hell and angels from 
heaven; by means of the spirits from hell man is in his own evil, and by means of the 
angels from heaven he is in good from the LORD; thus he is in spiritual equilibrium, 
that is. in liberty."

THE TRANSLATOR'S NOTES AND OBSERVATIONS

Verse 7. Mine eye has beheld mine enemies. To look upon enemies manifestly implies 
that the intellectual mind is exalted to a state of spiritual light, capable of noting them,
and thus of putting them to flight. 

197

PSALM 55

To him that presides on Neginoth; an instructive Psalm of David.

1. Give ear to my prayer, O God, and hide not yourself from my supplication.
2. Attend to me, and answer me; I go about moaning in my complaint, and am 

greatly agitated.

3. Because of the voice of the enemy, because of the oppression of the wicked; 

for they cast iniquity upon me, and in anger do they hate me.

4. My heart trembles in the midst of me, and the terrors of death have fallen upon

me.

5. Tearfulness and trembling are come upon me, and horror has covered me.
6. And I said, O that I had wings like a dove! I would fly away and be at rest.
7. Lo! I would wander afar off, I would pass the night in the wilderness. Selah.
8.
I would hasten my escape from the raging storm, and from the tempest.
9. Destroy, O LORD, and divide their tongues; for I behold violence and strife in 

the city.

10. Day and night they go about it, upon the walls thereof; iniquity also and 

trouble are in the midst of it.

11. Destructions are in the midst thereof, oppression and deceit depart not from 

her streets.

12. For no enemy reproached me, else I could have borne it; not he that hated me 

did exalt himself against me, else I could have hid myself from him.

13. But you a man, like myself, my friend and mine acquaintance.
14. We took sweet counsel together; we walked to the house of GOD with the 

multitude.

15. Let death seize upon them, let them go down alive into hell; for evils are in 

their habitation, yea in the midst of them.

16. But as for me, I will cry to GOD; and JEHOVAH will save me.
17. In the evening, and in the morning, and at noon, will I moan and cry aloud, 

and he will hear my voice.

18. He will deliver my soul in peace from them that assail me, although many are 

against me.

19. GOD shall hear and afflict them, even he that abides from of old; Selah: 

because they change not, neither do they fear GOD.

20. He has put forth his hands against them that were at peace with him; he has 

profaned his covenant.

21. His mouth is smoother than butter, but war is in his heart; his words are softer 

than oil, yet they are drawn swords.

22. Cast your burden upon JEHOVAH, and he shall sustain you; he will never suffer 

the just to be moved.

23. But you, O GOD, shall cast them down into the pit of destruction; the men of 

blood and deceit shall not live half their days, but I will trust in you.

The Internal Sense

The grievousness of his temptations is described, in which he prays to the FATHER, 
verses 1 to 5, 9; that he is ready to desist from combat by reason of their grievousness,

198

verses 6 to 8; the malice of the internals is described, verses 9 to 14; that they will be 
cast into hell, verse 15; a prayer to the FATHER, and that he will be succoured, verses 
16 to 18, 22; against the wicked and hypocrites, verses 19 to 21, 23.

Exposition

Verses 4, 5. My heart trembles, etc. Mention is frequently made in the Word of being 
frightened, dismayed, and the like, both concerning the good and the evil, and by 
terror and consternation is signified a state of commotion and change of mind, arising 
from imminent or visible danger of life, but differently with the good and with the 
evil; with the good it is a commotion of mind, and change of state, arising from the 
imminent and visible danger of the soul, but with the evil it arises from the imminent 
and visible dangers of the bodily life; the reason of this is because the good regard the
life of the soul as principal and final, and not so the life of the body, whereas the evil 
regard the life of the body as principal and final, and not so the life of the soul, which,
indeed, they do not believe in their heart, and they who do believe, still love only the 
things which are of the body, such as appetites and pleasures of various kinds: but the 
case is reversed with the good. In order that it may be known, that to be frightened, 
dismayed, to dread and the like, signify commotions of mind arising from the change 
of the state of the interiors, some passages shall be adduced from the Word by way of 
confirmation; thus in David, "My heart trembles in the midst of me, and the terrors of 
death are fallen upon me, fear and trembling came upon me, and horror has covered 
me," Psalm 55:4, 5; these things are said concerning temptations, in which evils and 
falsities break in from hell, and strike with terrors for fear of damnation; for as was 
said above, the good are terrified and tremble from imminent dangers of the soul, thus
from the irruption of evils into the thoughts and intentions of the will; those are, 
therefore, various commotions of the mind, which are specifically signified by 
trepidation of the heart, terrors of death, fear, trembling, and horror, which are those 
mentioned according to the order in which they succeed. See also, Isaiah 41:5; Ezek 
7:17, 18, 19. AE 677.

Verses 5, 6, 7. Fearfulness and trembling are come upon me, and I said, O that I had 
wings like a dove! I would fly away and be at rest; I would wander afar off, I would 
pass the night in the wilderness. The subject here treated of is concerning temptation, 
and concerning its straitness; fearful-ness and trembling also signify straitness; the 
desire after truth on the occasion, and the consideration in what direction he should 
turn himself, is signified by O that I had wings like a dove? I would fly away and be 
at rest; the wing of a dove is the affection of spiritual truth; to fly away and be at rest 
is, by it, to deliver the life from damnation; the hope of deliverance being not yet 
seen, is signified by I would wander afar off, and pass the night in the wilderness. AE 
282.

Verse 8. I will hasten to escape from the stormy wind, from the tempest. In the 
spiritual world, as in the natural, there exist strong winds and tempests; but tempests 
in the spiritual world exist from an influx of the Divine principle into inferior things, 
the region of those who are in evils of falsities; this influx, as it descends from the 
heavens towards the earths which are beneath, becomes proportionably more dense, 
and appears as a cloud, and with the wicked is dense and opaque according to the 
quantity and quality of evil; these clouds are appearances of what is false derived 
from what is evil, arising from the spheres of their life; for around every spirit and 

199

angel, there is a sphere of life, when the Divine principle in powerfully emitted from 
the LORD as a sun, and flows into these dense and opaque clouds, there arises a storm, 
which the spirits perceive there in like manner as men perceive storms on the earth; it 
has occasionally been allowed me to perceive those storms, and likewise an east wind,
by which the wicked were dispersed and cast into the hells when the last judgement 
was accomplished; from these considerations it may be manifest what storms, 
tempests, and violent winds signify in the following passages, "The wind shall carry 
them away, and the whirlwind shall scatter them," Isaiah 41:16. And in Jeremiah, "A 
whirlwind of JEHOVAH is gone forth in anger, even a grievous whirlwind, it shall fall 
grievously on the head of the wicked," Jer 23:19. And in David, "I will hasten to 
escape from the raging storm and tempest," Psalm 55:9. AE 419.

Verse 18. He shall redeem my soul with peace. To redeem denotes to deliver. AE 327.

By redeeming my soul with peace is signified salvation by conjunction with the LORD,
from them that assail me is signified the consequent removal of evils and falsities. AE 
365.

Verses 21, 23. His mouth is smoother than butter, but war is in his heart, his words 
are softer than oil, yet are they drawn swords; you, O GOD, shall cast them down into 
the pit of destruction. These things are said of those who make pretence of good 
affections, whilst they speak falsities by which they seduce. To make their mouth 
smoother than butter signifies a pretence of good by affections, butter signifies the 
good of external affections; words softer than oil have a like signification, oil is the 
good of internal affections; yet are they drawn swords, signify destructive falsities: 
you, O GOD, shall cast them down into the pit of destruction, signifies into hell where 
destructive falsities of that kind prevail. AE 537.

PSALM 56

To him that presides upon Jonath-elem-rechokim; Michtam of David, when the 
Philistines took him in Gath.

1. Be merciful to me, O God, for man would swallow me up; every day the 

assailant oppresses me.

2. My adversaries would daily swallow me up, for they are many that fight 

3.
4.

proudly against me.
In the day that I am afraid, I will trust in you.
In GOD I will praise his Word; in GOD I put my trust; I will not fear what flesh 
can do to me.

5. Every day they wrest my words; all their thoughts are against me for evil.
6. They gather themselves together, they hide themselves; they mark my heels as 

they lie in wait for my soul.

7. On account of their iniquity deliver my soul from them; in anger cast down the

peoples, O God.

8. You tell my wanderings; put my tears into your bottle; are they not written in 

your book?

9. Then shall mine enemies be turned back in the day that I cry to you; for this I 

know, that GOD is with me.

10. In GOD will I praise his WORD; in JEHOVAH will I praise his WORD.
11. In GOD will I put my trust; I will not fear what man can do to me.
12. Your vows are upon me, O GOD; I will render praises to you.
13. For you have delivered my soul from death, yea, my feet from stumbling; that 

I may walk before GOD in the light of the living.

The Internal Sense

The LORD'S temptations, in which his trust is fixed in the FATHER, verses 1 to 4, 10, 
11; the malice of the infernals, verses 5, 6; that the FATHER would assist him in his 
affliction, verses 7, 8; that he shall be assisted, verse 9; thanksgiving for protection, 
verses 12, 13.

Exposition

Verses 2, 5, 6. My adversaries would daily swallow me up, for they are many that 
fight proudly against me. Every day they wrest my words, all their thoughts are 
against me for evil. They gather themselves together, they hide themselves; they mark 
my heels as they lie in wait for my soul. Inasmuch as few are acquainted with the 
nature and circumstances of temptations, it may be expedient in this place to say a few
words on the subject. Evil spirits never make assault against any thing but what a man
loves, and their assault is violent in proportion to the intenseness of man's love; evil 
genii are those who assault what has relation to the affection of good, and evil spirits 
are those who assault what has relation to the affection of truth; as soon as ever they 

201

 
observe even the smallest thing which man loves, or perceive, as it were, by the smell 
what is delightful and dear to him, they instantly assault and endeavour to destroy it, 
consequently they assault and endeavour to destroy the whole man, inasmuch as his 
life consists in his loves; nothing is more pleasant to them than thus to destroy man, 
nor do they ever desist from their attempts, even to eternity, unless they are repelled 
by the LORD; such of them as are more particularly principled in malignity and 
cunning, insinuate themselves into man's very loves, by soothing and flattering them, 
and thus they introduce themselves to man, and then presently after introduction they 
endeavour to destroy his loves, and by so doing kill the man, and this in a thousand 
ways and methods altogether incomprehensible; nor do they carry on their assaults 
only by reasonings against goodnesses and truths, such assaults being of small 
account, (for if they were baffled a thousand times, still they would persist in their 
attempts, inasmuch as reasonings against goods and truths can never be wanting) but 
they pervert goods and truths, and enkindle a sort of fire of lust and persuasion, so that
a man does not know but that he is immersed in a like lust and persuasion, and herein 
they excite at the same time a delight, which they fraudulently steal from man's 
delights, derived from other sources, and thus with the utmost cunning they infect and
infest, and this so artfully, by leading from one thing to another, that unless the Lord 
was ready to administer help, man would never know any other but that he is really 
such as their suggestions represent him. In like manner they assault the affections of 
truth, which form man's conscience, as soon as ever they perceive any principle of 
conscience whatever, framing to themselves an affection out of the falsities and 
infirmities belonging to man, and by this affection overshadowing the light of truth, 
and thereby perverting it, or causing anxiety, and thus occasioning pain and torment; 
moreover they have the are of keeping the thought fixed intently on one object, 
whereby they fill it with phantasies, and thus at the same instant clandestinely 
insinuate lusts into those phantasies; not to mention innumerable other artifices, which
it is impossible to describe so as to give any just conceptions of them; what falls under
the immediate notice of man's conscience, which the evil spirits take particular delight
in destroying, will suggest but a partial and most general idea of those artifices. From 
this brief account of temptations, which yet from its brevity can scarcely be called an 
account, it may in some measure appear what is their nature and quality, and that in 
general they are such as are the kinds and degrees of man's love: hence also it may 
appear that the LORD'S temptations were the most grievous of all, inasmuch as the 
violence of the temptation is proportioned to the love; the LORD'S love was a most 
ardent desire for the salvation of the whole human race, consequently it was all the 
affection of goodness and truth in a supreme degree; against this love and affection all
the hells fought with the most malignant cunning and envenomed malice, but still the 
LORD overcame them all by his own proper power. AC 1820.

Verse 6. They mark my heels. See Psalm 49:5. Exposition.

Verses 12, 13. Your vows are upon me, O God; I will render praises to you, for you 
have delivered my soul, etc. When man emerges out of temptation, then light appears 
with its spiritual heat, that is, truth with its good; hence he has gladness after anxiety; 
this is the morning which succeeds night in the other life: the reason why in such case 
good is perceived, and truth appears is because after temptation truth and good 
penetrate towards the interiors, and are in-rooted; for when man is in temptation, he is
as it were in the hunger of good, and in the thirst of truth, wherefore when he 
emerges, he takes in good as a hungry man does meat, and receives truth as a thirsty 

202

man does drink; and besides when light from the Divine [being] appears, falsities and 
evils are removed, and when these are removed, there is a passage made for truth and 
good to penetrate more interiorly: these are the reasons why after temptations the 
good of love appears with its light from the LORD. AC 6829.

Verse 13. For you have delivered my soul from death, yea, my feet from stumbling, 
that I may walk before GOD in the light of the living. To walk with GOD is to teach and 
live according to the doctrine of faith; but to walk with JEHOVAH is to live a life of 
love; to walk is a usual expression signifying to live, as to walk in the law, to walk in 
the statutes, to walk in the truth; to walk properly respects a way, which is the way of 
truth, consequently which is of faith, or of the doctrine of faith; that this is the 
signification of walking, may be manifest from the WORD, as in Micah, "He has 
showed you, O man, what is good, and what does JEHOVAH require of you, but to do 
judgement, and to love mercy, and to humble yourself by walking with your GOD?" 
Micah 6:8, where to walk with GOD, signifies to live according to what was declared. 
And in David, "You have delivered my feet from stumbling, that I may walk before 
GOD in the light of the living," where to walk before GOD is to walk in the truth of 
faith, which is the light of the living. AC 519.

That to live, or to be alive, signifies spiritual life belonging to man, and that to be 
dead signifies the deprivation of that life, may be manifest from several passages in 
the WORD, as in David, "Behold the eye of JEHOVAH is on them that fear him, to 
deliver their soul from death, and to make them alive in famine," Psalm 30:18, 19; 
again, "You have delivered my soul from death, yea my feet from stumbling, to walk 
before GOD in the light of the living." AE 186.

203

PSALM 57

To him that presides; Al-taschith: Michtam of David, when he fled from Saul in the 
cave.

1. Be merciful to me, O GOD, be merciful to me, for my soul takes refuge with 
you, and in the shadow of your wings do I trust until calamities be overpast.
I cry to GOD, Most High, to GOD who performs for me.

2.
3. He will send from heaven and save me, he will put him to shame that would 

swallow me up; Selah; GOD shall send forth his mercy and his truth.

4. My soul is in the midst of lions; I dwell amongst men who are flames of fire; 

their teeth are as spears and arrows, and their tongue a sharp sword.
5. Exalt yourself, O GOD, above the heavens, your glory above all the earth.
6. They have prepared a net for my steps; they have bowed down my soul; they 

have dug a pit before me, they have fallen into the midst of it. Selah.
7. My heart is fixed, O God, my heart is fixed; I will sing and give praise.
8. Awake up my glory, awake psaltery and harp; I will awake in the morning.
9.

I will praise you, O LORD, amongst the peoples; I will praise you amongst the 
nations.

10. For your mercy is great even to the heavens; and your truth even to the skies.
11. Be you exalted, O GOD, above the heavens, your glory above all the earth. 

The Internal Sense

A prayer to the FATHER when in temptation-combats with the hells, which assault him,
verses 1 to 5; their malice against him, verses 4, 6; confidence from his Divine 
[principle], verses 7, 8; celebration of the FATHER on that account, verses 9 to 11.

Exposition

Verse 4. My soul is in the midst of lions; I dwell amongst the sons of man that are 
flames of fire; their teeth are spears and arrows, and their tongue a sharp sword. By 
lions are signified those who despoil the church of truths, and thus destroy it; by the 
sons of man who are flames of fire are signified those who are in the truths of the 
church, and abstractedly truths themselves, who are said to be flames of fire by the 
conceit of self-intelligence, whence come falsities, their teeth are a spear and arrows 
signify reasonings from external sensual principles, and thus from the fallacies and 
falsities of religion, by which truths are destroyed; teeth signify the ultimates of the 
life of man, which are external sensual principles, in this case reasonings from them; 
and tongue signifies the falsities of religion, wherefore their tongue is called a sharp 
sword, for by a sword is signified the destruction of truth by falsities. AE 455.

By lions are signified those who by falsities destroy the truths of the church; their 
teeth, which are a spear and arrows, signify scientifics, which they apply to confirm 
falsities and evils, and thus to destroy the truths and goods of the church; their tongue 
a sharp sword signifies cunning reasonings from falsities, which are called a sharp 
sword, because a sword signifies what is false destroying what is true. AE 556.

204

Verses 7, 8, 9. I will sing and give praise; awake up my glory, awake psaltery and 
harp; I will praise you, O LORD, amongst the peoples, I will praise you amongst the 
nations. Confession and glorification from the good of truth, or from spiritual good, 
and from the truth of good, or from spiritual truth, are expressed in every particular of 
this passage; the good of truth is expressed by singing, by awaking with the psaltery, 
and by praising amongst the nations; and the truth of good by awaking with the 
psaltery and harp, and praising amongst the people; for by nations, in the Word, are 
meant those who are in good, and by peoples, those who are in truth, in this case in 
spiritual truth: the reason why it is so said is because in the Word, where mention is 
made of good, mention is also made of truth, and this on account of their marriage. 
AE 323.

Verse 10. Your mercy is great even to the heavens, your truth, even to the aethers. 
That the Lord in the angelic heaven appears as a sun, and that the Divine Truth 
proceeding from the LORD, as a sun, forms all the light of heaven; thus all the 
intelligence and wisdom belonging to the angels, may be seen in the work concerning 
heaven and hell, HH 116 to 125, and HH 126 to 140; the reason why it is also said 
that the air is obscured is because the light of truth is meant, for the air has light from 
the sun. The like is signified by aethers in David, "Your mercy is great even to the 
heavens, your truth is even to the aethers," mercy signifies the Divine good of the 
Divine love, and truth the Divine Truth, and whereas the Divine Truth is the light of 
heaven, as was just now said, therefore it is said, "Your truth is even to the aethers;" 
by the aethers, therefore in the plural number is signified the Divine light even to the 
highest heaven, where it is in the highest degree. AE 541.

The Translator's Notes and Observations

Verse 8. I will awake in the morning. In the received English version of the Psalms, 
which is here rendered in the morning is expressed by the single term early, which has
respect to a period of time, but not immediately to the morning itself, consequently 
not to the divine and spiritual idea intended to be expressed by the term morning. For, 
according to the testimony of our enlightened expositor, the term morning has relation
to the LORD himself, who, in the supreme sense of the WORD, is the morning, and is 
thus expressive of a variety of ideas connected with that relation, which ideas are not 
at all suggested by the term early.

205

PSALM 58

To him that presides; Al-taschith; Michtam of David.

1. Do you indeed speak justice, O you mighty ones; do you judge uprightly, O 

you sons of man?

2. Yea, in heart you work wickedness, and your hands weigh out violence in the 

earth.

3. The wicked are estranged from the womb; they go astray from the belly, 

speaking lies.

4. Their venom is like the venom of a serpent, like that of the deaf adder which 

stops her ear;

5. Which hears not the voice of charmers, — of those skilled in enchantments.
6. O GOD, destroy their teeth in their mouths; break out the great teeth of the 

lions, O JEHOVAH.

7. Let them melt away, and be as water; let them pass away: when they direct 

their arrows, let them be blunted.

8. Let them be as a snail, which melts as it moves along; as an untimely birth of a

woman, let them never see the sun.

9. Before your pots can feel the thorns, whether they be green or dry, let him 

sweep them away.

10. The just shall be glad, when he sees vengeance; he shall bathe his feet in the 

blood of the wicked.

11. And man shall say, verily there is a reward for the just; verily, GOD is a judge 

in the earth.

The Internal Sense

Against those who were then of the church, who thought evil against the LORD, that 
they were in the mere falsities of evil, by which they perish, verses 1 to 9; that they 
who are in good come into the church, verses 10, 11.

EXPOSITION

Verse 3. The wicked are estranged from the womb, they go astray from the belly, 
speaking lies. It is not here meant that the wicked are estranged from the womb, and 
that they go astray from the belly, that is, from their first birth, for no one from that 
birth is estranged from GOD, and goes astray; but to be estranged from the womb 
signifies that they have departed from good to evil from the first day, when they were 
capable of being reformed; and to go astray from the belly signifies that, in like 
manner, they have departed from truths to falsities; to speak a lie also signifies to 
believe falsities. AE 710.

Verse 4. Their venom is like the venom of a serpent. That serpents in the Word, signify
the sensual man as to craftiness or subtlety, and as to prudence, may appear from the 
following passages: thus in Moses, "The serpent was made subtle above every wild 
beast of the field, which JEHOVAH GOD made," Gen 3:1; by the serpent here 

206

mentioned, is not understood the serpent, but the sensual man, and, in the general 
sense, the sensual principle itself, which is the ultimate of the human understanding: 
the reason why the serpent is called subtle above every wild beast of the field, is 
because of his having poison, and his bite being thence deadly, also from his hiding 
himself in lurking places; poison signifies craft and treachery, and thence the bite 
thereof, deadly hurt; and the lurking places from which he bites, and in which he 
conceals himself, signify subtleties. It is to be observed that all beasts signify 
affections, such as appertain to man, and serpents signify the affections of the sensual 
man, by reason of their creeping on the belly on the ground, in like manner as the 
sensual principle of men, for this is in the lowest place, and, as it were, creeps upon 
the ground under all other principles. The infernals are also crafty or subtle, because 
evil conceals in itself all subtlety and malice, as good does all prudence and wisdom; 
concerning this subject more may be seen in the work concerning Heaven and Hell, 
HH 567 to 581, where the malice and wicked acts of infernal spirits are treated of. 
Hence now it is that the devil or hell is called a serpent, as in the Apocalypse; "The 
dragon, the old serpent, the devil and satan, who seduces the whole world," Rev 12:9, 
14, 15; 20:20; and in David; "Their venom is like the venom of a serpent," Psalm 
58:4. AE 581.

Verse 6. O GOD, destroy their teeth in their mouths, break out the great teeth of the 
lions, O JEHOVAH. Teeth in their mouths signify scientifics from which they produce 
falsities; the great teeth of the lions signify the truths of the WORD falsified, which in 
themselves are falsities, by which they mostly prevail to destroy the truths of the 
church. AE 556.

What the falsification of truth is, shall be illustrated by some examples; truth is 
falsified when from reasonings it is concluded and said, that because no man can do 
good from himself, therefore good is of no effect to salvation: truth is also falsified 
when it is said, that every good, which man does, respects himself, and is done for the
sake of compensation, and this being the case, that works of charity are not to be 
done: truth is falsified when it is said, that because all good is from the LORD, 
therefore man ought to do nothing of good, but to expect influx: truth is falsified when
it is said, that truth can be given with man without the good which is of charity, thus 
faith without charity: truth is falsified when it is said, that no one can enter into 
heaven but who is miserable and poor; when it is also said, unless he gives his all to 
the poor and and plunges himself into distress: truth is falsified when it is said, that 
every one, however he has lived, may be admitted into heaven from mercy: truth is 
still more falsified when it is said, that there has been given to man the power of 
admitting into heaven whom he pleases: truth is falsified when it is said, that sins are 
wiped away and washed away like filth by water; and truth is still more falsified when
it is said, that man has the power of remitting sins, and when they are remitted, that 
they are altogether wiped away and man becomes pure: truth is falsified when it is 
said, that the LORD has taken all sins upon himself, and thus has taken them away, and
that man thereby can be saved, whatever his life be: truth is falsified when it is said, 
that no one is saved but he who is within the church; the reasonings, by which 
falsification is effected, are, that they who are within the church, are baptized, have 
the Word, have knowledge concerning the LORD, concerning the resurrection, 
concerning life eternal, concerning heaven, and concerning hell, and thus that they 
know what faith is by which they may be justified. There are innumerable cases like 

207

these, for there is not a single truth given which cannot be falsified, and the 
falsification be confirmed by reasonings from fallacies! AC 7318.

THE TRANSLATOR'S NOTES AND OBSERVATIONS

Verse 6. O God, destroy their teeth in their mouths, break out the great teeth of the 
lions, O JEHOVAH. It is evident from this passage, that the two names GOD and 
JEHOVAH are significative of two distinct principles in the DIVINE BEING, GOD having 
more relation to the DIVINE TRUTH, and JEHOVAH to the DIVINE GOOD. Accordingly 
GOD is supplicated to destroy the teeth of the wicked in their mouths, and JEHOVAH to 
break out the great teeth of the lions, to instruct us, that truth may destroy the teeth [or
false principles] of the wicked, but that the union of TRUTH and GOOD is necessary to 
break out the great teeth of the lions, in other words, to destroy truths falsified.

208

PSALM 59

To him that presides; Al-taschith; Michtam of David, when Saul sent, and they 
watched the house to kill him.

1. Deliver me from mine enemies, O GOD; lift me up from them that rise up 

against me.

2. Deliver me from the workers of iniquity, and save me from the men of blood.
3. For lo! they lie in wait for my soul; the mighty are gathered against me, not for

my transgression, nor for my sin, O JEHOVAH.

4. Not for mine iniquity do they run and prepare themselves; arouse yourself to 

meet me, and behold!

5. And do you, O JEHOVAH, GOD of Hosts, the GOD of Israel, awake to visit all 

the nations; spare not any who are treacherous in iniquity. Selah.

6. They return at evening; they make a noise like a dog, and go round about the 

city.

7. Behold, they belch out with their mouths, swords are in their lips; for who, say

they, does hear?

8. But you, O JEHOVAH, shall laugh at them; you shall have all the nations in 

derision.

9. They are strong; but on you do I wait; for GOD is my refuge.
10. The GOD of my mercy shall prevent me; GOD shall make me to see my desire 

upon mine enemies.

11. Slay them not lest my people forget; scatter them by your strength, and cast 

them down, O LORD! our shield.

12. For the sin of their mouth, for the word of their lips, let them be taken in their 

pride; and for the curses and lies which they speak.

13. Consume them in wrath, consume them that they be no more; that they may 

know that GOD rules in Jacob, even to the ends of the earth. Selah.

14. They return in the evening, they make a noise like a dog, and go round about 

the city.

15. They wander about for meat, if they be not satisfied; thus do they spend the 

night.

16. But I will sing aloud of your strength, yea, I will sing aloud of your mercy in 
the morning, for you have been my defence and my refuge in the day of my 
trouble.

17. O my strength, of you will I sing; for GOD is my defence, even the GOD of my 

mercy.

The Internal Sense

A prayer to the FATHER concerning those who were then of the church; that they 
sought to destroy and put him to death, when nevertheless he was innocent, verses 1 
to 6; that they contend by falsities against truths, verse 7; his trust in the FATHER, 

209

 
verses 8 to 10; he prays for them, verse 11; that they will destroy themselves, verses 
12, 13; by their malice, verses 14, 15; his trust in succour, verses 16, 17.

EXPOSITION

Verses 6, 14. They return at evening, they make a noise like a dog, etc. A dog signifies
the lowest of all, or those who are vile in the church, likewise those who are out of the
church, also those who babble much about the things of the church and understand 
little; and in the opposite sense, those who are altogether out of the faith of the church,
and speak disrespectfully of those things which are of faith. AC 7784.

By dogs in general are signified they who are in all kinds of cravings, and indulge in 
them, particularly they who are in pleasures merely corporeal, especially in the 
pleasure of feasting, in which they delight; such, inasmuch as they are of gross minds,
make no account of the things which relate to the church. Dogs have this signification 
in the following passages in the Word: "His watchmen are blind, they are all dumb 
dogs, looking about, lying down, loving to slumber, dogs obstinate of soul, they know
not satiety," Isaiah 56:10, 11. "They make a tumult like a dog, and go about in the city,
they ramble to eat, if they be not satisfied, thus do they spend the night," Psalm 59:6, 
14. AC 7784.

Verse 7. Behold they belch out with their mouth, for swords are in their lips. That a 
sword signifies the false principle destroying truth, is evident from these words, and 
hence may be known what is meant by the LORD'S Words to Peter, "They that take the 
sword, shall perish by the sword," namely that they who believe in falsities, will 
perish by falsities. The ground of this signification originates in the spiritual world, 
where, when spiritual combats take place, which are combats of what is true against 
what is false, and of what is false against what is true, there appears various weapons 
of war, as swords, spears, shields, and the like, not that by such things they engage in 
combat, for they are only representative appearances of spiritual combats. AE 131.

Verse 13. Consume them in wrath, etc. The external of the Word, which is called the 
sense of the letter, is written according to appearances in the world, because it is for 
infants and the simple minded, who have no perception of any thing contrary to 
appearances, wherefore such by the sense of the letter, in which are appearances of 
truth, are introduced into interior truths, as they advance in age, and thus appearances 
are put off by degrees, and in the place thereof interior truths are implanted: this may 
be illustrated by numberless examples from the Word; as where it is written that God 
is angry, punishes, casteth into hell, brings evil upon the wicked, and many other 
things of a similar nature, when notwithstanding GOD is never angry, never punishes, 
or casteth into hell, neither does he at all do evil to any one, but these things belong to
the wicked themselves, and are the consequence of their evils, for in the evils 
themselves are contained the evils of punishment; nevertheless these things are said in
many passages in the Word, because it so appears. AE 631.

Verse 16. Of your mercy in the morning. We often read of morning in the Word, and it 
has various significations according to the series of things treated of in the internal 
sense; in the supreme sense it signifies the LORD, and also his coming; in the internal 
sense it signifies his kingdom and church, and their state of peace; it moreover 

210

signifies the first state of a new church, and also a state of love, likewise a state of 
illustration, consequently a state of intelligence and wisdom, and also a state of 
conjunction, of goodness and truth, which is, when the internal man is conjoined to 
the external. The ground and reason why morning has such various signifi-cations, is 
because in the supreme sense it signifies the Divine Human of the LORD, and hence it 
also signifies all those things which proceed from him, so that he himself is there. The
reason why the Divine Human of the LORD, in the supreme sense is understood by 
morning is because the LORD is the sun of the angelic heaven, and the sun of that 
heaven does not make a progression from morning to evening, or from rising to 
setting as the sun of the world does to appearance, but it remains constant in its place, 
in front above the heavens, hence it is, that it is always in the morning, and never in 
the evening, and inasmuch as all intelligence and wisdom, which the angels possess, 
exist with them from the LORD as a sun, therefore also their state of love, and their 
state of wisdom and intelligence, and, in general, their state of illustration is signified 
by the morning. AC 179.

211

PSALM 60

To him that presides upon Shushan-eduth; Michtam of David, to teach; when he 
strove with Aram-naharaim and with Aram-zobah; when Joah returned, and smote of 
Edom in the valley of Salt twelve thousand.

1. O GOD, you have cast us off, you have scattered us, you have been displeased; 

do you restore us again!

2. You have made the earth to tremble, you have rent it to pieces; heal the 

breaches thereof, for it shakes.

3. You have showed to your people hard things; you have made us to drink the 

wine of trembling.

4. You have given a banner to them that fear you, that it may be displayed 

because of your truth. Selah.

5. That your beloved may be delivered; save with your right hand, and hear me.
6. GOD has spoken by his holiness; I will exult; I will divide Schechem and 

measure out the valley of Succoth.

7. Gilead is mine, and Manasseh is mine; Ephraim is the strength of my head; 

Judah is my lawgiver.

8. Moab is my wash-pot; over Edom will I cast out my shoe; O Philistia, triumph

you because of me.

9. Who will bring me to the fortified city? Who will lead me into Edom?
10. Will not you, O GOD! You that have forsaken us? you, O GOD, that have not 

gone forth with our armies?

11. Give us help against the enemy; for vain is the help of man.
12. With GOD we shall do valiantly; for he will tread down our enemies.

The Internal Sense

The lamentation of the LORD, that he is forsaken, together with the church, verses 1 to 
3; his confidence in deliverance, verses 4, 5; that an internal and external church will 
be established, in a supreme sense, of the LORD'S HUMAN [nature or manhood] which 
will be made Divine, verses 6 to 9; through his own power, verse 10; and through his 
own DIVINE [principle or Godhead], verses 11, 12.

EXPOSITION

Verses 1, 2. O GOD, you have cast us off, you have scattered us, you have been 
displeased; restore again us. You have made the earth to tremble, you have broken it; 
heal the breaches thereof, for it shakes. By a breach is signified the decay of the 
church, and hence the perversion of truth, and the inroad of what is false; this 
therefore is signified by making the earth to tremble, by breaking it, and by the earth 
being moved; the earth is the church. AE 400.

Verse 6. I will divide Schechem, and measure out the valley of Succoth. Schechem is 
the first station, as it were, in the land of Canaan, in coming from Syria, or from 
Haran; and whereas by the land of Canaan are signified celestial things of love, it is 

212

evident that by Schechem is signified the first appearing of things celestial. Jacob, 
when he returned from Haran to the land of Canaan, in like manner as Abram, came to
Schechem, as may appear from Genesis 33:18, where also by Schechem is signified 
the first dawn of light; so in David, "GOD has spoken in his holiness, I will exult, I 
will divide Schechem, and measure out the valley of Succoth; Gilead is mine, and 
Manasseh is mine, and Ephraim is the strength of my head; Judah is my lawgiver, 
Moab is my wash-pot, over Edom will I cast my shoe, over Philistia will I triumph," 
Psalm 60:6—8, where, by Schechem also the like is signified. AC 1441.

Succoth signifies tents, and tents the holy principle of truth. AC 4392.

Verse 7. Gilead is mine, and Manasseh is mine, and Ephraim is the strength of mine 
head; Judah is my lawgiver, By Manasseh is here signified the good of the church; by 
Ephraim its truth; and by Gilead, the natural principle; and since truth has divine 
power from natural good, therefore it is said, Ephraim is the strength of my head: the 
reason why there is divine power by truth from good in the natural principle is 
because the natural principle is the ultimate, into which interior things, which are 
spiritual and celestial, flow, and where they are together and subsist; they are 
therefore in their fullness there, in which, and from which, is all divine operation. AE 
440.

Verse 8. Over Edom will I cast out my shoe. The shoe is what invests the sole of the 
foot and the heel, therefore the shoe signifies what is still more natural; thus the very 
corporeal principle itself. AC 1748.

Verse 11. For vain (or vanity) is the help of man. Vanity signifies the falsity of 
doctrine, and a lie, the false principle of life. AC 9248.

PSALM 61

To him that presides upon Neginah; a Psalm of David.

1. Hear my cry, O GOD; attend to my prayer.
2. From the end of the earth I cry to you; when my heart fails lead me to the 

Rock that is higher than I.

3. For you have been a refuge for me, a strong tower from the enemy.
4.

I will abide in your tabernacle for ever; I will take refuge under the covert of 
your wings. Selah.

5. For you, O GOD, have heard my vows; you have given me the heritage of those

that fear your name.

6. You will prolong the days of the king; his years shall be from generation to 

generation.

7. He shall dwell before GOD for ever; O prepare mercy and truth, and let them 

preserve him.

8. So will I sing praises to your name for ever, by performing my vows daily.

The Internal Sense

Celebration of the FATHER by the LORD for his succour, verses 1 to 5; and union, 
verses 6 to 8.

Exposition

Verse 2. When my heart fails, lead me to the rock that is higher than I. It is an eternal 
truth, that the LORD governs heaven and the earth, also that no one lives from himself 
except the LORD, consequently that the all of life flows in, good of life from the LORD,
and evil of life from hell; this is the faith of the heavens; when man is in this faith, in 
which he may be when in good, then evil cannot be affixed and appropriated to him, 
because it is not from himself, but from hell; when man is in this state he can then be 
gifted with peace, for then he will trust solely in the LORD. AC 6325.

Rock denotes the LORD as to the truth of faith, because by rock is also meant a 
bulwark which is against falsities, the bulwark itself is the truth of faith, for combat is 
waged from that [truth] both against falsities and evils. That JEHOVAH is called a rock,
and that on such occasions is meant the LORD as to faith, is manifest from many 
passages in the Word, as from the following, "You have forgotten your salvation, and 
have not remembered the rock of your refuge," Isaiah 17:10; and in David, "From the 
extremity of the earth I cry to you, when my heart fails, lead me to the rock that is 
higher than I," Psalm 61:2. AC 8581.

Verse 4. I will abide in your tabernacle for ever, I will take refuge under the covert of 
your wings. To abide in your tabernacle for ever, signifies the Divine Good of love, to
take refuge under the covert of your wings, signifies in Divine Truths, for the wings of
JEHOVAH signify spiritual Truths. AE 799.

214

Verse 6. You will prolong the days of the king, his years shall be from generation to 
generation. Years denote what is eternal, for the subject treated of is concerning the 
LORD and his kingdom. That year in an internal sense does not signify year, may also 
be manifest from this consideration, that the angels, who are in the internal sense of 
the WORD, cannot have an idea of any year, but inasmuch as year denotes a full period
of time in the natural world, therefore instead of year they have an idea of what is full 
in respect to states of the church, and of what is eternal in respect to states of heaven: 
times with them are states. AC 2906.

The Translator's Notes and Observations

Verse 7. He shall dwell before GOD for ever; O prepare mercy and truth, let them 
preserve him. The union of mercy and truth in these words, will not fail to remind the 
intelligent reader of the Marriage of the DIVINE LOVE and WISDOM, which has been so 
often noted in the above pages as the distinguishing criterion of the Divine origin of 
the Sacred Scriptures. The same union will instruct him, that man cannot hope for the 
great blessing of dwelling before GOD for ever, only so far as mercy and truth preserve
him by being formed into his life, as its ruling principles of conduct and conversation.

215

PSALM 62

To him that presides, to Jeduthun; a Psalm of David.

1. Truly, my soul reposes in GOD; from him is my salvation.
2. He only is my rock and my salvation, my high tower; I shall not be greatly 

moved.

3. How long will you all assault a man? How long will you all attack him as 

though he were a bowing wall, or a tottering fence.

4. They only consult to cast him down from his eminence, they delight in lies; 

they bless with their mouth, but they inwardly curse. Selah.

5. O my soul, wait upon GOD, for my hope is from him.
6. He only is my rock and my salvation, my high tower; I shall not be moved.
7.

In GOD is my salvation and my glory; the rock of my strength, and my refuge 
is in GOD.

8. Trust in him at all times, you people; pour out your heart before him; GOD is a 

refuge for us. Selah.

9. Surely men of low degree are vanity, and men of high degree are a lie; if laid 

in the balance they are altogether lighter than vanity.

10. Trust not in oppression, and become not vain in robbery; if riches increase, set 

not your heart upon them.

11. Once has God spoken, these two things have I heard; that power belongs to 

God,

12. And that to you, O Lord, belongs mercy; for you renderest to every man 

according to his work.

The Internal Sense

A confession that there is no power but in the Divine [being or principle] and no 
succour but from the same, verses 1, 2, 5 to 8, 11, 12; that there is no prevailing 
against the Divine [being], verses 3, 4, 9, 10.

EXPOSITION

Verse 4. They bless with their mouth, but in the midst of them they curse. This is said 
of the church vastated as to good and as to truth, in which there is nothing but what is 
evil and false; the midst of man [vir] is the intellectual principle, where truth ought to 
be. AE 313.

Verse 10. Trust not in oppression, and become not vain in robbery; if riches increase, 
set not your heart upon them. The Divine Providence has for an end the eternal 
salvation of man, thus, not his satisfaction in the world, namely, opulence and 
eminence, wherein the generality, during the life of the body, place essential 
happiness; when yet the case is not so, inasmuch as generally eminence begets self-
love, and opulence the love of the world, thus, what is contrary to love to God, and to 
charity towards the neighbour. AC 6481.

216

The Translator's Notes and Observations

Verse 6. He only is my rock and my salvation, my high tower, etc. In the received 
English version of the Psalms, what is here rendered high tower, is expressed by the 
term defence, but it deserves consideration that, in the original Hebrew, a high place 
or tower is the idea intended to be expressed, as implying that all man's true security 
is an effect of his being raised above himself into communication and conjunction 
with that heavenly principle of love and of wisdom which is above himself.

Verse 9. Surely the sons of man [homo] are vanity, and the sons of man [vir] are a lie. 
By the sons of man [homo] are here evidently meant the thoughts of man's natural 
will, and by the sons of man [vir], the thoughts of man's natural understanding, which
are opposed to the Divine will and Divine understanding. See Exposition of Ps. xlix. 
verses 1, 2, 3.

217

PSALM 63

A Psalm of David, when he was in the wilderness of Judah.

1. O GOD, you are my GOD, early do I seek you; my soul thirsts for you; my flesh

longs for you, in a dry and thirsty land without water.

2. So may I behold your power and your glory, as I have seen you in the 

sanctuary.

3. For your mercy is better than life; my lips shall praise you.
4. Thus will I bless you while I live; in your name will I lift up my hands.
5. My soul shall be satisfied as with marrow and fatness, and my mouth shall 

praise you with joyful lips;

6. While I remember you on my bed; while I meditate upon you in the night 

watches.

7. For you have been my help, therefore under the shadow of your wings will I 

sing.

8. My soul cleaves to you; your right hand upholds me.
9. But they that seek my soul to destroy it, shall come into the lower parts of the 

earth.

10. They shall be given up to the sword; they shall be a portion for foxes.
11. But the king shall rejoice in God; every one that swears by him shall glory; for

the mouth of them that speak lies shall be stopped.

The Internal Sense

The desire and love of the LORD that; he may he united to his Divine [principle], 
verses 1 to 8; that they will perish who are in the falsities of evil, who lay snares for 
him, verses 9, 10; that then there will be salvation from the LORD, and rejection of the 
wicked, verse 11.

Exposition

Verse 1. O my GOD, early do I seek you, my soul thirsts for you, my flesh longs for 
you; in a dry and thirsty land without water. Flesh in the Word signifies various 
things; it signifies the proprium [or selfhood] of man, thus either his good or evil, and 
hence it signifies the whole man; in the supreme sense it signifies the DIVINE HUMAN 
[principle] of the LORD, and specifically the Divine good of the Divine love 
proceeding from him. That flesh signifies the good belonging to man, may he evident 
from this passage, "O my GOD, my flesh desires you," Psalm 63:1. AE 1082.

Waters signify the truths of faith, because bread signifies the good of love; the reason 
why waters and bread have this signification is because those things which relate to 
spiritual nourishment are expressed in the sense of the letter by such things as relate to
natural nourishment; for waters and bread, by which is meant all drink and all meat in 
general, nourish the body, and the truths of faith and the good of love nourish the soul;
this also is from correspondence, for when mention is made of bread and water in the 

218

Word, the angels, as being spiritual, understand those things which nourish them, 
which are the good things of love and the truths of faith. AE 71.

Verse 2. So may I behold your power and your glory. Power is predicated of the good,
and glory of the truth, which are in the Word. AC 4060.

Verse 5. My soul shall be satisfied as with marrow and fatness, and my mouth shall 
praise with lips of singing. The soul being satisfied with marrow and fatness signifies 
to be filled with the good of love and the joy thence derived; to praise with lips of 
singing signifies to worship by truths which make the soul glad. AE 1159.

Verse 6. While I remember you on my bed. Bed denotes the natural principle, because 
the natural principle is beneath the rational, and serves it as a bed, for the rational 
principle lies down as it were on the natural, and because the natural is thus spread out
underneath, it is therefore called a bed. AC 6188.

Verse 7. For you have been my help, therefore under the shadow of your wings will I 
sing. That wings signify the Divine spiritual principle, which in its essence is truth 
derived from good, is evident from these words. AE 283.

Verse 11. For the king shall rejoice in God; every one that swears by him shall glory. 
To swear by GOD here signifies to speak the truth, for it follows, "The mouth of them 
that speak lies shall be stopped." AE 608.

219

PSALM 64

To him that presides: a Psalm of David.

1. Hear my voice, O GOD, when I complain; preserve my life from fear of the 

enemy.

2. Hide me from the secret counsel of the wicked; from the insurrection of the 

workers of iniquity.

3. Who wet their tongue like a sword; who make ready their bow; their arrows 

are bitter words.

4. That they may shoot in secret at the perfect man; suddenly do they shoot at 

him and fear not.

5. They confirm themselves in an evil purpose; they commune of laying snares 

privily; they say, who shall see them?

6. They devise wicked deeds, saying, we have accomplished the devised project; 

for the inmost of man and the heart is deep.

7. But GOD shall shoot at them an arrow; suddenly shall they be wounded.
8. He shall cast them down; their own tongue shall be against them; all that see 

them shall flee away.

9. For every man shall fear, and shall declare the work of God, and shall 

understand his doing.

10. The just shall be glad in JEHOVAH, and shall trust in him; and all the upright in 

heart shall glory.

The Internal Sense

Of the snares of the wicked against the LORD, verses 1 to 6; that they will perish, 
verses 7, 8; and thus the good will be saved, verses 9, 10.

EXPOSITION

Verse 1. Preserve my life from the fear of the enemy. Good has life in itself because it 
is from the LORD, who ia life itself; in the life which is from the LORD there is wisdom 
and intelligence, for to receive good from the LORD, and thence to will good, is 
wisdom; and to receive truth from the LORD, and thence to believe truth, is 
intelligence: and they who have this wisdom and intelligence have life, and whereas 
happiness is adjoined to such life, eternal happiness is what is also signified by life; 
since there is life in good and in the truth thence derived, there cannot be life in evil 
and in the false derived from evil, for these latter are contrary principles and 
extinguish life. AC 5070.

Enemy denotes evils and falsities, for nothing else is meant in the Word in the spiritual
sense by enemies, foes, and haters. AC 8282.

Verse 3. Who wet their tongue like a sword. That a sword signifies the false principle 
destroying truth, is evident from these words in David, "The workers of iniquity 
sharpen their tongue like a sword, they bend their arrows with a bitter word." AE 131.

220

Inasmuch as a sword signifies the false principle fighting against truth, therefore it is 
said, they sharpen their tongue like a sword, and since an arrow signifies the false 
principle of doctrine, therefore it is said, their arrows are bitter words. AE 359.

Verse 6. The inmost of man and the heart is deep. The midst of the man [viri] denotes 
the intellectual [principle] where the truth should be, and the heart the will [ principle]
where the good should be, but in the present case, both perverted, the latter into evil, 
the former into the false. AE 313.

Verse 9. For every man shall fear, and shall declare the work of GOD. Fear, when 
predicated concerning the LORD, signifies worship and to revere, because in worship 
and in all things belonging thereto, there is a holy and reverential fear, which is 
grounded in the consideration, that the object of worship is to be honoured, and not by
any means to be injured; the case herein is as with infants towards their parents, with 
parents towards their children, with wives towards their husbands, and husbands 
towards their wives, likewise as with friends towards friends, with whom there is a 
fear lest they should be hurt, and at the same time a respect: this fear, attended with 
respect, is in all love and in all friendship, since love and friendship, without such 
fear and respect, is as food not salted, which is unsavoury: hence then it is, that to 
fear the LORD denotes to worship him from such love. AE 696.

Verse 10. The just shall be glad in JEHOVAH. All who are in the good of charity, are 
called the just, not that they are just from themselves, but from the LORD, whose 
justice is appropriated to them; they who believe themselves just from themselves, or 
so justified that they have no longer any thing of evil, are not amongst the just, but 
amongst the unjust, for they attribute to themselves what is good, and also place merit
in good, and such cannot in any way adore the LORD from true humiliation; wherefore
they who in the Word are called just and holy, are they who know and acknowledge 
that all good is from the LORD, and all evil from themselves, that is, in the power of 
themselves from hell. AC 5070

221

PSALM 65

To him that presides; a Psalm of David, a song.

1. Trust and praise are due to you, O GOD! in Zion; and to you shall the vow be 

performed.

2. O you that hearest prayer, to you shall all flesh come.
3.
Iniquities overwhelm me; but as for our transgressions, you will forgive them.
4. Blessed is the man whom you choose, and cause to approach, he shall dwell in

your courts; we shall be satisfied with the good of your house, with the 
holiness of your temple.

5. Wonderful things in justice will you answer us, O GOD of our salvation, the 

confidence of all the ends of the earth, and of the sea afar off.

6. Who by his strength sets fast the mountains, being girded with power.
7. Who stills the noise of the seas, the noise of their waves, and the tumult of the 

peoples.

8. And they that dwell at the extremities of the earth are afraid on account of 
your signs; you make the outgoings of the morning and evening to sing.
9. You visit the earth, and water it; you greatly enrich it; the river of GOD is full 

of water; you prepare their corn, for thus you have established it.

10. You water the furrows thereof; you set the ridges thereof; you make it soft 

with showers, you bless the springing thereof.

11. You crown the year with your goodness, and your paths drop fatness.
12. The habitations of the wilderness distil; and the hills are girded with joy.
13. The pastures are clothed with flocks; the valleys are covered with corn; they 

shout, they also sing.

The Internal Sense

That from the union of the DIVINE [essence] and of the HUMAN [essence] in the LORD 
will arise a church, which will be in all truth from the LORD, and safe from the 
infestation of falsities, verses 1 to 13.

EXPOSITION

Verse 4. Blessed is the man whom you choose, and cause to approach, he shall dwell 
in your courts; we shall be satisfied with the good of your house, with the holiness of 
your temple. By these words is signified that they who are in charity, or in spiritual 
affection, are about to live in heaven, and are there in intelligence and wisdom from 
Divine Truth and Divine Good; by the elect, or by whom you choose, are signified 
those who are in neighbourly love or in charity; by causing to approach is signified 
spiritual affection or love, for in proportion as man is in that love or in that affection, 
in the same proportion he is near to the LORD, for every one approaches according to 
that love; by inhabiting courts is signified to live in heaven, by inhabiting to live, and 
by courts heaven; by being satisfied with the good of your house is signified from 
Divine good to be in wisdom; and by being satisfied with the holiness of your temple 
is signified from Divine truth to be in intelligence, and from both to enjoy celestial 

222

joy; the house of GOD signifies heaven and the church as to Divine good, and the 
temple heaven and the church as to Divine truth, holiness is predicated of spiritual 
good which is truth. AE 630.

Verse 5. The confidence of all the ends of the earth and of the sea afar off. The ends of
the earth and the sea afar off, signify the ultimates of the church. In the opposite 
sense by afar off is signified evil, because this is in the external man, for all, who are 
in evils and in falsities thence derived, are external men. AE 1133.

Verses 6, 7. GOD who by his strength sets fast the mountains, he being girded with 
power; who stills the noise of the seas, the noise of their waves, and, the tumult of the 
people, and they that dwell in the extremities are afraid on account of your signs. 
Thus is described the Divine power of the LORD by things which testify that it ought 
to be believed, but the things which testify, which are signs, are not that he sets fast 
the mountain, that he stills the noise of the seas, the noise of the waves, and the tumult
of the people, for these are not such signs as to persuade those who ascribe all things 
to nature; but those things are signs testifying the Divine power of the LORD, which 
are understood in the spiritual sense in which heaven and the church are treated of, for
in that sense, by mountains, which by his strength he sets, fast, are meant the superior 
heavens, because the angels of those heavens dwell upon mountains, and in the 
abstract sense is meant love to the LORD and charity towards our neighbour, these 
being the things which the LORD sets fast by his power, that is, makes to subsist for 
ever; that mountains signify such things, see above, AE 405; by the noise of the seas 
and the noise of the waves are meant the disputes and reasonings of those who are 
below the heavens, and who are natural and sensual; that seas signify those things 
which are of the natural man, thus natural men, and hence their noise and waves 
signify their disputes and reasonings, see also above, AE 342; by the tumult of the 
people are meant contradictions from falsities, for by people are signified those who 
are in truths, and in the opposite sense who are in falsities, see above, AE 175, 331, 
625; that they who dwell in the extremities are afraid of your signs, signifies holy 
worship grounded in faith concerning the Divine power with those who are in the 
ultimates of heaven and the church; that to fear is to worship the LORD from charity 
and faith, see above, AE 696, and that the inhabitants of the extremities are those who 
are in the ultimates of heaven and of the church, and are there in the faith of charity, is
evident from this consideration, that extremities are the ultimates of heaven and of the 
church; from these considerations it is evident that signs here signify testifications 
respecting the Divine power of the LORD. AE 706.

Verses 9, 10. You visit the earth, and water it; you greatly enrich it; the river of GOD is
full of water; you prepare their corn, for thus you have established it; you water the 
furrows thereof; you set the ridges thereof; you make it soft with showers; you bless 
the springing thereof. By earth is here signified the church; by a river full of water is 
signified doctrine full of truths; by watering her ridges, by settling the furrows, and 
making it soft with showers, is signified to fill with the knowledges of good and truth; 
by preparing corn is signified all that nourishes the soul; wherefore it is added, thus 
you establish the earth, that is the church; by blessing the springing thereof is 
signified to produce anew continually, and to give birth to truths. AE 644.

Verses 12, 13. The habitations of the wilderness distil; the hills are girded with joy; 
the pastures are clothed with flocks; and the valleys are covered with corn, they shout,

223

they also sing. These words relate also to the church amongst the nations; by the 
habitations of the wilderness distilling, is signified that the minds of those, which 
were before in ignorance of truth, acknowledge and receive truths; to distil is spoken 
of the influx, the acknowledgement and reception of truth; habitations have relation to
the interiors of man, which are of his mind, and wilderness is spoken of the state of 
the ignorance of truth; that the hills are girded with joy, signifies that the goods 
belonging to them receive truths with joy of heart; that the pastures are clothed with 
flocks, and the valleys are covered with corn, signifies that each mind, both the 
spiritual and natural, receives the truths suitable to itself; pastures signify those things
which are of the spiritual mind, and valleys those which are of the natural mind, and 
flock spiritual truth, and corn natural truth. AE 730.

224

PSALM 66

To him that presides; a Psalm, or Song.

1. Make a joyful noise to God, all the earth. 
2. Sing forth the glory of his name, make his praise glorious.
3. Say to GOD, how marvelous are your works! through the greatness of your 

power shall your enemies submit themselves to you.

4. All the earth shall bow themselves down to you; and shall sing to you, they 

shall sing to your name. Selah.

5. Come and behold the works of GOD; marvelous are his doings towards the 

sons of man.

6. He turned the sea into dry land; they went through the river on foot; then we 

rejoiced in him.

7. He rules by his power for ever; his eyes behold the nations; let not the 

rebellious exalt themselves. Selah.

8. O bless our GOD you peoples, and make the voice of his praise to be heard.
9. Who places our soul amongst the living, and suffers not our feet to be moved.
10. For you, O GOD, did prove us; you did try us as silver is tried.
11. You did bring us into the net, you did lay oppression upon our loins.
12. You did cause men to ride over our head; we went through fire and through 

waters, and you have brought us out into a broad place.

13. I will come into your house with burnt offerings; I will pay you my vows;
14. Which my lips have uttered, and my mouth has spoken, when I was in trouble.
15. I will offer to you burnt-sacrifices of fatlings, with the incense of rams; I will 

offer bullocks with goats. Selah.

16. Come, hearken all you that fear GOD, I will declare what he has done for my 

soul,

17. I cried to him with my mouth, and he was exalted with my tongue.
18. If I regard iniquity in my heart, the LORD will not hear.
19. Verily, GOD has heard, he has attended to the voice of my prayer.
20. Blessed be GOD, who has not turned away my prayer, nor his mercy from me.

The Internal Sense

His joy by reason of the new church, which will trust in the LORD, verses 1 to 5; who 
will preserve it from evils, verses 6, 7; that the LORD, by means of grievous 
temptations, was united to his DIVINE [principle], verses 8 to 12; that thence there was 
Divine Truth from the LORD among men, verses 13 to 17; that this was effected by his 
integrity, verses 18 to 20.

Exposition

Verse 5. Sons of man. By the sons of man are signified the same as by people, namely,
those who are in spiritual truths and goods. AE 331.

225

Verses 11, 12. You have laid oppression upon our loins; you have made a man to ride 
over our head; we went through fire and waters, yet you broughtest us out into a 
broad place. Thus is described spiritual captivity and liberation thence; spiritual 
captivity is when the mind is closed so that it does not perceive good and understand 
truth; liberation thence is when the mind is opened; by oppression on the loins is 
signified that there is no perception of the good of love, for the loins and thighs 
signify the good of love; by making a man to ride over our head, is signified that 
there is no understanding of truth, by man is here signified understanding grounded in
self, which is no understanding, and the like by the head; these things being signified 
it is therefore said, we have entered through fire and waters, through fire denoting 
through evils which are from self-love, and through waters through falsities; 
liberation thence is understood by being brought out into a broad place. AE 355.

Verses 13, 15. I will come into your house with burnt-offerings, etc. To offer burnt-
offerings of fat things signifies worship from the good of celestial love; to offer with 
the incense of rams signifies worship from the good of spiritual love. AE 324.

Verses 17, 18, 19. I cried to GOD with my mouth; if I regard iniquity in my hearty the 
LORD will not hear; verily GOD has heard; he has attended to the voice of my prayers.
Inasmuch as the quality of prayers is such as the heart of man is, and consequently 
they are not prayers which have any worship in them if the heart be evil, therefore it is
said, if I regard iniquity in my heart the LORD will not hear, by which is signified 
would not receive worship; the heart of man is his love, and the love of man is his life 
itself, hence the prayers of man are of such a quality as his love is, or such as is life is;
hence it follows, that prayers signify the life of his love and charity, or that this life is 
understood by prayers in the spiritual sense. Moreover, man continually prays when 
he is in the life of charity, although not in mouth, still in heart, for what is of the love 
this is continually in the thought, even when he does not know it. AE 325.

THE TRANSLATOR'S NOTES AND OBSERVATIONS

Verse 12. You have made a man to ride over our head. The word here rendered man is
expressed in the Hebrew original by a term, which properly signifies the intellectual 
man, and since this man is frequently the child of evil and error, therefore the term is 
here to be understood in a bad sense.

Yet you have brought us out into a broad place, what is here rendered into a broad 
place is expressed in the original Hebrew by into the breadth, the ground or reason of 
which expression is thus explained in the Apocalypse Explained, 861. "By the breadth 
of the earth is signified the truth of the church, which signification originates in this 
consideration, that in the spiritual world there are four quarters, east, west, south and 
north, and the east and west make its longitude, and the south and north its latitude; 
and whereas in the east and west they dwell who are in the good of love, and therefore
by the east and west are signified good, hence in like manner by longitude; and 
whereas in the south and north they dwell who are in the truths of wisdom, and 
therefore by the south and north is signified truth, hence in like manner by latitude." 
That by latitude is signified truth, may be manifest from several passages in the Word,
"JEHOVAH you have not shut me up in the hand of the enemy, you have made my feet 
to stand in the breadth," Psalm 31:9. "I called on JEHOVAH in distress, he answered me

226

in the breadth," Psalm 118:5. "JEHOVAH brought me into the breadth, he delivered 
me," Psalm 18:19. 

227

PSALM 67

To him that presides on Neginoth, a Psalm, a song.

1. GOD be merciful to us, and bless us, and cause his face to shine upon us. Selah.
2. That your way may be known upon earth, your salvation amongst all nations.
3. Let the peoples praise you, O GOD, let all peoples praise you.
4. Let the nations be glad and sing for joy, for you shall judge the peoples in 

rectitude; and shall lead the nations upon earth. Selah.

5. Let the peoples praise you, O GOD, let all the peoples praise you.
6. The earth shall yield her increase, GOD, our own GOD shall bless us.
7. GOD shall bless us, and all the ends of the earth shall fear him.

The Internal Sense

That the universal church will acknowledge and worship the LORD from joy of heart, 
verses 1 to 5, 7; also every thing belonging to the church, verse 6.

EXPOSITION

Verse 1. GOD be merciful to us, and bless us, and cause his faces to shine upon us. By 
the light of the faces of JEHOVAH, or the LORD, is understood the Divine truth from the
Divine love, and hence intelligence and wisdom, for from Divine truth, or from 
Divine light in the heavens are all intelligence and wisdom both to angels and men, 
hence by causing your faces to shine upon us, by lifting up the light of your faces 
upon us is signified to enlighten in Divine truth, and to gift with intelligence and 
wisdom. AE 412.

Verses 3, 4. Let the peoples praise you, O GOD, let all the peoples praise you; O let 
the nations be glad and sing for joy, for you shall judge the peoples in rectitude, and 
shall lead the nations upon earth. Peoples here manifestly denote those who are in the
truths of faith, and nations those who are in the good of charity. AC 1259.

21. Truly GOD shall bruise the head of his enemies, the hairy scalp of such as go 

on still in their trespasses.

22. The LORD has said, I will bring you back from Bashan; I will bring you back

24. They have seen your goings, O GOD, the goings of my GOD, my king in the

gives strength and power to his people: blessed be GOD!

The Internal Sense

That the hells will be subdued, verses 1, 2; that the good will acknowledge the LORD 
who is Divine Truth itself, verses 3 to 5, 31; that he will be their protector, verses 5, 6;
that he will regenerate them, verses 7 to 11; others not so, although they have the 
Word, verses 12 to 14; of the church from the LORD, from whom is the all of doctrine, 
verses 15 to 17; that he will snatch them from the hands of the internals, verses 18 to 
23; celebration of the LORD for the same, verses 24 to 29; that the natural man will be 
subdued, verse 30; celebration of the Divine power of the LORD through his union, 
verses 32 to 35.

Exposition

Verse 2. As smoke is driven away, drive them away, as wax melts before the, fire, let 
the wicked perish before GOD. The destruction of the wicked is compared to smoke, 
which is driven by the air, and to wax which melts before the fire, because smoke 
signifies falsities, and fire evils. AE 539.

Verse 4. Sing to GOD, praise his name, extol him that rides on the clouds, by his name 
JAH. Where to ride on the clouds denotes the understanding of the Word as to its 
interior things, or the internal sense. AC 2701.

Verse 4. By his name JAH. The reason why Jah denotes the Divine Truth proceeding 
from the Divine human [principle] of the LORD, is because Jah is from JEHOVAH, and 
is called Jah, because it is not the esse, but the existere from the esse, for Divine truth 

230

is the existere, but the Divine good is the esse, see AC 6880. By Jah is also signified 
Divine truth in David, Sing to God, praise his name, extol him that rides upon the 
clouds, by his name Jah, and exult before him," Psalm 68:4, where to praise and extol
GOD by his name Jah denotes by Divine truth: again, "In straitness I called upon Jah, 
Jah answered me in the breadth; JEHOVAH helped me, my strength and song is Jah: I 
shall not die but live, and announce the works of Jah; I will enter through the gates of 
justice, and will confess Jah," Psalm 118:5, 13, 14, 17, 20; in this Psalm Jah denotes 
the LORD as to Divine Truth; in like manner Jah in Hallelu-Jah, Psalm 105:45, 106:1, 
48, 111:1, 112:1, 113:1, 9, 115:17, 18, 116:19. AC 8267.

Verse 4. Sing to GOD, praise his name, etc. By him that rides upon the clouds, is here 
understood the LORD as to illustration; clouds denote truths in the ultimates, which are
illustrated, and these are illustrated by the influx of light, which is the Divine truth 
from the spiritual world, or heaven. So in Nahum, "The way of JEHOVAH is in storms 
and tempest, and the clouds are the dust of his feet," Nahum 1:3. Truth in the 
ultimates, which is the truth of the literal sense of the Word, is called the clouds, the 
dust of the feet of JEHOVAH, because it is the natural, and lowest truth, into which the 
Divine truth in heaven, which is spiritual, terminates, and upon which it also subsists; 
inasmuch as Divine truth in ultimates is but little understood, unless it be illustrated 
from heaven, it is therefore a ground of disputation and controversy, which is 
understood by the storm and tempest, in which is the way of JEHOVAH; spiritual storm 
and tempest denoting disputation concerning the genuine sense, which nevertheless 
the LORD illustrates by influx, with those who desire the truth. AC 594.

Verse 5. A father of the fatherless, and a judge of the widow. The fatherless denote 
those who as infants are in the good of innocence, but not as yet in the truth, whose 
FATHER is said to be the LORD, because as a Father he leads them, and this by truths 
into goods, namely into the good of life or wisdom; widows denote those who as 
adults are in truth, but not yet in good, whose judge is said to be the LORD, because he
leads them, and this by good into truth, namely into the truth of intelligence; good 
without truth, which is the fatherless, becomes the good of wisdom by the doctrine of 
truth; and truth without good, which is the widow, becomes the truth of intelligence by
the life of good. AC 4844.

Verses 7, 8, 9. O God, when you went forth before your people, when you did march 
through the wilderness; the earth trembled, the heavens also dropped at the presence 
of GOD, this Sinai before GOD, the GOD of Israel; you O GOD make the rain of 
benevolences to drop. That hereby is signified a state of good in which the truths of 
faith were to to be implanted, appears from the signification of the wilderness of 
Sinai, as denoting a state of good in which the truths of faith are to be implanted; 
wilderness here denotes the good in which truths have not been yet implanted, and 
Sinai denotes the truths themselves; for a wilderness has several significations; in 
general, it signifies what is uninhabited and uncultivated, thus, in a spiritual sense, the
good which as yet does not contain truths, for good without truths is what is 
spiritually uncultivated. As to what concerns the mountain of Sinai, it signifies in the 
supreme sense the Divine Truth derived from the Divine Good, mountain the Divine 
Good, and Sinai the Divine Truth; hence it was that the sons of Israel encamped in the
wilderness near that mountain, for from it were not only promulgated the Ten 

231

 
Commandments, which are the law in a confined sense, but likewise all the statutes of
the church, which were contained in them, because they represented the spiritual and 
celestial truths and goods of the Lord's kingdom; that the law was thence promulgated
is manifest from the following chapter xx. that the statutes of the church were also 
thence promulgated, is signified by Sinai in David, "O GOD, when you went forth 
before your people, when you did march in the wilderness, the earth trembled, the 
heavens also dropped at the presence of GOD, this Sinai before GOD, the GOD of Israel;
you O GOD, cause to drop the rain of benevolences;" in this passage Sinai denotes the 
truth which is from good, for these things are signified by the heavens dropping 
before GOD, and by GOD dropping the rain of benevolences. AC 8753.

That Mount Sinai denotes the law or Divine Truth, proceeding from the Divine Good 
of the LORD, thus the Word, and in the supreme sense the LORD, is manifest from 
David, "The earth trembled, the heavens also dropped before GOD, this Sinai before 
GOD, the GOD of Israel; the chariots of GOD are two myriads, thousands of thousands; 
the LORD is amongst them, in Sinai in the holy place." That earth and the heavens 
denote the external and internal of the church, see AC 1733, and that chariot denotes 
doctrine, see AC 2760; hence the chariots of GOD denote doctrinals or Truths Divine 
such as is in the heavens; hence it is evident that by this Sinai before GOD, the GOD of 
Israel, and by Sinai in the sanctuary, is signified the law or Divine Truth proceeding 
from the Divine Good of the LORD. AC 9420.

Verses 9, 11. You, O GOD, make the rain of benevolences to drop, by which you did 
confirm your inheritance when it was weary; your congregation has dwelt therein. 
Where manifestly congregation denotes the people who receive the influx of Divine 
Truth from the LORD, for it is the inheritance of GOD by which is signified the church; 
it is called your congregation shall dwell in it; by the rain of benevolences is signified
the influx of Divine Truth from the Divine clemency. AE 650.

Verse 13, Though you have lain amongst the hearth-stones, the wings of a dove, 
covered with silver, and her feathers with yellow gold. The wings of a dove are the 
truths of faith; that a dove denotes faith, see AC 870, which are said to be covered 
with silver, because silver is truth derived from good. AC 8764.

What is signified by the above words, can only be known from the internal sense; to 
lie amongst the hearth-stones signifies to live in the statutes; the wings of a dove 
covered with silver signify spiritual truths; feathers of yellow gold signify spiritual 
good from which those truths are derived; SHADDAI signifies a state of temptations; 
kings in her signify truths in that state, and after it. The reason why the wings of a 
dove covered with silver signify spiritual truths is because wing signifies what is 
spiritual, a dove truth from good, and silver truth itself; the reason why feathers 
covered with yellow gold signify spiritual good from which these truths are derived, is
because a feather signifies spiritual good from which are truths, and the similitude of 
the yellowness of gold; the reason why when SCHADDAI expands, signifies a state of 
temptations is because GOD SCHADDAI signifies temptations, and consolations after 
them, and whereas truths from good are implanted in man by temptations, therefore it 
is said, kings shall be in her, for by kings are signified truths derived from good. AE 
283.

232

Verses 15, 16. The mountain of GOD is the mountain of Bashan, a mountain of hills is 
the mountain of Bashan; why leap you, you mountains? you hills of the mountain, 
which GOD desires to dwell in? JEHOVAH shall dwell in it for ever. By the mountain of 
Bashan is signified voluntary good, such as has place with those who are in the 
externals of the church, for Bashan is a country beyond Jordan, which was given as an
inheritance to the half tribe of Manassah, and by Manassah is signified the voluntary 
good of the external or natural man, this voluntary good is the same thing with the 
good of love in the external man; for all good of love is of the will, and all truths 
thence are of the understanding; wherefore by Ephraim his brother is signified the 
intellectual truth of that good: since by the mountain of Bashan that good is signified 
therefore by the hills of that mountain are signified good things in act; hence it is 
evident what is signified by the mountain of GOD the mountain of Bashan, a mountain
of hills the mountain of Bashan, why leap you, you mountains, you hills of the 
mountain; since the LORD dwells with man in his voluntary good, whence come good 
things in act, therefore it is said, GOD desires to dwell in it, JEHOVAH also shall dwell 
there for ever. AE 405.

Verse 17. The chariots of GOD are twenty thousands, thousands of thousands. The 
chariots of GOD denote those things which are of the Word, and of the doctrine thence 
derived; myriads of thousands denote the infinite things which are therein, as in John, 
"I saw and heard the voice of many angels about the throne, their number was 
myriads of myriads, and chiliads of chiliads," Apoc 5:11, denoting that they were 
innumerable. AC 3186.

Verse 18. You have ascended on high, you have led captivity captive. This is said of 
the LORD, and by leading captivity captive, is signified to deliver them from the false 
principles which had led them captive. AE 811.

Verse 21. GOD shall bruise the head of his enemies, the hairy scalp of such as go on 
still in their trespasses. In this and other passages, by shaving the head, polling the 
beard, and inducing baldness, is signified to deprive a man of all truth and good, since
he who is deprived of ultimates is deprived also of things prior, for prior things exist 
and subsist in ultimates. AE 66.

Verses 24, 25. They have seen your goings O GOD, the goings of my GOD, my KING, in 
the sanctuary; the singers went before, the players on instruments after, in the midst 
of virgins playing with timbrels. These things are said of the LORD, who is there my 
GOD, and my KING; and his coming is meant by his goings in the sanctuary; by the 
singers going before, the players on instruments, are signified all who are of his 
spiritual and celestial kingdom; by the virgins singing, they who are of his spiritual 
kingdom, by the players on instruments, they who are of his celestial kingdom, who 
are called virgins from the affection of truth and of good, and are said to sing, and 
play on instruments, from their gladness and joy of heart. AE 863.

Verses 25 to 32. The singers went before, the players on instruments after, in the midst
of virgins playing with timbrels: bless you GOD in the congregations, the LORD from 
the fountain of Israel; there is little Benjamin their ruler, the princes of Judah their 
council, the princes of Zebulon, the princes of Naphtali, your GOD has commanded 
your strength; put on strength O GOD; this you have done for us; from your temple at 
Jerusalem, kings shall give a present to you, rebuke the wild beast of the reed, the 

233

multitude of the mighty amongst the calves of the people; him that treads down pieces
of silver, that scatters the people, that delights in wars; the fat shall come out of 
Egypt, Ethiopia shall soon stretch out her hands to GOD. The subject here treated of in
the spiritual sense is concerning the LORD'S advent, and concerning the glorification of
his HUMAN [principle], also concerning the subjugation of the hells, and salvation 
thence; the celebration of the LORD on account of his advent is described in these 
words, they have seen your goings, O GOD, the goings of my GOD, of my king in the 
sanctuary, the singers went before in the midst of dancing virgins; bless you GOD in 
the congregations, the LORD from the fountain of Israel; his innocence, from which he
operated and performed all things, is signified by little Benjamin their ruler; Divine 
Truth from Divine Good is signified by the princes of Judah their council; the 
glorification, or the uniting of the DIVINE and HUMAN [principles] by his own proper 
power, by the princes of Zebulon and the princes of Naphtali ; that hence the HUMAN 
[principle] of the LORD had Divine power; by GOD commanded your strength, put on 
strength O GOD, this you have done fur us from your temple at Jerusalem; by temple 
is there meant the DIVINE HUMAN [principle] of the LORD, and by Jerusalem the 
church; the subjugation of the hells is signified by rebuke the wild beast of the reed, 
the congregation of the mighty, amongst the calves of the people, him that treads 
down pieces of silver; that scatters the people that desires wars; the wild beast of the 
reed and the congregation of the mighty, is the scientific principle of the natural man 
perverting the truths and goods of the church; the calves of the people are the goods of
the church, the pieces of silver are the truths of the church, he has dispersed the 
people, he desires wars, signifies to pervert and reason against those things; by the 
subjugation of the hells is meant the subjugation of the natural man, for in that man 
are evils from hell, which are the delights of the love of self and of the world, and the 
scientifics confirming them; which delights, when they are regarded as an end and 
have dominion, are against the goods and truths of the church; that the natural man, 
when he is subjugated, ministers suitable scientifics and the knowledges of truth and 
of good, is signified by the fat shall come out of Egypt, Ethiopia shall stretch out her 
hands to God, Egypt is the natural man as to scientifics, and Ethiopia is the natural 
man as to the knowledges of good and of truth. AE 439.

Verse 30. Rebuke the wild beast of the reed, the multitude of the mighty, amongst the 
calves of the people, him that treads down pieces of silver, that scatters the people, 
that desires wars. The subject here treated of is concerning the arrogance of those 
who from scientifics are willing to enter into the mysteries of faith, and not to 
acknowledge any thing but what themselves hatch thence; inasmuch as these see 
nothing from the light of heaven which is from the LORD, but from the lumen of 
nature which is from selfhood, they seize upon shadows instead of light, upon 
fallacies instead of realities, and, in general, upon what is false instead of truth; these, 
inasmuch as they think insanely because from lowest principles, are called the wild 
beast of the reed, and because they reason sharply, they are called the congregation of
the mighty, and because they dissipate the truths as yet remaining as scattered amongst
the goods of those who are in the truths of the church, it is said of them that they tread
down pieces of silver amongst the calves of the people, and further, that they disperse 
the people, that is, the church itself with its truths; the lust of assaulting and 
destroying those truths is meant by desiring wars. AC 9391.

The subject here treated of is concerning the LORD'S kingdom; that caution is 
necessary to guard against the false scientific principle, that is, against the scientific 

234

principle falsely applied by the natural man separate from the spiritual, which is 
meant by rebuke the wild beast of the reed; inasmuch as those scientifics, being 
derived from the fallacies of the senses have strong power of persuasion, they are 
called the congregation of the mighty; the calves of the people are the goods of the 
church which are in the natural man; the fragments of silver are the truths of the 
church; to tread, upon and to disperse is to destroy and dissipate, as is done by those 
who are natural and sensual, and think naturally and sensually, and not at the same 
time spiritually, thus who think from the natural and sensual man separate from the 
spiritual; this man is meant by the wild beast of the reed; to desire wars signifies 
reasonings against truths; the fat from Egypt and Ethiopia, are those who are in the 
science of spiritual things, and who are in the knowledges of truth and of good, who 
are about to come to the LORD'S kingdom, because they are in light from the spiritual 
man. AE 627.

Verse 31. Fat ones shall come out of Egypt, Ethiopia shall stretch out her hands to 
GOD, etc. By the fat ones out of Egypt are signified the gentiles or nations, who are in 
the affection of knowing truths, and by Ethiopia are signified those who imbibe them 
from the delight of the natural man; the signification of Ethiopia may appear from 
other passages in the Word where Ethiopia is mentioned, as in Gen 2:13; Eph 3:5, 9, 
10; the reception by the nations of the goods and truths of heaven and the church from
the LORD, is signified by "Sing to God, you kingdoms of the earth, sing praises to the 
LORD." AE 654.

THE TRANSLATOR'S NOTES AND OBSERVATIONS

It is impossible for a devout Christian to read the foregoing Psalm with serious 
attention, and not be forcibly struck with the conviction, that a spiritual sense is 
contained under the letter, which is necessary to impart to the letter an edifying 
meaning, or indeed any meaning at all. Let the reader then deeply ponder on the 
spiritual sense here detected by the enlightened Scribe of the New Jerusalem, and he 
will see abundant cause to be thankful, not only that the WORD OF GOD is 
distinguished by this remarkable criterion of its Divine origin, but also that it has been
reserved for the happiness of the present generation, to see a full demonstration of this
edifying and blessed truth.

235

PSALM 69

To him that presides; upon Shoshannim, a Psalm of David.

1. Save me, O GOD, for the waters are come in even to my soul.
2.

I sink in deep mire, wherein there is no standing; I am come into deep waters 
and the floods overflow me.
I am weary of my crying, my throat is dried up; mine eyes waste away, whilst 
I wait for my GOD.

3.

4. They that hate me without cause are more than the hairs of my head; they that 
would destroy me, they that are unjustly mine enemies are mighty; I must 
restore what I took not away.

5. O GOD, you know my foolishness, and my guilt is not hid from you.
6. Let not them that wait on you, O LORD, JEHOVAH OF HOSTS, be ashamed 

through me; let not them that seek you, O GOD of Israel, be disgraced through 
me,

7. Because for your sake I have borne reproach; shame has covered my face.
8.
I am become a stranger to my brethren, and an alien to my mother's sons,
9. For the zeal of your house has consumed me; and the reproaches of them that 

reproach you are fallen upon me.

10. When I weep in the fasting of my soul, it is turned to reproaches against me.
11. When I make sackcloth my garment, I become a by-word to them.
12. They who sit in the gate speak against me; and I am the song of the drunkards.
13. But as for me, let my prayer come to you, O JEHOVAH, in an acceptable time; 

O GOD, in the greatness of your mercy answer me, in the truth of your 
salvation.

14. Deliver me out of the mire, and let me not sink; let me be delivered from them 

that hate me, and out of the deep waters.

15. Let not the water-flood overflow me, neither let the deep swallow me up; nor 

let the pit shut her mouth upon me.

16. Answer me, O JEHOVAH, for your mercy is good; for the multitude of your 

compassions look upon me.

17. Hide not your face from your servant, for I am in trouble; answer me speedily.
18. Draw near to my soul, and redeem it; deliver me because of mine enemies.
19. You know my reproach, my shame and my disgrace, mine adversaries are all 

before you.

20. Reproach has broken my heart, and I am sick, and I wait for some person to 

pity but there is no one; and for comforters, but I find them not.

21. But they give me gall for my meat; and for my thirst they give me vinegar to 

drink.

22. Let their table become a snare before them; and let their reward be a trap.
23. Let their eyes be darkened, that they see not; and make their loins continually 

to shake.

24. Pour out your indignation upon them; and let the wrath of your anger overtake 

them.

25. Let their habitations be desolate; let no one dwell in their tents.
26. For they persecute him whom you have smitten; and talk of the pain of those 

whom you have wounded.

236

27. Add misery to their misery, and let them not come into your justice.
28. Let them be blotted out of the book of life; and let them not be written with the

just.

29. But I am afflicted and distressed; let your salvation, O GOD, set me up on high.
30. I will praise the name of GOD with a song, and will magnify him with 

thanksgiving.

31. And it shall please JEHOVAH better than bulls, — than horned oxen with 

divided hoofs.

32. The afflicted shall see, and be glad; O you that seek GOD! your heart shall live.
33. For JEHOVAH hears the needy, and despises not his prisoners.
34. Let heaven and earth praise him, the seas, and every thing that creeps therein.
35. For GOD will save Zion, and will build the cities of Judah; and they shall dwell

therein, and shall inherit it.

36. And the seed of his servants shall inherit it; and they that love his name shall 

dwell therein.

The Internal Sense

The LORD'S temptation-combats even to despair, verses 1 to 4; inasmuch that he 
thought to recede, verse 5; but that he supported them for the sake of those who 
expected salvation, verses 6, 7; that he will be treated ignominiously by those among 
whom the church is, verses 8 to 12; a prayer to the FATHER to succour him lest they 
prevail, verses 13 to 20; when he desired the good and truth of the church, that they 
gave him what was false and evil, as upon the cross, gall and vinegar, verse 21; that 
therefore they will be destroyed, verses 22 to 28; when he is delivered, that the gospel 
will be preached, verses 29 to 31; because then they of the church will be saved, who 
will worship him, verses 32 to 36,

EXPOSITION

Verse 1. Save me, O GOD, for the waters are come in even to my soul. Waters here 
denote falsities, and the temptations which are effected by injected falsities. AC 9050.

Verses 1, 2, 14, 15. The waters came even to my soul; I sunk in the mire of the depth 
where there was no standing, I came into the depths of the waters, and the wave 
overwhelmed me: deliver me from the mire and let me not sink, deliver me from them 
hate me, and out of the deep waters; let not the water-flood overwhelm me, neither let
the pit shut its mouth upon me. In this passage are described the temptations of the 
LORD, when he was in the world, by which he subjugated the hells, and glorified his 
humanity: by waves and billows are signified evils and falsities, and by abysses and 
depths of the sea, likewise by the pit, are signified the hells where and whence they 
are; for as was said above, temptations are, as it were, immersions into the hells, and 
obsessions by evils and falsities: things are signified by the lamentations in David in 
many places, and also in the prophets; for in the spiritual sense of the Word, the 
temptations of the LORD are much treated of, by which he subjugated the hells, and 
disposed all things to order in the heavens and in the hells, and by which he glorified 
his Human [principle]; they are especially understood by the things predicted in the 
prophets and in the Psalms, concerning the LORD, and by the things fulfilled by him, 
as mentioned in Luke 24:44. AE 538.

Verse 13. My prayer is to you, O JEHOVAH, in an acceptable time: O GOD, for the 
greatness of your mercy answer me, in the truth of your salvation. The acceptable 
time of JEHOVAH signifies acceptance from love; time signifies existing state when it is
said of men, but perpetually existing when of JEHOVAH, thus of his love, for this is 
perpetual; hearing and assistance from love by the divine proceeding principle, which 
is divine truth, is signified by for the greatness of your mercy answer me, in the truth 
of your salvation. AE 295.

Verses 14, 15. Deliver me out of the mire and let me not sink; let me be delivered from
them that hate me, and out of the deep waters; let not the water-flood overflow me, 
neither let the deep swallow me up, nor let the pit shut her mouth upon me. That a pit 
signifies hell, where and whence are false principles, is here very evident, for it is 
said, let not the pit shut her mouth upon me, that is, let not hell, which is the source of 
false principles, or let not false principles take entire possession of me, that I cannot 
escape; by being delivered from mire that I sink not, is signified from the evils of what
is false, lest I perish; let me be delivered from them that hate me, and the depths of 
waters, signifies to be delivered from evils and falsities, which are from the hells; 
they that hate me, are the evils thence; and the depths of waters are the falsities 
thence; lest the deep swallow me up, signifiess lest hell swallow me up, where are the 
falsities of evils. AE 537.

Verse 17. Hide not your faces from your servant, for I am in trouble; answer me 
speedily. From what has been above explained, it may be known what is. by the face 
of JEHOVAH, or the LORD, namely the divine love, and all good in heaven and the 
church thence derived; hence also it may be known what is signified by hiding or 
concealing the faces, when JEHOVAH, or the LORD, is spoken of, namely that it means 
to leave man in his selfhood, and thence in the evils and falsities which emerge from 
the selfhood; for man, viewed in himself, is nothing but what is evil and the false 
thence derived; and is withheld from these principles by the LORD that he may be in 
good, which is effected by an elevation from the selfhood; hence it may be manifest 
that by hiding or concealing the faces, when it relates to the LORD, is signified to 
leave man in evils and falsities. AE 412.

Verses 21, 22, 23. They give me also gall for my meal, and in my thirst they give, me 
vinegar to drink: let their table become a snare before them, and let their reward be a 
trap: let their eyes be darkened that they see not; and make their loins continually to 
shake. All and singular the things, which are related in the Evangelists concerning the 
LORD'S passion, in the spiritual sense, signify the state of the church at that time in 
respect to the LORD and to the Word; for the, LORD was the Word, because divine 
truth; and the Jews, as they treated the Word or divine truth, so they treated the LORD, 
on which subject see above, AE 64, 195; that they gave to the LORD vinegar mixed 
with gall, which is also called wine mingled with myrrh, signified the quality of 
divine truth from the Word, such as it was with the Jewish nation, namely mixed with 
the false principle of evil, and thus altogether falsified and adulterated, wherefore he 
was unwilling to drink it; but that afterwards they gave the LORD vinegar in a sponge, 
and set it on hyssop, signified the false principle such as prevailed among the well-
disposed Gentiles, which was false from the ignorance of truth, in which false 
principle there was good, and a principle of utility; which false principle the LORD 
drank, because it was accepted by him; by the hyssop, on which it was set, is signified
its purification; by the LORD saying, I thirst, is signified divine spiritual thirst, which 

238

is that of divine truth and good in the church, whence comes the salvation of the 
human race. AE 519.

Verse 28. Let them be blotted out of the book of lives, and not be written with the just. 
By the book of lives is signified heaven, and the reason is because man, who is in love
and faith to the LORD, is heaven in the least effigy, which corresponds to heaven in the
largest effigy; wherefore, he who has heaven in himself, comes also into heaven, for it
is accommodated to him; hence it is that the book of lives is that principle belonging 
to man which corresponds to heaven belonging to him; and since this remains with 
him for ever, if he become spiritual by the knowledge of truth and good applied to life
in the world, therefore it is said, "I will not blot his name out of that book." AE 199.

The reason why writing upon any one denotes to implant on the life is because 
writing is to impress on paper from the memory, thought, and mind, what is to remain 
fixed; wherefore, in the spiritual sense, it signifies what is to remain fixed in the life 
of man, inscribed and implanted in him, thus the natural sense of that expression is 
turned into the spiritual sense, for it is natural to write on paper and in a book, but it is
spiritual to inscribe on the life. AE 222.

Verse 30. I will praise the name of GOD with a song; I will magnify him with 
thanksgiving. Inasmuch as joy of heart is from celestial love, and from spiritual love, 
therefore mention is made of praising the name of GOD with a song, and of 
magnifying him with thanksgiving. AE 326.

Verse 33. For JEHOVAH hears the needy, and despises not his prisoners. By the poor 
and needy are here signified those who are in the defect of truth and good, and yet are 
in the desire of those blessings; of this it is said, that JEHOVAH hears them, and 
despises not his prisoners. AE 238.

Verse 34. Let the seas, and every thing that creeps therein praise him. The affections 
of man are signified in the Word by clean beasts, as was observed; but inasmuch as 
they are not perceived except in his pleasures so that man calls them pleasures, 
therefore they are here named creeping things. Pleasures are of two kinds, such as 
relate to things of the will, and to things of the understanding; in general there are 
pleasures arising from the possession of land and of money; there are pleasures 
arising from honours and offices in the state; there are pleasures of conjugial love, and
of love towards infants and children; there are the pleasures of friendship and of social
exchange; there are the pleasures of reading, of writing, of attaining knowledge and 
wisdom, not to mention several others of a like sort; there are the pleasures of the 
senses; as, that of hearing, in general, is the pleasure arising from the sweetness of 
music and singing; that of seeing, in general, is the pleasure arising from different 
beauties, which are manifold; that of smelling is the pleasure arising from the 
sweetness of odours; that of taste is the pleasure arising from the agreeableness and 
usefulness of meats and drinks; that of touch is a pleasure resulting from many 
pleasantnesses. These kinds of pleasures, inasmuch as they are made sensible in the 
body, are called bodily pleasures; howbeit there is not any pleasure which exists in the
body, but what has its existence and subsistence from some interior affection; and 
there is not any interior affection but what exists and subsists from an affection still 
more interior, in which is its use and end. Man during his life in the body, is not 
sensible of these interior things which have an orderly connection with, and derivation

239

from, what is inmost, and several scarce know that such things exist, much less that 
all pleasures are derived thence; nevertheless, as it is impossible that any thing should 
exist in things external, unless it has an orderly connection with, and derivation from, 
things interior, therefore pleasures also must needs be the ultimate effects of 
somewhat prior or interior. 

Interior things are not discovered, so long as men live in the body, except by those 
who are given to inward reflection; they first manifest themselves in another life, and 
that in the order in which they are elevated towards heaven by the LORD: the interior 
affections with their delights manifest themselves in the world of spirits; such as are 
more interior manifest themselves with their pleasantnesses in the heaven of angelic 
spirits; and such as are still more interior manifest themselves with their happiness in 
the heaven of angels; for there are three heavens, one more interior, more perfect, and 
more happy than the other, see AC 459, 684. Thus these things unfold themselves in 
order and present themselves to the perception in another life; but so long as man 
lives in the body, being continually in the idea and thought of things corporeal, those 
interior things are as it were asleep, because they are immersed in corporeal things; 
nevertheless it may still appear to any one who reflects, that all pleasures have a 
quality according to the interior affections and the order thereof, and that they receive 
thence all their essence. Inasmuch as the interior affections in their orderly 
arrangement are made sensible in the extremes, or in the body, as pleasures, they are 
therefore called creeping things; but these are only corporeal things which are 
affected by things internal; as may be evident to every one from the consideration of 
sight only and its pleasures; for unless there were interior sight, or vision, it would be 
impossible for the eye by any means to see. The sight of the eye derives its existence 
from an interior sight, wherefore also man, after the life of the body, sees equally 
well, nay, much better than whilst he lived in the body, not indeed worldly and 
corporeal things, but the things which are in another life: they who were blind in the 
life of the body see in another life equally well with those who were quick-sighted; 
wherefore also, during sleep, a man sees in his dreams equally well as when he is 
awake: it has been given me to see with the internal sight the things that are in another
life, much clearer than I see the things which are here in the world. Hence it appears 
that external sight exists from interior sight, and this from a sight still more interior, 
and so forth: the case is similar with every other sense and with every pleasure. 

Pleasures in like manner are called creeping things in other parts of the Word, and a 
distinction is there made also between such creeping things as are clean, and such as 
are unclean, that is, between pleasures whose delights are alive or celestial, and 
pleasures whose delights are dead and infernal; as in Hosea: "In that day I will make a
covenant for them with the wild beast of the field, and with the birds of heaven, and 
with the creeping things of the ground," Hosea 2:18; where that the wild beast of the 
field, the birds of heaven, and the creeping thing, signify such things in man as have 
been mentioned, may appear from this consideration, that the subject treated of is 
concerning a new church. So in David: "Let the heavens and earth praise JEHOVAH, 
the seas and all that creeps therein," Psalm 69:35: the seas and the things that creep 
therein cannot praise JEHOVAH, but he may be praised by those things in man which 
are signified thereby, and which are alive, consequently which proceed from the living
things that are in them. So again; "Praise JEHOVAH, you wild beast, and every beast, 
creeping thing, and birds of wing," Psalm 148:10; where the creeping thing has a like 
signification: that by creeping things nothing else is here understood but the good 

240

affections from which pleasures are derived, appears also from this consideration, that
creeping things with the Jews were unclean, as will be seen by what follows. Again: 
"O JEHOVAH, the earth is full of your possessions; so is the great and wide sea also, 
wherein are creeping things innumerable; all things look to you, that you may give 
them their meat in its season; you give them, they gather it; you open your hand, they 
are satisfied with good," Psalm 104:24, 25, 27, 28; where, in an internal sense, by seas
are signified things spiritual; by creeping things whatever has life thence; enjoyment 
is described by giving them meat in its season, and satisfying them with good. So in 
Ezekiel: "And it shall come to pass, that every living soul which creeps wherever the 
river shall come, shall live, and there shall be fish in great abundance, because these 
waters come thither, and are healed; and everything shall live whither the river 
comes," 47:9; speaking of the waters from the New Jerusalem; waters signify things 
spiritual from a celestial origin; the living soul which creeps signifies the affections of
good and the pleasures thence derived, as well relating to the body as to things 
sensual: which things, that they live by the waters, or by things spiritual from a 
celestial origin, is very manifest. That filthy pleasures also, which take their origin 
from proprium, consequently from its defiled lusts, are likewise called creeping 
things, appears from Ezekiel: "So I went in and saw, and behold, every form of 
creeping things and abominable beasts, and all the idols of the house of Israel, 
portrayed upon the wall round about," Ezekiel 8:10; where the forms of creeping 
things signify filthy pleasures, whose interiors are lusts, and the inner things of those 
lusts are hatreds, revenges, cruelties, and adulteries; such are the creeping things, or 
the delights of pleasures, arising from self-love and the love of the world, or from 
proprium, which are their idols, because they suppose those delights to be as gods, 
and love them as such, and thereby adore them: these creeping things, as signifying 
such defiled things, in the representative church were also accounted so unclean that it
was not even lawful to touch them, and whoever only touched them was unclean, as 
appears, Levit 5:2; 11:31, 32, 33; 22:5, 6. AC 994.

Corporeal and sensual things are in themselves merely material, inanimate, and dead, 
but they are made alive by the delights which come from the interiors in their orderly 
arrangements; hence it appears that according to the quality of the life of the interiors, 
such is the delightfulness of pleasures, inasmuch as in delight there is life: the delight,
wherein there is good from the LORD, is alone a living delight, for in such case it has 
life from the essential life of good; wherefore it is here said, "Every creeping thing 
which is alive shall be to you for meat," that is, for enjoyment. Some suppose, that 
whoever wishes to be happy in another life, ought by no means to live in the pleasures
of the body, and of sensual things, but to refuse all such enjoyments; and they urge in 
favour of this notion, that corporeal and wordly things draw off and detain the mind 
from spiritual and celestial life: but they who suppose so, and in consequence thereof 
resign up themselves voluntarily to miseries, whilst they live in the world, are not 
informed as to the real truth of the case. It is by no means forbidden any one to enjoy 
the pleasures of the body and of sensual things, namely the pleasures arising from the 
possession of lands and money; the pleasures arising from honours and offices in the 
state; the pleasures of conjugial love, and of love towards infants and children; the 
pleasures of friendship and of social exchange; the pleasures of hearing or of the 
sweetnesses of singing and music; the pleasures of sight, or of beauties, which are 
manifold, as handsome clothing, well-furnished houses, beautiful gardens, and the 
like, which things are delightful by virtue of the harmony contained in them; the 
pleasures of smelling, or of the sweetness of odours; the pleasures of taste, or of the 

241

agreeableness and usefulness of meats and drinks; and the pleasures of touch. For 
these are the extreme or corporeal affections, which have their origin, as was said, 
from the interior affections: the interior affections, which are alive, all derive their 
delight from goodness and truth, and goodness and truth derive their delight from 
charity and faith, and in this case from the LORD, consequently from the very essential
life, wherefore the affections and pleasures, which have this origin, are alive; and 
whereas genuine pleasures are from such source, they are never denied to any one; 
yea, when they are derived from that source, then their delight indefinitely exceeds 
the delight which is from any other source, and which is respectively filthy and 
defiled; as for example, the pleasure of conjugial love, when it takes its origin from 
true conjugial love, infinitely exceeds the pleasure which is not from that source, nay, 
to such a degree, that they who are in true conjugial love are in the enjoyment of a 
certain heavenly delight and happiness, inasmuch as it descends out of heaven: this 
was also acknowledged by those who were of the most ancient church; the delight 
arising from adulteries, and which adulterers felt, was to them so abominable, that 
they expressed horror at the very thought of it; hence may appear what is the nature 
and quality of a delight which does not descend from the true fountain of life, or from 
the LORD. That the pleasures above mentioned are by no means denied to man, yea, so
far from being denied, that they then first become pleasures when they are derived 
from their true origin, may further appear from this consideration, that very many who
have lived in the world, in power, dignity and opulence, and who enjoyed abundantly 
all pleasures both of the body and of the things of sense, are amongst the blessed and 
happy in heaven, and with them the interior delights and happiness are now alive, 
because such delights and happiness had their source in the good things of charity and
the truths of faith towards the LORD; and, deriving pleasures from charity and faith 
towards the LORD, they regarded them all with a view to use, which was their end in 
the enjoyment of them; for it was use itself which was to them most delightful, and 
hence came the delight of their pleasures. See on this subject what is related from 
experience, AC 954. AC 995.

PSALM 70

To him that presides, a Psalm of David, to bring to remembrance.

1. O GOD, make haste to deliver me; O JEHOVAH, make haste to help me.
2. Let them be ashamed and confounded that seek after my soul; let them be 

turned backwards and put to confusion, that desire my hurt.

3. Let them be turned back as a reward of their shame, that say, aha! aha!
4. Let all those that seek you be glad and rejoice in you; and let such as love your

salvation say continually, Let GOD be magnified!

5. But I am afflicted and needy, make haste to me, O GOD; you are my help and 

my deliverer; O JEHOVAH, delay not.

The Internal Sense

A prayer to the FATHER that he would assist against the hells, verses 1 to 3, 5; that they
may have salvation who worship him, verse 4.

Exposition

Verse 1. O GOD, make haste to deliver me; O JEHOVAH, make haste to help me. By 
reason of the marriage of the LORD with the church, or, what is the same thing, the 
marriage of divine good and divine truth, in every part of the Word, the expressions, 
JEHOVAH and GOD, so frequently occur; also JEHOVAH and the HOLY ONE or ISRAEL, as 
if they were two, when, nevertheless, they are one; for by JEHOVAH is meant the LORD 
as to divine good, and by GOD and the HOLY ONE OF ISRAEL, is meant the LORD as to 
divine truth. That the expressions JEHOVAH and GOD, and JEHOVAH and the HOLY ONE 
OF ISRAEL, also occur in many parts of the Word, and yet signify one, may be seen in 
the "Doctrine respecting the LORD," SS 34, 38, 46. SS 88.

Verse 4. Let all those that seek you rejoice and be glad. By rejoicing and being glad, 
is signified to enjoy the delight of the affections of the heart and soul; the delight of 
the affection of the heart is of the will, and the delight of the affection of the soul is of 
the understanding; for, in the Word, by heart and soul are meant the will and 
understanding of man; hence it is that it is said to rejoice and be glad, although joy 
and gladness seem to be one and the same thing, but in these expressions there is a 
marriage of the will and the understanding, which is also a marriage of good and 
truth, that takes place in the whole and in every particular of the Word, as is shown in 
the "Doctrine of the New Jerusalem concerning the Sacred Scripture;" AR 80 to 90; 
this is the reason why both these expressions, to rejoice and be glad, or joy and 
gladness, frequently occur in other parts of the Word. AR 507.

Verse 5. But I am afflicted and needy, make haste to me, O GOD. By the miserable and
the poor, in the spiritual sense of the Word, are meant they who are without the 
knowledges of things true and good, for they are spiritually miserable and poor; the 
same are understood hereby in the following passages, "I am miserable and poor, O 
LORD, remember me," Psalm 40:18, 70:5. By the miserable and the poor are 

243

principally understood those who are not in the knowledges of what is good and true, 
and yet desire them, because by the rich are understood such as are possessed of the 
knowledges of things good and true. AR 209.

Divine order requires that man should prepare himself for the reception of GOD; and 
in proportion as he so prepares himself, GOD enters into him, as into his house or 
habitation; and that preparation is effected by means of knowledges concerning GOD 
and the spiritual things of the church, and a consequent intelligence and wisdom; for it
is a law of order, that in proportion as man approaches and draws near to GOD, which 
he ought to do entirely as from himself, in the same proportion GOD approaches and 
draws near to man, and joins himself to him in the centre of his soul. AR 89.

244

PSALM 71

1. With you, O JEHOVAH, do I take refuge, let me never be put to shame.
2.

In your justice deliver me, and cause me to escape; incline your ear to me, and 
save me.

3. Be you my rock of habitation, to which I may continually resort: you have 
given commandment to save me, for you are my rock and my fortress.
4. O my GOD, deliver me from the hand of the wicked, from the hand of the 

iniquitous and violent man.

5. For you are my hope; O LORD JEHOVAH, you have been my trust from my 

youth.

6. By you have I been supported from the womb; you are he that has brought me 

out of my mother's bowels; my praise is continually of you.
I am as a wonder to many, but you are my strong refuge.

7.
8. My mouth shall be filled with your praise; and with your glory all the day 

long.

9. Cast me not off in the time of old age; forsake me not when my strength fails.
10. For mine enemies speak against me, and they that lay wait for my soul take 

counsel together:

11. Saying, GOD has forsaken him; persecute and take him, for there is none to 

deliver.

12. O GOD, be not far from me, my GOD, make haste for my help.
13. Let them be ashamed, let them be consumed, that hate my soul; let them be 

covered with reproach and disgrace that seek my hurt.

14. But I will hope continually, and will yet praise you more and more.
15. My mouth shall show forth your justice, your salvation all the day; for I know 

not the numbers thereof.

16. I will go in the strength of the LORD JEHOVIH; I will make mention of your 

justice, of yours only.

17. O GOD, you have taught me from my youth; and hitherto I have declared your 

wondrous works.

18. Wherefore also, when I am old and gray-headed, O GOD, forsake me not; until 
I have showed your arm to this generation, your power to every one that is to 
come.

19. For your justice, O GOD, is very high; who has done great things; O GOD, who 

is like you?

20. You who has showed me many and grievous distresses, shall revive me again; 

you shall bring me up again from the depths of the earth.

21. You shall increase my greatness, and shall comfort me on every side.
22. I will also praise you with the psaltery, even your truth, O my GOD; to you will

I sing upon the harp, O you Holy One of Israel.

23. My lips shall sing aloud when I give praise to you; and my soul, which you 

have redeemed.

24. My tongue also shall meditate on your justice all the day; for they are 

confounded and brought to shame that seeking hurt.

245

The Internal Sense

His confidence that the FATHER will succour him, verses 1 to 4, 7, 12, 14; that he was 
his from his nativity, verses 5, 6; lest the internals should say that he was deserted by 
GOD, verses 9 to 11; that thus they recede, verse 13; that so the name of GOD will be 
preached, verses 8, 15 to 19, 22 to 24; when he is victorious, verses 20, 21.

Exposition

Verse 6. By you have I been supported from the womb; you are he that brought me out
of my mother's bowels. These things were said of the prophet Jeremiah, but still by a 
prophet in the spiritual sense is meant one who teaches truth, and in the abstract sense 
the doctrine of truth, hence by forming in the womb, and by knowing before he came 
out from the womb, is signified foresight that he may be in truths from good by 
regeneration, thus that he may receive and teach the Word. AE 710.

Verse 22. I will also praise you, with the psaltery, even your truth, O my GOD; to you 
will I sing upon the harp, O you Holy One of Israel. That by the harp is signified 
confession from spiritual truths, is manifest from the signification of a harp as 
denoting confession from such truths; the reason why this is signified by a harp is 
because a harp is a stringed instrument, and by those instruments are signified things 
spiritual, or those which are of truth, but by wind-instruments are signified things 
celestial, or those which are of good: the reason why such things are signified by 
musical instruments is from sounds, for sounds correspond to affections, even in 
heaven affections are perceived from sounds; and whereas affections are various, and 
various sounds are uttered by musical instruments, therefore the latter from 
correspondence and agreement signify the former; in general stringed instruments 
signify such things as relate to the affections of truth, and wind-instruments such as 
relate to the affections of good, or, what is the same thing, some instruments appertain
to the spiritual class, but some to the celestial class: that sounds correspond to 
affections, has been made evident to me from much experience, and also that musical 
sounds, and that the angels are affected according to sounds and their varieties. It is 
further remarkable, that discrete sounds excite the affections of truth, or that they who
are in the affections of truth are affected by them, and that continuous sounds excite 
the affections of good, or that they who are in the affections of good are affected by 
them. AE 323.

246

PSALM 72

To Solomon.

1. Give the king your judgements, O GOD, and your justice to the king's son.
2. He shall judge your people in justice, and your afflicted in judgement.
3. The mountains shall bring peace to the people, and the hills in justice.
4. He shall judge the afflicted of the people; he shall save the sons of the needy; 

but shall break in pieces the oppressor.

5. They shall fear you as long as the sun and moon shall endure; from generation 

to generation.

6. He shall come down like the rain upon the mown grass; like showers that

water the earth.
In his days shall the just flourish, and there shall be abundance of peace until 
the moon shall be no more.

8. And he shall have dominion from sea to sea, and from the river even to the 

ends of the earth.

9. The barbarians shall bow before him, and his enemies shall lick the dust.
10. The kings of Tarshish and of the isles shall bring a present, the kings of Sheba 

and of Seba shall offer a gift.

11. And all kings shall bow down before him; all nations shall serve him.
12. For he shall deliver the needy when he cries; the afflicted also and him that 

has no helper.

13. He shall spare the miserable and needy, and shall save the souls of the needy.
14. He shall redeem their soul from deceit and violence, and their blood shall be 

precious in his eyes.

15. And he shall live, and to him shall be given of the gold of Sheba, and prayer 

shall be made for him continually; and daily shall he bless him.
16. There shall be an abundance of corn on the earth; upon the top of the 

mountains his fruit shall shake like Lebanon; and they of the city shall flourish
like the grass of the earth.

17. His name shall endure for ever; his name shall flourish as long as the sun 
stands; and they shall be blessed in him; all nations shall call him blessed.
18. Blessed be JEHOVAH GOD, the GOD of Israel, who alone does wondrous things.
19. And blessed be the name of his glory for ever; and let the whole earth be filled

with his glory. Amen, and Amen.

20. The prayers of David the son of Jesse are ended.

The Internal Sense

Of the LORD'S kingdom, verses 1, 2, 4; of the happy state of those who are of his 
kingdom, verses 3, 6, 7, 15, 16; of the worship of him from love and faith from 
eternity, and then verse 5; of the greatness and extension of his dominion, verses 8 to 
12; of protection and redemption, verses 12, 13, 14; that, from eternity the DIVINE 
HUMAN [being] was acknowledged, in which is the whole of salvation, verse 17; his 
celebration, verses 18, 19.

247

EXPOSITION

Verses 1, 3, 7. Give the king your judgements, O GOD, and your justice to the king's 
son; the mountains shall bring peace to the people, and the kills injustice; they shall 
fear you as long as the sun, and the moon shall endure, from generation to 
generations; in his days shall the just flourish, and there shall be abundance of peace,
until the moon be not. By the sun is signified love, and by the moon faith; by 
mountains and hills the most ancient church; by generation of generations the 
churches after the flood, it is said, until the moon be not, because faith shall be love. 
AC 337.

Verse 3, 7. The mountains shall bring peace to the people, and the hills in justice; in 
his days shall the just flourish, and abundance of peace until the moon be not. The 
subject here treated of is concerning the LORD, his coming and his kingdom. By the 
mountains which shall bring peace to the people, is signified love to the LORD, and by
the hills which are in justice, is signified charity towards the neighbour, by reason that
they who are in love to the LORD dwell in heaven upon mountains, and they who are 
in charity towards their neighbour dwell upon hills; hence it is evident that by peace is
meant celestial joy, which is from conjunction with the LORD, by love; by justice 
flourishing in his days is signified in the days of him who is in the good of love; hence
it is said and abundance of peace, for peace is from no other source than from the 
LORD, and from his conjunction with those who are in the good of love; it is said, 
until the moon be not, by which is signified that there shall be no truth separate from 
good, but the two shall be so conjoined that they may be one, that is, that truth also 
may be good, for all truth is of good because from good, and hence in its essence is 
good, such is the truth belonging to those who are in the good of love to the LORD 
from the LORD, who are here meant by the just. AE 365.

Verse 8. And he shall have dominion from sea to sea, and from the river even to the 
ends of the earth. This is said of the LORD, and by his dominion from sea to sea is 
signified the extension of natural things, and by dominion from the river even to the 
ends of the earth, is signified the extension of things rational and spiritual. AE 569.

Verse 9. The barbarians shall bow before him, and his enemies shall lick the dust. 
Barbarians and enemies denote those who look only at corporeal and earthly things. 
AC 249.

Verse 10. The kings of Tarshish and of the isles shall bring a present, the kings of 
Sheba and of Seba shall offer a gift. These words relate to the LORD, and by bringing 
presents and gifts is meant to worship, and by the kings of Tarshish and of the Isles 
are meant interior and exterior truths of the natural man, by the kings of Tarshish his 
interior truths, and by the Isles his exterior truths; by the kings of Sheba and of Seba 
are meant interior and exterior goods of the natural man, by Sheba his interior goods, 
and by Seba his exterior goods; by the truths of the natural man are meant the 
knowledges of truth, and by the goods of the natural man are meant the knowledges of
good; that these are meant by Sheba and Seba, see AC 1171, 3240. AE 406. See also 
AC 1171, 9293.

248

Verses 11, 15. All kings shall fall before him, all nations shall serve him; he shall save
the souls of the needy, and he shall live, and to him shall be given of the gold of 
Sheba. These words have relation to the LORD'S advent; by the kings who shall fall 
down before him, and by the nations which shall serve him, are meant all who are in 
truths from good; by the needy whom he shall save, are meant those who are not in the
knowledges of truth and of good, but still desire them; by the gold of Sheba of which 
he shall give to them, is meant the good of love into which the LORD will guide them 
by knowledges. AE 242.

Verses 14, 15. He shall redeem their soul from deceit and violence, and precious shall
their blood be in his eyes; and he shall live, and to him shall be given of the gold of 
Sheba, and shall pray for him continually, and daily shall he bless him. The subject 
here treated of is concerning the needy, by whom are signified those who desire truths 
from spiritual affection; of these it is said, that he will redeem their soul from deceit 
and violence, by which is signified deliverance from evils and falsities which destroy 
the goods of love and the truths of faith; the reception of Divine Truth by them is 
signified by their blood being precious in his eyes; their reformation is described by 
he shall live, and shall give to him of the gold of Sheba, and shall pray for him 
continually, and daily shall he bless him; the gold of Sheba is the good of charity; to 
pray for him continually signifies that they will be continually withheld from falsities,
and preserved in truths; and daily shall he bless him, signifies that they shall be kept, 
continually in the good of charity and of faith, for this is the Divine blessing, and this 
is to pray for him continually. AE 328.

By blessing is signified the LORD, and when he is called blessing, it signifies that from
him are all celestial and spiritual things, which alone are good, and whereas they 
alone are good, they also are alone true; wherefore in proportion as natural, worldly, 
and corporeal things partake of celestial and spiritual goods, in the same proportion 
the former are goods, and so far they are blessed. AC 1420.

PSALM 73

A Psalm of Asaph.

1. Truly GOD is good to Israel,—to the pure in heart.
2. But as for me, my feet were almost gone, my steps had all but slipped;
3. When I was envious against the proud, and saw the peace of the wicked.
4. For there are no bands until death, but their strength is firm.
5. They are not in trouble as other men, neither are they plagued like other men.
6. Therefore pride encompass them as a chain; violence covers them as an 

ornament.

7. Their eyes stand out with fatness; the imaginations of their heart exceed all 

bounds.

8. They scoff and speak evil; they speak proudly of oppression.
9. They set their mouth against the heavens, and their tongue wanders through 

the earth.

10. Therefore his people is turned here, and waters of a full cup are wrung out to 

them.

11. Whence they say, how does GOD know, or is there knowledge in the MOST 

HIGH?

12. Behold, these are the ungodly; and being prosperous in the world they 

multiply riches.

13. Truly then I have cleansed my heart in vain, and washed my hands in 

innocence.

14. For all the day long have I been plagued, and chastened every morning.
15. If I should say, I will speak as they, behold, I should act treacherously against 

the generation of your sons.

16. Therefore I thought to know this, but it was painful in mine eyes.
17. Until I went into the sanctuary of GOD, understood I their end.
18. Surely, you do set them in slippery places; you do cast them down into 

destruction.

19. How are they brought suddenly into desolation! They are utterly consumed 

with terrors.

20. As a dream when one awakes, O LORD, when you arisest you will despise their

shadowy image.

21. For my heart was embittered, and I was pricked in my reins.
22. But I was foolish and ignorant; I was as a beast before you.
23. But I am always with you; you hold me by my right hand.
24. You guide me in your counsel, and afterwards receive me in glory.
25. Whom have I in the heavens but you? And there is none on earth that I desire 

besides you.

26. My flesh and my heart are consumed; GOD is the rock of my heart and my 

portion for ever.

27. For lo! they that are far from you shall perish; you will destroy all them that go

a whoring from you.

28. But it is good for me to draw near to GOD; I put my trust in the LORD JEHOVIH, 

to declare all your works.

250

The Internal Sense

It is wonderful to some that the wicked glory and prosper, verses 1 to 9; that the good 
thereby are seduced, thinking that goodness is of no avail, nor affliction, verses 10 to 
14; but afterwards it is given them to know that the wicked are nevertheless vastated 
and consumed, verses 15 to 20, 27; that this they know not, verses 21, 22; but that the 
good are always supported and live with God, verses 23 to 26, 28.

EXPOSITION

Verses 13, 14. Truly I have cleansed my heart in vain, and washed my hands in 
innocence; for all the day long have I been plagued and chastened every morning. To 
wash the hands in innocence is to testify that the person is innocent and pure from 
evils and falsities; for washing the hands was also a testification of innocence, as may 
be manifest from this consideration, that Pilate washed his hands and said, I am 
innocent of the blood of this just one. Matt 27:24. AE 475.

To render the heart pure is to be purified interiorly; and to wash the hands in 
innocence is exteriorly. AC 10296.

Verse 21. My heart was embittered, and I was pricked in my reins; but I was foolish 
and ignorant. By these words is described the infestation of good by evil, and of what 
is true by what is false. AE 167.

Verses 22, 23, 24. I was foolish and ignorant, but I am always with you; you hold me 
by my right hand; you guide me by your counsel, and afterwards receive me in glory. 
Since by the right hand, when spoken of man, is signified the wisdom which is from 
the divine truth, therefore it is said, I am foolish and ignorant, you guide me by your 
counsel, and afterwards receive me in glory; to guide in counsel is by divine truth; 
and to receive in glory is to bless with intelligence; for glory, when spoken of the 
LORD, signifies divine truth and divine wisdom; but when of man, it signifies the 
intelligence thence derived. AE 298.

Verse 26. My flesh. For the signification of flesh, see Psalm 16:9, Exposition.

Verse 27. You will destroy all them that go a whoring from you. That to commit 
whoredom, in the spiritual sense, signifies to imbue falsities, as also to falsify truths, 
appears from several passages in the Word; the like was signified by the whoredoms 
of the sons of Israel with the daughters of Moab; for all the historicals in the Word 
involve and signify spiritual things, as may appear from the explication of Genesis 
and Exodus, which are called ARCANA COELESTIA; and inasmuch as the sons of Israel 
eating of things sacrificed to idols, and their whoredoms with the daughters of Moab, 
involved also such things; for what they signify, they also involve; therefore it was 
commanded that the heads of the people should be hung up to JEHOVAH before the 
sun, and therefore Phineas the son of Eleazer thrust through a man of Israel and a 
Midianitish woman in a brothel, on account of which he was also blessed; and 
therefore also there were slain of Israel twenty and four thousand, as may be seen, 
Numb 25:1 to the end: such punishments and such plagues could by no means have 
been commanded solely on account of their eating of the idolatrous sacrifices, and 

251

committing whoredom with the women of another nation, unless they had involved 
wicked outrages against heaven and the church, which do not appear in the literal 
sense of the Word, but only in its spiritual sense; those wicked outrages which were 
involved, were, that they profaned at the same time the goods and truths of the church,
which, as has been said above, was the appropriation of evil and the false. 

That adulteries and whoredoms involve such things, appears from very many passages
in the Word, where they are related; from which it is manifest, that by them are 
signified the adulterations of good, and the falsifications of truth, as in Ezekiel: 
"Jerusalem, you have confided in your beauty, and have played the harlot because of 
your fame, so that you have poured out your whoredoms upon all that passed by. You 
have committed whoredom with the sons of Egypt, your neighbours, great in flesh, 
and have multiplied your whoredom: you have committed whoredom with the sons of 
Ashur, when there was no satiety to you, with whom you committed whoredom: you 
have multiplied your whoredom even to Chaldea, the land of merchandize: an 
adulterous woman has received strangers under her own husband. All others give 
reward to their harlots, but you have given rewards to all your lovers, and have 
rewarded them, that they may come to you on every side in your whoredoms. 
Wherefore, O harlot! hear the word of JEHOVAH," Ezekiel 16:15, 26, 28, 29, 32, 33, 
35, and following verses. Who cannot see, that by whoredoms here mentioned are not 
understood whoredoms in a common natural sense? 

For the church is here treated of, in which all the truths of the Word are falsified; these
things are what are understood by whoredoms, for whoredoms in a spiritual sense, or 
spiritual whoredoms, are no other than falsifications of truth: Jerusalem, in the above 
passage, is the church; the sons of Egypt, with whom she committed whoredom, are 
scientifics and knowledges of every kind, applied in a sinister manner to confirm 
falsities; the sons of Ashur, are fallacious reasonings thence derived; Chaldea, the land
of merchandize, is the profanation of truth; the rewards which she gave to her lovers, 
are the vendings of falsities; and from the adulteration of good by the falsification of 
truth, that church is called a woman adulterous under her own husband: again, "Two 
women, the daughters of one mother, have committed whoredom in Egypt; in their 
youth they committed whoredom; one committed whoredom under me, and chose for 
lovers the Assyrians her neighbours; she gave her whoredoms upon them, 
nevertheless she has not deserted her whoredoms in Egypt. The other has corrupted 
her love more than she, and her whoredoms above the whoredoms of her sister: she 
added to her whoredoms; she loved the Chaldeans; the sons of Babel came to her to 
the connection of loves, and polluted her by their whoredoms," Ez 23:2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 11, 
14, 16, 17, and following verses. That by whoredoms are likewise here understood 
spiritual whoredoms, is evident from singular the things which are mentioned; two 
women, the daughters of one mother, are two churches, the Israelitish and the Jewish; 
their whoredoms with the Egyptians, the Assyrians, and Chaldeans, signify similar 
things to what were explained above; the connection of loves with the sons of Babel, 
is the profanation of good. Again, in Jeremiah, "You have committed whoredom with 
many companions, you have profaned the land with your whoredoms, and your 
wickedness: have you seen what averted Israel has done? she has gone away upon 
every high mountain, and under every green tree, and there have you committed 
whoredom: perfidious Judah also has gone away, and committed whoredoms, so that 
by the voice of her whoredom she has profaned the land; she has committed adultery 
with stone and with wood," Jer 3:2, 6, 8, 9; Israel is the church which is in truth, 

252

Judah is the church which is in good, for they represented these two churches; the 
falsifications of truth are signified by the whoredoms of Israel, and the adulterations 
of good by the whoredoms of Judah; to go away into every high mountain, and under 
every green tree, and commit whoredom, is to enquire into all the knowledges of good
and truth, even from the Word, and to falsify them; to commit adultery with stone and 
wood, is to pervert and profane all truth and good: stone signifies truth, and wood 
signifies good. Again, "Run you to and fro through the streets of Jerusalem, and seek 
in the broad ways thereof, if you can find a man [vir], if there be any that does 
judgement that seeks the truth: when I fed them to the full they committed whoredom,
and came by troops to the house of the harlot," Jer 5:1, 7; to run to and fro through the
streets, and to seek in the broad ways of Jerusalem, is to see and explore in the 
doctrinals of that church; for Jerusalem is the church, and streets and broad ways are 
doctrinals; if you can find a man, if there be any that does judgement, that seeks the 
truth, denotes whether there be any truth in the church; when I fed them to the full, 
they committed whoredom, denotes, that when truths were revealed to them, they 
falsified them; such a church as to doctrine is the house of a harlot, into which they 
come by troops. Again, "Yours adulteries, your neighings, the lewdness of your 
whoredom, your abominations upon the hills in the field, have I seen: Woe to you, O 
Jerusalem! you will not be made clean," Jer 13:27: neighings denote profanations of 
truth, because a horse signifies the intellectual [principle] whore truth is; the hills in 
the field are the goods of truth in the church, which are perverted. Again, "In the 
prophets of Jerusalem I have seen an horrible obstinacy, in adulterating, and going in 
a lie," Jer 23:14. Again, "They have done foolishness in Israel, and have committed 
adultery with the wives of their companions, and have spoken my Word in my name 
as liars," Jer 29:23; to adulterate and to commit adultery, here manifestly denote to 
pervert truths; the prophets signify those who teach truths from the Word; for it is 
said, in adulterating, and going in a lie, and they have spoken my Word as liars: a lie 
in the Word signifies the false. Again in Moses, "Your sons were feeding in the desert 
forty years; and they carried about their whoredoms even till their bodies were 
consumed in the desert," Numb 14:33: that the sons of Israel were not consumed in 
the desert because they carried about their whoredoms, but because they rejected 
celestial truths, appears from this circumstance, that this was said to them because 
they were not willing to enter into the land of Canaan is signified heaven and the 
church, with its truths; and by Egypt are signified those things falsified, and turned 
into magic. 

Again, in Micah, "All the graven images thereof shall be beaten to pieces, and all the 
rewards of whoredom shall be burnt in the fire; and all the idols thereof will I lay 
waste, for she has gathered them from the hire of the harlot, therefore to the hire of 
the harlot they shall return," Micah 1:7: graven images and idols signify falsities, 
which are from man's own intelligence; the hire of a harlot, denotes the knowledges of
truth and good, which they applied to falsities and evils, and thus perverted. And in 
Hosea, "JEHOVAH spoke to the prophet, take to you a woman of whoredoms and 
children of whoredoms, because the land has committed great whoredom in departing 
from JEHOVAH," Hos 1:2; hereby was represented what was the quality of the church, 
namely, that it was wholly in falsities. Again, "They have sinned against me, their 
glory will I turn into shame; they committed whoredom, because they have quite 
forsaken JEHOVAH, whoredom, wine, and new wine, occupied the heart: your 
daughters commit whoredoms, and your daughters in law commit adultery," Hos 4:7, 
10, 11. Whoredom, wine, and new wine are falsified truths. Whoredom is the 

253

falsification itself, wine is the interior false principle, new wine is the exterior false 
principle; the daughters who commit whoredom are goods of truth perverted; the 
daughters in law who commit adultery are evils conjoined with falsities thence 
derived. Again in Isaiah, "It shall come to pass at the end of seventy years JEHOVAH 
shall visit Tyre, and she shall return to her meretricious hire; she shall commit 
whoredom with all the kings of the earth upon the faces of the world; at length her 
merchandise shall be holy to JEHOVAH," Is 23:17, 18. Tyre in the Word is the church as
to knowledges of truth and good; the meretricious hire denotes the same knowledges 
applied to evils and falsities by perversion; her merchandize is the selling thereof; to 
commit whoredom with all the kings of the earth, denotes with all and singular the 
truths of the church; the reason why it is said, that her merchandize and the 
meretricious hire shall at length be holy to JEHOVAH, is because thereby are signified 
knowledges of truth and good by them applied to falsities and evils, and man, by the 
knowledges themselves, viewed in their true nature and quality, may become wise, for
knowledges are the means of being wise, and they are also the means of becoming 
insane, when they are falsified by applications to evils and falsities; similar is what is 
signified where it is said that they should make to themselves friends of the unjust 
mammon, Luke 16:9; and by its being commanded that the sons of Israel should 
borrow from the Egyptians gold, silver and clothing, and take them away with them, 
Exod 3:22; 12:35, 36; for by the Egyptians are signified scientifics of every kind, 
which they applied to falsify truths. AE 141.

The Translator's Notes and Observations

Verse 5. They are not in trouble as a man; neither are they plagued like a man. It may 
be proper to inform the reader, that the two terms here rendered man, are expressed in 
the original Hebrew by distinct terms, the one having more respect to the voluntary 
faculty, and the other to the intellectual faculty; thus, that trouble has reference to the 
former, and plague to the latter.

254

PSALM 74

An instructive Psalm of Asaph.

1. Why, O GOD, have you cast us off for ever? Why does your anger smoke 

against the sheep of your pasture?

2. Remember your congregation which you did purchase of old; which you did 
redeem as the tribe of your inheritance; mount Zion, in which you did dwell.
3. Lift up your steps to the perpetual desolations; the enemy has destroyed every 

thing in the sanctuary.

4. Yours adversaries roar in the midst of your solemn assemblies; they set up 

their ensigns for signs.

5. The enemy appears as one raising up axes against the thick forest.
6. For now they break down at once its carved work with axes and hammers.
7. They have cast fire into your sanctuary; they have defiled the dwelling-place 

of your name, by casting it down to the earth.

8. They have said in their heart, Let us oppress them together; they have burnt up

all GOD'S places of assembly in the earth.

9. We see not our signs, there is no more any prophet; neither is there among us 

any that knows how long.

10. How long, O GOD, shall the adversary reproach? shall the enemy despise your 

name for ever?

11. Why withdrawest you your hand,—your right hand? pluck it out of your 

bosom.

12. For GOD is my King of old, working salvations in the midst of the earth.
13. You did divide the sea by your strength; you did break the heads of the whales 

in the waters;

14. You did break in pieces the heads of Leviathan; you did give him to be meat to

the ravenous birds of the wilderness;

15. You did divide the fountain and the river; you did dry up mighty rivers.
16. The day is yours, the night also is yours; you have prepared the light of the 

sun;

17. You have set all the borders of the earth; you have made summer and winter.
18. Remember this, the enemy has reproached JEHOVAH, and the foolish people 

has despised your name.

19. Give not the soul of your turtle dove to the beast; forget not the life of your 

afflicted for ever.

20. Have respect to the covenant, for the dark places of the earth are full of the 

habitations of cruelty.

21. O let not the oppressed return ashamed; let the afflicted and needy praise your 

name.

22. Arise, O GOD, plead your own cause; remember how the foolish one 

reproaches you daily.

23. Forget not the voice of your enemies; the tumult of those that rise up against 

you ascends continually.

255

The Internal Sense

That the church, and all things belonging thereto, is entirely destroyed, and its holy 
things profaned, saying in their hearts that religion is nothing, verses 1 to 9; a prayer 
to the LORD that he would bring assistance, verses 2, 10, 11; that he had subdued the 
internals before, verses 12 to 15; and established the church, verses 16, 17; that he 
would therefore have mercy lest the church perish, verses 18 to 21; by the insurrection
of the wicked, verses 22, 23.

Exposition

Verses 3, 4. The enemy has destroyed every thing in the sanctuary, your adversaries 
roar in the midst of your solemn assemblies. Enemy signifies evil from hell, sanctuary
the church, solemn assemblies worship, hence it is manifest what those words signify. 
AE 601.

Verses 3, 4, 9. The enemy has destroyed every thing in the sanctuary, your adversaries
roar in the midst of your solemn assemblies; they set up their ensigns for signs; we 
see not our signs, there is no more any prophet. The enemy has destroyed every thing 
in the sanctuary, signifies that evil has destroyed the holy things of the church; your 
adversaries roar in the midst of your solemn assemblies, signifies that falsities have 
destroyed all things of worship; they have set up their ensigns for signs, signifies that, 
they have testified and persuaded by all things; we see not our signs, signifies that no 
testifications of truth are accepted in the church; no more any prophet, signifies that 
there is no longer any doctrine of truth. AE 706.

Verses 13, 14, 15. You did divide the sea by your strength, you did break the heads of 
the whales in the waters; you did break in pieces the heads of Leviathan; you did give
him to be meat to the ravenous birds of the wilderness; you did divide the fountain 
and the river, you did dry up mighty rivers. In this passage by fountains and rivers are 
signified the falsities of doctrine which are derived from self-intelligence; mighty 
rivers are the principles of what is false thence confirmed; by whales and the 
Leviathan are signified the scientifics which are of the sensual and natural man, from 
which are derived every false principle, when the spiritual man is closed above them; 
in the sensual and natural man the selfhood [proprium] of man resides, wherefore 
what is concluded from them alone is concluded from the selfhood [or proprium] or 
from self-intelligence; for what is divine flows-in through the spiritual man into the 
natural, but not into the natural when the spiritual is closed above it; but the spiritual 
man is opened by truths and by a life according to them; the ravenous birds of the 
wilderness to which Leviathan is given for meat signifies those who are in infernal 
falsities. AE 483.

Verse 15. You did dry up mighty rivers. To dry up mighty rivers denotes to dissipate 
the more potent falsities. AC 8185.

The subject here treated of in the internal sense is concerning sciences destroying the 
truths of faith; the whales whose heads shall be broken, are scientifics in general; in 
like manner Leviathan; the ravenous birds to which, he was to be given for food, are 
they who are in falsities, or falsities themselves; hence it is evident what the sea is, 

256

namely that it is the scientific principle misapplied to weaken and destroy truths. AC 
9755.

Verses 16, 17. The day is yours, the night also is yours; you have prepared the light of
the sun; you have set all the borders of the earth; you have made summer and winter. 
That a regenerate person has his vicissitudes, namely that at times he has no charity, 
and at times he has some charity, may be sufficiently manifest from this consideration,
that with every one, even a regenerate person, there is nothing but evil, and that all 
good is of the LORD alone; inasmuch as there appertains to him nothing but evil, he 
must of necessity undergo vicissitudes, and at one time be as it were in summer, that 
is, in charity, but at another time in winter, that is, in no charity; such are the 
vicissitudes, that man may be more and more perfected, and thus that he may be 
rendered more and more happy. Such vicissitudes not only appertain to a regenerate 
man, whilst he lives in the body, but also when he comes into the other life, for 
without vicissitudes as it were of summer and winter, as to things voluntary, and as it 
were of day and night as to things intellectual, he is never perfected and rendered 
more happy: but their vicissitudes in the other life are like the vicissitudes of summer 
and winter in the temperate zones, and like the vicissitudes of day and night in the 
time of spring. AC 935.

Verses 18, 19. The enemy has reproached JEHOVAH, and the foolish people has 
despised your name; give not the soul of your turtle-dove to the beast: forget not the 
life of your afflicted for ever. By the enemy who reproaches JEHOVAH, is signified hell 
and the evil thence; by the foolish people who despise his name, are signified the 
falsities which are contrary to the truths of doctrine; they are called people who are in 
truths, and in the opposite sense who are in falsities, who are a foolish people, and the 
name of JEHOVAH signifies every truth of doctrine and of the church; give not the soul
of your turtledove to the beast, signifies that spiritual good should not be given to 
those who are in the lusts of evil; by the life of the poor is signified spiritual life 
oppressed by evils and falsities. AE 630, 388.

Verse 21. Let the afflicted and needy praise your name. The reason why the two 
expressions, afflicted and needy, are so frequently conjoined in the Sacred Scriptures 
is because it is according to the style of the WORD, that where mention is made of 
truth, mention should also be made of good, and in the opposite sense, where mention 
is made of what is false, mention should also be made of what is evil, because they 
make one and as it were constitute a marriage, wherefore mention is made of the poor
and at the same time of the needy, for by the poor are meant those who are in a defect 
of the knowledges of good: that such a marriage has place in the prophetical parts of 
the Word almost throughout, may be seen in the Arcana Coelestia, n. 683, 793, 801, 
2516, 2712, 3004, 3005. AE 238.

257

PSALM 75

To him that presides; Al-taschith, a Psalm, a song of Asaph.

1. Unto you, O GOD, do we give thanks, to you do we give thanks; for that your 

name is near, your wondrous works declare.

2. When I hold the solemn assembly, I will judge uprightly.
3. When the earth and all its inhabitants are dissolved, I will bear up the pillars 

thereof.
I said to the proud, boast not; and to the wicked, lift not up the horn.

5. Lift not up your horn on high, speak not with a stiff neck.
6. For neither from the east, nor from the west, nor from the wilderness comes 

exaltation.

7. Truly GOD is judge, he puts down one, and raises up another.
8. For in the hand of JEHOVAH is a cup, and the wine is red, it is full of mixture; 
and he pours it out, but the dregs thereof all the wicked of the earth shall suck 
up and drink.

9. But I will declare for ever; I will sing to the GOD of Jacob.
10. All the horns of the wicked will I cut off; but the horns of the just shall be 

exalted.

The Internal Sense

That when the LORD comes, he will raise up the lapsed church, verses 1 to 3; the 
wicked are not to exalt themselves against the good, verses 4 to 6; because the 
judgement is at hand, whereby they will perish, and the good will he saved, verse 7; 
that the wicked will then perish by dire falsities, verses 8, 10; but the good will 
worship the LORD, verse 9.

EXPOSITION

Verses 2, 3. When I shall hold the solemn assemblies I will judge uprightly; when the 
earth and all its inhabitants are dissolved, I will bear up the pillars of it. The earth 
here denotes the church, which is said to be dissolved, when it is in want of truths 
which are productive of good; since truths support the church, they are called its 
pillars, which GOD will strengthen: inasmuch as the restoration of the church is here 
described, it is therefore said, when I shall hold the solemn assemblies I will judge 
uprightly. AE 304.

Verses 4, 5, 10. I said to the proud, boast not; and to the wicked, lift not up the horn: 
all the horns of the wicked will I cut off, the horns of the just shall be exalted. By 
horns are signified in a good sense, the power of truth grounded in good, and in an 
opposite sense the power of the false principle which is grounded in evil. According 
to this latter sense by lifting up the horn on high is signified boldly to defend what is 
false against what is true, wherefore also it is said, speak not with a hard neck; by 
cutting off their horns is signified to destroy their falsities; and by exalting the horns 

258

of the just is signified to render the truths of good powerful and strong. AC 2832. AE 
316.

Verse 8. In the hand, of JEHOVAH is a cup, and the wine is red, it is full of mixture; he 
pours it out, but the dregs thereof all the wicked of the earth shall such up and drink. 
By a cup in the hand of JEHOVAH and by wine is signified Divine Truth; by mixing and
by what is mixed, is signified profanation; for the mixture of what is false with what is
true is understood; by his pouring it out and all the, wicked of the earth sucking it up 
and drinking is signified the punishment of profanation. AE 1116.

PSALM 76

To him that presides on Neginoth, a Psalm or Song of Asaph.

In Judah is GOD known, his name is great in Israel.
In Salem is his tabernacle, and his dwelling-place in Zion.

1.
2.
3. There has he broken the arrows of the bow, the shield, and the sword, and the 

battle. Selah.

4. You are more glorious and magnificent than the mountains of prey.
5. The stout-hearted are spoiled, they have slept their sleep, and none of the men 

of might have found their hands.

6. At your rebuke, O God of Jacob, both the chariot and horse have fallen into 

deep sleep.

7. You are to be feared, even you! yea, who can stand before you when you are 

angry?

8. You do cause judgement to be heard from heaven; and the earth fears and is 

still.

9. When GOD arises to judgement, to save all the afflicted of the earth. Selah.
10. For the anger of man shall praise you, with the remainder of anger you will 

gird yourself.

11. Vow and pay to JEHOVAH your GOD, let all that be round about him bring 

presents to him that ought to be feared.

12. He shall cut off the spirit of princes; he is to be feared by the kings of the 

earth.

The Internal Sense

That the LORD is in his church, where there is protection against falsities and evils, 
verses 1 to 4; that in the Jewish church there is no longer any truth, verses 5, 6; that 
the LORD is about to execute judgement, whereby the wicked will perish, and the good
will be saved, verses 7 to 10, 12; the LORD is to be worshipped, verse 11.

EXPOSITION

Verses 2, 3. In Salem is his tabernacle, and his dwelling-place in Zion; there has he 
broken the arrows of the bow, the shield, the sword, and the battle. Jerusalem is here 
called Salem, because by Salem is signified peace, from which also it derived its name
of Jerusalem; by the tabernacle of God which is there, is signified the church; and by 
his habitation in Zion, is signified the good of love, inasmuch as the LORD dwells in 
that good, and thence gives truths, and fructifies and multiplies them; and since by 
peace is also signified that there are no longer any combats of what is evil and false 
against what is good and true, or no longer any disagreement or war in a spiritual 
sense, therefore it is said, he has there broken the arrows of the bow, the shield, the 
sword, and the battle, by which is signified the dissipation of all combat of the 
doctrine of falsities against good and truth, and in general the dissipation of all 
disagreement. AE 365. See also AC 1726.

260

That battle [or war] in the Word signifies spiritual battle [or war], which is that of the 
false grounded in evil against truth grounded in good, is manifest from various 
passages of the Word. AE 734.

Verses 5, 6. The stout-hearted are spoiled, they have slept their sleep; at your rebuke, 
O God of Jacob, both the chariot and horse have fallen into a deep sleep. By the 
stout-hearted are signified those who are in truths grounded in good; by their being 
spoiled and sleeping their sleep, is signified that they have lapsed from evils into 
falsities; by the rebuke of the GOD of Jacob is signified the inversion of their state of 
themselves; and that both the chariot and the horse have fallen into deep sleep is 
signified that their intellectual principle is disposed to sleep because it is become 
merely natural. AE 355.

Chariot and horse signify the doctrine of the church and its intellect, which are said to
be asleep when they are without truths, and hence the man of the church is without 
spiritual life. AE 187.

261

PSALM 77

To him that presides; to Jeduthun, a Psalm of Asaph.

1.

2.

3.

I cried to GOD with my voice, even to GOD with my voice; and he gave ear to 
me.
In the day of my distress I sought the LORD, my hand was stretched out by 
night, and was not faint; my soul refused to be comforted.
I remember GOD, yet am I troubled; I meditate so that my spirit is 
overwhelmed.

4. You keep mine eyes waking; I am so troubled that I cannot speak.
5.
6.

I have considered the days of old, the years of former ages.
I call to remembrance my song in the night, I commune with my own heart; 
and my spirit makes diligent search; saying:

7. Will the LORD cast me off for ever, and will he be favourable no more?
8.
Is his mercy gone for ever? does his WORD fail from generation to generation?
9. Has GOD forgotten to be merciful? Has he in anger shut up his mercies? Selah.
10. And I said, this is my infirmity: I will remember the years of the right hand of 

the Most High.

11. I will remember the works of JAH; yea, I will remember your wonders of old.
12. And 1 will meditate on all your work; and will consider your doings.
13. Your way, O GOD, is in holiness; what GOD is great as our GOD?
14. You are the GOD that do wonders; you have made known your strength 

amongst the peoples.

15. You have redeemed your people with your arm; even the sons of Jacob and 

Joseph. Selah.

16. The waters saw you, O GOD, the waters saw you, they were afraid; yea, the 

depths also were troubled.

17. The clouds dropped waters; the skies uttered a voice; your arrows also went 

abroad:

18. The voice of your thunder was in the whirlwind; the lightnings lightened the 

world; the earth trembled and shook.

19. Your way is in the sea, and your path in many waters; yet your footsteps are 

not made known.

20. You have led your people like a flock by the hand of Moses and Aaron.

The Internal Sense

The LORD'S state of temptation, that he was even in despair whether the FATHER would
succour him, verses 1 to 9; comforting himself through his Divine [principle] by 
things past, that they are saved who have implored, verses 10 to 15; and that through 
divine truth he shall have power, verses 16 to 19; and the church be preserved, verse 
20.

262

EXPOSITION

Verse 5. I have considered the days of old, the years of former ages. The days of old, 
and the years of former ayes, denote the most ancient church, and the ancient church. 
AC 2906.

Verse 15. You have redeemed your people with your arm, even the sons of Jacob and 
Joseph. By the sons of Jacob and Joseph are meant those who are in the good of life, 
according to their religious principle; by Jacob, in the Word, is meant the external 
church, which appertains to those who are in the good of life; and by Joseph are here 
meant Menassah and Ephraim, for it is said, you have redeemed the sons of Joseph, by
whom are meant those who, as to the external man, are in good and truth, thus as to 
life; that Menassah and Ephraim, who are the sons of Joseph, signify such, may be 
seen above, AE 440; to redeem them with the arm signifies to save them by virtue of 
Omnipotence, for they who were of such a character, were saved of the LORD by his 
coming into the world, for otherwise they could not have been saved. AE 448.

Verses 15, 16, 17, 18. You have redeemed your people with your arm; the clouds 
dropped waters; the skies uttered a voice; your arrows also went abroad; the voice of 
your thunder was in the whirlwind; the lightnings lightened the world. The subject 
here treated of is concerning the establishment of the church; and by the clouds 
dropping waters, are signified truths from the sense of the letter of the Word; by the 
skies, or superior clouds, uttering a voice, are signified truths from the spiritual sense 
of the Word; by the arrows which went abroad, are meant lightnings, from which they
appear as arrows from a bow, and which are present when there are thunderings and 
lightnings, and by them are signified divine truths; by the voice of thunder in the 
whirlwind is signified divine truth as to perception and understanding in the church; 
and by the lightnings lightening the world, is signified as to illustration thence; the 
world is the church, AE 278.

Verse 17. The clouds dropped waters; the shies uttered a voice; and your arrows went
abroad. The clouds dropped waters signifies that, from the sense of the letter of the 
Word, were derived genuine truths; the skies uttered a voice signifies influx out of 
heaven; your arrows went abroad signifies divine truths thence. AE 599.

Verse 18. The voice of your thunder was in the whirlwind, your lightnings lightened 
the world, the earth trembled and shook. His lightnings lightened the world, the earth 
will see and fear, the mountains like wax will melt before JEHOVAH, before the LORD of
the whole earth, Psalm 97:4, 5. That by voices, which are of thunders from heaven, 
are signified Truths Divine, see AC 7573, and that lightnings denote the splendours 
thence issuing, which glance upon the internal sight of man, and illuminate those who 
are in truth from good, and confound those who are in false principles grounded in 
evil, is manifest from the passages in the Word where lightnings are mentioned, as in 
David, "The clouds dropped waters, the skies uttered a voice, your arrows went 
abroad, the voice of your thunder was in the whirlwind, the lightnings lightened the 
world, the earth trembled and shook," where the voice of your thunder denotes Truth 
Divine, lightnings denote the splendour thereof, and world denotes the church. AC 
8813.

263

By these words is described the state of the wicked arising from the presence of the 
LORD in his Divine Truth, which state is like the state of the sons of Israel, when the 
LORD appeared to them on Mount Sinai, that they then heard the thunderings, saw the 
lightnings, and that the mount appeared in consuming fire as of a furnace, and that 
they trembled; this is known from the Word, and this because they were evil-hearted, 
for the LORD appears to every one according to his quality, to the good as a refreshing 
fire, and to the evil as a consuming fire; hence it is evident what is signified by the 
voice of thunder in the whirlwind, by the lightnings lightening the world, by the earth 
trembling and shaking, and by the mountains melting before JEHOVAH the LORD of the
whole earth; by the world are meant all of the church who are in good principles, in 
this case who are in evil principles, and by the earth are meant all who in the church 
are in truths, in this case who are in falsities. AE 741.

Verse 19. Your way is in the sea, and your path in many waters, yet your footsteps are 
not known. That by the sea is not here meant the sea, nor by waters are meant waters,
is evident, because it is said, that the way and path of JEHOVAH is there; wherefore by 
sea and by waters are meant such things in which JEHOVAH or the LORD is, which 
things are the knowledges of truth in general from the Word, and the truth there; sea 
denotes those knowledges, and waters denote truths; knowledges and truths differ in 
this respect, that knowledges are of the natural man, and truths are of the spiritual 
man. AE 275.

264

PSALM 78

An instructive Psalm of Asaph.

1. Hearken, O my people, to my law; incline your ear to the words of my mouth.
I will open my mouth in a parable, I will utter dark sayings of old;
2.
3. Which we have heard and known, and which our fathers have told us.
4. We will not hide them from their sons, from the generation to come; 

recounting the praises of JEHOVAH, and his strength, and his wonderful works 
which he has done.

5. For he established a testimony in Jacob, and appointed a law in Israel, which 

he commanded our fathers to make know to their sons.

6. That the generation to come might know them, the sons which should be born,

who should arise, and recount them to their sons.

7. That they should set their hope in GOD, and not forget the works of GOD, but 

keep his commandments;

8. And not be as their fathers, a stubborn and rebellious generation; a generation 
which set not their heart right; and whose spirit was not steadfast with GOD.
9. Like the sons of Ephraim, who were armed, shooters with the bow, who turned

back in the day of battle.

10. They kept not the covenant of GOD, and refused to walk in his law.
11. Yea, they forgot his works, and his wonders which he had shown to them.
12. In the sight of their fathers he did wonderful things in the land of Egypt, in the 

field of Zoan.

13. He divided the sea, and made them pass through; and he made the waters to 

stand as a heap.

14. And he led them with a cloud by day, and all the night with a light of fire.
15. He cleft the rocks in the wilderness, and made them drink as out of great 

depths.

16. For he brought streams out of the rock, and caused waters to run down like 

rivers.

17. But they sinned yet more against him, by provoking the MOST HIGH in the 

wilderness.

18. And they tempted GOD in their heart, by asking meat for their soul.
19. And they spoke against GOD: they said, can GOD prepare a table in the 

wilderness?

20. Behold, he smote the rock, that the waters gushed out, and the rivers 

overflowed; can he give bread also? can he provide flesh for his people?

21. Therefore JEHOVAH heard and was wrath, and a fire was kindled against Jacob;

and anger also came up against Israel.

22. Because they believed not in GOD, and trusted not in his salvation.
23. Therefore he commanded the clouds from above, and opened the doors of 

heaven.

24. And rained down manna upon them to eat, and gave them of the corn of 

heaven.

25. Man did eat the bread of the mighty; he sent them meat to the full.
26. He caused an east wind to blow in the heavens, and by his power he brought 

the south wind.

265

27. He rained flesh also upon them as dust; and feathered bird as the sand of the 

sea.

28. And he let it fall in the midst of their camp, round about their habitations.
29. But when they had eaten, and were well filled, and he had given them their 

desire;

30. Their lust did not depart from them, and while their meat was yet in their 

mouths;

31. The anger of GOD came upon them, and slew the fattest of them, and smote 

down the chosen men of Israel.

32. For all this they sinned still, neither did they believe through his wondrous 

works.

33. Therefore their days did he consume in vanity, and their years in terror.
34. When he slew them, then they sought him; and they returned and enquired in 

the morning after GOD.

35. And they remembered that GOD was their rock, and the MOST HIGH GOD their 

Redeemer.

36. But they flattered him with their mouth; and with their tongues they lied to 

him.

37. For their heart was not right with him, nor were they faithful in his covenant.
38. But he in his mercy forgave their iniquity, and destroyed them not; yea, many 

a time turned he his anger away, and did not stir up all his wrath.

39. For he remembered that they were flesh; a breath that passes away, and comes 

not again.

40. So often did they provoke him in the wilderness, and grieve him in the desert.
41. They turned back and tempted GOD, and provoked the Holy One of Israel.
42. They remembered not his hand, nor the day when he delivered them from the 

enemy.

43. When he worked his signs in Egypt, and his wonders in the field of Zoan;
44. When he turned their rivers into blood; and their streams that they could not 

drink;

45. When he sent divers sorts of flies among them, which devoured them; and 

frogs, which destroyed them;

46. When he gave their increase to the caterpillar, and their labours to the locust;
47. When he destroyed their vines with hail, and their sycamore trees with great 

hailstones;

48. When he gave up their cattle to the hail-storm, and their flocks to the 

lightnings;

49. When he cast upon them the fierceness of his anger, wrath, indignation, and 

trouble, by sending evil angels among them;

50. When he made a way to his anger, he spared not their soul from death, but 

gave their life over to the pestilence;

51. When he smote all the first-born in Egypt,— the beginning of strength in the 

tents of Ham.

52. But made his own people to go forth like sheep, and guided them in the 

wilderness like a flock.

53. And he led them on safely, so that they did not fear; but the sea covered their 

enemies.

54. And he brought them to the border of his sanctuary; to the mountain which his

right hand had purchased.

266

55. He cast out the nations before them, and divided them an inheritance by line, 

and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents.

56. Nevertheless, they tempted and provoked the MOST HIGH GOD, and kept not his

testimonies.

57. But turned back, and acted treacherously like their fathers; they were turned 

aside like a deceitful bow.

58. For they provoked him to anger with their high places, and moved him to 

jealousy with their graven images.

59. When GOD heard this, he was wrath, and greatly abhorred Israel.
60. Therefore he forsook the habitation of Shiloh,—the tent in which he dwelt 

amongst men;

61. And delivered his strength into captivity, and his beauty into the hands of the 

enemy.

62. He gave up his people to the sword, and was wrath with his inheritance.
63. The fire consumed his young men, and his maidservants were not given in 

marriage.

64. His priests fell by the sword; and his widows made no lamentations.
65. Until the LORD awaked as one out of sleep—as a mighty man that shouts by 

reason of wine.

66. And he smote his enemies on the back; he put them to a perpetual reproach.
67. Moreover he refused the tabernacle of Joseph; and chose not the tribe of 

Ephraim;

68. But chose the tribe of Judah, the mount Zion which he loves.
69. And he built his sanctuary like the heights of heaven, like the earth, which he 

has established for ever.

70. He chose also David his servant, and took him from the sheepfolds;
71. From following the ewes giving suck, he brought him to feed Jacob his people,

and Israel his inheritance.

72. Who fed them according to the integrity of his heart, and guided them by the 

skilfulness of his hands.

The Internal Sense

That the Word was given to the sons of Jacob, and confirmed by miracles, verses 1 to 
7; but that their fathers and their sons receded, not living according to the same, 
verses 8 to 10; and that neither did the miracles in the wilderness do any thing, all 
which implied how the LORD teaches and leads those whom he calls to his church, 
which miracles are recited, verses 11 to 31; that by reason of the miracles they were 
indeed converted, but only in word, and not from the heart, verses 32 to 37; that the 
LORD pardoned them, verses 38 to 40; that they were again as it were converted, from 
the remembrance of the miracles in Egypt, which all implies a removal and 
dissipation of the hells from them, which are recited, verses 41 to 51; that thus the 
LORD led them even to the land in which the church was, verses 52 to 55; that 
nevertheless they turned away, and worshipped another GOD, verses 56 to 58; that 
therefore they were left by the LORD, and delivered up to their falsities and evils, by 
their own choice, verses 59 to 64; and thus rejected, verses 65 to 67; that therefore a 
new church was established, which might worship the LORD, and which the LORD 
might teach, verses 68 to 72.

EXPOSITION. 

267

Verse 5. For he established a testimony in Jacob, and appointed a law in Israel, 
which he commanded our fathers to make known to their sons. By Jacob and Israel is 
signified the church,—by Jacob the external church, and by Israel the internal church;
by testimony also, and by the law, is signified the Word; by testimony, what there 
teaches the goods of life, and by law, what there teaches the truths of doctrine; 
inasmuch as they who are in the external church are in the good of life according to 
the truths of doctrine; and as they who are in the internal church, are in the truths of 
doctrine according to which the life is formed, therefore it is said of Jacob that it is a 
testimony, and of Israel that it is a law. AE 392.

Verse 8. And not be as their fathers, a stubborn and rebellious generation, a 
generation which set not their heart right, and whose spirit was not steadfast with 
GOD. Inasmuch as heart signifies good, and spirit truth, both received in the life, 
therefore heart in the opposite sense signifies evil, and spirit, what is false; for, in 
many parts of the Word, as in the above passage, they have also an opposite sense; the
heart and spirit are predicated according to this sense in the following passages in 
David: "A generation which set not their heart right, nor is their spirit steadfast with 
GOD," Psalm 78:8; and in Ezekiel, "Every heart shall melt, and every spirit shall be 
contracted," Ezekiel 21:13; and in Moses, "JEHOVAH has aggravated the spirit of the 
king of Hesh-bon, and has hardened his heart," Deut 10:30; and in Isaiah, "Conceive 
chaff, bring forth stubble, fire shall devour your spirit," Isaiah 33:11; and in Ezekiel, 
"Woe to the foolish prophets who go away after their own spirit," Ezekiel 13:3; again,
"That which ascends upon your spirit shall never come to pass," 20:32. From these 
considerations it is evident, that the whole life of man is understood by heart and 
spirit, and inasmuch as his whole life has reference to these two principles, namely, to
good and truth, and, in a spiritual sense, to love and faith, therefore, by heart, and 
spirit, those two lives of man are understood; hence also it is that the heart and spirit 
signify the will and understanding of man, inasmuch as these two faculties with man 
constitute all his life, for man has no life but in those faculties, the reason is because 
the will is the receptacle of good and its love, or of evil and its love, and the 
understanding is the receptacle of truth and its faith, or of the false and its faith, and, 
as has been said, all things with man have reference to good and truth, or to evil and 
the false, and in a spiritual sense to love and faith, as may he seen in the "Doctrine of 
the New Jerusalem," NJHD 28 to 25. The ground and reason why by spirit, when 
predicated of man, is signified truth or the false, and his life from one or the other is 
because by spirit is properly understood the spirit which is in man, and thinks, and it 
thinks either from truths or from falsities; but, as was said above, there are two things 
which constitute the life of man,— the understanding and the will; the life of the 
understanding is to think from truths or falsities, and the life of the will is to affect or 
inflame with love those things which the understanding thinks. These two lives of 
man correspond to the two lives of his body, which are the life of the respiration of the
lungs, and the life of the pulse of the heart; by this correspondence the spirit is united 
to the body with man, as may be seen above, AE 167, and in the work concerning 
"Heaven and Hell," HH 446, 447; for as much as there is such a correspondence, 
therefore spirit is so called from wind, as well in the original as in many other 
languages, wherefore, also to expire, is expressed by emitting the spirit., and this also 
in the Word; thus in David, "I have gathered their spirit, it has expired," Psalm 
104:29. AE 183.

268

Verses 9, 10. The sons of Ephraim, who were armed shooters with the bow, who 
turned back in the day of battle; they kept not the covenant of GOD. By Ephraim is 
here signified as a bow, the understanding of truth, and by his sons the truths 
themselves, wherefore also they are called shooters with the bow, that is, combatants 
against evils and falsities; in this case that they did not resist them, because not 
conjoined with the LORD, is signified by their turning back in the day of battle, 
because they kept not the covenant of God; covenant is conjunction, and not to keep it,
is not to live according to the truths and goods which conjoin. AE 357.

Verses 15, 16. He cleft the rocks in the wilderness, and made them drink as out of 
great depths; for he brought streams out of the rocks, and caused waters to run down 
like rivers. Rock denotes the LORD, and waters, rivers, and depths thence denote truth 
derived from him. AC 2702.

In this passage depths denote waters in store; and waters in store denote the truths of 
faith in abundance; to make them to drink great depths out of the rock denotes the 
truths of faith without deficiency. AC 8278.

Verses 26, 27. He caused an east wind to blow in the heavens, and by his power he 
brought in the south wind; he rained flesh also upon them as dust, and feathered bird 
as the sand of the sea. That by the east wind are signified those things which are of 
lusts and phantasies thence derived, is manifest from the passages in the Word, where 
it is named; that by the flesh, which that wind brought, are signified cravings, and by 
the feathered bird the phantasies thence derived, is manifest from the Book of Moses, 
Numb 11:31 to 35, where it is written that the name of the place, where the people 
were smitten with the plague by reason of their eating flesh, was called the graves of 
cravings, because there they buried the people that lusted. AC 5215.

Verse 39. For he remembered that they were flesh, a breath that passes away and 
comes not again. Speaking of the people in the wilderness desiring flesh, that they 
were corporeal; who, by desiring flesh, represented that they only desired corporeal 
things, Numb 11:32, 33, 34. AC 574.

In the Word, the spirit is opposed to the flesh, since by the spirit is signified life from 
the LORD, and by the flesh life from man, as in John, "It is the spirit which vivifies, 
the flesh profits nothing;" John 6:63; hence it is manifest, that spirit denotes life from 
the LORD, which is the life of love and of faith to him from him, and that flesh denotes
life from man, thus his proprium; hence it is said that the flesh profits nothing. AC 
10283.

Verse 43. When he worked his signs in Egypt, his wonders in the field of Zoan. Signs 
and miracles are frequently mentioned in the Word; and by a sign is understood, that 
which indicates, witnesses, and persuades, concerning the subject of enquiry, but by 
miracle is understood that which excites, strikes, and induces astonishment; thus a 
sign moves the understanding and faith, and a miracle the will and its affection, for 
the will and its affection is what is excited, struck, and amazed, and the understanding
and its faith is what is persuaded, indicated to, and for which testification is made. 
That there is such a difference between a sign and a miracle, may appear from this 
consideration, that the Jews, although they saw so many miracles performed by the 
LORD, still asked of him signs; and also from this, that the prodigies performed in 

269

Egypt and in the wilderness are sometimes called signs and sometimes miracles, and 
also sometimes both; and moreover it is manifest from this consideration, that in 
every part of the Word there is a marriage of truth and good, consequently also of the 
understanding and will, for truth appertains to the understanding and good to the will, 
and hence also signs have reference to the things which are of truth, thus which are of 
faith and the understanding, and miracles to the things which are of good, thus which 
are of affection and the will: hence then it is evident, what is specifically understood 
by signs, and what by miracles, where-they are both mentioned in the Word; as in the 
following passages. Thus in Moses; "I will harden the heart of Pharaoh, that I may 
multiply my signs and my miracles in the land of Egypt," Exod 7:3; again, "JEHOVAH 
gave signs and miracles great and evil in Egypt, in Pharaoh, and in every man of his," 
Deut 6:22; from these passages it is evident, that the prodigies performed in Egypt, 
and afterwards with the sons of Israel, are called signs and miracles, signs because 
they testified and persuaded, and miracles because they excited and induced 
astonishment; they agree, however, in this, that the things which excite and induce 
astonishment also testify and persuade, as those things which excite the will also 
persuade the understanding, or as those things which move the affection also move 
the thought by persuasion. AE 706.

Verses 45, 46. When he sent divers sorts of flies among them, which devoured them, 
and frogs which destroyed them; when he gave their increase to the caterpillar, and 
their labour to the locust. It is to be noted, that flying things in the Word, all signify 
intellectual things, and thence truths, and in the opposite sense falsities; but the flying 
things of the lowest sort, which are insects, signify truths, and in the opposite sense 
falsities, which are more ignoble and obscure, as those are which are proper to the 
sensual principle, for those, unless they be illustrated by interior things, are altogether 
in obscurity and darkness, being next to the body, and thence near to terrestrial things. 
AC 7441.

Verses 45, 46. When he sent divers sorts of flies among them, which devoured them, 
and frogs which destroyed them; when he gave their increase to the caterpillar, and 
their labour to the locust. Inasmuch as by locust is there signified the sensual 
principle, as what is false and evil, or what is the same thing, what is false and evil in 
the sensual man, therefore this is here signified by locust. AE 543.

Verses 47, 48, 49. When he destroyed their vines with hail, and their sycamore trees 
with great hail stones; when he gave up their cattle to the hail storm, and their flocks 
to the lightnings; when he cast upon them the fierceness of his anger, wrath, and 
indignation and trouble, by sending evil angels among them. Hail denotes the 
vastation of truth and good by falsities derived from evil. AC 7553.

In this passage, by anger, wrath, and indignation, are meant punishments and 
damnation, into which man casteth himself, when into evils, for it is of divine order 
that goods have with them recompense, and hence it is that evils have with them 
punishments. AC 6997.

Verses 47, 48, 49. He destroyed their vines, etc. Inasmuch as hail signifies the false 
destroying the truths of the church, it is therefore said, he destroyed their vine with 
hail, and their sycamores with great hail-stones, for by vine is signified the spiritual 
truth of the church, and by sycamore, its natural truth; and inasmuch as by lightnings, 

270

is signified the love of evil, and its ardour for destroying the goods of the church, it is 
therefore said, he delivered up their cattle to the hail storm, and their flocks to the 
lightnings, cattle and flock signifying the evil affections or cupidities arising from evil
love, and lightnings, the cupidity and ardour of destroying; by sending evil angels, is 
signified the false of evil from hell. AE 503.

Verse 51. When he smote all the first-born of Egypt, the beginning of strength in the 
tents of Ham. That Ham signifies the church corrupted, that is, those who make faith 
separate from charity the principle of religion, appears from David, "He smote all the 
first-born in Egypt, the beginning of strength in the tents of Ham:" Psalm 78:51: by 
the first-born of Egypt was represented faith without charity; that faith is called the 
first-born of the church, may be seen above, AC 352, 367; and that faith is thence 
called the beginning of strength, as here in David, may be seen in Genesis 49:3, 
where, speaking of Reuben, who, as the first-born of Jacob, representing faith, is 
called the beginning of strength; the tents of Ham signify worship thence derived: that
tents signify worship may be seen above, AC 414, hence Egypt is called the land of 
Ham, Psalm 105:23, 27. Psalm 106:22. Such as were called Ham in the ancient 
church, inasmuch as they lived in the indulgence of all evil lusts, and made a talk of 
salvation by faith without respect to their lives, appeared to the ancients to be black, 
by reason of the heat of their lusts, whence they were called Ham. Hence it is that 
Ham is called the father of Canaan, because such are little concerned how a man lives,
provided he only frequents the ordinances of the church, for they still insist on the 
expediency of some kind of worship, but then they use only what is external, rejecting
that which is internal, and what is grounded solely in charity; hence Ham is called the 
father of Canaan. AC 1063.

Verse 55. He cast out the nations before them, and divided them an inheritance by 
line, and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents. Lines in the Word also 
signify portions of inheritance and of land, inasmuch as by lines were made 
measurements. AC 9854.

Verse 60. Therefore he forsook the habitation of Shiloh; the tent in which he dwelt 
amongst men. Where tent signifies the same as temple, in which GOD is said to dwell, 
when present with man in love; hence man, who lived in holy worship, was by the 
ancients called a tent, and afterwards a temple. AC 1102.

Verses 60, 61. Therefore he forsook the habitation of Shiloh; the tent in which he 
dwelt amongst men: and delivered his strength into captivity; and his beauty into the 
hands of the enemy. By the habitation of Shiloh is signified the church which is 
principled in the good of love, and by the tent is signified the church which is 
principled in the truths of doctrine; hence it is evident what is signified by GOD 
forsaking the habitation of Shiloh, the tent in which he dwelt amongst men, namely 
that the goods of love and truths of doctrine were destroyed; by the strength which he 
delivered into captivity, is signified spiritual truth derived from celestial good, and by 
captivity, seclusion from the understanding thereof, and so destruction by falsities; 
and by the beauty which he delivered into the hand of the enemy, is signified natural 
truth from spiritual, this being signified by beauty, and the destruction thereof by evils
being signified by delivering it into the hand of the enemy. AE 811.

271

Verses 62, 63, 64. He gave up his people to the sword, and was wrath with his 
inheritance. The fire consumed his young men, and his maidservants were not given 
in marriage. His priests fell by the sword, and his widows made no lamentations. 
These words also relate to the devastation of the church by falsities and evils; he gave
up his people to the sword, and was wrath with his inheritance, signifies that the 
church perished by falsities and evils; the sword signifies the destruction of truth by 
falsities; a fire consumed his young men, signifies that self-love, and the pride of self-
intelligence, destroyed the understanding of truth; the maidservants not being given in
marriage, signifies that the affections of truth perished by the want of the 
understanding of truth; the priests fell by the sword, signifies that the goods of the 
church, which are the goods of work, of charity, and of life, were destroyed by 
falsities. AE 863.

Verses 67, 68, 69. Moreover he refused the tabernacle of Joseph; and chose not the 
tribe of Ephraim; but chose the tribe of Judah, the mount Sion which he loves; and he
built his sanctuary like high places, like the earth which he has established for ever. 
From these and many other passages it may be manifest what is signified in the Word 
by Judah, and that thereby is not meant the Jewish nation, inasmuch as this was very 
far from being a celestial church, but the worst of all nations in regard to love to the 
LORD; but that such persons were still capable of representing the celestial and 
spiritual things of the LORD'S kingdom, may be seen AC 3479, 3480, and 3481; since 
in representations the person is not reflected upon, but only the thing which is 
represented. When, however, they did not remain in the rituals ordained by JEHOVAH, 
but turned away from them to idolatry, they then no longer represented celestial and 
spiritual things, but things opposite, according to the LORD'S words in John, "You are 
of your father the devil, at the desire of your father you are willing to do;" John 8:44. 
AC 3881.

Verses 70, 71, 72. He chose also David his servant, and took him from the sheepfolds;
from following the ewes giving suck, he brought him to feed Jacob his people, and 
Israel his inheritance; who fed them according to the integrity of his heart, and 
guided them by the skilfulness of his hands.

That to feed signifies to instruct may appear without further exposition, inasmuch as it
is a custom derived from the Word to call those who teach, pastors, and those who are 
instructed, the flock; but the reason of this is not yet known, and therefore it shall be 
explained: in heaven, all things which appear before the eyes are representative, for 
they represent, under a natural appearance, the spiritual things which the angels think 
and with which they are affected, thus their thoughts and affections are presented 
before their eyes in forms such as are in the world, or in similar forms of natural 
things, and this by virtue of the correspondence, which is established by the LORD 
between spiritual things and natural, concerning which we have treated in many 
places, particularly in the work concerning "Heaven and Hell", HH 87 to 102, and HH
133 to 115. It is from this correspondence that there appear in heaven flocks of sheep, 
lambs, and goats, feeding in green pastures, and also in gardens, which appearances 
exist from the thoughts of those who are in the goods and truths of the church, and 
who think thence intelligently and wisely; hence then it is, that in the Word mention is
so often made of flock, also of pastures, of feeding, and of a pastor or shepherd; for 
the Word in the letter consists of such things as appear to the sight in heaven, by 
which are signified correspondent spiritual things. Inasmuch as it is known in the 

272

church that to feed signifies to instruct, pasture, instruction, and a pastor or shepherd, 
an instructor, we will only adduce a few places from the Word where these 
expressions are used, without further explication: thus in Isaiah; "In that day shall 
your flock feed in a broad meadow;" Is 30:23; again, "As a shepherd he shall feed his 
flock, he shall gather the lambs into his arms, he shall gently lead those that give 
suck;" Is 40:11; again, "He shall say to the bound, go forth, to them that are in 
darkness, be discovered; they shall feed upon the ways, and their pasture shall be in 
all high places;" Is 49:9. AE 482.

PSALM LXXIX. 

A Psalm of Asaph.

1. O GOD, the nations have come into your inheritance; your holy temple have 

they defiled; they have laid Jerusalem on heaps.

2. The dead bodies of your servants have they given for meat to the birds of 

heaven; the flesh of your saints to the wild beasts of the earth.

3. Their blood have they shed like water round about Jerusalem; and there is no 

one to bury them.

4. We are become a reproach to them that dwell near us; a scorn and derision to 

them that are round about us.

5. How long, O JEHOVAH, will you be angry? For ever? How long shall your 

jealousy burn like fire?

6. Pour out your wrath upon the nations that have not known you; and upon the 

kingdoms that have not called upon your name;

7. For they have devoured Jacob, and laid waste his dwelling-place.
8. O remember not against us former iniquities! O let your tender mercies 

speedily come before us, for we are brought very low.

9. Help us, O GOD of our salvation, for the glory of your name; and deliver us, 

and purge away our sins, for your name's sake.

10. Wherefore should the nations say, where is their GOD? May vengeance be 

known among the nations in our sight, for the blood of your servants which is 
shed!

11. May the sighing of the prisoner come before you! according to the greatness 

of your arm, preserve you the sons of death;

12. And render to those who dwell near us seven-fold into their bosom their 

reproaches, with which they have reproached you, O LORD.

13. So we your people, and the sheep of your pasture, will give you thanks for 

ever; we will show forth your praise to all generations.

The Internal Sense

That falsifications of the Word, and direful evils, had destroyed the church, verses 1 to
4; the cries of the church for succour, lest it be destroyed, and a prayer that they may 
be removed who have brought destruction on the church, verses 5 to 12; hence the 
Lord will be worshiped, verse 13.

273

Exposition

Verses 1, 2. O GOD, the nations are come into your inheritance; your holy temple 
have they defiled; they have laid Jerusalem on heaps. The dead bodies of your 
servants have they given for meat to the birds of the heaven; the flesh of your saints to
the wild beasts of the earth. By nations are not here meant nations, but evils of life 
and falsities of doctrine, for by the inheritance of GOD is signified the church, in 
which the LORD is all good and truth, because from him; by defiling your temple of 
holiness, and laying Jerusalem on heaps is signified to profane the worship and 
pervert the doctrine of the church; the temple of holiness signifies worship, because 
worship is performed there; and Jerusalem signifies the church as to doctrine, thus 
also the doctrine of the church; and by giving the dead bodies of your servants for 
meat to the birds of the heavens, and the flesh of your saints to the wild beasts of the 
earth, is signified to destroy all truths by falsities, and goods by evils; the birds of the 
heavens here also are the thoughts of what is false; and the wild beasts of the earth 
denote the affections of evil thence derived. AE 388.

Verses 1, 2. O GOD, the nations, etc. Inasmuch as the birds of the heavens, and the 
wild beasts of the earth, signify such things, and since the nations of the land of 
Canaan signified the evils and falsities of the church, therefore it was usual with the 
Jewish nation to expose the dead bodies of their enemies to the wild beasts and birds, 
by which they might be devoured: hence it is, that it was considered as horrible and 
profane, and is likewise so considered at this day, to leave dead men unburied on the 
face of the earth, even after the combat: this also is signified in the Word by their not 
being buried, and also by the bones being extracted from their tombs, and being 
exposed. AE 1100.

Verse 9. Help us, O GOD of our salvation, for the glory of your name, and deliver us, 
and purge away our sins for your name's sake. That expiation, or purging away, 
signifies cleansing from evils, thus the remission of sins is manifest from the passages
in the Word, where mention is made of expiation, as in the above. AC 9506.

But in what way sins are forgiven, and evils removed, see Psalm 51:2, Exposition.

Verse 9. For the glory of your name,— for your names sake. They who were of the 
ancient church by name, did not understand name, but all the quality of a thing, see 
AC 144, 145; thus by the name of GOD they understood every thing in one complex 
whereby GOD is worshiped, consequently every thing belonging to love and faith: but 
when the internal principle of worship perished, and the external one remained, then 
by the name of GOD they began to understand nothing else but name, insomuch that 
they worshiped the very name itself, without any concern about the principle of love 
and of faith from which they worshiped: in consequence hereof nations began to 
distinguish themselves by the names of gods, and the Jews and Israelites preferred 
themselves before other nations on account of worshiping JEHOVAH, placing the 
essential of worship in mentioning and invoking a name, when yet the worship of a 
name only is no worship, being practicable with the worst of people, who thereby do 
but more profane the name. Inasmuch as by the name of GOD is signified the all of 
worship, that is, the all of love and of faith whereby he is worshiped, it is evident 
hence what is meant by these words in the LORD'S prayer, "Hallowed be your name" 
Matt 6:9; and by these words of the LORD, "You shall be hated of all for my names 

274

sake," Matt 10:22; "If two shall agree in my name on earth, concerning any thing 
whatever they shall ask, it shall be done for them of my FATHER, who is in the 
heavens: where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst
of them," Matt 18:20. "When the man of the church, as was observed, from internal 
became external, and began to make worship consist in a name only, then they no 
longer acknowledged one GOD, but several gods; for it was customary with the 
ancients to add somewhat to the name of JEHOVAH, thereby to record some kindness 
or attribute of his, as in the present case, "He called on the name of the GOD of 
eternity;" and in the following chapter, "Abraham called the name of that place, 
JEHOVAH-JIREH, that is, he will see," verse 14; again, "Moses built an altar, and called 
the name thereof JEHOVAH-NISSI, that is, my standard," Exodus 17:15; again, "Gideon 
built an altar to JEHOVAH, and called it JEHOVAH-SHALOM, that is, of peace," Judges 
6:24; besides other places; hence it came to pass, that they who made worship to 
consist in a name only, worshiped as many gods as there were names; and that 
amongst the gentiles, especially in Greece and at Rome, so many gods were 
acknowledged and worshiped, when yet the ancient church, from which those epithets
came, never worshiped any but one GOD venerated under so many names, inasmuch 
as by name the men of that church understood quality. AC 2724.

Verse 11. May the sighing of the prisoner come before you! according to the greatness
of your arm, preserve you the sons of death. They who are in vastations are called 
prisoners, not that they are in any bond or chain, but that they are not in liberty, as to 
their former thoughts and consequent affections; that such are they who are meant in 
the Word by prisoners, is manifest from the above passage. AC 5036.

Verse 11. According to the greatness of your arm preserve you the sons of death. From
this passage it may be manifest, that by arm in the Word, when applied to the LORD, is
signified superior power. AC 4933.

Verse 12. And render to those who dwell near us sevenfold into their bosom their 
reproaches, with which they have reproached you, O LORD. As the times of the 
regeneration of man are distinguished into six, before the seventh, or celestial man, so
likewise the times of vastation, until nothing celestial remains. Hence the 
grievousness and increase of punishment were expressed by seven, as in Moses, "If 
you are not obedient to me, I will chastise you seven-fold for your sins," Lev 26:18, 
21, 24, 28; and in David, "Render to our neighbours seven-fold into their bosom." AC 
395.       To recompense into their bosom denotes into themselves. AC 6960.

Verse 13. So we your people, and the sheep of your pasture, will give you thanks for 
ever; we will show forth your praise to all generations. That in this passage there are 
two expressions of one thing is manifest, which would appear like vain repetition, 
unless one involved a celestial principle which is good, and the other a spiritual 
principle, which is truth, thus a divine marriage, the LORD'S kingdom itself being such 
a marriage; this arcanum is in the Word throughout, but it cannot in any way be 
discovered except by the internal sense, and knowledge thence derived respecting the 
class, celestial or spiritual, to which each expression belongs. AC 3810.

To find pasture denotes to be taught, illustrated, and nourished in divine truths. AR 
914.

PSALM 80

To him that presides upon Shoshannim-eduth; a Psalm of Asaph.

1. Give ear, O you Shepherd of Israel! you that leadest Joseph like a flock; you 

that dwell between the cherubim, shine forth!

2. Before Ephraim, and Benjamin, and Manasseh, stir up your strength, and 

come and save us.

3. Turn us again, O GOD! and cause your face to shine, that we may be saved.
4. O JEHOVAH, GOD of HOSTS, how long will you be angry with the prayers of 

your people?

5. You have fed them with the bread of tears; and have given them tears to drink 

in full measure.

6. You have made us a strife to those who dwell near us; and our enemies laugh 

among themselves.

7. Turn us again, O GOD of HOSTS! and cause your face to shine, that we may be 

saved.

8. You have brought a vine out of Egypt; you have cast out the nations, and 

planted it.

9. You have prepared a place for it, and have caused it to take deep root, and to 

fill the earth.

10. The mountains were covered with its shadow, and the cedars of GOD with its 

branches.

11. It sent out its boughs to the sea, and its branches to the river.
12. Why have you broken down its hedges, so that all they who pass by the way 

do pluck it?

13. The boar out of the wood does trample upon it, and the wild beast of the fields 

does devour it.

14. Return, we beseech you, O GOD of HOSTS! look down from heaven, and 

behold and visit this vine;

15. Even the plant which your right hand has planted, and the son, that you have 

made strong for yourself.

16. It is burnt with fire; it is cut down; may they perish at the rebuke of your 

countenance!

17. Let your hand be over the man of your right hand, over the son of man whom 

you have made strong for yourself.

18. So will not we turn back from you; quicken us, and we will call upon your 

name.

19. Turn us again, O LORD GOD of HOSTS, cause your face to shine, that we may 

be saved.

The Internal Sense

A prayer of the new church to the LORD, that he would come and lead them, verses 1 
to 3, 7; because of their affliction, verses 4 to 6; that he established his church and 
reformed it by truths from the Word, verses 8 to 11; and nevertheless falsities began to
destroy it, verses 12, 13; that the LORD may come and restore it, and that thus it will 
be vivified, verses 14 to 19.

276

EXPOSITION

Verse 1. Give ear, O you Shepherd of Israel, you that leadest Joseph like a flock, you 
that dwell between the cherubim, shine forth! Dwelling between the cherubim denotes
the LORD as to a state of Providence, in preventing any one entering into the holy 
things of love and faith unless he be prepared of the LORD. AC 3884. (See AC 308.)

It is believed that the LORD may be approached by the truths of faith, but he cannot be 
approached by those truths separate from the good of love, nor indeed can heaven be 
approached, but as soon as truths separate are willing to enter, heaven is shut, thus the 
way to the LORD is closed; and whereas, truth cannot of itself enter, unless good be in 
it, and thus by good it be made good, so neither can the intellectual principle, and still 
less scientifics, separate from the good of the will enter into heaven. Inasmuch as 
guard and Providence to prevent the LORD being approached except by the good of 
love, is signified by cherubim, therefore in the Word JEHOVAH is said to sit upon 
cherubim, also to ride and dwell upon cherubim, as in David, "Shepherd of Israel give
ear, you that dwell between the cherubim shine forth."

Verse 2. Before Ephraim and Benjamin, and Manasseh, stir up your strength and 
come and save us. In this sense Joseph signifies the spiritual man; Ephraim, Benjamin
and Manasseh are the three principles proper to the spiritual church. AC 3969.

Verse 2. Before Ephraim, and Benjamin, and Manasseh, stir up your strength and 
come and save us. From the spiritual sense it is evident that these words contain a 
supplication to the LORD, that he may instruct those who are of the church, and lead 
by truths to good, thus to heaven; the LORD is called the shepherd of Israel, from this, 
that he instructs and leads, wherefore it is said, who leads Joseph as a flock; by 
Joseph are meant those who are of the church, who are in truths grounded in good; 
who sit upon a cherub signifies the LORD above the heavens, whence he sends forth 
light which enlightens the minds of angels and of men; wherefore it is said, shine 
forth; that the light of truth may penetrate even to those who are in natural truth and 
good, thus to the ultimates or lowest in the church, is signified by stirring up your 
strength before Ephraim, Benjamin, and Manasseh; by Ephraim are meant those who 
are in natural truth, natural truth being the quality of the truth of the Word in the sense
of the letter; by Manasseh are meant those who are in natural good, which is the 
delight of doing good and learning truth; by Benjamin is meant the conjoining 
principle of truth and good, or the conjoining medium in the natural principle; by 
stirring up strength is meant to penetrate thither with light; that they may be saved is 
signified by being salvation to us. Inasmuch as all good belonging to the natural man 
flows in from the LORD through the spiritual man, and that without that influx not any 
good can be given to the natural man; and whereas by Manasseh was represented and 
thence signified good in the natural man from a spiritual origin, therefore to that tribe 
was given an inheritance beyond Jordan, and likewise on this side or within Jordan. 
Deut 3:13; Josh 13:29, 30, 31. AC 440. 

Verse 3. Turn us again, O God, and cause your face to shine, that, we may be saved. 
That the face of JEHOVAH or of the LORD is mercy, may be evident from the Word, for 
the face of JEHOVAH or the LORD, in a proper sense, is the divine love itself, and 
because it is the divine love, it is of mercy, for mercy is grounded in love towards the 
human race beset with so great miseries. That the face of JEHOVAH or the LORD is the 

277

Divine love, may be manifest from the LORD'S face, when he was transfigured before 
Peter, James, and John, that is, when he showed them his Divine principle, on which 
occasion his face did shine as the sun. The LORD'S essential Divine principle never 
appeared in any face, but his Divine human principle has so appeared. AC 5585.

Verses 8, 9. You have brought a vine out of Egypt, you have cast out the nations and 
planted it; you have prepared a place for it, and have caused it to take deep root, and 
to fill the earth. By a vine out of Egypt is signified the church, which the sons of Israel
represented; by driving out the nations is signified the evils of the natural man which 
are driven out by truth; by preparing a place for it, and by making it to take root, is 
signified instruction according to order, which is that they should imbue knowledges 
and scientifics, and next that they should be in the wilderness and be tempted, and 
afterwards should be introduced into the land of Canaan, that is, into the church; these
things in their order are signified by preparing a place for it; by making it take root till
it had filled the earth, by sending forth its boughs even to the sea, is signified an 
increase of intelligence and extension even to the ultimates of the good and truth of 
the church; and by sending forth its branches even to the river, is signified to the 
rational principle. AE 654.

By a vine out of Egypt are meant the sons of Israel, who are called a vine, because 
they represented the spiritual church, which is signified by a vine in the Word; their 
sojourning in Egypt represented their first initiation into the things of the church, for 
Egypt signified scientific subservient to the things of the church; when therefore a 
vine signifies the church, and Egypt a subservient scientific, it is evident what is 
signified in the spiritual sense, by bringing a vine out of Egypt; the extension of its 
intelligence even to things scientific and rational, is signified by sending forth its 
boughs even to the sea, and its branches to the river. AE 518.

Speaking in a supreme sense of the LORD, the vine out of Egypt is truth from 
scientifics, to drive out the nations is to purge from evils; to sweep before it is to make
ready that goodnesses may fill. AC 3142.

To the sea and to the river denotes to interior truths and goods. AC 9341.

Verses 14, 15, 16. Return, we beseech you, O GOD of HOSTS! look down from heaven, 
and behold and visit this vine. And the plant which your right hand has planted, and 
the son that you have made strong for yourself. It is burnt with fire; it is cut down; 
they perish at the rebuke of your countenance. David said these things of the church 
and of himself, which is the sense of the letter, for he understood himself by the 
branch, and by the son; but in the spiritual sense, by a vine and by a branch which 
JEHOVAH planted, is signified the spiritual church represented by the sons of Israel; by 
a son whom he made strong for himself is signified the truths of doctrine from the 
Word; by the man of your right hand, and by the son of man whom he made strong for
himself is signified the truths of the Word in the natural sense, which is the sense of 
the letter, and the truths of the Word in the spiritual sense, which is the internal sense. 
AE 724.

Verse 18. We will call upon your name. See Psalm 79:9, Exposition.

PSALM 81

To him that presides, upon Gittith, a Psalm of Asaph.

1. Sing aloud to GOD our strength; make a joyful noise to the GOD of Jacob.
2. Lift up a song, and bring here the timbrel; the pleasant harp, with the psaltery.
3. Blow the trumpet at the new moon, at the time appointed on the day of our 

solemn festival.

4. For this was a statute for Israel, a judgement for the GOD of Jacob.
5. This he ordained in Joseph for a testimony, when he went forth against the 

6.

land of Egypt; when I heard a language which I knew not.
I caused his shoulder to be removed from the burden; and his hands passed 
away from the furnace.

7. You called in distress and I delivered you; I answered you in the secret place 

of thunder; I proved you at the waters of Meribah. Selah.

8. Hear, O my people, and I will testify to you: O that you, O Israel, would 

hearken to me!

9. Let there be no strange GOD in you, neither bow yourself down to the GOD of 

the stranger.

10. I am JEHOVAH your GOD, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt: open 

your mouth wide, and I will fill it.

11. But my people would not hearken to my voice, and Israel would not comply 

with me.

12. Therefore I gave them up to the hardness of their heart, and they walked in 

their own counsels.

13. O that my people had hearkened to me! that Israel had walked in my ways!
14. I would soon have subdued their enemies, and turned my hand against their 

adversaries.

15. The haters of the LORD should have been submissive to him; but their time 

should have endured for ever.

16. He would have fed them also with the fat of wheat; and with honey out of the 

rock would I have satisfied you.

The Internal Sense

Celebration of the LORD by his church, verses 1 to 4; that he will deliver them from 
the hells when invoked, and when he has proved them, verses 5 to 7; that the church 
among the sons of Jacob had turned away, and worshiped another god, verses 8 to 11; 
and were therefore left to themselves, verse 12; if they had obeyed, the hells would 
have been removed from them, and they would have enjoyed every good, verses 13 to
16.

Exposition

Verses 1, 2, 3. Sing aloud to God our strength; make a joyful noise to the GOD of 
Jacob: lift up a song and bring here the timbrel, the pleasant harp, with the psaltery; 
blow the trumpet in the new moon, in the time appointed on the day of our solemn 

279

festival. Various kinds of affections in which are grounded confession and 
glorification of the LORD, are here expressed by various kinds of sounds and 
instruments; by various kinds of sounds, by singing aloud to the GOD of our strength; 
and by various kinds of instruments, by harps, timbrel, and trumpets, but to explain 
the significations of each is not our present intention, only to show what is meant by 
the harp; and to sing to JEHOVAH with the harp; with the harp and the voice of 
singing signifies confession from the affection of spiritual good and truth, for every 
affection, because it is of love, when it falls into sound, has a sound suitable to itself, 
whence also from the sound which is in speech, and in which the expressions of 
speech as it were flow, is heard the affection of another, which is also thence known to
the person addressed, and this manifestly in the spiritual world, where all sounds of 
speech manifest affections. AE 323.

That Joseph in this passage denotes the spiritual church, or the spiritual man, is 
evident from the particular words and expressions contained in it, for there are 
expressions in the Word which express spiritual things, and others which express 
celestial things, and this regularly throughout the Word. AC 3969. 

To lift up a song, etc. signifies confession from spiritual and celestial truths, and the 
delights of the affection of truth and of good, see above AE 323, 326.

To blow the trumpet in the new moon, on the day of our festival, signifies worship 
from the delights of those affections; this he ordained as a statute for Israel and a 
testimony for Joseph, signifies that those things related to the new church established 
amongst the sons of Israel, which church was in the truths of doctrine; in his going 
forth against the land of Egypt, where I heard a language which I knew not, signifies 
when the old church was destroyed, in which then were the falsities of doctrine; for 
Egypt, when Joseph was ruler there, represented the church which was in the 
knowledges of truth and of good, and in confirming scientifics, but when they began 
to hate the sons of Israel Egypt then represented the church destroyed, in which were 
mere falsities, for it is said, that a new king arose over the Egyptians, who knew not 
Joseph, wherefore also the Egyptians with Pharaoh, who persecuted the sons of Israel,
were overwhelmed in the Red Sea. AE 448.

Verse 5. I heard a language (a lip) which I knew not. In the Word, mention is 
frequently made of the lip, the mouth, and the tongue, and by the lip is signified 
doctrine, by the mouth, thought, and by the tongue, confession; the reason of such 
signification of the lip, mouth, and tongue, is because they are the externals of man, 
by which things internal are made manifest, and things internal which are in the 
internal or spiritual man are what are signified; for the Word in the letter consists of 
external things which appear before the eyes, and are perceived by the senses, whence
the Word in the letter is natural, and this in order that the divine truth which it 
contains, may be there in its ultimate, and so in fullness; but those external things, 
which are natural, comprehend in themselves things internal, which are spiritual, and 
are therefore the things signified. That tongues signify confessions from religion, and 
according to the dogmas of religion, may appear from the following passages, as in 
Isaiah: "The time comes when all nations and tongues shall be gathered together, that 
they may come and see my glory," Is 66:18; speaking of the advent of the LORD; by 
nations and tongues are signified all who are in the good of life according to their 
religions; tongues signify religions from confession, wherefore it is said, that they 

280

may come and see my glory, glory signifying divine truth, by which the church exists. 
Again, in Jeremiah; "Behold I bring upon you a nation, a nation whose tongue you 
shall not know, neither understand what they speak, they shall devour your harvest 
and your bread," Jer 5:15, 16; where it is not understood that a nation of an unknown 
tongue, or of an unintelligible speech, should be brought upon them, but an evil nation
altogether of a different religion, whose dogmas they should not know, nor understand
the reasonings derived from them; and in the abstract sense are signified the falsities 
of evil altogether opposite to the truths of good, for nation in the abstract sense here 
denotes evil, and tongue denotes the false of religion, and to speak denotes to reason 
thence: it therefore follows, they shall devour your harvest and your bread, for by 
harvest are signified truths by which good is procured, by bread, the good thence 
derived, and by devouring, to consume and deprive. AE 455.

Verse 6.I caused his shoulder to be removed from the burden; his hands passed away 
from the furnace. The natural man as to the scientific principle is signified by the 
furnace of iron; the furnace is the natural man, and iron is the scientific principle, in 
this case the false scientific principle, because it is said that they were brought out; for
the natural man, unless he be led by the spiritual man, is in falsities and in evils, by 
reason of his having no light from heaven, for light from heaven flows in through the 
spiritual man into the natural, and enlightens, teaches, and leads; the contrary is the 
case when the natural man does not think and act under the guidance of the spiritual 
man; in this case also he is in slavery, for he thinks and acts from all falsities and evils
which are from hell; this is signified by their being said to be brought out of bondage; 
for all liberty of thought and of action is from the spiritual man, inasmuch as he thinks
and acts from heaven and the LORD, and to be led of the LORD is freedom: from these 
considerations it may be manifest whence it is that Egypt is called a furnace of iron, 
and a house of bondage, AE 540.

To carry on the shoulders when subjection is treated of, signifies service, see Gen 
49:13; but when the subject treated of is concerning rule, then it signifies the highest 
power, see Isaiah 9:6. AC 9836.

Verse 7. You called in distress and I delivered you; I answered you in the secret place 
of thunder; I proved you at the waters of Meribah. As to what concerns this 
temptation itself, and its quality, it is to be noted that in this passage are described 
those who in temptations almost yield, namely who complain against heaven, and also
against the Divine Providence; these things are signified in the internal sense by what 
precedes, and also by what follows in this verse, and are the quality of the state of 
temptation, which is signified by Massah, and the quality of complaint or temptation 
is signified by Meribah. AC 8588.

Verses 13 and 16. O that my people had hearkened to me! O that Israel had walked in
my ways! He would have fed them with the fat of wheat, and with honey out of the 
rock would I have satisfied you. That wheat denotes the things that are of love and 
charity, may also appear from the following passages, "JEHOVAH makes him to ride 
upon the high places of the earth, and feeds him with the produce of fields; he makes 
him to suck honey out of the rock, and oil out of the flinty rock, butter of the herd and 
milk of the flock, with the fat of lambs and of rams, the sons of Bashan, and of goats, 
with the fat of the kidneys of wheat, and you drink the blood of the grape pure wine," 
Deut 32:13, 14; in this passage, in the internal sense, the ancient church is treated of, 

281

and its state at its establishment, and all the things relating to love and charity, and to 
faith, are described by significatives; the fat of the kidneys of wheat denotes the 
celestial principle of love and charity. AC 3941.

To suck honey out of the rock denotes delight derived from scientific truth. AC 5620.

Inasmuch as rock signifies the LORD as to faith, and faith from the LORD, therefore 
also wonderful things were done upon a rock. AC 8581.

By the fat of wheat is also signified the delight of spiritual good, and by honey out of 
the rock the delight of natural good by truths from the LORD, it is to be noted that 
natural good is not good, unless also there be in it spiritual good, for all good flows in 
through the spiritual man or mind, into the natural man or mind; and so far as the 
natural man or mind receives the good of the spiritual man or mind, so far it receives 
good. AE 619.

282

PSALM 82

A Psalm of Asaph.

1. GOD stands in the assembly of GOD; he judges in the midst of the gods.
2. How long will you judge perversely, and accept the countenances of the 

wicked? Selah.

3. Judge the poor and fatherless, do justice to the afflicted and needy.
4. Deliver the poor and needy, rescue them out of the hand of the wicked.
5. They know not, neither will they understand; they walk on in darkness; all the 

foundations of the earth totter.
I have said you are gods; and you are all the sons of the Most High.

6.
7. But you shall die like men, and fall like one of the princes.
8. Arise, O GOD, judge the earth; for you shall inherit all nations.

The Internal Sense

The LORD to the church in which the Word is, whence they might be in Divine Truths, 
verse 1; they are not to do evil, but good, verses 2 to 4; which they do not do, 
wherefore the church totters, verse 5; therefore although they have the Word they will 
perish, verses 6, 7; a prayer that the Lord would came and execute judgement, verse 8.

Exposition

Verse 1. GOD stands in the assembly of GOD, he judges in the midst of gods. By the 
assembly of GOD, and by the gods in the midst of whom JEHOVAH stands, are meant 
the angels, by whom in the spiritual sense are signified Divine Truths; and since the 
LORD in heaven is Divine Truth, therefore it is said of him that he stands there. AE 
639.

The assembly of GOD signifies heaven; in the midst of gods signifies with all the 
angels there, thus in the whole heaven; for the angels are called gods from the divine 
truth which they receive from the LORD, for God in the Word signifies the LORD as to 
divine truth, which proceeds from him, and which makes heaven. AE 313.

The angels, consequently the truths of good which are from the LORD, are also meant 
by gods in the following passages, "GOD stands in the assembly of GOD, in the midst 
of the gods he shall judge; I said you are gods, and you are all the sons of the Most 
High:" that the truths which proceed from the LORD are here meant by gods, is 
manifest from this consideration, that it is first said the assembly of GOD, and 
afterwards in the midst of gods. AC 8301.

As to what further concerns the signification of GOD, it is to be noted, that GOD in the 
supreme sense is the divine principle which is above the heavens, but GOD in the 
internal sense is the divine principle which is in the heavens: the divine principle 
which is above the heavens is the divine good, but the divine principle which is in the 
heavens is the divine truth; for from the divine good proceeds the divine truth, and 

283

makes heaven and arranges it; for what is properly called heaven is nothing else than 
the divine principle there formed, since the angels, who are in heaven, are human 
forms recipient of the divine principle, and constituting a common form, which is that 
of man; and whereas the divine truth in the heavens is what is meant by GOD, it is 
from this ground that in the original tongue GOD is called Elohim, in the plural; and 
also that the angels who are in the heavens, because they are recipients of the divine 
truth, are called gods, as in David, "Who in heaven shall be compared to JEHOVAH, 
who shall be likened to JEHOVAH among the sons of GOD?" Ps 89:6. AC 7268.

Verse 3. Judge the poor and fatherless. See Psalm 10:14, 18. Exposition.

Verse 5. They know not, neither will they understand; they walk on in darkness; all 
the foundations of the earth totter. He who does not know what is signified by a 
foundation, and what by the earth, conceives no otherwise than that the bottoms of the
earth are here meant by the foundations of the earth, although he may perceive if he 
attends, that something else is meant, for what would it be to know, to hear, and 
understand the foundations of the earth; hence it may be manifest that by the 
foundations of the earth are signified such things as are of the church; that earth in the
Word denotes the church, is very manifest from the passages in the Word where earth 
is named, and that its foundations are the truths of faith, for these truths of the church 
are for foundations; that the foundations of the earth do not totter, but the truths of the
church to those who do not acknowledge, do not understand, and walk in darkness, is 
evident. AC 9643.

284

PSALM 83

A Song or Psalm of Asaph.

1. Keep not you silence, O GOD; hold not your peace, and be not still, O GOD!
2. For lo, your enemies make a tumult; and they that hate you lift up the head.
3. They take crafty counsel against your people, and consult against your hidden 

ones.

4. They say, come, let us cut them off, that they be no more a nation; and that the 

name of Israel be no more remembered.

5. For they consult together with one heart; they make a covenant against you;
6. Even the tents of Edom, and the Ishmaelites; of Moab, and the Hagarenes;
7. Gebal, and Ammon, and Amalek; the Philistines, with the inhabitants of Tyre;
8. Ashur also is joined with them; they have become an arm to the sons of Lot. 

Selah.

9. Do you to them as to the Midianites; as to Sisera, as to Jabin, at the brook of 

Kishon:

10. Who perished at Endor: they became as dung for the earth.
11. Make their nobles like Oreb, and like Zeeb: yea, all their princes as Zebah, and

Zalmunna:

12. Who said, let us take to ourselves the dwellings of GOD in possession.
13. O my GOD, make them like a whirl; like the stubble before the wind.
14. As the fire burns the wood, and as the flame sets the mountains on fire,
15. So persecute them with your tempest, and terrify them with your storm. 
16. Fill their faces with shame, that they may seek your name, O JEHOVAH.
17. Let them be confounded and troubled for ever; yea, let them be put to shame, 

and perish.

18. That they may know that you, whose name alone is JEHOVAH, are the Most 

High over all the earth.

The Internal Sense

Of the combat of the LORD with the hells, which would willingly destroy all the things
of the church, verses 1 to 5; the hells in insurrection against the LORD enumerated, 
verses 6 to 8; that they will be cast down and subdued, verses 9 to 11; from the places 
where they have made as it were heavens to themselves, verse 12; a prayer to the 
LORD to overthrow them, verses 13 to 17; that it may be known that power is of the 
LORD only, verse 18.

Exposition

Verse 1. Keep not you silence, O GOD; hold not your peace, and be not still, O GOD. 
So long as temptation continues, man supposes that the LORD is absent, because he is 
disturbed by evil genii, and that to such a degree, as sometimes to be reduced to a 
state of despair, in which he can scarcely believe that any GOD exists; nevertheless the
LORD is more present at such times than is to him credible or conceivable, but when 

285

temptation ceases then he receives comfort, and then he first believes that the LORD is 
present. AC 840.

Verses 3, 4. They take crafty counsel against your people; and consult against your 
hidden ones: they say, come, let us cut them off, that they be no more a nation; and 
that the name of Israel be no more remembered. The things of memory are as dead 
things, unless man live according to the dictates thereof from a principle of 
conscience; when this is the case, then the things of memory become at the same time 
the things of life, and then only they are of use and salvation to the possessor after the 
life of the body. This is evident from what is here said concerning taking crafty 
counsel against your people. AC 1197.

To consult over the hidden ones, to cut them off from a nation, that the name of Israel 
be no more remembered, is altogether to reject and spit out things interior. AC 2468.

Verse 9. As to Sisera. That by Sisera is signified the false of evil, may be seen from 
the book of Judges, where he is mentioned: "From Machir shall the legislators 
descend, and from Zebulon they that draw the sceptre of the scribe: Zebulon was a 
people that devoted the soul to die, and Naphtali was upon the heights of the field: the
kings came, they fought, then fought the kings of Canaan in Taanach near the waters 
of Megiddo; they took not any gain of silver; the stars fought from heaven, from their 
courses they fought with Sisera," Judges 5:14, 18, 19, 20. The subject treated of in 
this prophecy is concerning the combat of truth from good against the false from evil; 
by the king of Canaan, who reigned in Hazor, and by Sisera the prince of his army, 
who fought against Barak and Deborah, is signified the false of evil, and by Barak and
Deborah, the truth of good; and inasmuch as the tribes of Naphtali and Zebulon 
signified combat from the truth which is from good, the tribe of Naphtali, combat, and
the tribe of Zebulon, the conjunction of good and truth, therefore these two tribes only
were taken to fight, and not the rest, see Judges 4:6. That this combat was 
significative of such things, may appear from the prophecy pronounced by Deborah 
and Barak, which in the spiritual sense treats of the victory of truth from good over 
the false from evil, and of the purification and reformation of the church; here 
therefore from Machir shall descend the legislators, signifies that the truths of good 
shall flow from the good of life, for Machir signifies the same as Manasseh, inasmuch
as he was the son of Manasseh, Gen. 1. 23; Josh 13:31; and legislators signify those 
who are in the truths of good, and abstractedly, the truth of good; and from Zebulon 
them that draw the sceptre of the scribe, signifies intelligence from the conjunction of 
truth and good, Zebulon signifying here, as above, the conjunction of truth and good, 
and the sceptre of the scribe, intelligence. Zebulon was a people that devoted the soul 
to die, and Naphtali was upon the heights of the field, signifies combat by truths in the
natural man, which are from the spiritual man, and its influx and conjunction, the 
heights of the field signifying the interior things belonging to the spiritual man, from 
which the natural man combats; the kings came, they fought, then fought the kings of 
Canaan, signifies the falsities of evil, against which is combat; in Taanach near the 
waters of Megiddo, signifies those falsities and their quality; they took not any gain of
silver, signifies that they took and carried away nothing of truth from good, silver 
denoting truth from good; they fought from heaven, the stars from their courses 
fought with Sisera, signifies combat by the knowledges of truth and good, which are 
through heaven from the LORD, stars denoting such knowledges, and ways or courses 
denoting truths. AE 447.

286

Verse 15, So persecute them with your tempest, and terrify them with your storm. By 
tempest and storm, in this passage, is signified the dispersion of falsities and evils, 
because they who are in the falsities of evil are cast down into hell by a stormy wind. 
AE 419.

Verse 18. Whose name alone is JEHOVAH. For the signification of the name of 
JEHOVAH. See Psalm 79:9. Exposition.

287

PSALM 84

To him that presides; upon Gittith, a Psalm for the sons of Korah.

1. How amiable are your dwelling-places, O JEHOVAH of hosts!
2. My soul longs, yea, even faints for the courts of JEHOVAH; my heart and my 

flesh cry out for the living GOD.

3. Yea, the sparrow has found a house, and the swallow a nest for herself, where 
she may lay her young, even your altars, O JEHOVAH of hosts, my king and my
GOD!

4. Blessed are they that dwell in your house, that are continually praising you! 

Selah.

5. Blessed is the man whose strength is in you! in whose heart are your ways;
6. Who passing through the valley of weeping make it a well; and the early rain 

covers it with blessings.

7. They go from strength to strength; every one of them appears before GOD in 

Zion.

8. O JEHOVAH, GOD of Hosts! hear my prayer; give ear O GOD of Jacob! Selah.
9. Behold, O GOD, our shield, and look upon the face of your anointed.
10. For a day in your courts is better than a thousand; I had rather be a door keeper

in the house of my GOD, than dwell in the tents of wickedness.

11. For JEHOVAH GOD is a sun and a shield; JEHOVAH will give grace and glory; no

good thing will he withhold from them that walk uprightly.
12. O JEHOVAH of Hosts! blessed is the man who trusts in you!

The Internal Sense

Of his love and desire towards the church and heaven, verses 1 to 4; that they through 
confidence in the LORD will increase in truth and goodness, verges 5 to 7; that their 
happiness proceeds from trust in the LORD, verses 8 to 12.

EXPOSITION

Verse 1. How amiable are your dwelling-places, O JEHOVAH of Hosts! That the divine 
things, proceeding from the Divine human principle of the LORD are what are properly
called dwelling-places, and that hence heaven itself is called a dwelling-place, is also 
manifest from David, "He has sworn to JEHOVAH, he has vowed to the Mighty One of 
Jacob, I will not give sleep to mine eyes, until I have found a place for JEHOVAH, 
dwelling-places for the Mighty One of Jacob." Ps 132:2, 4 to 7. The Mighty One of 
Jacob is the LORD as to the Divine human principle. AC 9594.

By altars are here meant the heavens, for it is said, how amiable are your dwelling-
places, O JEHOVAH of Hosts! my soul longs, yea, even faints for the courts of 
JEHOVAH; my heart and my flesh cry out for the living GOD; by dwelling-places are 
meant the superior heavens, and by courts the inferior heavens, where there is 
entrance, which are also called altars from worship; and since all worship is from the 
good of love by truths, therefore it is said, your altars JEHOVAH of Hosts, my king and 

288

my GOD, for the LORD is called JEHOVAH from the Divine Good, and King and GOD 
from Divine Truth; and since the heavens are understood, it is also said blessed are 
the inhabitants of your house, the house of JEHOVAH GOD being heaven in every 
complex; the reason why it is also said, a bird has found a house, and a swallow a 
nest for herself is, because a bird signifies spiritual truth, and a swallow natural truth, 
by which there is worship; and since all truth by which there is worship is from the 
good of love, therefore it is premised, my heart and my flesh cry out to the living GOD;
by heart and by flesh is signified the good of love, and by crying out is signified 
worship from the delight of good. AE 391.

Verse 8. O JEHOVAH, GOD of Hosts! hear my prayer; give ear, O GOD of Jacob! In 
heaven they know nothing of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and when those names are 
read by man, they have no perception of any thing but of the LORD as to his Divine 
principle and his Divine Human. This being the case, it may plainly appear what is 
signified in the Word of the Old Testament, by the GOD of Jacob, and by the Holy One
of Israel, namely the LORD himself. AC 3305.

Verse 9. Behold, O GOD, our shield, and look upon the face of your anointed. The 
reason why kings were called the anointed of JEHOVAH, and why on that account it 
was sacrilegious to hurt them, was, because by the anointed of JEHOVAH is meant the 
LORD as to the Divine Human principle, for the LORD, when he was in the world, was 
Divine Truth itself as to the Human principle, and was Divine Good itself, as to the 
very esse of his life, which esse with man is called the soul derived from the FATHER, 
for he was conceived of JEHOVAH, and JEHOVAH in the Word is the Divine good of the 
Divine love, which is the esse of the life of all; hence it is, that the LORD alone was the
anointed of JEHOVAH, in very essence, and in very act, inasmuch as the Divine good, 
was in him, and the Divine truth proceeding from that good in his Human principle 
when he was in the world. AC 9954.

Verse 10. For a day in your courts is better than a thousand; I had rather be a door-
keeper in the house of my GOD, than dwell in the tents of wickedness. To be a door-
keeper in the house of GOD denotes to communicate abroad with good, which is the 
house of GOD. AC 8989.

By the court of the habitation is signified the ultimate heaven, and denoting the 
external of heaven; for there are three heavens, the inmost, the middle, and the 
ultimate; the inmost was represented by the inmost habitation, where was the ark of 
the testimony; the middle by the habitation out of the veil; the ultimate by the court. 
This heaven is called the court, because in it are they who are in the good of faith, and
not yet in the good of charity towards their neighbour; they who are in the good of 
charity are in the middle heaven. They who are in the ultimate heaven, which is called
the court, are called angelic spirits; but they who are in the middle heaven, are called 
spiritual angels; but they who are in the inmost heaven, celestial angels. The good 
itself of faith, which is the good of the ultimate heaven, is called also a court., for by it
man is introduced into the good of charity, which is the good of the middle heaven. 
AC 9741.

Verse 11. For JEHOVAH GOD is a sun and a shield; JEHOVAH will give grace and glory;
no good thing will he withhold from them that walk uprightly. That a shield denotes 
protection against evils and falsities, is manifest without explication. That a shield 

289

signifies in respect to the LORD protection against evils and falsities, and in respect to 
man confidence in the LORD, the reason is because it is the protection of the breast, 
and by the breast is signified good and truth, good because the heart is in it, and truth 
because the lungs are in it. AC 1788.

For JEHOVAH GOD is a sun, etc. The Divine Love and the Divine Wisdom appear in 
the spiritual world as a Sun. There are two worlds, the spiritual and the natural; and 
the spiritual world does not derive any thing from the natural world, nor the natural 
world from the spiritual world: they are altogether distinct, and communicate only by 
correspondences; the nature of which has elsewhere been abundantly shown. To 
illustrate this let us take an example: Heat in the natural world corresponds to the 
good of charity in the spiritual world, and light in the natural world corresponds to the
truth of faith in the spiritual world: who does not see that heat and the good of charity,
and light and the truth of faith, are totally distinct? At first sight they appear as 
distinct, as two totally different things: they appear so if it be enquired in thought, 
what has the good of charity in common with heat, and what has the truth of faith in 
common with light? when nevertheless spiritual heat is that good, and spiritual light is
that truth. These principles, although they are so distinct in themselves, nevertheless 
make one by correspondence; they make one thus, that whilst a man reads of heat and 
light in the Word, then the spirits and angels who are with him, instead of heat 
perceive charity, and instead of light faith. This example is adduced in order to show, 
that the two worlds, the spiritual and the natural, are so distinct, that they have nothing
in common with each other; but nevertheless are so created, that they communicate, 
yea are joined together, by correspondences.

Inasmuch as these two worlds are so distinct, it may clearly be seen, that the spiritual 
world is under a different sun from that of the natural world; for in the spiritual world 
there is equally heat and light, as in the natural world, but the heat there is spiritual, 
and in like manner the light, and spiritual heat is the good of charity, and spiritual 
light is the truth of faith. Now for as much as heat and light cannot derive their origin 
any otherwise than from a nun, it may appear, that in the spiritual world there is a sun 
different from that in the natural world, as also that the sun of the spiritual world is 
such in its essence, that spiritual heat and light may exist from it, and that the sun of 
the natural world is such in its essence, that natural heat may exist from it. Every thing
spiritual, which has relation to good and truth, can proceed from no other origin than 
the divine love and divine wisdom, for every good is of love, and every truth is of 
wisdom: that they are from no other source every wise man may see.

That sun is not the LORD himself, but from the LORD: it is the divine love and divine 
wisdom proceeding from him, which appear in that world as a sun; and for as much as
love and wisdom in the LORD are one, as was shown in the first part, it is said that that
sun is the Divine Love; for the divine wisdom is of the divine love, thus it also is love.
DLW 83, 84, 86.

Verse 11. Uprightly. By uprightness or entireness, in the internal sense of the Word, is 
signified Divine Truth in effect, which is a life according to the divine precepts. AC 
9905.

PSALM 85

To him that presides; a Psalm for the sons of Korah.

1.

JEHOVAH, you have been favourable to your land; you have brought back the 
captivity of Jacob.

2. You have forgiven the iniquity of your people; you have covered all their sins. 

Selah.

3. You have taken away all your anger; you have turned from the heat of your 

anger.

4. Turn us, O GOD of our salvation! and withdraw your indignation from us.
5. Will you be angry with us for ever? Will you prolong your anger to all 

generations?

6. Will you not again revive us; that your people may rejoice in you?
7. Show us your mercy, O JEHOVAH, and grant us your salvation.
8.

I will hear what GOD JEHOVAH will speak: truly, he will speak peace to his 
people, and to his saints; and they shall not turn again to folly.

9. Surely, his salvation is near to them that fear him; so that glory shall dwell in 

our land.

10. Mercy and truth have met together; justice and peace have kissed each other.
11. Truth shall spring out of the earth, and justice shall look down from heaven.
12. Yea, JEHOVAH shall give that which is good; and our land shall yield her 

increase.

13. Justice shall go before him, and shall set us in the way of his steps.

The Internal Sense

A prayer of the LORD to the FATHER, that after the judgement of the wicked a new 
church may be established, verses 1 to 7; a perception from his Divine principle that a
church will exist and nourish, which will acknowledge the LORD, walking in truths, 
verses 8 to 13.

EXPOSITION

Verse 6. Will you not again revive us; that your people may rejoice in you? The LORD 
in the Word is said to be alone alive, and is called the living JEHOVAH. Wherefore also 
they are said to be vivified or revived who receive faith in him: on the other hand they 
who do not receive faith in him are said to be dead. AC 290.

Verse 8. He will speak peace to his people, and to his saints; and they shall not turn 
again to folly. By JEHOVAH speaking peace to his people and to his saints, is signified 
that he will teach and give conjunction with himself, by the conjunction of good and 
of truth with them; by peace is signified each conjunction; by people are signified 
those who are in truths grounded in good, and by saints those who are in good by 
truths; that evil grounded in what is false, and what is false grounded in evil does not 
appertain to thorn, is signified by their not returning to folly; each conjunction is 
further described by mercy and justice meeting together, and justice and peace kissing

291

each other; mercy in this case signifies removal from falsities, whence they have 
truths, and justice signifies removal from evils whence they have goods; hence it is 
evident what is signified by justice and peace kissing each other. AE 365.

Verse 10. Mercy and truth have met together, justice and peace have kissed each 
other. Celestial men, when they are reformed and regenerated, are introduced to love 
to the LORD by charity towards their neighbour; hence it is evident that by mercy from
the LORD they understood nothing else but the reception of an influx of love towards 
him, and by truth an influx of charity towards the neighbour thence derived; but it is 
otherwise with the spiritual, who, when they are reformed and regenerated, are 
introduced by things that are of faith to charity towards their neighbour; wherefore 
when these latter are treated of, by mercy from the LORD is meant an influx of charity 
towards their neighbour, and by truth an influx of faith. Hence it may be manifest 
what the most ancient people understood by mercy and truth, which are so often 
mentioned in the Word. AC 3122.

That by kissing each other is signified presence and conjunction, is manifest from the 
signification of coming near, as denoting presence, and from the signification of 
kissing as denoting conjunction from affection; that this is signified by kissing, is 
manifest also from the following passage in the Word, "Serve JEHOVAH in fear, and 
kiss the son, lest he be angry;" Psalm 51:12; speaking of the LORD, whose Divine 
Human Principle is the Son; to kiss him is to be conjoined to him by faith grounded in 
love. AC 3574.

Inasmuch as the good of love and the truth of faith are in the closest conjunction, and 
one is not given without the other, therefore this form of speaking was customary 
amongst the ancients, because it was known to them that the good of love was 
inseparable from the truth of faith, and this being the case, those two principles are 
frequently in the Word spoken of conjointly. AC 6180.

Verse 11. Truth shall spring out of the earth, and justice shall look down from heaven.
There are no others who are called just in the Word, but those who from the LORD are 
in the good of charity, for the LORD alone is just, because alone justice, therefore man,
so much as he receives of good from the LORD, that is, so much of the LORD as he has 
belonging to him, and according to its quality, so far he is just and justified. The good 
of charity towards the neighbour is exterior good, which is signified by just, and the 
good of love to the LORD is interior good, which is signified by innocence. AC 9263.

292

PSALM 86

A Prayer of David.

Incline your ear, O JEHOVAH, answer me, for I am afflicted and needy.

1.
2. Preserve my soul, for I am holy; O you my GOD, save your servant who trusts 

in you.

3. Be merciful to me, O LORD! for to you do I cry all the day long.
4. Make glad the soul of your servant: for to you, O LORD, do I lift up my soul.
5. For you, O LORD, are good, and ready to forgive; plentiful in mercy to all them

that call upon you.

6. Give ear, O JEHOVAH, to my prayer; and attend to the voice of my 

supplications.
7.
In the day of my distress I will call upon you; for you will answer me.
8. Among the gods there is none like you, O LORD; nor any works like your.
9. All the nations whom you have made shall come, and bow themselves down 

before you, O LORD; and shall glorify your name.
10. For you are great, and do wonders; you alone are GOD!
11. Teach me your way, O JEHOVAH, that I may walk in your truth; unite my heart 

to fear your name.

12. I will praise you, O LORD my GOD, with my whole heart; and I will glorify 

your name for ever.

13. For great is your mercy towards me; and you have delivered my soul from the 

lowest hell.

14. O GOD, the proud have risen up against me, and the company of the violent 

have sought after my soul; they have not set you before them.

15. But you, O LORD, are a GOD of tender mercy and grace; slow to anger, and 

plentiful in mercy and truth.

16. O turn to me, and have mercy upon me; give your strength to your servant; 

and save the son of your handmaid.

17. Show me a sign for good, that they who hate me may see, and be ashamed; 

because you, O JEHOVAH, have been my helper and my comforter.

The Internal Sense

A prayer of the LORD to the FATHER to assist him in temptations, verses 1 to 8; because
thence arise the worship and confession of the LORD, verses 9 to 13; that the hells are 
in insurrection, verses 14, 15; that they will be overcome through his succour, verses 
16, 17.

Exposition

Verse 1. Incline your ear, O JEHOVAH, answer me, for I am afflicted and needy. That 
by the afflicted, or poor and needy, are not meant the poor and needy as to worldly 
wealth, but as to spiritual riches, is evident, since David speaks this of himself, 
wherefore also he said, "JEHOVAH incline your ear and answer." AE 238.

293

Verse 1. O JEHOVAH, answer me, etc. The expression to answer frequently occurs in 
the Word, and when predicated of the LORD, it signifies influx, inspiration, perception,
and information, likewise mercy and aid as in the following passages:—" In an 
acceptable time I answered you, and in the day of salvation I helped you," Isaiah 49:8.
"Answer me, when I cry, O GOD of my justice," Psalm 55:2. AC 471.

Verse 2. Preserve my soul, for I am holy; O you my GOD, save your servant who trusts
in you. Inasmuch as the LORD, as to Divine Truth, is meant by David, and since by 
David is meant Divine Truth, in like manner as by the prophets, therefore by servant 
also, in these passages, in the spiritual sense is meant what is subservient: he who is 
not acquainted with the spiritual sense of the Word, may believe, that not only David, 
but also the rest of the prophets, called themselves servants, by reason that they were 
all servants of the LORD, but still where servants are mentioned in the Word, in the 
spiritual sense is meant such as are subservient and efficient, for which reason also 
"Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon is called the servant of JEHOVAH," Jeremiah 25:9; 
but specifically by servant in the Word are meant those who receive Divine truth and 
teach it, since Divine truth is subservient, and by it effects Divine good; hence it is 
that throughout the Word mention is made of servants, and at the same time of elect, 
servants denote those who receive Divine truth and teach it, and the elect those who 
receive Divine good and lead to it. AE 4909.

Verse 8. Among the gods there is none like you, O JEHOVAH. The reason why it is so 
often said that JEHOVAH is above all gods, and that he is GOD of gods, was, because at 
that time several gods were worshiped, and the nations were distinguished by the 
gods whom they worshiped, and each nation believed that its own god was the 
supreme, and because hence a plurality of gods had a place in all minds, and because 
it was a matter of dispute which of them was the greatest, as may sufficiently appear 
from the historicals of the Word, this opinion had place also in the minds of the Jews, 
more than others, on which account it is so often said in the Word, that JEHOVAH is 
greater than all gods, and that he was the king and GOD of gods. AC 8301.

Verse 15. Tender mercy and grace—mercy and truth; see Psalm 85:10, 11, 
Exposition.

Verse 17. Show me a sign for good, that they who hate me, may see and be ashamed, 
etc. That to be signed, or to receive a sign, is not literally to be signed, but to be 
reduced to such a state as that their quality may be acknowledged, consequently that 
they may he conjoined with those who are in a similar state, and separated from those 
who are in a dissimilar state, is signified by being signed, and by a sign in the 
following passages, as in Ezekiel, "JEHOVAH said to the man clothed in linen, 
[garments,] pass through the midst of the city, through the midst of Jerusalem, and 
sign a sign upon the foreheads of the men that groan and sigh over all the 
abominations done in the midst thereof: and pass through the city after him, and 
smite, let not your eye spare, neither use clemency; but come not near any man, upon 
whom is the sign, Ezekiel 9:4, 5, 6; treating also concerning the separation of the good
from the evil. By being signed on the forehead, is signified the same as in this place in
the Apocalypse, namely, to be distinguished and separated from the evil, and to be 
conjoined to the good; the casting-out and damnation of the evil is also afterwards 
treated of; they who are in good are described by those that groan and sigh over all the
abominations done in the midst of the city of Jerusalem; they that groan and sigh over 

294

the abominations are they who are not in evils and falsities thence derived, groaning 
and sighing over them signifying aversion and grief for them, Jerusalem denoting the 
church, and the city denoting doctrine: the casting-out and damnation of the evil is 
afterwards described, by its being commanded to pass through the city after him and 
smite, and not to let their eye spare; to smite and to kill signifies to be damned, for 
spiritual death, which is damnation, is signified in the Word by natural death. So in 
Isaiah, "He shall come to gather together all nations and tongues, that they may come 
and see my glory, and I will set on them a sign;" Isaiah 66:18, 19; these words are said
concerning the LORD, and concerning the new church to be established by him, 
consequently concerning the new heaven and the new earth, as is evident from verse 
22 of that chapter; by gathering together all nations and tongues is signified the same 
as by "gathering together the elect from the four winds;" Matt 24:31; to gather 
together signifies to call to himself those who are his; nations signify those who are in
good, and tongues those who are in a life according to doctrine; to come and to see 
the glory of the LORD, signifies to be illustrated in divine truth, and to be thence in the 
fruition of heavenly joy, for the glory of the LORD signifies the divine truth, and 
illustration and joy therefrom; to set on them a sign signifies to distinguish and 
separate them from the evil, and to conjoin them to the good. AE 427.

295

PSALM 87

A Psalm, or song, for the sons of Korah.

JEHOVAH loves the gates of Zion more than all the dwellings of Jacob.

1. His foundation is upon the mountains of holiness!
2.
3. Glorious things are spoken in you, O city of GOD! Selah.
4.

I will make mention of Rahab and Babylon amongst them that know me; 
behold Philistia and Tyre, with Ethiopia! this man shall be born there.

5. And of Zion it shall be said, This man and that man shall be born in her; and 

6.

the Highest himself shall establish her.
JEHOVAH shall reckon, when he writes up the people, that this man was born 
there. Selah.

7. Both the singers and the dancers shall say, All my springs are in you.

The Internal Sense

Celebration of the LORD by the New Church, which will be collected from all parts, 
verses 1 to 7.

EXPOSITION

Verse 2. JEHOVAH loves the gates of Zion more than all the dwellings of Jacob. They 
who abide merely in the sense of the letter of the Word believe, that by Jacob is meant
all that people which was derived from Jacob, and therefore they apply to that people 
all those things which were spoken both historically and prophetically concerning 
Jacob; but the Word is divine, principally in this respect, that all and singular the 
things contained therein do not respect one nation or one people, but the universal 
human race. Hence also it is evident, that by Jacob in the Word is not meant Jacob, 
nor by Israel, Israel; but no one can know what is specifically understood by the one 
and by the other, unless by virtue of that sense which lies concealed under the letter, 
and contains in it the arcana of heaven. That by Jacob, therefore, is signified in the 
internal sense, the doctrine of natural truth, or, what is the same thing, those who are 
principled in that doctrine, of whatever nation they be; and that in a supreme sense the
LORD is understood, may be manifest from the passages where mention is made of 
Jacob. AE 208.

Inasmuch as by doors and gates are signified introduction, and specifically are 
signified introducing truths, which are truths grounded in good from the LORD, hence 
it is evident what are signified by gates in this passage. AE 208.

Verse 3. Behold Philistia and Tyre with Ethiopia. That by the Philistines are signified 
the interior truths of faith, is manifest from David, "Glorious things are spoken in you,
O city of GOD! I will make mention of Rahab and Babylon among them that know me,
also Philistia and Tyre, with Ethiopia," where the city of GOD is the doctrine of the 
truth of faith derived from the Word; Tyre denotes the knowledges of truth and good, 

296

in like manner Ethiopia; hence it is evident that Philistia denotes the science of the 
truths of faith. AC 9340.

Verse 5. And of Zion it shall be said, this man and that man shall be born in her. To be
born, signifies to be regenerated, for he who does not receive spiritual life, that is, 
who is not born again, or begotten anew by the LORD cannot come into heaven, which
the LORD teaches in John, "Verily, verily, I say to you, except a man be born again, he 
cannot see the kingdom of GOD, John 3:3.

Man is not born of his parents into spiritual life, but into natural life. Spiritual life 
consists in loving GOD above all things, and in loving his neighbour as himself, and 
this according to the precepts of faith, which the LORD taught in the Word: but natural 
life consists in loving ourselves and the world more than our neighbour, yea, more 
than GOD himself.

Every man is born of his parents into the evils of the love of self and of the world: for 
every evil, which by habit has contracted as it were a nature, is derived into the 
offspring; thus it descends successively from parents, from grandfathers, and from 
great grandfathers in a long series backwards; whence the derivation of evil at length 
becomes so great, that the whole of man's proper life is nothing else but evil. This 
continual derivation of evil is not broken and altered, except by the life of faith and 
charity from the LORD.

Man continually inclines to, and lapses into, what he derives from his hereditary 
principle: hence he confirms with himself that evil, and also superadds more of 
himself. These evils are altogether contrary to spiritual life, and destroy it; wherefore 
unless a man receives a new life, which is spiritual life, from the LORD, thus unless he 
is conceived anew, is born anew, is educated anew, that is, is created anew, he is 
damned, for he wills nothing else, and thence thinks nothing else, but what is of self 
and the world, in like manner as they do who are in hell.

No man can be regenerated unless he knows such things as belong to the new life, that
is, to the spiritual life; and the things which belong to the new life, which is the 
spiritual life, are truths which are to be believed and goods which are to be done, the 
former are of faith, the latter of charity. These things no one can know from himself, 
for man apprehends only those things which are obvious to the senses, from which he 
procures to himself a light (lumen) which is called natural light, by virtue whereof he 
sees nothing else than what relates to the world and to self, but not the things which 
relate to heaven and to GOD. These he must learn from revelation: as, that the LORD, 
who is GOD from eternity, came into the world to save the human race; that he has all 
power in heaven and in earth; that the all of faith and the all of charity, thus all truth 
and good, is from him; that there is a heaven, and that there is a hell; and that man is 
to live to eternity, in heaven, if he have done well, in hell, if he have done evilly.

These and several other things belong to faith, and ought to be known by the man who
is to be regenerated; for he who knows them, may think them, afterwards will them, 
and lastly do them, and so have new life: whilst he who does not know that the LORD 
is the Saviour of the human race, cannot have faith in him, love him, and thus do good
for the sake of him. He who does not know that all good is from him, cannot think 
that his own salvation is from him, still less can he will it to be so, thus he cannot live 

297

from him: he who does not know that there is a hell and that there is a heaven, nor that
there is eternal life, cannot even think about the life of heaven, nor apply himself to 
receive it; and so in other cases.

Every one has an internal man and an external man; the internal is what is called the 
spiritual man, and the external is what is called the natural man: and each is to be 
regenerated that the man may be regenerated. With the man who is not regenerated, 
the external or natural man rules, and the internal serves; but with the man who is 
regenerated, the internal or spiritual man rules, and the external serves: whence it is 
manifest that the order of life is inverted with man from his birth, namely, that that 
principle serves which ought to rule, and that that principle rules which ought to 
serve. In order that man may be saved this order must be inverted; and this inversion 
can by no means exist, but by regeneration from the LORD.

What it is for the internal man to rule and the external to serve, and vice versa, may be
illustrated thus: if a man places all his good in voluptuousness, in gain, and in pride, 
and has delight in hatred and revenge, and inwardly in himself seeks for reasons 
which confirm such evils, then the external man rules and the internal serves: but 
when a man perceives good and delight in thinking and willing well, sincerely, and 
justly, and in outwardly speaking and doing in like manner, then the internal man rules
and the external serves.

The internal man is first regenerated by the LORD, and afterwards the external, and the
latter by means of the former: for the internal man is regenerated by thinking those 
things which are of faith and charity, but the external by a life according to them. This
is understood by the words of the LORD, "Unless a man be born of water and the spirit
he cannot enter the kingdom of GOD," John 3:5. Water, in the spiritual sense, is the 
truth of faith, and the spirit is a life according to it.

The man who is regenerated is, as to his internal man, in heaven, and is an angel there
with the angels, amongst whom he also comes after death; he is then able to live the 
life of heaven, to love the LORD, to love his neighbour, to understand truth, to relish 
good, and to perceive the blessedness thence derived. H. D. 173—182.

Verse 7. All my springs are in you. By a spring, or fountain, is meant the Word; and by
springs, or fountains, are meant divine truths from the Word. AE 483.

298

PSALM 88

A song, or Psalm for the sons of Korah. To him that presides; upon Mahalath; 
Leannoth, an instructive Psalm of Heman, the Ezrahite.

1. O JEHOVAH, GOD of my salvation, day and night do I cry before you.
2. Let my prayer come before you, incline your ear to my cry.
3. For my soul is full of evils, and my life draws near to hell.
4.

I am counted with them that go down into the pit; I am as a man that has no 
strength;
I am prostrate among the dead, like the slain that lie in the grave, whom you 
remember no more, and who are cut off from your hand.

5.

6. You have laid me in the lowest pit, in dark places,— in the deeps.
7. Your wrath presses upon me, and you afflict me with all your breakers. Selah.
8. You have removed mine acquaintance far from me; you have made me an 

abomination to them; I am shut up, and I cannot come forth.

9. Mine eye languishes by reason of affliction; O JEHOVAH, I have called all the 

day upon you; I have stretched out my hands to you.

10. Will you show wonders to the dead? Shall the dead arise and praise you? 

Selah.

11. Shall your mercy be declared in the grave? Your truth in destruction?
12. Shall your wonders be known in darkness? And your justice in the land of 

forgetfulness?

13. But to you have I cried, O JEHOVAH,—and in the morning shall my prayer 

come before you.

14. O JEHOVAH, why cast you off my soul? Why hide you your face from me?
15. I have been afflicted and ready to die from my youth up; I suffer your terrors; I

am distracted.

16. Your fierce wrath goes over me; your terrors have cut me off.
17. They surround me daily like waters; they compass me about together.
18. Lover and friend have you removed far from me; darkness is my companion.

The Internal Sense

The LORD to the FATHER in temptation, even to despair that he is in a manner 
overcome by the internals, verses 1 to 9, 13 to 18; that GOD has no glory from the 
hells, verses 10 to 12.

Exposition

Verses 4 and 6. I am counted with them that go down to the pit; you have laid me in 
the lowest pit, in dark places, in the deeps. That hereby is signified among falsities, is 
manifest from the signification of pits, as denoting falsities; the reason why pits 
denote falsities is because men who have been in false principles, after death are kept 
for some time in the lowest earth, until falsities be removed from them; the places in 
that earth are called pits; hence it is that by pits, in the abstract sense, are signified 
falsities. AC 4728.

299

Verses 5, 6, 7, 12. I am prostrate among the dead, like the slain that lie in the grave, 
whom you remember no more; and who are cut off from your hand. You have laid me 
in the lowest pit, in dark places, in the deeps. Your wrath presses upon me, and you 
afflict me with all your breakers. Shall your wonders be known in darkness; and your 
justice in the land of forgetfulness? The subject here treated of is concerning 
temptations, in the supreme sense, concerning the temptations of the LORD, which are 
described as to their quality, namely that he seems to himself as if in hell, amongst the
damned; for the temptations, which the LORD sustained, were so severe and 
enormous; wherefore he was counted with them that go down into the pit, by which is 
signified that he seemed to himself as in hell, a pit denoting hell; he became as a man 
that has no strength, signifies that he then seemed to himself as without power, for 
temptations immerse man into falsities and evils, which have no power; prostrate 
amongst the dead, signifies amongst those who have nothing of truth and good, and 
are therefore rejected; amongst the slain buried in the grave, signifies as those who 
are in falsities grounded in evil; slain signify those who perish by falsities; a grave 
signifies hell by reason that they who are in hell are spiritually dead; whom you 
remember no more, and who are cut off from your hand, signifies deprived of all truth 
and good; you have laid me in the lowest pit, signifies in the places of hell inhabited 
by such; in dark places, signifies as in falsities; in deeps, signifies as in evils. Now 
follows prayer arising from grief, that he might be delivered from temptation; and 
amongst the causes was also this, shall your mercy be declared in the grave and truth 
in destruction, signifies that in hell, where and whence are evils and falsities, divine 
good and divine truth cannot be preached; mercy is the divine good of the divine love,
and truth is the divine truth of the divine wisdom; grave is hell, where and whence are
evils, and destruction is hell, where and whence are falsities; from these 
considerations it is also evident that by a grave is meant hell; for this reason, that they 
who are in hell are spiritually dead. AE 659.

Verse 14. O JEHOVAH, why cast you off my soul? why hide you your face from me? 
From this consideration it may also be known what is signified by hiding or 
concealing the face, when spoken of JEHOVAH or the LORD, namely: that it is to leave 
man in his own selfhood, and thence in the evils and falsities which flow from that 
selfhood; for man considered in himself is nothing but evil and the false principles 
thence derived, and he is withhold from them by the LORD that he may be in good, 
which is effected by an elevation above the selfhood, hence it may be manifest that by
hiding and concealing the face, when it relates to the LORD, is signified to leave man 
in evils and falsities. AE 412.

As this Psalm is descriptive of the most direful temptations it may be well to explain, 
in this place, the cause and uses of temptation. They alone who are regenerated 
undergo spiritual temptations, for spiritual temptations are pains of the mind, induced 
by evil spirits, with those who are in goods and truths. Whilst these spirits excite the 
evils which are with such persons, there arises an anxiety which is that of temptation; 
man knows not whence it comes, because he is unacquainted with this its origin.

For there are evil spirits and good spirits attendant on every man; the evil spirits are in
his evils, and the good spirits are in his goods: when the evil spirits approach they 
draw forth his evils, and the good spirits, on the contrary, draw forth his goods, 
whence a collision and combat takes place, from which the man perceives an interior 
anxiety, which is temptation. Hence it is plain that temptations are not from heaven, 

300

but are induced by hell: which is also according to the faith of the church, which 
teaches that GOD tempts no one.

Interior anxieties also take place with those who are not in goods and truths, but these 
are natural anxieties, not spiritual ones: they are distinguished by this, that natural 
anxieties have worldly things for their objects, but spiritual anxieties have heavenly 
things for their objects.

In temptations, the dominion of good over evil, or of evil over good, is what is 
contended for. The evil which desires to have the dominion, is in the natural or 
external man, and the good is in the spiritual or internal; if good conquer, then the 
spiritual man has the dominion.

Those combats are fought by means of the truths of faith, which are from the Word; it 
is from these that man must fight against evils and falsities, for if he combats from 
any other principles than these, he does not conquer, because the LORD is not in any 
other principles. For as much as the combat is fought by means of the truths of faith, 
therefore man is not admitted into that combat before he is in the knowledges of good 
and truth, and has thence obtained some spiritual life; wherefore those combats do not
take place with man, until he has arrived at years of maturity.

If man falls in temptation, his state after it becomes worse than his state before it, 
inasmuch as evil has thereby acquired power over good, and the false over truth 
inasmuch as at this day faith is rare because there is no charity, the church being at its 
end, therefore few at this day are admitted into any spiritual temptations: hence it is 
that it is scarcely known what they are, and to what end they conduce.

Temptations conduce to acquire for good the dominion over evil, and for the truth the 
dominion over the false; also to confirm truths, and to conjoin them to goods, and at 
the same time to disperse evils and the falsities thence derived.They conduce likewise 
to open the internal spiritual man, and to subject the natural thereto: as also to break 
the loves of self and the world, and to subdue the cravings which proceed from them. 
When these things are effected, man acquires illustration and perception respecting 
what truth and good are, and what the false and evil are; whence man obtains 
intelligence and wisdom, which afterwards continually increase.

The LORD alone combats for man in temptations; if a man does not believe that the 
LORD alone combats and conquers for him, he then only undergoes an external 
temptation, which does not conduce to his salvation. NJHD 187—195.

PSALM 89

An instructive Psalm of Ethan the Ezrahite,

1.

I will sing of the mercies of JEHOVAH for ever; with my mouth will I make 
known your truth to all generations,

2. For I have said, mercy shall be built up for ever; you shall establish your truth 

in the heavens.
I have made a covenant with my chosen; I have sworn to David my servant:

3.
4. Your seed will I establish for ever; and I will build up your throne to all 

generations. Solah.

5. And the heavens shall praise your wonders, O JEHOVAH; your truth also in the 

congregation of the holy ones.

6. For who in the skies can be compared to the LORD? Who among the sons of 

the gods can be like JEHOVAH?

7. GOD is greatly to be feared in the assembly of the saints; and to be had in 

reverence of all them that are round about him.

8. O JEHOVAH, GOD of hosts! who is strong like you, O JAH; or to your truth 

round about you?

9. You rule the raging of the sea; when the waves thereof arise, you still them.
10. You have broken Rahab in pieces as one that is slain; you have scattered your 

enemies with the arm of your strength.

11. The heavens are yours, the earth also is yours; as to the world and the fullness 

thereof you have founded them.

12. You have created the north and the south; Tabor and Hermon shall rejoice in 

your name.

13. You have a mighty arm; strong is your hand; high is your right hand.
14. Justice and judgement are the support of your throne; mercy and truth shall go 

before your face.

15. Blessed are the people that know the joyful sound; they shall walk, O 

JEHOVAH, in the light of your countenance.

16. In your name shall they rejoice all the day; and in your justice shall they be 

exalted.

17. For you are the glory of their strength; and through your favour our horn shall 

be exalted.

18. For JEHOVAH is our shield, and the Holy One of Israel is our king.
19. Then you did speak in vision to your Holy One, and did say, I have laid help 

upon one that is mighty; I have exalted one chosen out of the people.
20. I have found David my servant; with my holy oil have I anointed him:
21. With whom my hand shall be established; mine arm also shall strengthen him.
22. The enemy shall not oppress him, nor shall the son of iniquity afflict him.
23. I will beat down his adversaries before his face; and smite them that hate him.
24. But my truth and my mercy shall be with him; and in my name shall his horn 

be exalted.

25. I will set his hand over the sea, and his right hand over the rivers.
26. He shall call upon me, saying, You are my FATHER, my GOD, and the rock of 

my salvation!

27. I also will make him my first born, high over the kings of the earth.

302

28. My mercy will I keep for him for ever more; and my covenant with him shall 

stand firm.

29. His seed also will I establish for ever; and his throne as the days of heaven.
30. If his sons forsake my law, and walk not in my judgements;
31. If they profane my statutes, and keep not my commandments;
32. I will visit their transgression with a rod, and their iniquity with blows.
33. Yet my mercy will I not take from him, nor act falsely against my truth.
34. My covenant will I not break; nor alter that which is gone forth out of my lips.
35. Once have I sworn by my holiness, that I will not lie to David.
36. His seed shall be for ever, and his throne as the sun before me.
37. It shall be established for ever as the moon, and as a faithful witness in the 

skies. Selah.

38. But them have cast off and abhorred; you have been angry with your anointed.
39. You have abhorred the covenant of your servant; you have profaned his crown 

by casting it down to the ground.

40. You have broken down all his fences, you have made his fortresses a ruin.
41. All that pass by the way plunder him; he is a reproach to his neighbours.
42. You have exalted the right hand of his adversaries; you have made all his 

enemies to rejoice.

43. You have also turned the edge of his sword; and have not enabled him to stand

in the battle.

44. You have made his lustre to cease; and have cast his throne down to the 

ground.

45. The days of his youth have you shortened; you have covered him with shame. 

Selah.

46. How long, O JEHOVAH, will you hide yourself? For ever? How long shall your 

wrath burn like fire?

47. Remember how short my time is! to what vanity you have created all the sons 

of man!

48. What man is he that lives and shall not see death? Shall he deliver his soul 

from the hand of hell? Selah.

49. Where are your former mercies, O LORD? You did swore to David in your 

truth.

50. Remember, O LORD, the reproach of your servants; which I bear in my bosom 

from so many peoples;

51. Wherewith your enemies have reproached, O JEHOVAH, with which they have 

reproached the footsteps of your anointed.

52. Blessed be JEHOVAH for ever more! Amen, and Amen.

The Internal Sense

That all Divine Truth is from the LORD, verses 1, 2; that there is union with the Divine
human essence, therefore from him proceeds Divine Truth, verses 3 to 5; thus all 
power is the LORD'S, verses 6 to 10, 13; that all things of heaven and the church are 
from him, verses 11 to 14; blessed is he whose trust is in the LORD, verses 15 to 18; 
the FATHER to the LORD, or the Divine being to his human essence, that from union 
with him comes omnipotence against the hells, verses 19 to 25; that there shall be an 
eternal union with him, verses 26 to 29, 35 to 37; that although they of the church 
should fall off, nevertheless there shall be an eternal union with him, verses 30 to 37; 
of the Jewish nation that they have destroyed conjunction with him, because they have

303

destroyed the church, verses 38 to 42; that they have altogether rejected him, verses 
43 to 45; a prayer to the FATHER, that unless he assists, no one can have life eternal, 
verses 46 to 48; unless union be effected, verse 49; otherwise the hells would prevail, 
verses 50, 51; that he would assist, verse 52.

EXPOSITION

Verses 1, 2. I will sing of the mercies of JEHOVAH for ever; with my mouth will I make 
known your truth to all generations: for I have said, mercy shall be built up for ever; 
you shall establish your truth in the heavens. See the signification of mercy and truth, 
and the reason, why they are mentioned together in the Exposition of Psalm 85:10.

Verses 4, 5, 20, 21, 22, 24, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 36, 37, 38. That by David is not here 
meant David, but the LORD as to his royalty, which is the Divine spiritual principle, 
and is called Divine Truth, is very evident from those things which are here said of 
David, namely: "that his seed and his throne shall be as the days of heaven, and as the 
sun and moon for ever, that he shall set his hand over the sea, and his right hand over 
the rivers, and that he shall call JEHOVAH his Father, and that his first begotten shall be
high over the kings of the earth," and several other things which cannot be said of 
David, his sons and throne; that by David is meant the LORD in the Word, see above 
AE 205; but to proceed to particulars; I have made a covenant with mine elect, I have 
sworn to David my servant, signifies the union of his Divine principle with the 
human; to make a covenant signifies to be united; to swear signifies to confirm union;
the expression elect is predicated of good, and servant of truth; for ever will I 
establish your seed, and will build your throne to all generations, signifies Divine 
truth, and heaven and the church from him; seed is Divine truth and those who receive
it, and throne is heaven and the church; you did speak in vision to your holy one, 
signifies a prophetic arcanum concerning the LORD; I have laid help upon one that is 
mighty, I have exalted one chosen from the people, signifies Divine truth by which 
Divine good produces all operation; it is called aid more than the powerful, and in 
another place the right hand of JEHOVAH; Divine majesty and power derived from it is
signified by exaltation of the elect from the people; I have found David my servant, 
with the oil of holiness I have anointed him, signifies the LORD as to the Divine human
principle, and union with the Divine principle itself, which union is called 
glorification in the Word of the New Testament, and this union is meant by being 
anointed with the oil of holiness, for the oil of holiness signifies the Divine good of 
the Divine love, and to be anointed signifies to be united to the Divine truth which 
was of the LORD'S human principle when he was in the world; with whom my hand 
shall be established, also mine arm shall strengthen him, signifies thence 
omnipotence, hand signifying the omnipotence of truth from good, and arm 
signifying the omnipotence of good by truth; I will beat down his adversaries before 
his face, and smite them that hate him, signifies combats with victory against falsities 
and evils, thus against the hells; I will set his hand over the sea, and his right hand 
over the rivers, signifies the extension of his dominion and his kingdom over all 
things of heaven and the church, for seas and rivers are the ultimates of heaven, and 
ultimates signify all things; he shall call upon me, you are my Father, my GOD, and 
the rock of my salvation, signifies the Divine human principle which is the Son of 
GOD, who was conceived and afterwards begotten of him, and whereas hence the 
LORD'S human principle had Divine truth and Divine power, it is also called GOD and 
the rock of salvation; also I will make him my first begotten high over the kings of the 

304

earth, signifies that he is above all good and truth of heaven and the church, because 
the goods and truths of heaven and the church are from him; and my covenant shall be
established with him, signifies eternal union; I will make his seed for ever, and his 
throne as the days of heaven, signifies here as above, the days of heaven being the 
states of the whole heaven, which are from his Divine principle; I have sworn once by
my holiness I will not lie to David, signifies eternal confirmation, because from the 
Divine principle, concerning the LORD, and concerning the union of his Human 
principle, with the Divine itself. AE 684.

Verses 3, 4, 5. I have made a covenant with my chosen, I have sworn to David my 
servant. Your seed will I establish for ever, and build up your throne to all 
generations. And the heavens shall praise your wonders, O JEHOVAH, your truths also
in the congregation of the holy ones. By David is here meant the LORD as to royalty, 
see above AE 205; who is called elect from good, and servant from truth; to make a 
covenant and to swear to him signifies the union of his Divine principle with his 
Human, to make a covenant is to be united, and to swear is to confirm it; I will 
strengthen your seed for ever, signifies the eternity of Divine truth from him; I will 
keep mercy for ever, signifies the eternity of Divine good from him; my covenant shall
be established, signifies the union of the Divine and Human principles in him. AE 
701.

That by David in the Word is meant the LORD as to royalty, which is the Divine truth 
in the LORD'S spiritual kingdom, see above, AE 205; hence by his seed is signified that
Divine truth which appertains to those who are in truth and in good, thus also who are 
in the truths of doctrine from the Word, for the truths of doctrine from the Word, and 
all things of the Word are from good; and since they are meant by the seed of David, 
thus also in the abstract sense by it is meant the truth of the Word, or the truth of 
doctrine from the Word; that by the seed of David is not meant his posterity, may be 
obvious to every one, where it is said "that his seed shall be multiplied as the host of 
heaven and as the sand of the sea, and that it should be established for ever, and that 
his throne should be built from generation to generation, and that it should be as the 
days of heaven and as the sun;" which cannot be said of the seed of David, that is, his 
posterity, and of his throne; for where now is his seed and his throne? but all those 
things are in agreement when by David is meant the LORD, by his throne heaven and 
the church, and by his seed the truth of heaven and the church. AE 768.

By the seed of David is not meant the posterity from David as a father, for this was 
not so much multiplied, and not of so much importance, that it should be multiplied as
the army of the heavens, and as the sand of the sea; but by David in this passage, and 
also in other places, is meant the LORD as to Divine truth, thus by his seed they who 
are regenerated or born of the LORD, and in the abstract sense those things which 
appertain to them from the LORD, which are the truths of faith and the good of charity. 
AC 10249.

To make a covenant with the elect, and to swear to David, denotes irrevocable 
confirmation or eternal truth; to make a covenant has respect to the Divine good, to 
swear has respect to the Divine truth. AC 2842.

Verse 8. Unto you, O JAH! see Psalm 68:4. Exposition.

305

Verse 11. The heavens are yours, the earth also is yours; as to the world and the 
fullness thereof you have founded them. Where fullness also denotes truth and good, 
earth denotes the church in a specific sense; world denotes the church in a universal 
sense; JEHOVAH founded the world upon the seas, denotes upon those things which are
of science, AC 28; and founding it upon the river denotes upon those things which are
of intelligence, AC 305; that it is not meant that JEHOVAH founded the world upon the 
sea and established it upon the rivers, who cannot see? for the world is not founded 
and established thereon; wherefore every considerate person may see, that by seas and
rivers something else is signified and that this something else is spiritual and is the 
internal principle of the Word. AC 6297.

Verse 12. You have created the north and the south. The north here denotes those who 
are more remote from the light of good and truth, and the south those who are near 
thereto. AC 3708.

By heaven and earth are meant the superior and inferior heavens, in like manner the 
internal and external church; by world and the fullness thereof are meant the heavens 
and the church in general as to good and as to truth; by world heaven and the church 
as to good, and by the fullness thereof heaven and the church as to truth; and whereas 
the latter or those who are in them are in the north and in the south, and since the 
south is at the right hand of the LORD, therefore it is said the north and the right hand;
and since Divine truth united with Divine good is such in those quarters from the 
foundation of the world, as was said above, therefore it is said, you have founded and 
created them. AE 600.

Verse 14. Justice and judgement are the support of your throne. Justice denotes the 
good which is of mercy, and judgement denotes the truth which is of faith, hence it is 
said also mercy and truth. AC 9857.

Verse 15. Blessed are the people that know the joyful sound; they shall walk, O 
JEHOVAH, in the light of your countenance. What is here meant by the countenance (or
faces) of JEHOVAH, every one may comprehend, namely: the Divine being or 
principle, and whatever is of the Divine being or principle, thus mercy, peace, and all 
good, but in the universal sense, the Divine truth, since in the Divine truth is all good; 
and with man and with angel there is Divine good in Divine truth, and without the 
latter there is not the former; for truth is the recipient of good, thus also of mercy and 
of peace: hence now it follows, that where Divine good is not in Divine truth, there 
the faces of JEHOVAH are not. AC 10579.

Verse 17. For you are the glory of their strength, and through your favour our horn 
shall be exalted. In this passage our horn and his horn manifestly denotes the power 
of truth; the subject here treated of is concerning the LORD'S spiritual kingdom; the 
Holy One of Israel our king, denotes that Divine truth is the LORD'S; to place the hand
over the sea and the right hand over the rivers, denotes that strength is in the sciences,
and knowledges of truth. AC 2832.

Verse 20. I have found David my servant; with my holy oil have I anointed him. By 
David is here meant the LORD, as also in other places; the oil of holiness with which 
JEHOVAH anointed him, is the Divine good of the Divine love; that it is the LORD who 
is here meant by David, is evident from what goes before, and from what follows in 

306

that Psalm, for it is said, "You speak in visions concerning your Holy One; I will set 
his hand over the sea, and his right hand over the rivers; he shall call me my FATHER; I
will also give him my first-born, high over the kings of the earth; I will set his seed to 
eternity, and his throne as the days of heaven." AC 9954.

Verse 25. I will set his hand also over the sea, and his right hand over the rivers. This 
is said of David, by whom is there meant the LORD; the power of the LORD even to the
ultimates of heaven and the church; thus, over the whole heaven, and over every thing
of the church, is signified by setting the hand over the sea, and the right hand over 
the river; power is signified by the hand and the right hand, and the ultimates of the 
heaven and the church by sea and by rivers; these ultimates were bounded by two 
seas and by two rivers, which were the boundaries of the land of Canaan; the two seas
were the sea of Egypt and the sea of the Philistines, where are Tyre and Sidon; and the
two rivers were Euphrates and Jordan. AE 518.

Verses 36 and 37. His seed shall endure for ever, and his throne as the sun before me. 
It shall be established for ever as the moon, and as a faithful witness in the clouds. 
Selah. These things are said of the LORD; and by seed that shall be for ever, is 
signified the divine truth which is from him; by throne, which shall be as the sun and 
as the moon, is signified heaven and the church, as to the good of love and as to the 
truth of faith, by throne, heaven, and the church; by being as the sun as to the good of 
love, and by being as the moon as to the truth of faith; a faithful witness in the clouds,
signifies that he is divine truth, for witness, when predicated of the LORD, signifies 
that which proceeds from him; and since this is of him, it witnesses concerning him. 
AE 594.

Verse 27. I also will make him my first born, high over the kings of the earth. All are 
called first born, who are principled in love to the LORD and in charity towards their 
neighbour, and these were also represented by the first born in the Jewish church, that 
is, were understood in a respective sense, because the LORD is the first-born, and they 
are his likenesses and images. That the LORD, as to the divine Human principle, is the 
first-born, is manifest from David in these words, "He shall call me, you are my 
FATHER, my GOD, and the rock of my salvation, and I will make him my first-born, 
high over the kings of the earth. AC 3325.

Verse 28. And my covenant shall stand firm with him. Speaking of the LORD; my 
covenant shall stand firm with him denotes the union of the Divine principle itself, 
and the Divine Human; thus also it denotes the Word, for the LORD as to the Divine 
Human was made flesh, the reason why the Divine truth or the Word is a covenant or 
conjunction is because it is the divine principle from the LORD, thus the LORD himself;
wherefore when the Word is received by man, the LORD himself is received; hence it 
is evident, that by the Word is effected the conjunction of the LORD with man; and 
whereas the Word is the conjunction of the LORD with man, it is also the conjunction 
of heaven with man, for heaven is called heaven from the Divine truth proceeding 
from the LORD, consequently from the Divine being or principle, whence they who are
in heaven are said to be in the LORD. AC 9396.

Verse 35. Once have I sworn by my holiness that I will not lie to David. David here 
denotes the LORD; covenant in this passage denotes the Divine good, the declaration 

307

of the lips denotes the Divine truth, and this by reason of the marriage between good 
and truth, which is in every part of the Word. AC 2242.

Verse 39. You have abhorred the covenant of your servant, you have profaned his 
crown by casting it down to the ground. Anointed denotes the LORD; anger denotes a 
state of temptation, in which he was when in combats with the hells; lamentation on 
the occasion is described by anger and damnation, as the last lamentation of the LORD 
on the cross that he was forsaken; for the cross was the last of temptation, or of 
combat with the hells, and after that last he put on Divine good, and thereby united his
Divine Human principle to his divine principle itself which was in himself. AC 9930.

Verse 50. Which I bear in my bosom from so many peoples. That the bosom denotes 
that very self which is of man, thus man's selfhood, and hence appropriation by 
conjunction of love, is manifest from the following passages: "My prayer shall return 
into mine own bosom," Psalm 35:13, denoting that it would return to himself; again, 
"Remember, LORD, the reproach of your servants, that I bear in my bosom from so 
many peoples," denoting belonging to himself, as his own property. AC 6960.

Verse 52. Blessed be JEHOVAH for ever more. Amen and Amen. It was usual with the 
ancients to say, blessed is JEHOVAH, by which they understood that from him is all 
blessing, that is, all good, and it was also a form of thanksgiving that the LORD 
blessed, and that he has blessed. AC 1096.

Verse 52. Amen and Amen; for the signification of Amen, see Psalm 41:13, Exposition.

308

PSALM 90

A prayer of Moses, the man of God.

1. O LORD, you have been our habitation in all generations.
2. Before the mountains were brought forth, yea, before the earth and the world 

were formed, even from eternity to eternity, you are GOD!
3. You turn man to destruction, and say, Return, you sons of man.
4. For a thousand years in your eyes are but as yesterday when it is past, and as a 

watch in the night.

5. You sweep them away as with a flood; they are as asleep; in the morning they 

are like grass which grows up.

6. Which in the morning flourishes, and grows up; in the evening is cut down 

and withers.

7. For we are consumed by your anger, and by your wrath are we troubled.
8. You have placed our iniquities before you, our secret sins in the light of your 

countenance.

9. For all our days pass away through your wrath; we consume our years like a 

breath.

10. As to the days of our years, they are three-score years and ten; and if by reason
of strength they be fourscore years, yet is their pride labour and sorrow, for it 
is soon cut off, and we flee away.

11. Who knows the power of your anger? According to your fear so is your wrath.
12. So teach us to number our days, that we may acquire a heart of wisdom,
13. Return, O JEHOVAH, how long will you be angry? And let it repent you 

concerning your servants.

14. O satisfy us in the morning with your mercy! that we may rejoice and be glad 

all our days.

15. Make us glad according to the days in which you have afflicted us, according 

to the years in which we have seen evil.

16. Let your work appear to your servants, and your glory to their sons.
17. Let the favour of the LORD our GOD be upon us; and establish you for us the 

work of our hands, yea, establish you the work of our hands.

The Internal Sense

That man is nothing of himself, but only the LORD, verses 1 to 6; that the church must 
perish, verses 7 to 11; unless the LORD restore it, verses 12, 13; by his coming, verse 
14; whence proceeds salvation, verses 14 to 17.

EXPOSITION

Verse 1. O LORD, you have been our habitation in all generations. Inasmuch as 
habitation signifies heaven, where the LORD is, it also signifies the good of love and 
faith, for these constitute heaven; and whereas all good is from the LORD, and heaven 
is called heaven from love and faith in the LORD, hence also habitation in the supreme 
sense signifies the LORD. AC 9481.

309

Verse 2. Before the mountains were brought forth, yea, before the earth and the world 
were formed, even from eternity to eternity you are GOD. By the mountains, the earth, 
and the world, here spoken of, is not meant the creation of the world, but the 
establishment of the church; for mountains, in the Word, signify celestial love, thus 
the church, in which that love is; the earth also, and the world, signify the church. AC 
10248.

By mountains are signified those who dwell on mountains in the heavens, being those 
who are in celestial good; but by the earth and the world is signified the church, 
consisting of those who are in truths and in goods. AE 741.

Verse 4. For a thousand years in your eyes are but as yesterday when it is past, and 
as a watch in the night; where a thousand years denotes what is without time, 
consequently what is eternal, which is the infinite of time. AC 2575.

In this passage, yesterday, and the day before yesterday, denotes formerly, or the time 
past. Now, whereas by yesterday, and the day before yesterday, is signified the time 
past, and the subject treated of, in the supreme sense, is concerning the LORD, it is 
evident by from yesterday, and the day before yesterday, is signified from eternity. AC 
6983.

Verse 4. For a thousand years in your eyes are but as yesterday. In this passage, by a 
thousand is not signified a thousand, but much, without any number. AC 8715.

Verse 6. Which in the morning flourishes and grows up; in the evening it is cut down. 
In the Word throughout mention is made of the evening, and by it is signified the last 
time of the church, and also its first time,.—the last with those with whom the church 
ceases, and the first with those with whom it commences; hence primarily by evening 
is signified the coming of the LORD, for then was the end of the former church, and 
the beginning of a new one; the first state of which is called evening, because the man 
of the church begins from obscure light, and advances to clear light, which to him is 
morning. AC 7844.

Verse 8. You have placed our iniquities before you, our secret sins in the light of your 
countenance. The light of your countenance, is the light, of heaven from the LORD as a
sun; (that the effulgence of the divine love and wisdom proceeding from the Lord, 
appears as a sun encircling his Divine Person, see Psalm 84:11, Exposition;) inasmuch
as this light is essential divine truth, from which are all intelligence and wisdom, 
therefore the quality of every thing that comes into it is manifested as in clear day; 
hence it is, that when the evil come into this light, they appear altogether agreeable to 
their real quality, deformed and monstrous according to the evils concealed in them, 
from which it is evident what is signified by the above words. AE 412.

Verse 10. The days of our years are threescore years and ten, etc. Man, from first 
infancy to extreme old age, undergoes several states as to his interiors, which are of 
intelligence and wisdom; the first, state is from nativity to the fifth year of his age; 
this state is a state of ignorance, and of innocence in ignorance, and is called infancy; 
the second - state is from the fifth year of age even to the twentieth; this state is a state
of instruction and of science, and is called boyhood: the third state is from the 
twentieth year of age to the sixtieth, which state is a state of intelligence, and is called 

310

adolescence, youth, and manhood: the fourth or last state is from the sixtieth year of 
age and upwards, which state is a state of wisdom, and of innocence in wisdom: these 
successive states of the life of man are signified by the numbers of the years of age, 
five, twenty, and sixty, in the following passage in Moses: "When any one shall make 
a singular vow, the estimation of a male shall be from a son of twenty years even to a 
son of sixty years, fifty shekels of silver; if a female, the estimation shall be thirty 
shekels. But from a son of five years even to a son of twenty years, the estimation shall
be, if a male, twenty shekels, if a female, ten shekels. But from a son of a month even 
to a son of five years, the estimation of a male shall be five shekels, of a female three 
shekels: but from a son of sixty years and upwards, the estimation shall be fifteen 
shekels, but of a female ten shekels," Levit 27:2 to 7. That the first state is a state of 
ignorance, and also of innocence in ignorance, is evident; during the continuance of 
this state, the interiors are forming to use, consequently are not manifested, but only 
the most external, which are of the sensual man; when these alone are manifested, 
there is ignorance: for whatever man understands and perceives, is from the interiors; 
hence also it may be manifest, that the innocence which exists at that time, and is 
called the innocence of infancy, is innocence the most external. 

That the second state is a state of instruction and of science is also evident; this state 
is not yet a state of intelligence, because the child at that time does not form any 
conclusions from himself, neither does he discern between truths and truths, nor even 
between truths and falsities, from himself, but from others; he only thinks and speaks 
things of the memory, thus from science alone, nor does he see and perceive whether 
a thing be so, except on the authority of his master, consequently because another has 
so said. But the third state is called a state of intelligence, since at this time man 
thinks from himself and discerns and concludes; and what he then concludes is his 
own and not another's; at this time faith commences, for faith is not the faith of the 
man himself, until from the ideas of his own proper thought he has confirmed what he
believes; previous to this time, faith is not his, but another's in himself, for he believed
the person not the thing; hence it may be manifest, that a state of intelligence then 
commences with man when he no longer thinks from a master, but from himself; 
which effect has not place until the interiors are open towards heaven. It is to be 
noted, that the exteriors belonging to man are in the world, and the interiors in 
heaven; and that in proportion to the quantity of light which flows in from heaven into
those things which are from the world, in the same proportion man is intelligent and 
wise; this is effected in the degree, and according to the quality in which the interiors 
are opened; and they are so far opened, as man lives for heaven and not for the world. 

But the last state is a state of wisdom, and of innocence in wisdom; which is when 
man has no longer any concern about understanding truths and goods, but about 
willing them and living them; for this is to be wise; and man is enabled to will truths 
and goods and to live them, so far as he is in innocence, that is, so far as he believes 
that he has nothing of wisdom from himself, but that whatever relish he has of 
wisdom is from the LORD; also so far as he loves it to be so; hence it is that this state 
also is a state of innocence in wisdom. From the succession of these states the man 
who is wise may also see the wonderful things of Divine Providence, which are these,
that a prior state is the plane of those which continually follow, and that the opening 
or unfolding of the interiors proceeds from outermost things, even to inmost things 
successively; and at length in such a manner that what was first, but in things 
outermost, this also is last, but in things inmost, namely ignorance and innocence; for 

311

he who knows that of himself he is ignorant of all things, and that whatever he knows 
is from the LORD, he is in the ignorance of wisdom, and also in the innocence of 
wisdom. AC 10225.

Verse 12. So teach us to number our days, that we may acquire a heart of wisdom. To 
number days denotes to ordain and arrange states of life; and days are said to be 
numbered when they are ordained or arranged, thus when they are finished, as in 
Isaiah, "I said by the cutting off of my days I was about to go away to the gates of 
hell; I was numbered as to the residue of my years," Isaiah 38:10. The reason why 
numbering is signified to ordain and arrange is because by number is signified the 
quality of a thing and of a state, and the quality is determined by the number adjoined;
hence to number denotes its quality, and the qualification of a thing in spiritual things 
is effected by ordination and arrangement from the LORD. AC 10217.

312

PSALM 91

1. He that dwells in the secret place of the MOST HIGH; he that abides under the 

shadow of the ALMIGHTY,

2. Shall say of JEHOVAH: O, my refuge and my fortress; my GOD, in whom I will 

trust.

3. For he shall deliver you from the snare of the fowler, from the deadly 

pestilence.

4. He shall cover you with his pinions, and under his wings shall you find refuge;

his truth shall be your shield and your buckler.

5. You shall not be afraid of the terror by night; of the arrow that flies by day;
6. Nor of the pestilence that walks in thick darkness; of the destruction that 

wastes at noon-day.

7. A thousand shall fall at your side, and ten thousand at your right hand, but it 

shall not come near to you.

8. You shall only behold with your eyes, and shall see the recompense of the 

wicked;

9. Because you, O JEHOVAH, are my refuge; you have made the MOST HIGH your 

habitation.

10. There shall no evil befall you, nor shall any plague come near to your tent.
11. For he shall give his angels charge over you, to keep you in all your ways.
12. They shall bear you up in their hands, lest you dash your foot against a stone.
13. You shall tread upon the lion and adder; the young lion and the dragon shall 

you trample under foot.

14. Because he has set his love upon me, therefore will I deliver him; I will set 

him on high, because he has known my name.

15. When he calls upon me, I will answer him; I will be with him in distress: I will

deliver him and honour him.

16. With length of days will I satisfy him, and I will show him my salvation.

The Internal Sense

Celebration of the FATHER by the LORD, to whom he is to be united, verse 1; that 
thence there will be protection from all assaults, verses 2 to 6; and no insurrection 
from the hells, verses 7 to 9; nor against the church, verse 10; that so the heavens will 
serve him, verses 11, 12; that there will be no fear of the hells when the human 
principle is united with the divine, verses 13 to 16.

EXPOSITION

Verse 3. From the snare of the fowler. For the signification of snare, see Psalm 11:6, 
Exposition.

Verse 4. He shall cover you with his pinions, and under his wings shall you find 
refuge; his truth shall be your shield and your buckler. Where shield and buckler 
denote defence against falsities. AC 1788; see also Ps 35:2, Exposition.

313

To cover under the wing denotes to guard by divine truth, which is the divine spiritual
principle. AE 283.

To be covered with the wing of JEHOVAH denotes the protection and confidence which 
are of faith. AC 8764.

Verse 5. For you shall not be afraid of the arrow that flies by day. That the man of the 
spiritual church is here signified appears from the signification of a dart, or an arrow, 
as denoting truth, and from the signification of a bow, as denoting doctrine; see AC 
2686. The man of the spiritual church was formerly called a shooter of the bow, 
because he defends himself by truths, and debates about truths, otherwise than the 
man of the celestial church, who is secure by virtue of good, and does not debate 
about truths. That the spiritual man was formerly called a shooter and archer, and that 
doctrine was called a bow and a quiver, and that the truths of doctrine, or rather 
doctrinals, were called darts and arrows, appears from David, where mention is made 
of the shooters of the bow, and of arrows and quivers. AC 2709.

Verse 6. Nor of the pestilence that walks in thick darkness; nor of the destruction that 
wastes at noon-day. The terror by night denotes the false principle which is in secret; 
the arrow which flies by day, denotes the false principle which is in manifestation; the
pestilence which walks in thick darkness, denotes the evil which is in secret; the 
destruction which wastes at noon-day, denotes the evil which is in manifestation. AC 
7102.

The above words are spoken of falsities and evils, which are not known to be falsities 
and evils, and of falsities and evils, which are known to be falsities and evils, and still 
creep into the thought and into the will, and destroy man; the falsities which are 
known to be falsities are understood by the arrow which flies by day; and the evils 
which are known to be evils and yet enter, are understood by the destruction which 
wastes at noon-day; and the falsities which are not known to be falsities, are 
understood by the terror by night; and the evils which are not known to be evils, by 
the pestilence which walks in thick darkness; the destruction of these latter evils is 
signified by a thousand which shall fall by his side; and the destruction of the falsities
by the myriad which shall fall at his right hand; also by the side on which they shall 
fall is signified good, and by the right hand the truth of good; that a thousand is 
predicated of evils, and a myriad, of falsities, is for this reason, because falsities are 
opposed to truths, and evils are opposed to goods. AE 336.

The terror by night denotes the falsities of evil, which are from hell; the arrow which 
flies by day denotes the false principle which is openly professed; the destruction 
which lays waste at noon-day, denotes the evil which is openly lived in, whereby truth
is destroyed. AC 9642.

Verse 7. A thousand shall fall at your side, and ten thousand at your right hand. 
Thousand and myriad denote what is innumerable; and since the whole Psalm relates 
to the LORD, who is meant by David, therefore thousand and myriad here denote all 
who are his enemies. AC 2575.

Verse 11. For he shall give his angels charge over you, to keep you in all your ways. 
To the intent that the LORD'S life may flow in, and be received according to every law 

314

belonging to man, there are continually attendant on man, angels, and spirits, angels 
from heaven, and spirits from hell; and I have been informed, that there are two spirits
and two angels attendant on every individual. The reason why there are attendant 
spirits from hell is because man. from himself is continually in evil, for he is in the 
delight of self-love and the love of the world, and so far as man is in evil, or in that 
delight, so far the angels from heaven cannot be present.

Those two spirits who are adjoined to man, cause him to have communication with 
hell, and those two angels cause him to have communication with heaven; man, 
without communication with heaven and hell, would not be able to live even a 
moment; if those communications were taken away, he would fall down dead as a 
stock, for in such case would be taken away his connection with the first esse, that is, 
with the LORD. This also has been shown me by experience; the spirits attendant on 
me were a little removed, and instantly according to the removal I began as it were to 
expire, and likewise should have expired, unless they had been sent back again. But I 
am aware that few believe that any spirit is attendant upon them, yea, that there are 
spirits; and the principal cause of this unbelief is because at this day there is no faith 
by reason that there is no charity, hence neither is it believed that there is a hell, yea, 
neither that there is a heaven, consequently no life after death; another cause of this 
unbelief is because with their eyes men do not see spirits, for they say, if I saw, I 
would believe; what I see, that is, but what I do not see, I know not whether it is or 
not; when yet they know, or may know, that the eye of man is so dim and gross, that it
does not even see things more extant which are in ultimate nature, as is evident from 
artificial glasses, by which such things become visible; how then should it be able to 
see the things which are within nature, even purer nature, where are spirits and angels;
these man cannot see, unless by the eye of his internal man, for this eye is 
accommodated to the seeing of such objects; but the sight of this eye is not opened to 
man, during his abode in the world, for several reasons. From these considerations it 
may be manifest, how much modern faith differs from ancient faith; for it was a tenet 
of ancient faith, that every man had his attendant angel. AC 5848, 5849.

That angels and spirits are attendant upon man, see Psalm 34:7; Matt 18:10; Heb 1:14.

Verse 13. The young lion and the dragon shall you trample under foot. By treading 
upon a lion, an adder, serpents, and scorpions, is meant not only to destroy evils and 
falsities, but also not to be hurt by them. AE 632.

To destroy interior and exterior falsities, which vastate the goods of the church, is 
signified by treading on a lion and adder; and to destroy interior and exterior falsities,
which vastate the goods of the church, is signified by treading on a young lion and on
a dragon. AE 714.

Verse 16. With length of days; see Psalm 23:6, Exposition.

315

PSALM 92

A Psalm, or song, for the Sabbath day.

1.

It is a good thing to give thanks to JEHOVAH, and to sing praises to your name, 
O you MOST HIGH!

2. To show forth your mercy in the morning, and your truth every night;
3. Upon an instrument of ten strings, and upon the psaltery; upon the harp with a 

solemn sound.

4. For you, O JEHOVAH, have made me glad through your work; I will sing aloud 

of the works of your hands.

5. How great are your works, O JEHOVAH! How very deep are your thoughts!
6. A brutish man knows not; neither does a fool understand this.
7. Though the wicked spring up as the grass, though all the workers of iniquity 

flourish; yet, they shall be destroyed for ever.
8. But you, O JEHOVAH, are most high for ever more.
9. For, lo, your enemies, O JEHOVAH, for, lo, your enemies shall perish! All the 

workers of iniquity shall be scattered!

10. But you exalt my horn like the horn of unicorns; I am anointed with fresh oil.
11. Mine eye looks with satisfaction on mine enemies; mine ear listens with 

satisfaction at the overthrow of the wicked that rise up against me.

12. The just shall flourish like the palm-tree; he shall grow up like the cedar of 

Lebanon.

13. They that are planted in the house of JEHOVAH, shall flourish in the courts of 

our GOD.

14. They shall still bring forth fruit in old age; they shall be fat and flourishing;
15. To show that JEHOVAH my rock is upright; and that there is no injustice in him.

The Internal Sense

Of the union of the LORD'S divine essence with his human, which is the sabbath. A 
thanksgiving for the Father's cooperation with him, verses 1 to 5; that the wicked 
understand not this, verse 6; that the wicked, though they may flourish, will perish in 
the end, verses 7 to 9; whence there will be divine omnipotence against all insurgents,
verses 10, 11; and the church will flourish, verses 12 to 14; and celebrate the LORD, 
verse 15.

EXPOSITION

Verse 3. Upon an instrument of ten strings, etc. For the signification of musical 
instruments and singing, see Psalm 71:1, 2, 3, Exposition.

Verse 10. But you exalt my horn like the horn of unicorns. Divine truths are called the 
horns of unicorns by reason of their length; hence mention is so often made of the 
horn being exalted, for exaltation signifies power from an interior principle. AC 2832.

316

 
Verse 12. The just shall flourish like the palm-tree; he shall grow up like a cedar in 
Lebanon. Palm denotes good, and cedar truth. Inasmuch as it signifies good, it also 
signifies wisdom, for wisdom is of good; this was signified by the palms, which 
together with the cherubs and flowers were engraven on the walls of the temple; for 
the temple signified the LORD himself, and in the representative sense, heaven; the 
cherubs, the palms and flowers upon the walls signified providence, wisdom, and 
intelligence, which are from the LORD, thus all things which are of heaven. AC 8368.

The just signify those who are in good, for by the just in the Word are meant those 
who are in the good of love, and by saints those who are in truths from that good; 
hence it is that it is said of the just one, that he shall flourish like a palm, and like a 
cedar in Lebanon, for the fructification of good is meant by the former, and the 
multiplication of truth thence by the latter. AE 458.

Verse 14. They shall bring forth fruit in old age; or grey hairs. Grey hair denotes in 
the last or ultimate. AC 5550.

Old age signifies to put off what is human, and to put on what is celestial. The ground
and reason why such things are signified by being old, and coming into days, is 
because the angels have no idea of old age, nor of advancing age, or coming into 
days, but only the idea of state as to the life in which they are principled, wherefore 
when mention is made in the Word of advancement in age, and of old age, the angels 
attendant on man cannot form any other idea than of the state of life in which they are,
and in which men are, when they pass through various ages even to the last, namely 
that they successively thus put off the human principle, and put on the celestial; for 
human life is nothing else from infancy to old age but a progression from the world to
heaven, and the last, which is death is the real transit, of consequence burial is 
resurrection, because it is a plenary putting off, see 2916; inasmuch as the angels are 
in such an idea, nothing else can be signified by old age, in the internal sense, which 
is principally designed for the angels, and for men who are angelic minds. AC 3016.

Verse 14. They shall be fat and flourishing, (green.) To be fat and green signifies to be
in goods and truths of doctrine. That fatness signifies goodness and things belonging 
thereto, thus satisfactions and joys, appears from the following passages in the Word: 
as in Isaiah, "Attending attend to me, eat you good, that your soul may be delighted in
fatness," Isaiah 55:2; by eating good is signified to appropriate good to themselves; 
whence by delighting in fatness is signified to be in a state of satisfaction and 
blessedness; and in Jeremiah, "I will fill the soul of the priests with fatness, and my 
people shall be satisfied with good," Jer 31:14; where also by fatness is signified the 
satisfaction and blessedness arising from the good of love; and in David, "My soul 
shall be satisfied with marrow and fatness, and my mouth shall praise you with joyful 
lips," Psalm 63:6; where the soul being satisfied with marrow and fatness, signifies 
being filled with the good of love and with joy thence derived; to praise with joyful 
lips, signifies to worship by truths which gladden the mind; again, "Your houses shall 
be filled with fatness, and you shall make them drink of the river of your delights," 
Psalm 36:9. By the fatness with which the houses shall be filled, is signified the good 
of love, and satisfaction thence derived, houses denoting the things of the mind; by 
the river of the delights, of which they shall drink, is signified intelligence and the 
felicity thence derived; and in Isaiah, "In this mountain shall JEHOVAH ZEBAOTH make
to all people a feast of fat things, a feast of wine on the marrow, of fat things full of 

317

marrow and of wine on the marrow well refined," Isaiah 25:6. These things are said 
concerning the state of those who should acknowledge and adore the LORD; by that 
mountain is signified the New Church from them; by the feast of fat things, of fat 
things full of marrow, is signified good both natural and spiritual with joy of heart; 
and by the marrow, and marrow refined, are signified truths from that good with the 
felicity thence derived; again in the same prophet, "JEHOVAH shall give the rain of 
your seed, with which you shall sow the land, and bread of the produce of the earth, 
and it shall be fat and plentiful," Isaiah 30:23; by the rain of seed is signified the 
multiplication of truth; and by bread of produce is signified the fructification of good; 
by fat and plentiful is signified good and truth with all satisfaction and felicity. 

Inasmuch as the Jewish and Israelitish nation was only in external worship, and not at 
the same time in internal worship, and consequently was not in any good of love, nor 
in any good of charity and faith, therefore it was prohibited them to eat the fat and 
blood, and it was declared that, if they should eat them they would be cut off, Levit 
3:17; 7:23, 25; but to those who are in internal worship, and thence in external 
worship, such as they are to be, who should be of the LORD'S New Church, it is said, 
that they should eat fat to satiety, and drink blood to inebriety, Ezek 39:19; by fat is 
there signified all the good of heaven and the church, and by blood all the truth 
thereof. In the opposite sense, by the fat ones are signified those who nauseate good, 
or who at least despise or reject it, Deut 32:15; Jer 5:27; 1. 11; Psalm 17:10; Psalm 
20:4; 18:32; 119:70; and elsewhere. AE 1159.

318

PSALM 93

1. JEHOVAH reigns, he is clothed with majesty; JEHOVAH is clothed with strength; he 
has girded himself; therefore the world is established, it cannot be moved.

2. Your throne has been established from of old; You are from eternity!

3. The rivers lift up, the rivers lift up their voice. O JEHOVAH! the rivers lift up their 
roaring.

4. JEHOVAH on high is mightier than the voices of many mighty waters, than the 
breakers of the sea!

5. Your testimonies are very sure; holiness becomes your house, O JEHOVAH, for ever!

The Internal Sense

That by the union of the Divine essence with the Human in the LORD, heaven and the 
church will endure for ever, verses 1, 2; the joy of those who are in divine truths from 
there, verses 3, 4; the Word established in the church, verse 5.

Exposition

Verses 1—5. These words also relate to the LORD; his dominion from eternity to 
eternity over heaven and earth, is signified by his throne being established from of 
old; you are from eternity; the glorification of the LORD by reason of his coming, and 
the consequent salvation of the human race, is signified by the rivers lifting up their 
voice and their roaring; by the rivers here mentioned three times are signified all 
things relating to intelligence in the internal man, and all things which are in the 
external man; divine truth from him, by which there is power, and by which there is 
salvation, is signified by the voices of many waters being mightier than the breakers 
of the sea; waters are truths; the voices of many waters are divine truths. AE 518.

These words relate to the LORD about to come into the world, and since he has glory 
and power from the Human principle, which he united to his Divine, it is said that he 
is clothed in majesty and strength, and that he girds himself; for the LORD assumed the
Human principle, that he might be in the power of subduing the hells; the church 
which he was about to establish and to defend to eternity, is signified by the world 
which shall be established and shall not be moved, and by the throne which shall be 
made firm; for by world is signified heaven and the church, as to the reception of 
divine good, and by throne, heaven and the church as to the reception of divine truth. 
AE 741.

Verse 3. The rivers have lifted up, O JEHOVAH, the rivers have lifted up their voice; 
the rivers lift up their roaring. That voice signifies annunciation, and, in a good sense,
annunciation from the Word, which voice is called the voice of JEHOVAH, is manifest 

319

from the passages in David, where it is mentioned, in which passages voice denotes 
divine truth; thus the Word, and annunciation from it. AC 6971.

320

PSALM 94

1. O GOD of vengeance, O JEHOVAH, O GOD of vengeance, shine forth!
2. Arise, O Judge of the earth! render recompense to the proud.
3. How long, O JEHOVAH, shall the wicked, how long shall the wicked triumph?
4. They belch out, they speak hard things; all the workers of iniquity make loud 

boasting.

5. They break in pieces your people, O JEHOVAH, and afflict your inheritance.
6. They slay the widow and the sojourner, and murder the fatherless.
7. Yet they say: JAH will not see; neither will the GOD of Jacob consider.
8. Understand, you brutish among the people; O, you fools, when will you be 

wise?

9. He who planted the ear, shall he not hear? He who planted the eye, shall he not

see?

10. He who chastises the nations, shall he not correct?— Even he who teaches 

man knowledge!

11. JEHOVAH knows the thoughts of man, that they are vanity.
12. Blessed is the man whom you chastise, O JAH; and teach out of your law;
13. To give him rest from the days of evil, until the pit shall be dug for the wicked.
14. For JEHOVAH will not desert his people, nor will he forsake his inheritance.
15. But judgement shall return to justice; and all the upright in heart shall follow 

it.

16. Who will rise up for me against the evil doers? Who will stand up for me 

against the workers of iniquity.

17. Unless JEHOVAH had been my help, my soul had quickly dwelt in silence.
18. When I said, my foot has slipped! Your mercy, O JEHOVAH, supported me.
19. In the multitude of my anxious thoughts within me, your comforts delighted 

my soul.

20. Shall the throne of iniquity have fellowship with you, which frames mischief 

by a law?

21. They gather themselves together against the soul of the just, and condemn the 

innocent blood.

22. But JEHOVAH is my defence, and my GOD is the rock of my refuge.
23. And he will bring upon them their own iniquity, and will cut them off in their 

own wickedness; yea, JEHOVAH our GOD will cut them off.

The Internal Sense

Of the Jewish nation, that they destroyed the church; that there may be a judgement 
upon them, verses 1, 2; because they destroyed the church, neither do they fear GOD, 
who nevertheless sees all things, verses 3 to 11; that the LORD, for the sake of the 
church, will come to judge them, verses 12 to 15; that the LORD'S Divine principle will
assist him against the wicked, and in temptation, verses 16 to 19; that the wicked rise 
up and seek to kill him, verses 20, 21; but by the help of the Divine principle they will
perish, verses 22, 23.

321

Exposition

Verse 2. O Judge of the earth. Judge of the earth, in an internal sense, signifies 
essential good from which truth is derived, which was also represented by the priests, 
who at the same time were judges in the representative church, they as priests 
represented Divine good, and as judges Divine Truth, but Judge of the whole earth 
denotes both, because earth signifies the church. For the better understanding of this, 
it is to be observed that there are two things which constitute the order of the universal
heaven, and consequently of all things in the universe, namely good and truth; good is
the essential [principle] of order, and all things belonging thereto are of mercy; truth is
the secondary [principle] of order, and all things belonging thereto are truths; Divine 
good judges all to heaven; but Divine truth condemns all to hell; wherefore unless the 
mercy of the LORD, which is of good, was eternal, all men whatever would be 
damned; this is what is signified by what is here said, that Divine good cannot do this 
according to truth separate from good; see also what is said above on this subject, AC 
1728. 

That the wicked nevertheless are condemned to hell, is not a consequence of Divine 
good being separated from Divine truth, but is a consequence of man's separating 
himself from Divine good; for the LORD never casts down any to hell, but man casts 
himself down, as has been repeatedly shown above: herein also Divine good is joined 
with Divine truth, inasmuch as unless the wicked were separated from the good, the 
wicked would cause hurt to the good, and would be continually attempting to destroy 
order; thus their separation is of mercy, lest the good should suffer harm; the case in 
this respect is like as in kingdoms of the earth, where, unless evils were punished, the 
whole kingdom would be infected therewith, and would thereby perish, wherefore 
with kings and judges there is more of mercy in punishing evils, and in expelling the 
wicked from society, than in showing them unseasonable clemency. AC 2258.

Verse 6. They slay the widow and the sojourner, and murder the fatherless. From this 
and other passages it may also be known what is signified in the internal sense of the 
Word by orphans, that is, by those who are without a father, namely those who are in 
a state of innocence and charity, and desire to know and to do what is good, and are 
not able; in such a state are especially they who are out of the church, of whom the 
LORD takes care, and whom he adopts as sons in another life; and inasmuch as these 
are signified by orphans, therefore when they are mentioned in the Word, in several 
passages are also mentioned sojourners and widows; for by sojourners are signified 
those who are instructed in goodness and truth, and by widows those who are in a 
state of good, and not so much in truth, and who are in a state of truth, and not so 
much in good, and yet are desirous to be good; inasmuch as by these three, namely 
orphans, sojourners, and widows, somewhat similar is signified in a series, therefore 
in several passages they are named together, as in the above. AC 3703.

Verse 7. JAH will not see. For the specific meaning of JAH, see Psalm 68:4. Exposition.

Verse 17. My soul had quickly dwelt in silence. What the soul is when separated from 
the natural body, see Psalm 43:5. Exposition; see also the work entitled Heaven and 
Hell from beginning to end.

322

Verse 18. My foot has slipped. For the signification of foot and heel see Psalm 49:5. 
Exposition.

Verse 21. They gather themselves together against the soul of the just, and condemn 
the innocent blood. Just denotes the good of love towards the neighbour; innocence is 
to acknowledge in heart, that man of himself wills nothing but evil, and perceives 
nothing but what is false, and that all the good which is of love, and all the truths 
which are of faith, are from the LORD alone: no others can acknowledge these things 
in heart, but they who are conjoined to the LORD by love; such are they who are in the 
inmost heaven, which is hence called the heaven of innocence; wherefore the good 
belonging to them is interior good; for it is the divine good of love proceeding from 
the LORD, which they receive who are in the heaven of innocence; hence also they 
appear naked, and likewise as infants, from which circumstance it is, that innocence is
represented by nakedness, and also by infancy. 

From what has been now said concerning innocence, it may be manifest that the 
divine principle of the LORD cannot be received except in innocence; whence it is, that
good is not good unless innocence be in it, that is, the acknowledgement that from the 
selfhood of man proceeds nothing but what is evil and false, and that from the LORD is
all good and truth; to believe the former, and to believe and also to will the latter, is 
innocence: therefore the good of innocence is good Divine itself from the LORD 
belonging to man: hence it is, that an innocent one signifies him, who is in interior 
good, and in the abstract sense interior good. Inasmuch as by innocent or innocence is
signified the Divine good proceeding from the LORD, therefore it was a crime most 
heinous to shed innocent blood. AC 9262.

PSALM 95

1. O come, let us sing to JEHOVAH; let us make a joyful noise to the rock of our 

salvation.

2. Let us come before his presence with thanksgiving, and let us make a joyful 

noise to him with psalms.

3. For JEHOVAH is a great GOD, and a great King above all gods!
4.

In whose hand are the deep places of the earth; the treasures of the mountains 
are his also.

5. The sea is his, for he made it; and his hands formed the dry land.
6. O come, let us fall prostrate; let us bow down; let us kneel before JEHOVAH our

Maker!

7. For he is our GOD, and we are the people of his pasture, and the sheep of his 

hand. Today, if you will hear his voice,

8. Harden not your hearts, as at Meribah, as in the day of Massah in the 

wilderness.

9. When your fathers tempted me, when they proved me, although they had seen 

my work.

10. Forty years long was I grieved with that generation, and said, they are a people

that do err in their hearts, and have not known my ways.

11. Unto whom I swore in my wrath, that they should not enter into my rest.

The Internal Sense

Celebration of the LORD, verses 1, 2; that omnipotence belongs to him, verses 3 to 5; 
that he is to be worshiped in humility, verses 6, 7; that we are not to be like the Jewish
nation, who alienated themselves from the LORD, verses 8 to 10; with whom therefore 
he has no conjunction, verse 11.

EXPOSITION

Verse 1. O come, let us sing to JEHOVAH; let us make a joyful noise to the rock of our 
salvation. Mention is here made of Jehovah and rock, because by Jehovah is meant 
the LORD as to Divine good, and by rock the LORD as to Divine truth, and since the 
latter and the former is meant, he is twice addressed, for one name has reference to the
Divine good, the other to the Divine truth, since in the Word there is a heavenly 
marriage in every part, which is the marriage of good and truth. AE 411.

Verse 3. For JEHOVAH is a great GOD, and a great King above all gods. That hereby is 
signified that there is one God, and none besides him, and because there is none 
besides him, that there is one God: in the Word it is occasionally said, that there is 
none as Jehovah God, also that there is no God as he; it was so said in the Word, 
because at that time they worshiped several gods in the land where the church was, as 
also in the lands where the church was not, and every one preferred his own God to 
the God of another. AC 7401.

324

In the Word, Jehovah or the Lord in several places is named El in the singular and 
also Eloah, and likewise Elohim in the plural, each sometimes in one verse or in one 
series; the reason why he is so named cannot be known, unless the internal sense of 
the Word be known. What is involved in the name El, when it is named, and what in 
Elohim, may appear from what has been abundantly shown above, namely that El or 
Elohim or God is mentioned, when truth is treated of; hence it is, that by El and 
Elohim in the supreme sense is signified the Divine spiritual principle, for this is the 
same with Divine truth, but with this difference, that by El is signified truth in the will
and act, which is the same thing with the good of truth; Elohim in the plural is used, 
because by the Divine truth is meant all truths proceeding from the LORD; hence also 
the angels in the Word are sometimes called Elohim or gods. AC 4402.

Verses 8, 9, 10. Harden not your hearts, as at Meribah, etc. etc. As to what concerns 
the temptation at Meribah and its nature, it must be noted, that in this passage are 
described those who almost yield, namely who complain against heaven, and also 
against the divine itself, and at length almost dis-believe a Divine providence; these 
things are signified in the internal sense by what precedes, and also by what follows in
this verse, and are the quality of the state of temptation which is signified by Massah, 
and the quality of complaint in temptation which is signified by Meribah: that this 
quality is here signified by Meribah, is evident in David: "In straitness you have 
called upon me, and I rescued you, I answered you in what is hidden, I proved you 
near the waters of Meribah," Psalm 81:7. But in the internal historical sense, in which 
the religious principle which prevailed amongst the Israelitish nation is treated of, that
nation is described as to its quality towards JEHOVAH, namely that they were not 
willing by supplication to entreat Him for aid, but that they expostulated: the reason 
was, because they did not acknowledge JEHOVAH as the supreme GOD in heart, but 
only in mouth when they saw miracles: that they did not acknowledge Him in heart, is
very manifest from the Egyptian calf, which they made for themselves and adored, 
saying that these were their gods; also from their frequent apostacy, concerning which
see AC 8301. These are the things which are here described in the internal historical 
sense; but in the internal spiritual sense is described the quality of temptation with 
those who are brought to the last [state] of temptation, before they are liberated. That 
the quality of the Israelitish nation and of their religious principle is described by the 
contention with Moses at Massah and Meribah, is also manifest in David: "Harden 
not your heart as in Meribah, as in the day of Massah in the wilderness, where your 
fathers tempted me; they tempted me, although they saw my work; Forty years I was 
grieved with this generation; and I said, they are a people that do err in heart, and the 
same have not known my ways, to whom I swore in my anger, that they shall not 
come to my rest," Psalm 95:8, 9, 10, 11. 

The reason why divine representative worship was still instituted amongst that nation 
was, because representative worship could be instituted with every nation, which had 
holy externals of worship, and worshiped almost idolatrously; for what is 
representative does not respect the person but the thing, AC 1381, and it was the 
genius of that nation above every other nation altogether to worship external things as 
holy and divine, without any internal principle; as to adore their fathers, Abraham, 
Isaac, and Jacob, afterwards Moses and David, as deities, and besides to account holy 
and as divine, and to worship every stone and every [piece of] wood, which was 
inaugurated into their divine worship, as the arks, the tables there, the lamp, the altar, 
the garments of Aaron, the urim and thummim, and afterwards the temple. By such 

325

things at that time there was given of the LORD'S providence a communication of the 
angels of heaven with man; for there must needs be somewhere a church, or the 
representative of a church, that there may be communication of heaven with the 
human race; and inasmuch as that nation, above every other nation, could place divine
worship in external things, and thereby act the representative of a church, therefore 
that nation was taken. 

Communication with the angels in heaven by representatives was effected at that time 
in this manner: their external worship was communicated with angelic spirits who are 
simple, and do not reflect on things internal, but still are interiorly good; such are they
who in the grand man correspond to the skins; these do not at all attend to the internal 
of man, but only to his external; if this latter appears holy, they also think holily 
concerning it; the interior angels of heaven saw in those spirits the things that were 
represented, consequently the celestial and divine things which corresponded; for with
these [spirits] they could be present, and see those things, but not with man, except by
them [the angelic spirits]; for the angels dwell with men in interior principles, but 
where there are no interior principles, they dwell in the interior principles of simple 
spirits, for the angels have no relish except for things spiritual and celestial, which are
the interior things contained in representatives; from these few observations it may be 
manifest how communication with heaven could be given by such a people: but see 
what has been before shown on this subject, namely that the holy principle of worship
belonging to the Jews, was miraculously elevated into heaven out of them, AC 4307; 
that the posterity of Jacob, of whatever quality they were, could represent what is 
holy, if so be they strictly observed the rituals that were commanded, AC 3147, 3479, 
3480, 3881, 4208. AC 8588.

Verse 11. Unto whom I swore in my wrath, that they should not enter into my rest. 
JEHOVAH GOD, or the LORD never swears, for it is not suitable to GOD himself, or to 
the Divine truth to swear; but where GOD or the Divine truth is willing to have any 
thing confirmed before man, then this confirmation falls down into a natural sphere, 
into an oath or the form of an oath customary in the world; hence it is evident, that 
although GOD never swears, still in the sense of the letter of the Word, which is the 
natural sense, it is said that he swears. AE 608.

326

PSALM 96

1. O, sing to JEHOVAH a new song; sing to JEHOVAH, all the earth:
2. Sing to JEHOVAH, bless his name; show forth his salvation from day today.
3. Declare his glory among the nations, his wonders among all peoples.
4. For JEHOVAH is great, and greatly to be praised; he is to be feared above all 

gods.

5. For all the gods of the peoples are vanities; but JEHOVAH made the heavens!
6. Glory and majesty are before him; strength and beauty are in his sanctuary.
7. Give to JEHOVAH, O you families of the peoples, give to JEHOVAH glory and 

strength.

8. Give to JEHOVAH the glory of his mime; bring an offering, and come into his 

courts.

9. Fall prostrate before JEHOVAH in the ornament of holiness; tremble before him 

all the earth.

10. Say among the nations, JEHOVAH reigns; yea, the world shall be established, it 

cannot be moved: he shall judge the people with rectitude.

11. Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoice; let the sea roar, and the 

fullness thereof.

12. Let the field and all that is therein be joyful; then shall the trees of the forest 

exult.

13. Before JEHOVAH; for he comes, for he comes to judge the earth; he judges the 

world with justice, and the peoples with his truth.

The Internal Sense

Celebration of the LORD by his church, that he alone has power and glory, verses 1 to 
9; that he will come to judgement, that the heavens and the church may worship him 
in joy of heart, verses 10 to 12; that he comes to judgement, verse 13.

Exposition

Verses 1, 2, 3. Sing to JEHOVAH a new song, etc, etc, That to bless Jehovah is here to 
glorify him, and to give him thanks, is evident; and since all glorification of him is 
from spiritual truths and from spiritual good, it is therefore said, bless you his name, 
show forth his salvation from day today; name also is predicated of truths, and 
salvation of good; that to sing a song signifies to glorify from those truths and that 
good, may be seen above. AE 340.

The acknowledgement and celebration of the LORD with joy of heart for his coming is 
signified by singing to Jehovah, bless his name, show forth his salvation from day 
today; the corning itself is described by Jehovah comes; inasmuch as his coming is 
when the last judgement is at hand, therefore it is said, he comes to judge the earth, he
shall judge the world in justice, and the people in truth; by the earth is meant the 
church, by the world are meant those in the church who are in the good of charity, and
by people those who are in truths thence derived; that the coming of the LORD is when
the last judgement is at hand, was said above; for then the wicked will be separated 

327

from the good, or the goats from the sheep, and the wicked will be sentenced to hell, 
and the good to heaven. AE 612.

That hereby is signified the glorification of the LORD by those who are of the spiritual 
church, on account of liberation, is evident from the signification of singing a song, as
denoting glorification; the reason why it denotes the glorification of the LORD is 
because by JEHOVAH in the Word is meant the LORD, and from the representation of 
Moses and the sons of Israel, as denoting those who are of the spiritual church; that 
the glorification of the LORD is on account of liberation, is evident from what was 
shown in the foregoing chapter, namely that they who are of the spiritual church were 
saved solely by the coming of the LORD into the world, and that until that time they 
were detained in the lower earth, and there infested by spirits who were in falsities 
derived from evil, and were liberated by the LORD after he had made the Human 
principle in himself divine. The reason why to sing a song denotes to glorify, and thus
a song denotes glorification, is because songs in the ancient church, and afterwards in 
the Jewish, were prophetic, and treated of the LORD, especially of his coming into the 
world, and destroying the diabolical crew at that time more raging than ever, and 
liberating the faithful from their assaults; and inasmuch as the prophetic of songs 
contained such things in the internal sense, hence by them is signified the glorification
of the LORD, that is, the celebration of him from gladness of heart; for gladness of 
heart is especially expressed by a song, inasmuch as gladness in a song breaks forth, 
as it were, of itself into sound; hence it is that JEHOVAH, that is, the LORD, in songs is 
called Hero, a Man of war, the God of armies, the Conqueror, Strength, Defence, the 
only Shield; and the diabolical crew, which was destroyed, is called the enemy, which 
was smitten, swallowed up, overwhelmed, cast into hell. AC 8261.

Verse 3. His wonders, or, miracles; see Psalm 78:43, Exposition.

Verse 7. Give to JEHOVAH, O you families of the peoples; give to JEHOVAH glory and 
strength. As nations signified goodnesses, so also did families, because every nation 
consisted of families, families, however, signify goodnesses when predicated of 
nations, but, truths when predicated of people, as in David, "Give to JEHOVAH, you 
families of the peoples, give to JEHOVAH glory and strength." In this and the preceding
verse families are predicated of goodnesses, because they were families of nations. 
AC 1261.

Verse 8. Bring an offering, and come into his courts. For the signification of courts, 
see Psalm 84:10, Exposition.

Verse 12. Let the field and all that is therein be joyful; then shall also the trees of the 
forest exult. The church as to science, or as to externals, is signified by a forest in 
David, "Let the field and all that is therein be joyful; then shall all the trees of the 
forest exult;" for the church is called a forest, a garden, and a paradise; a forest, from 
science; a garden, from intelligence; and a paradise, from wisdom; and since a forest 
denotes the church as to science, thus as to externals, it denotes also a religious 
principle. AC 9011.

Verse 13. Before JEHOVAH; for he comes, for he comes to judge the earth; he shall 
judge the world with, justice, and the peoples with his truth. These words relate to the 
coming of the LORD, and to the last judgement, at that time; inasmuch as by world are

328

signified those of the church who are in good, and by people, those who are in truths; 
therefore it is said that he will judge the world in justice, and the people in truth. AE 
741.

Few at this day know what is meant by the Last judgement. It is generally supposed 
that it is to be accompanied with the destruction of the world; and it is hence 
conjectured, that this terrestrial globe is to perish by fire, together with all things that 
exist in the visible world; and that then, for. the first time, the dead shall rise again, 
and shall undergo their judgement; when the wicked are to be cast into hell, and the 
good to ascend into heaven. These conjectures are grounded in the prophetical parts of
the Word, where mention is made of a new heaven and a new earth, and also of the 
New Jerusalem; mankind not being aware, that the prophetical parts of the Word, in 
their internal sense, have a totally different signification from what appears in the 
literal sense; and that by heaven, or the sky, is not meant heaven or the sky, nor by 
earth the earth, but the church of the LORD in general, and with every individual in 
particular. By the last judgement is meant the last time of the church; and also, the last
time of every one's life. To speak of it, first, as denoting the last time of the church. It 
was the last judgement of the most ancient church, or that before the flood, when their
posterity perished, whose destruction is described by the flood. It was the last 
judgement of the ancient church, or that after the flood, when almost all who belonged
to that church became idolaters, and were dispersed. It was the last judgement of the 
representative church which succeeded among the posterity of Jacob, when the twelve
tribes were carried away into captivity, and dispersed amongst the nations; and 
afterwards when the Jews, after the coming of the LORD, were driven out of the land 
of Canaan, and scattered over the face of the whole earth. The last judgement of the 
present church, which is called the Christian church, is what is meant, in the 
Revelation of John, by the new heaven and the new earth. 

That the last time of the life of every man, when he dies, is to him the last judgement, 
is not unknown to some, but still few believe it. Nevertheless it is a certain truth, that 
every man rises again after death into another life, and undergoes his judgement. This 
judgement is thus accomplished. As soon as his corporeal organs grow cold, which 
happens a few days after his decease, he his raised again of the LORD by celestial 
angels, who are at first attendant on him; but in case he be such that he cannot remain 
with them, he is then received into the care of spiritual angels; and successively 
afterwards into the care of good spirits. For all who come into the other life, be they 
who they may, are welcome guests who meet a kind reception. But as every one's 
desire follows him, he who has led a wicked life cannot abide long with the angels 
and good spirits, but successively separates himself from them, repeating these 
separations till he comes among spirits whose life is similar and conformable to that 
which he had while in the world. It then appears to him as if he was in his former 
bodily life, and, in fact, this present life is a continuation of his past. From this life his 
judgement commences. They who have led a wicked life, in process of time descend 
to hell: and they who have led a good life, are by degrees elevated by the LORD into 
heaven. Such is the last judgement of every individual person; of which we have 
spoken from experience in the first part of this work. See AC 168—189.

As to what the LORD spoke concerning the last times, saying, that then the sea and the 
waves shall roar, the sun shall be darkened, the moon shall not give her light, the stars
shall fall from heaven, nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom, 

329

with several other particulars; Matthew 24:7, 29; Luke 21:25; they all, both in general 
and in particular, signify the state of the church, in regard to what it would be at the 
time of the Last judgement. By the sea and the waves roaring, nothing else is signified
than that heresies and controversies, in general within the church, and in particular in 
every individual, would be thus noisy and outrageous: by the sun nothing else is 
meant than love to the LORD and towards our neighbour; by the moon, faith; and by 
stars, the knowledges of faith; which in the last times would thus be darkened, would 
not give light, and would fall from heaven, that is, would vanish away. The like is said
by the LORD in Isaiah 13:10. Also, by nation rising up against nation and kingdom 
against kingdom, nothing else is meant than evils rising against evils, and falsities 
against falsities, etc. There are reasons, replete with arcana, why the LORD thus spoke 
in this style. That seas, the sun, the moon, the stars, nations, and kingdoms, have such 
a signification, I know of a certainty; and it was shown in the first part of this work. 
AC 2117—2120.

PSALM 97

JEHOVAH reigns! let the earth rejoice; let the many islands be glad!

1.
2. Clouds and thick darkness are round about him; justice and judgement are the 

support of his throne!

3. A fire goes before him, and burns up his adversaries round about him!
4. His lightnings enlighten the world; the earth beholds, and trembles.
5. The mountains melt like wax at the presence of JEHOVAH, at the presence of 

the LORD of all the earth!

6. The heavens declare his justice; and all peoples behold his glory!
7. Let all those who serve graven images be ashamed! all those who boast of 

vanities!—fall prostrate before him all you gods.

8. Zion hears and is glad, and the daughters of Judah rejoice because of your 

judgements, O JEHOVAH!

9. For you, O JEHOVAH, are most high above all the earth; you are greatly exalted

above all gods.

10. O you who love JEHOVAH, hate evil! He is the preserver of the souls of his 

saints; He delivers them from the hand of the wicked.

11. Light is sown for the just, and gladness for the upright in heart.
12. Rejoice in JEHOVAH all you just, and give thanks at the remembrance of his 

holiness.

The Internal Sense

The joy of the church concerning the coming of the LORD, with whom there is Divine 
truth, verses 1 to 6; for all who are in falsities, will be removed, verse 7; their joy 
because the LORD is the GOD of heaven and the church, verses 8, 9; that he will protect
those who are in truths from himself, verses 10 to 12.

EXPOSITION

Verse 1. JEHOVAH reigns, let the earth rejoice; let the many islands be glad. By these 
words is signified that the church where the Word is, and the church where the Word 
is not, consequently they who are in spiritual truths, and they who are in truths not 
spiritual, will rejoice on account of the kingdom of the LORD; by the earth is signified 
the church where the Word is, and by the islands where the Word is not, consequently 
they who are remote from spiritual truths, for the truths of the Word alone are 
spiritual, but with those who are out of the church, because they have not truths from 
the Word, truths are only natural, hence it is that they are called islands. By islands in 
the Word are not meant any islands of the sea, but places in the spiritual world, 
inhabited by those who are in the natural science of knowledges in some measure 
agreeing with the knowledges of truth and good that are in the Word, which places 
sometimes appear there as islands in the sea; hence in the abstract sense, by islands 
are signified the truths of the natural man. AE 406.

The islands of the gentiles signify the nations now remote from the knowledges of 
faith; as in David, "JEHOVAH reigns, let the earth rejoice, let the many islands be glad; 

331

clouds and thick darkness are round about him," denoting the same gentiles; their 
ignorance is here represented by clouds and thick darkness, but whereas they are 
principled in simplicity and probity, it is said, roundabout him. AC 1158.

Verses 3, 4. A fire goes before him, and burns up his adversaries round about him; his
lightnings enlighten the world. From these words it is evident that lightnings signify 
Divine truth as to illustration, for it is said, he shall enlighten the world. That by the 
voice of thunder is signified Divine truth as to perception and understanding, and by 
lightnings the same truth as to illustration, may be manifest from its being said, that 
the Maker of the earth prepares the world by his wisdom, and extends the heavens by 
his intelligence. AE 273.

Verses 4, 5. His lightnings enlighten the world; the earth beholds, and trembles. The 
mountains melt like wax at the presence of JEHOVAH, at the presence of JEHOVAH of 
the whole earth. By these words is described the state of the wicked at the presence of
the Lord in his Divine truth, which state is similar to the state of the sons of Israel, 
when the LORD appeared to them on Mount Sinai; that they then heard thunders, saw 
lightnings, and that the mountain appeared in a consuming fire as of a furnace, and 
that they trembled, is known from the Word, and this because they were wicked in 
heart, for the LORD appears to every one according to his quality, to the good as a 
recreating fire, and to the evil as a consuming fire. Hence it is evident what is 
signified by a voice of thunder being heard in the world, by lightning enlightening the
world, by the earth being moved and trembling, and by the mountains melting before 
JEHOVAH the LORD of the whole earth; by world are meant all who are of the church in
goods, in this case who are in evils, and by the earth all who are of the church in 
truths, in this case who are in falsities. AE 741.

That hereby is signified a state divine in which is revelation, appears from the 
signification of voices, which are sounds of thunder, as denoting truths divine; and 
from the signification of lightnings, as denoting the flashing and splendour which 
appertain to those truths, for truths divine are resplendent and flashing from the 
flaming of the light which is from the sun of heaven; hence it is that lightnings denote 
the splendours thence issuing which glance upon the internal sight of man, and 
illuminate those who are in truths from good, and confound those who are in the 
falsities derived from evil. AC 8813.

In the Word throughout it is said, that when JEHOVAH descends, the earth trembles, 
and the mountains melt, by which is signified the commotion of all at the presence of 
the DIVINE BEING, for the DIVINE BEING is such, that no one endures except he be in a 
sort of cloud, and be thus accommodated to reception, for it is as the fire which is in 
the sun, which, if it was to fall bare upon any one, would consume him in a moment; 
but reception is according to the quality belonging to any one; they who are in good 
tremble indeed at the presence of the DIVINE BEING, but it is a holy tremor which 
precedes reception; whereas they who are in evil are terrified at the presence of the 
DIVINE BEING, and on this account flee away, and are there involved in their own false
principle, as in a dusky cloud, and are hid. AC 8816.

Verse 8. The daughters of Judah rejoice. That the daughters of Judah signify the 
affections of good, see Psalm 48:11, 12, 13. Exposition.

332

Verse 12. Rejoice in the LORD all you just, and give thanks at the remembrance of his 
holiness. In the Word it is said for ever, and to generation of generations, and this 
sometimes in one verse; the reason is because for ever is predicated of the Divine 
good, and generation of generations of Divine truth; the case is similar with the 
signification of memorial (remembrance) and of name; memorial or remembrance is 
predicated of the quality of the DIVINE BEING in worship as to truth, but name of the 
quality of the DIVINE BEING in worship as to each both truth and good, but specifically
as to good. That memorial or remembrance denotes the quality of the DIVINE BEING in
worship, is evident from David, "Sing you to JEHOVAH, O you saints of his, and give 
thanks at the memorial or remembrance of his holiness." That holy is predicated of 
truth, see AC 6788; the worship thence derived is signified by the memorial or 
remembrance of his holiness. AC 6888.

333

PSALM 98

A Psalm.

1. Sing you to JEHOVAH a new song, for he has done wonders! His right hand and

2.

his holy arm have worked salvation for him!
JEHOVAH has made known his salvation; before the eyes of the nations he has 
revealed his justice.

3. He has remembered his mercy and his truth to the house of Israel; all the ends 

of the earth have seen the salvation of our GOD.

4. Make a loud noise to JEHOVAH all the earth; break forth, and rejoice, and sing 

praise.

5. Sing to JEHOVAH with the harp; with the harp, and the voice of a psalm.
6. With trumpets and with the sound of the cornet, make a joyful noise before 

JEHOVAH the king.

7. Let the sea roar and the fullness thereof; the world, and those that dwell 

therein.

8. Let the rivers clap their hands; let the mountains be joyful together.
9. Before JEHOVAH; for he comes to judge the earth; with justice shall he judge 

the world, and the peoples with rectitude.

The Internal Sense

Of the coming of the LORD, and the glorification of his Human principle, that then he 
will have power, verse 1; whence there will be salvation, verse 2; that the prophecies 
will be fulfilled, verse 3; celebration and joy thereat, verses 4 to 8; because he comes 
to judgement, verse 9.

Exposition

Verse 1. Wonders or miracles; see Psalm 78:43, Exposition.

Verse 1. His right hand, and his holy arm; see Psalm 10:15. Exposition.

Verses 1 to 7. Sing you to JEHOVAH a new song, etc. etc. All the instruments 
mentioned from this to the seventh verse signify affections, each its own affection, 
and this from the agreement of their sound, for there are affections which produce 
varieties of sounds with men, whence also affections are known from sounds, as was 
said above in this article. I will add this arcanum; the angels, who in heaven constitute
the LORD'S celestial kingdom, draw the internal sense of the Word from man's 
affection alone when he reads the Word, resulting also from the sound and expressions
in the original tongue; but the angels, who are in the LORD'S spiritual kingdom, draw 
the internal sense from the truths which the expressions contain; hence from the 
celestial kingdom there is joy of heart to the man who is in spiritual affection, and 
from the spiritual kingdom confession from that joy; the sounds of musical 
instruments, which are there named, elevate the affection, and truths form it; that this 
is the case, is also known by those who are skilled in the are of music; for this reason 

334

the psalms of David are called psalms from playing instruments, and likewise songs 
from singing. AE 327.

Verses 1 to 7. See also Psalm 96:1. Exposition.

Verse 3. He has remembered his mercy and his truth to the house of Israel, etc. In the 
Word it is said of JEHOVAH, that is, of the LORD, that he remembers, and that he does 
not remember, and by it is signified that in such case it is done from mercy, whether it 
be preservation or deliverance; in like manner as that he sees, hears, knows, and that 
he does not see, does not, hear, and does not know, by which expressions also are 
signified compassions and non-compassions; the reason why it is so expressed is 
grounded in what passes in a similar way with man, and in appearance; for when he 
averts himself from the LORD, as is the case when he does evil, then, because the 
LORD is to his back, it appears to him that the LORD does not see it, does not hear and 
know it, neither remembers him, when yet this is what appertains to the man, and 
hence from appearance it is so expressed in the Word, but the case is changed when 
man turns himself to the LORD, as he does when he does well; every one must know 
that remembrance and recollection cannot be predicated of the LORD, inasmuch as 
things past and future in him are eternal, that is, are present from eternity to eternity. 
AC 9849. 

By mercy from the LORD, the celestial understand nothing else but the perception of 
an influx from him, and by truth an influx of charity thence derived; but it is 
otherwise with the spiritual; these think concerning the things which are of faith, and 
when they are reformed and regenerated, they are introduced by things which are of 
faith to charity towards their neighbour; wherefore when the latter is treated of, by 
mercy from the LORD is meant an influx of charity towards their neighbour, and by 
truth an influx of faith; but still this faith, when the spiritual man is regenerated, 
becomes charity, for then he acts from charity. AC 3122.

Verses 7, 8. Let the sea roar and the fullness thereof; the world, and those that dwell 
therein. Let the rivers clap their hands, let the mountains be joyful together. By these 
words is signified the glorification of the LORD by the universal heaven; glorification 
from its ultimates is signified by the sea roaring and its fullness; the glorification 
from the whole heaven is signified by the world making a noise, and those that dwell 
in it; world signifies the universal heaven as to its truth, and those that dwell in it 
signify the universal heaven as to its good; the glorification of the LORD by the truths 
which are of intelligence, and by the goods which are of love, is signified by the 
rivers clapping hands, and the mountains rejoicing together, rivers denoting the truths
of intelligence, and mountains the goods of love. AE 518.

Verse 9. He comes to judge the earth. What judgement means both general and 
particular, see Psalm 96:13, Exposition.

335

PSALM 99

1.

JEHOVAH reigns! Let the peoples tremble! He sits between the cherubim; let 
the earth quake!
2.
JEHOVAH is great in Zion, and he is high above all peoples.
3. Let them praise your great and reverend name; Holy is he!
4. The mighty king loves judgement; you do establish rectitude; you do execute 

judgement and justice in Jacob.

5. Exalt you JEHOVAH our GOD, and fall prostrate at his footstool; Holy is he!
6. Moses and Aaron among his priests, and Samuel among those who call upon 

his name; these called upon JEHOVAH and he answered them.

7. He spoke to them in the cloudy pillar; they kept his testimonies and the statute 

which he gave them.

8. You did answer them, O JEHOVAH our GOD; you were a forgiving GOD to them,

though an avenger of their doings.

9. Exalt JEHOVAH our GOD, and fall prostrate at his holy mountain, for JEHOVAH 

our GOD is holy.

The Internal Sense

Celebration of the LORD, who is the Word and the GOD of the church, verses 1, 2; that 
he is to be worshiped, verses 3, 5, 9; because to him belong power and justice, verse 
4; that the Word is from him, verses 6, 7; that he is the REDEEMER, verse 8.

Exposition

Verse 1. JEHOVAH reigns! let the peoples tremble; he sits between the cherubim, let the
earth quake. Cherubim signify guard and providence, to prevent the LORD, and also 
heaven being approached except by the good of love, that is, except by those who are 
in the good of love, also to prevent the goodness from being injured, which is from 
the LORD in heaven, and with man. AC 9509.

Verse 2. JEHOVAH is great in Zion, and he is high above all peoples. By Mount Zion is 
signified heaven and the church where the LORD reigns by his Divine truth, and the 
reason is because Zion was the city which David built, and in which he afterwards 
dwelt, and was hence called the city of David, and because by David was represented 
the LORD as to royalty, which is Divine truth, therefore by Zion in the Word is 
signified heaven and the church where the LORD reigns by Divine truth. For the same 
reason also it was, that the ark of JEHOVAH, in which the law was deposited, was 
translated into that city by David, for by that law in an extended sense is also signified
the Divine truth proceeding from the LORD. For this reason also it was, that by 
Jerusalem, which was beneath that mountain, is signified the church as to doctrine, for
the doctrine of the church is all from the Divine truth which proceeds from the LORD, 
consequently from the Word: the reason why that city was built on a mountain was, 
because mountains at that time from their height represented the heavens, and hence 
also in the Word signify the heavens; the reason of the representation and consequent 
signification was because the supreme heavens, where are the angels of the third 

336

degree, appear in altitude above the rest, and before the eyes of others as mountains, 
and because the supreme heavens appear as mountains, and the angels who are upon 
them are in love to the LORD, hence by mountains in the Word, and principally by 
Mount Zion, is signified love to the LORD. AE 850.

Verse 4. You do execute judgement and justice in Jacob. What is meant by Jacob see 
Psalm 87:2, Exposition.

Verse 5. Exalt you JEHOVAH our GOD, and fail prostrate at his footstool; Holy is he! 
Footstool is the Divine truth under heaven, such as is the Word in the literal sense, for 
upon this the Divine truth in heaven, which is the Word in the internal sense, reclines 
and as it were stands; the former truth is signified by footstool in David, Psalm 99:5. 
AC 9166.

The footstool of JEHOVAH, towards which they should fall prostrate, is the Divine truth
in ultimates, thus the Word. AC 9406.

Verse 6. Moses and Aaron among his priests. Moses signifies the Divine law, or the 
Word, in the internal sense, and Aaron the doctrine thence derived, when they are 
named together. By the Divine law which Moses represents, is meant the Word such 
as it is in its internal sense, thus such as it is in the heavens; but by doctrine is meant 
the Word, such as it is in its literal sense, thus such as it is in the earths; how much 
they differ, may be manifest from what has been heretofore explained as to the 
internal sense of the Word. Let the ten precepts, which are specifically called the law, 
serve for illustration; the literal sense of these precepts is, that parents are to be 
honoured, that murder is not to be committed, nor adultery, nor theft, etc. but the 
internal sense is, that the LORD is to be worshiped, that hatred ought not to be 
maintained, that truth ought not to be falsified, and that no one ought to claim to 
himself what is the LORD'S; thus are these four precepts of the Decalogue understood 
in heaven, and the rest also in their manner; for in the heavens they know no other 
FATHER but the LORD, therefore by parents being to be honoured, they understand that 
the LORD is to be worshiped; neither do they know in the heavens what it is to commit
murder, for they live for ever, but instead of committing murder, they understand to 
bear hatred, and to hurt the spiritual life of any one; neither do they know in the 
heavens what it is to commit adultery, wherefore instead of committing adultery they 
understand what corresponds to it, namely the falsification of truth; and instead of 
stealing, they perceive the taking away any thing from the LORD, and claiming it to 
themselves, as good and truth.

Such is that law, and also the whole Word in the heavens, thus such in the internal 
sense, yea it is still deeper, for several things which are thought and said in the 
heavens do not fall into the words of human speech, because in the heavens the Word 
is spiritual but not natural; and those things which are of the spiritual world transcend 
those which are of the natural world, in the same manner as immaterial things 
transcend those which are material; but whereas material things correspond to 
immaterial, the latter may be expounded by the former, thus by natural speech, but not
spiritual; for spiritual speech is not a speech of material expressions, but of spiritual 
expressions, which are ideas modified into expressions in the spiritual aura, and 
represented by the variegations of heavenly light, which light in itself is nothing but 
Divine intelligence and wisdom proceeding from the LORD. From these considerations

337

it may be manifest what is meant, in its genuine sense, by the Divine law which 
Moses represents, and what by the doctrine which Aaron represents. AC 7089.

Verse 7. He spoke to them in the cloudy pillar. In the Word it is often said that 
JEHOVAH appeared in a cloud, and that he was girded with a cloud, also that beneath 
his feet was a cloud; in which passages by cloud is meant the obscurity of truth 
specifically the literal sense of the Word, for this sense, in respect to the internal 
sense, is the obscurity of truth, see preface to Gen. xviii. also AC 4391, 5922, 6343, 
6752; this was signified by the cloud, when the LORD appeared to Peter, James, and 
John in glory, Luke 9:34; when from Mount Sinai to the people, and when to Moses 
upon his going in to him there; Exodus 19:9, 20:18, 24:15, 16, 17, 18, 34:5; and also 
by this circumstance, that the LORD so often said that he would come in the clouds of 
heaven, Matt 24:30, 26:63, 64; Mark 13:26, 14:61, 62; Luke 21:27. The literal sense 
of the Word is called a cloud, because the internal sense, which is called glory, cannot 
be comprehended by man, except he be regenerated, and in such case illustrated. The 
internal sense of the Word, or Truth Divine in its glory, if it appeared before a man not
regenerated, would be as thick darkness, in which he would see nothing at all, and 
also by which he would be blinded, that is, would believe nothing. From these 
considerations it may be manifest what is signified by a cloud by day, namely that it is
the obscurity of truth, and where the Word is treated of, it is the literal sense. It is said 
in a pillar of a cloud and of fire, because by a pillar is signified firmament, which 
supports, as Jer 1:18; Psalm 75:3; Rev 3:12; Job 9:6; and it is predicated of the natural
principle, because the natural principle is like a firmament or basis to the spiritual; for 
the spiritual closes in the natural, and there rests; hence it is that the feet of the angel 
descending from heaven appeared as pillars of fire, Rev 10:1, for by feet is signified 
the natural principle, AC 2162, 3147. AC 8106.

The reason why JEHOVAH, or the LORD, appeared or went before in a pillar of a cloud 
by day, and in a pillar of fire by night, was because by those things was represented 
the state of heaven, for in heaven there are perpetual variations and changes of state, 
for the angels are continually perfecting, which cannot in any way be effected without
perpetual changes of states; in general those variations and changes are as the 
vicissitudes of times in the world, namely as the vicissitudes of the times of the year, 
which are spring, summer, autumn, winter, and again spring; and as the vicissitudes of
the times of the day which are morning, mid-day, evening, night, and again morning; 
when it is morning and mid-day there, there is illustration of the understanding from 
the LORD, but on this occasion the illustration is tempered by the obscurity of truth, as 
by a cloud, and when it is evening and night there, they have obscurity of 
understanding, but this is tempered of the LORD by the good of love, as by a fire 
which illuminates. These are the things which were represented by the pillar of a 
cloud by day, and the pillar of fire by night, attendant on the sons of Israel in the 
wilderness. AC 8108.

338

PSALM 100

A Psalm of confession, or thanksgiving.

1. Make a joyful noise to JEHOVAH, all the earth.
2. Serve JEHOVAH with gladness; enter into his presence with a song.
3. Know you, that it is JEHOVAH who is GOD; he has made us, and not we 

ourselves; we are his people, and the sheep of his pasture.

4. Enter into his gates with thanksgiving, into his courts with praise; be thankful 

to him, bless his name!

5. For JEHOVAH is good; his mercy is everlasting, and his truth to all generations.

The Internal Sense

Celebration of the LORD, that he is to be worshiped from the heart because he is the 
former of the church, verses 1 to 3; that he is to be approached through the truths of 
the Word, and acknowledged, verses 4, 5.

Exposition

Verses 1 to 5. Make a joyful noise to JEHOVAH, all the earth, etc, etc. where it is 
manifest what is meant by confessing and confession, or thanksgiving, namely that it 
is to acknowledge JEHOVAH or the LORD, and the things belonging to him; hence also 
it is evident, that confession involves the celestial principle of love; and the genuine 
confession, or that which is from the heart, can only he made from good, the 
confession which is from truth being called the voice of singing, the voice of them 
who sport, and who play on instruments. AC 3880.

Verse 3. Know you, that it is JEHOVAH who is GOD; he has made us, and not we 
ourselves; we are his people, and the sheep of his pasture. Pasture, in this passage, 
denotes the truths in which man is instructed, and such things as relate to spiritual life;
for spiritual life is of such a nature, that if that pasture fail, it grows languid, and as it 
were lean, like the body when deprived of food. That pasture denotes the good and 
truth which recreate and sustain the soul and spirit of man, is clear from the LORD'S 
words in John, "I am the door, by me if any one enter in, he shall be saved, and shall 
go in and out and find pasture," where pasture denotes the goods and truths belonging
to those who acknowledge the LORD, and seek life from him alone. AC 6073.

Verse 4. Enter his gates with confession, (or thanksgiving), his courts with praise; 
confess to him, bless his name, where confession and confessing, or thanksgiving, 
proceeds-from the love of good, but praise and blessing from the love of truth. AC 
3880.         Real confession of the heart, inasmuch as it is grounded in celestial love, is
in a general sense confession; the man who is in this confession, acknowledges that all
good is from the LORD, and that all evil is from himself; and when he is in this 
acknowledgement, he is in a state of humiliation, for he acknowledges in such case, 
that the LORD is every thing belonging to him, and that he himself is respectively 

339

nothing; and when confession is made from this state, it is then grounded in celestial 
love. AC 3880.

340

PSALM 101

A Psalm of David.

1.
2.

3.

I will sing of mercy and judgement; to you, O JEHOVAH, will I sing.
I will act wisely in the way of the upright; when will you come to me? I will 
walk within my house in the integrity of my heart.
I will set no wicked thing before mine eyes; I hate the work of them that turn 
aside; it shall not cleave to me.

4. A perverse heart shall depart from me; I will not know a wicked man.
5. Whoever secretly slanders his neighbour, him will I cut off; him that has a 

high look and a proud heart, I will not suffer.

6. Mine eyes shall be upon the faithful of the earth, that they may dwell with me;

he that walks in the way of the upright, he shall serve me.

7. He who works deceit, shall not dwell within my house; he who speaks lies 

8.

shall not abide before mine eyes.
In the morning will I cut off all the wicked of the earth; yea, I will cut off all 
the workers of iniquity from the city of JEHOVAH.

The Internal Sense

Of a certain judgement by the LORD, that he is to be celebrated, verse 1; his integrity, 
and that he loves those who have integrity, verses 2, 3, 6, 7; that he rejects the wicked 
and the haughty, verses 4, 5; that the wicked will perish when the LORD comes, verse 
8.

EXPOSITION

Verses 1, 2. I will sing of mercy and judgement, etc, etc. From the contents of these 
verses it will appear, that a distinction is made between a just man and a man of 
integrity, or uprightness; for a just man has a respect to the love of charity, and a man 
of integrity has respect to the truth of charity; hence also it is evident that he is called 
just who does good, and he is called a man of integrity or of uprightness who does 
truth derived from good, which also is to do justice and judgement. AC 612.

Verse 5. Whoever secretly slanders his neighbour, him will I cut off. By bearing false 
witness in a natural sense, is not only meant to act in the character of a false witness 
but also to lie and to defame, or to slander. By bearing false witness in a spiritual 
sense is meant, to assert, and to persuade others, that what is false is true, and that 
what is evil is good, and vice verse: but in a supreme sense, by bearing false witness, 
is meant to blaspheme the Lord and the Word: these are what constitute the bearing 
false witness in a threefold sense. That these several kinds of false witness make a one
with every man who acts as a false witness, who tells a lie, and defames his 
neighbour, may appear from what was shown in the "Doctrine concerning the Sacred 
Scripture," in relation to the threefold sense of all that is contained in the Word, SS 5, 
6, 7, and 57. Inasmuch as a lie and truth are two opposites, it follows that so far as any
one shuns a lie as sin, so far he loves truth. So far as any one loves truth, so far he is 

341

desirous of knowing it, and so far he is affected in heart when he finds it; nor can any 
other attain to wisdom; and so far as he loves to do the truth, so far he is made 
sensible of the pleasantness of the light in which the truth is. The case is similar in 
respect to the subjects spoken of above; as in respect to sincerity and justice with him 
who shuns thefts of every kind; in respect to chastity and purity with him who shuns 
adulteries of every kind; and in respect to love and charity with him who shuns 
murders of every kind, etc. But he who is in the opposites, knows not any thing 
concerning these virtues; when yet they contain in them every thing that is any thing. 
Doc. of Life, DLife 87—89.

Verse 7. He who works deceit shall not dwell within my house. Where to dwell in the 
house of JEHOVAH, denotes to be and to live in the good of love, for this is the house 
of JEHOVAH. AC 3384.

Verse 7. He who works deceit; see Psalm 52:2, 3, 4, Exposition.

342

PSALM 102

A Prayer for the afflicted when he is overwhelmed, and pours out his complaint 
before JEHOVAH.

1. Hear my prayer, O JEHOVAH, and let my cry come to you.
2. Hide not your face from me; in the day when I am in distress, incline your ear 

to me; in the day when I call, answer me speedily.

3. For my days are consumed like smoke; and my bones are burnt up like fire-

wood.

4. My heart is smitten, and withered like grass; so that I forget to eat my bread.
5. Because of the voice of my groaning, my bones cleave to my flesh.
6.
7.
8. Mine enemies reproach me all the day; they that rave at me are sworn against 

I am like the pelican of the wilderness; I am become like the owl of the desert.
I am sleepless, and am become as a lonely bird upon the house-top.

me.

9. For I have eaten ashes like bread, and mingled my drink with weeping,
10. Because of your indignation and your anger; for you have lifted me up, and 

have cast me down.

11. My days are like a shadow that declines, and I am withered like grass.
12. But you, O JEHOVAH, abidest for ever, and your remembrance from generation 

to generation.

13. You shall arise, and have mercy upon Zion; for the time to favour her, yea, the 

appointed time is come.

14. For your servants take pleasure in her stones, and have compassion on her 

dust.

15. So the nations shall fear the name of JEHOVAH, and all the kings of the earth 

your glory.

16. When JEHOVAH shall have builded up Zion, he will appear in his glory;
17. He will regard the prayer of the destitute, and not despise their prayer.
18. This shall be written for the generation to come; and the people, which shall 

be created, shall praise JAH.

19. For he has looked down from the height of his sanctuary; from heaven has 

JEHOVAH beheld the earth;

20. To hearken to the groaning of the prisoner; to set at liberty the sons of death.
21. To declare in Zion the name of JEHOVAH, and his praise in Jerusalem;
22. When the peoples are gathered together, and the kingdoms to serve JEHOVAH.
23. He has afflicted my strength in the way; he has shortened my days.
24. I said, O my GOD, take me not away in the half of my days! your years are 

throughout all generations.

25. Of old have you laid the foundation of the earth, and the heavens are the work 

of your hands.

26. They shall perish, but you shall endure; yea, they all shall grow old like a 
garment, like a clothing shall you change them, and they shall be changed.

27. But you are the same, and your years shall not end.
28. The sons of your servants shall dwell in the land, and their seed shall be 

established before you.

343

The Internal Sense

A prayer of the LORD when he was in temptations even to despair, which state is 
described, verses 1 to 11; that nevertheless they who are out of the church expect 
mercy, that they may become a church, verses 12 to 18; that he will hear them, and 
have mercy, that out of them a church may be formed, verses 19 to 22; that He may 
not sink under temptations before that time, verses 23, 24; lest thereby the church and 
the heavens should perish, but they will be established, verses 25 to 28.

EXPOSITION

Verse 2. Hide not your face from me in the day when I am in distress, etc. It was said 
above that by the faces of JEHOVAH are signified the interior things of the Word, and 
of the church, and of worship; the reason is because the interior Divine things of the 
Word, of the church, and of worship, are all the Divine truths proceeding from the 
LORD, thus the LORD in heaven. What is here meant by the faces of JEHOVAH, every 
one may comprehend, namely the DIVINE BEING, or whatever is of the DIVINE BEING, 
thus mercy, peace, and all good, but in the universal sense the Divine truth, since in 
the Divine truth is all good; both with man and with angels there is Divine good and 
Divine truth, and without the latter there is not the former; for truth is the recipient of 
good, hence therefore it follows that if Divine good is not in Divine truth, there the 
faces of JEHOVAH are not. AC 10579.

Hence also it may be known what is signified by hiding or concealing the faces, when
it relates to JEHOVAH or the LORD, namely that it is to leave man in his own selfhood, 
and thence in the evils and falsities which arise from his selfhood; for man considered
in himself is nothing but what is evil and false, and is withheld from evils and falsities
by the LORD that he may be in good, which is effected by an elevation out of the 
selfhood. AE 412.

That to hear in a supreme sense denotes Providence, and that to see denotes foresight,
appears from those passages in the Word, in which eyes and also ears are predicated 
of JEHOVAH or the LORD. AC 3869.

Verse 3—5. My bones are burnt up like firewood. For the spiritual signification of 
bones, see Psalm 34:20, Exposition.

Verse 9. For I have eaten ashes like bread, etc. What these words signify, is evident 
from what was said just above, AC 7519, namely that by truth from the DIVINE BEING,
which is represented by Moses, the falsities of the lusts of those who infest are shown 
and manifested in heaven, whence the presence of heaven, and from presence the 
existence of such things amongst the evil, as are signified by the ulcers. That ashes 
denote what is false, may be confirmed from the passages where they are mentioned. 
AC 7520.

Verse 14. For your servants take pleasure in her stones, etc, etc. By the stones of 
Zion, in which the servants of JEHOVAH take pleasure, are understood Divine truths, 
for by Zion, to which JEHOVAH shall be merciful, is meant the church which is in 
celestial love. AE 717.

344

Verses 14, 15, 16, 17, 22, 23. You shall arise and have mercy upon Zion, etc. etc. 
Those words relate to the coming of the LORD, and to the redemption of the faithful by
him; his coming is signified by the time to have mercy upon her, and by the appointed 
time; the truths to be restored are signified by the stones in which the servants take 
pleasure; the establishment of the church and the worship of the LORD by Divine 
truths are described by what follows. AE 850.

By making heaven and earth in the Word is not meant the first creation itself of the 
visible heaven and earth, but the establishment of the church, and the regeneration of 
man; by heaven is meant its internal, and by earth its external; that this creation is 
meant, is manifest from the passages in the Word, where mention is made of creating,
as in David, the people who shall be created shall praise JAH, Psalm 102:18; again, 
"You sendest forth your spirit, they are created, and you renewest the faces of the 
earth, Psalm 104:30. AC 10373.

By the earth which GOD formed, and by the heavens which are the work of his hands, 
which shall perish, is signified the same as by the former earth, and former heaven 
which passed away, see Rev 21:1; and since the face of the earth and of the heavens 
in the spiritual world is entirely changed in the day of the last judgement, and in the 
place of the former a new earth and new heavens will exist, therefore it is said, that 
all will grow old as a garment, you shall change them as a clothing, and they shall be
changed; they are compared to garments, because garments signify external truths, 
belonging to those who were in the former heaven and in the former earth, which do 
not remain because they are not in internal truths; the state of Divine truth, which is to
remain from the LORD to eternity, is signified by you shall dwell, and you are the 
same, and your years shall not end, where by the years of GOD are signified the states 
of Divine truth; the sons of your servant shall dwell, and their seed shall be 
established before you, signifies that angels and men, who are recipient of Divine 
truth, shall have eternal life, and that the truths of doctrine belonging to them will 
continue for ever; the sons of the servants of GOD are angels and men, who are 
recipient of Divine truth, and the truths of doctrine are their seed. AE 708.

Verse 18. Shall praise JAH, see Psalm 68:4, Exposition.

Verse 19. For he has looked down from the height of his sanctuary, etc. Where 
sanctuary denotes the heaven where the truth of faith is, hence the term GOD is 
applied and not JEHOVAH, also the term king, because the term GOD is used where 
truth is treated of, and the term JEHOVAH where good is treated of. AC 8330.

Verse 20. To set at liberty the sons of death, see Psalm 79:11, Exposition.

Verse 21. The name of JEHOVAH. What is properly meant by the name of JEHOVAH, see
Psalm 79:9, Exposition.

Verses 24 and 27. I said, O my GOD, take me not away in the half of my days, etc. etc. 
That year signifies an entire period of the church from beginning to end, and 
consequently that year signifies time or period within the general time or period, may 
appear from the passages in the Word, where mention is made of years. That year in 
an internal sense, does not signify year, may also appear from this consideration, that 
the angels, who are in the internal sense of the Word, cannot form an idea of any year,

345

but inasmuch as year denotes a full period of time in the natural world, therefore 
instead of year they have an idea of what is full in respect to states of the church, and 
of what is external in respect to the states of heaven, times with them denoting states. 
AC 2906.

Some total period in the Word is marked either by a day, or by a week, or by a month, 
or by a year, yea, if it was even a hundred or a thousand years, as day in the first 
chapter of Genesis in which was signified the regeneration of man in the most ancient 
church, for a day and a year signify nothing else in the internal sense but time, and 
because they signify time, they signify state, wherefore a year is applied to denote 
time and state in the Word throughout. AC 893.

PSALM 103

A Psalm of David.

1. Bless JEHOVAH, O my soul, and all that is within me, bless his holy name!
2. Bless JEHOVAH, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits.
3. Who forgives all your iniquities; who heals all your diseases;
4. Who redeems your life from the pit; who crowns you with mercy and tender 

compassions;

5. Who satisfies your mouth with good, so that your youth is renewed like the 

eagle's.
JEHOVAH does justice and judgement for all the oppressed.

6.
7. He made known his ways to Moses, his doings to the sons of Israel.
8.
JEHOVAH is merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and of great mercy.
9. He will not chide to eternity, neither will he keep his anger for ever.
10. He has not dealt with us according to our sins, nor recompensed us according 

to our iniquities.

11. For as high as the heavens are above the earth, so great is his mercy towards 

them that fear him.

12. As far as the east is from the west, so far has he removed our transgressions 

from us.

13. Like as a father pities his children, so JEHOVAH pities them that fear him.
14. For he knows our frame; he remembers that we are dust.
15. As for man, his days are as grass; as a flower of the field so he flourishes.
16. For the wind passes over it, and it is no more, and the place thereof shall know

it no longer.

17. But the mercy of JEHOVAH is from everlasting to everlasting upon them that 

fear him, and his justice to children's children.

18. To those who keep his covenant, and to those who remember his 

commandments to do them,

19. JEHOVAH has established his throne in the heavens; and his kingdom rules over

all.

20. Bless JEHOVAH, you, his angels, you mighty in strength, who execute his 

Word, hearkening to the voice of his Word.

21. Bless JEHOVAH, all you, his hosts! you, his ministers, who do his pleasure.
22. Bless JEHOVAH all you his works, in all places of his dominion: bless JEHOVAH,

O my soul!

The Internal Sense

Celebration of the LORD for redemption and reformation, verses 1 to 7; out of mercy 
because he knows the infirmities of man, verses 8 to 18; that the heavens and the earth
are his, wherefore he is to be celebrated, verses 19 to 22.

347

Exposition

Verse 1. Bless JEHOVAH, O my soul. As the Psalmist here addresses his soul, or his 
internal man, it may be well to state in this place the true doctrine concerning the 
Internal and the External man, or mind. Man is so created as to be, at one and the 
same time, in the spiritual world, and in the natural world: the spiritual world is that in
which angels are, and the natural world is that in which men are. And because man is 
so created, therefore he is endowed with an internal and an external; an internal by 
which he may be in the spiritual world, and an external by which he may be in the 
natural world. His internal is what is called the internal man, and his external is what 
is called the external man.

Every man has an internal and an external; but there is a difference in this respect 
between the good and the evil. The internal with the good is in heaven and its light, 
and the external is in the world and its light, which light with them is illuminated by 
the light of heaven, so that with them the internal and the external act in unity, as the 
efficient cause and the effect, or as what is prior and what is posterior. But with the 
evil the internal is in the world and its light, as is also the external; wherefore they see
nothing from the light of heaven, but only from the light of the world, which light 
they call the light of nature: hence it is that the things of heaven are to them in 
darkness, whilst the things of the world are in light. It is therefore manifest that the 
good have an internal man and an external man, but that the evil have no internal man,
but only an external.

The internal man is what is called the spiritual man because it is in the light of heaven,
which light is spiritual; and the external man is what is called the natural man because
it is in the light of the world, which light is natural. The man whose internal is in the 
light of heaven, and his external in the light of the world, is a spiritual man as to each:
but the man whose internal is not in the light of heaven, but only in the light of the 
world, in which is also his external, is a natural man as to each. The spiritual man is 
what is called in the Word alive, but the natural man is what is called dead.

The man whose internal is in the light of heaven, and his external in the light of the 
world, thinks both spiritually and naturally, but when he thinks naturally his spiritual 
thought flows in into the natural, and is there perceived. But the man whose internal, 
together with his external, is in the light of the world, does not think spiritually, but 
materially; for he thinks from such things as are in the nature of the world, all which 
are material. To think spiritually, is to think of things as they essentially are, to see 
truths from the light of truth, and to perceive goods from the love of good: also to see 
the qualities of things, and to perceive their affections, abstractedly from matter: but 
to think materially, is to think, see, and perceive them together with matter, and in 
matter, thus in a gross and obscure manner respectively.

The internal spiritual man, regarded in himself, is an angel of heaven; and also, during
his life in the body, notwithstanding his ignorance of it, is in society with angels; and 
after his separation from the body he comes amongst them. But the merely natural 
internal man, regarded in himself, is a spirit, and not an angel; and also, during his life
in the body, is in society with spirits, but with those who are in hell; amongst whom 
he also comes after his separation from the body.,

348

The interiors which are of the mind, with those who are spiritual men, are also 
actually elevated towards heaven, for that is what they primarily regard; but the 
interiors which are of the mind with them who are merely natural, are turned to the 
world because that is what they primarily regard. The interiors which are of the mind 
[mens] are turned with every one to that which he loves above all things; and the 
exteriors which are of the mind [animus] are turned the same way as the interiors. 

They who have only a common [or general] idea concerning the internal and external 
man, believe that the internal man is what thinks and wills, and that the external is 
what speaks and acts because to think and to will is internal, and to speak and to act it 
external: but it is to be observed, that when man thinks intelligently, and wills wisely, 
he then thinks and wills from a spiritual internal; but when man does not think 
intelligently and will wisely, he thinks and wills from a natural internal. Of 
consequence, when man thinks well concerning the Lord and those things which are 
of the Lord, and well concerning his neighbour and those things which are of his 
neighbour, and wills well to them, he then thinks and wills from a spiritual internal 
because he then thinks from the faith of truth and from the love of good, consequently
from heaven: but when man thinks ill concerning them, and wills ill to them, he then 
thinks and wills from a natural internal, because he thinks and wills from the faith of 
what is false and from the love of what is evil, consequently from hell. In short, so far 
as man is principled in love to the Lord, and in love towards his neighbour, so far he 
is in a spiritual internal, from which he thinks and wills, and from which also he 
speaks and acts: but so far as man is in the love of self, and in the love of the world, 
so far he is in a natural internal, from which he thinks and wills, and from which also 
he speaks and acts.

It is so provided and ordered by the Lord, that so far as man thinks and wills from 
heaven, so far his internal spiritual man is opened and formed; it is opened into 
heaven even to the Lord, and it is formed according to those things which are of 
heaven. But on the contrary, so far as man does not think and will from heaven, but, 
from the world, so far his internal spiritual man is shut, and his external is opened; it 
is opened into the world, and it is formed according to those things which are of the 
world.

They with whom the internal spiritual man is opened into heaven to the Lord, are in 
the light of heaven, and in illumination from the Lord, and are thence in intelligence 
and wisdom; these see truth because it is truth, and perceive good because it is good. 
But they with whom the internal spiritual man is shut, do not know that there is an 
internal man, and much less what the internal man is; neither do they believe that 
there is a Divine, nor that there is a life after death, consequently they do not believe 
the things which are of heaven and the church; and for as much as they are only in the
light of the world and in illumination thence, they believe in nature as the Divine, they
see the false as truth, and they perceive evil as good.

He whose internal is so far external, that he believes nothing but what he can see with 
his eyes and touch with his hands, is called a sensual man; this is the lowest natural 
man, and is in fallacies concerning all the things which are of faith and the church. 
There are fallacies of the senses in things natural, civil, moral, and spiritual, and many
in each of them; but here I design to recite some of the fallacies in spiritual things. 
They who think from the fallacies of the senses, cannot understand, 

349

1. That man after death can appear as a man; nor that he can enjoy his sense as 

before; nor consequently that angels have such a capacity. 

2. They think, that the soul is only a vital something, purely etherial, of which no

idea can be formed. 

3. That it is the body alone which feels, sees, and hears. 
4. That man is like a beast, with this difference only, that he can express his 

thoughts by speech. 

5. That nature is all, and the first source from which all things proceed. 
6. That man imbues sciences and learns to think by an influx of interior nature? 

and its order. 

7. That there is no spiritual principle, and if there be, that it is a purer natural 

principle. 

8. That man cannot enjoy any blessedness, if divested of the delights of the love 

of glory, honour, or gain. 

9. That conscience is only a disease of the mind proceeding from the infirmity of 

the body, and from misfortunes, 

10. That the divine love of the Lord is the love of glory. 
11. That there is no Providence, but that all things come to pass from self derived 

prudence and intelligence. 

12. That honour and riches are real blessings bestowed by God: not to mention 

many other things of a similar nature. 

Such are the fallacies of the senses in spiritual things. Hence it may appear, that 
celestial things cannot be comprehended by them who are merely natural and sensual;
they are merely natural and sensual, whose internal spiritual man is shut, and whose 
natural man only is open.

The internal and external which have been treated of, are the internal and external of 
the spirit of man; his body is only an additional external, within which they exist; for 
the body does nothing from itself, but from its spirit which is in it. It is to be observed 
that the spirit of a man, after its separation from the body, thinks and wills, speaks and
acts, the same as before; to think and to will is its internal, and to speak and to act is 
its external; concerning which, see the Treatise on Heaven and Hell, HH 234 to 245, 
265 to 275, 432 to 444, 453 to 484. NJHD 36—46.

Verse 3. Who forgives all your iniquities. How sins or iniquities are forgiven, see 
Psalm 51:2, Exposition. 

Verse 3. Who heals all your diseases. Whence diseases originate, see Psalm 38:5, 7, 
11, Exposition.

Verse 4. Who redeems your life from the pit. As to what concerns redeeming, in the 
proper sense it signifies to restore and appropriate to himself what had been his own, 
and is predicated of slavery, of death, and of evil; when of slavery, they are meant 
who have been made slaves, in the spiritual sense, who are enslaved to hell; when of 
death, they are meant who are in damnation; and when of evil, as in the present case, 
they are meant who are in hell, for the evil, from which the angel redeems, is hell. 
Inasmuch as the LORD delivered man from these things, by making the Human 
principle in himself Divine, therefore his Divine Human principle is what in the Word 
is called REDEEMER, as in Isaiah, "I will help you, says JEHOVAH, and your Redeemer, 

350

the Holy One of Israel;" Isaiah 41:14; again, "Thus says JEHOVAH, the Redeemer of 
Israel, his Holy One," Isaiah 19:16. But that it is JEHOVAH himself in the Divine 
Human principle, is manifest from the following passages, "Thus says JEHOVAH, the 
King of Israel, and his Redeemer, JEHOVAH of Hosts, I am the First, and I am the Last, 
and besides me there is no GOD;" 45:6; and in David, "JEHOVAH, who redeems my life 
from the pit;" from which passages it is evident, that by JEHOVAH in the Word no other
is meant than the LORD, and JEHOVAH the Redeemer is his Divine Human principle. 
AC 6231.

To redeem from the pit denotes to deliver from damnation, which is signified by the 
pit. The reason why to redeem signifies to rescue from evils and to deliver from 
falsities, and also to rescue and deliver from hell is because from hell all evils and 
falsities belonging to man have their rise, and since these are removed by reformation 
and regeneration by the LORD, reformation and regeneration are also signified by 
redeeming or by redemption. AE 328.

Verse 5. Who satisfies your mouth with good, so that your youth is renewed like the 
eagle's. By an eagle is signified intelligence, and hence may be manifest what is 
signified by the LORD'S words, when they questioned him concerning the last 
judgement in Luke, "The disciples said, Where LORD? He said to them, where the 
body is, there the eagles will be gathered together," Luke 17:37; by the body is there 
signified the spiritual world, where all men are together both good and bad, and by 
eagles are signified those who are in truths and who are in falsities, thus who are in 
true intelligence, and who are in false intelligence, the latter intelligence is from the 
selfhood of man, but true intelligence is from the LORD by the Word. AE 281.

Verse 8. JEHOVAH is merciful and gracious. They who are in the LORD'S spiritual 
kingdom speak of favour or grace, and they who are in the LORD'S celestial kingdom 
speak of mercy. Unless such was the difference between favour and mercy, no mention
would have been made of doing favour and doing mercy. AC 10577

Inasmuch as there are two principles to which all things of the church have reference, 
namely love and faith, and whereas mercy is of love, and favour or grace, and also 
truth is of faith, therefore in the Word it is called mercy, and favour, or grace, when 
the LORD is implored, and mercy and truth when the LORD is described. AC 10577.

Verse 21. Bless JEHOVAH, all you, his hosts, etc. Inasmuch as truths and goods are the 
armies or hosts of JEHOVAH, therefore the angels are called his armies, where it is 
said, "Bless JEHOVAH, you his angels, mighty in strength," where angels are called 
armies from the truths and goods in which they are principled; nor were the angels 
alone called the armies of JEHOVAH, but also the luminaries of heaven, as the sun, the 
moon, and the stars, and this because by the sun was signified the good of love, by the
moon the good of faith, and by the stars the knowledges of good and truth; that those 
luminaries are called armies, is evident in the book of Genesis, "The heavens and the 
earth were finished, and all their armies, where by armies are meant all the luminaries
of heaven, but in the internal sense, in which the new creation of man is there treated 
of, are meant truths and goods. AC 7988.

PSALM 104

1. Bless JEHOVAH, O my soul! O JEHOVAH, my GOD, you are very great, you are 

clothed with glory and majesty.

2. Who covers himself with light as with a garment; who stretches out the 

heavens like a curtain;

3. Who lays the beams of his chambers in the waters; who makes the clouds his 

chariot; who walks upon the wings of the wind;

4. Who makes his angels winds, his ministers a flaming fire;
5. Who founded the earth upon its foundations; it shall never be moved.
6. You did cover it with the deep as with a garment; the waters stood above the 

mountains.

7. At your rebuke they fled! at the voice of your thunder they hastened away!
8. The mountains arose, the valleys sank down, to the place which you have 

founded for them.

9. You have set a boundary, they shall not pass over; they shall not return to 

cover the earth.

10. He sends forth springs into rivers; they run between the mountains.
11. They give drink to every beast of the field; the wild asses quench their thirst;
12. About them do the birds of the heavens dwell, from amidst the branches they 

utter their song.

13. He waters the mountains out of his chambers; the earth is satisfied with the 

fruit of your works.

14. He causes the grass to grow for the cattle, and herb for the service of man, that

he may bring forth bread out of the earth;

15. And wine which gladdens the heart of man; he makes his face to shine with 

oil, and with bread does he support the heart of man.

16. The trees of JEHOVAH are full; even the cedars of Lebanon which he planted.
17. Wherein the birds make their nests; the stork makes the fir-trees her house.
18. The lofty mountains are a refuge for the wild goats, the rocks for the conies.
19. He made the moon for the appointed seasons; the sun knows his setting.
20. You make darkness and it is night, when all the beasts of the forest creep forth.
21. The young lions roar after their prey, and seek their food from GOD;
22. The sun arises, they gather themselves together, and lie down in their 

dwellings.

23. Man goes forth to his work, and to his labour until the evening.
24. How manifold are your works, O JEHOVAH! in wisdom have you made them 

all; the earth is filled with your riches.

25. This great and wide sea, wherein are things creeping innumerable, both small 

and great beasts.

26. There go the ships; that leviathan, which you have made to sport therein.
27. All these wait upon you, to give them their food in due season.
28. You give it to them, they gather it; you open your hand, they are filled with 

good.

29. You hide your face, they are troubled; you take away their breath, they die, 

and return to their dust.

30. You sendest forth your spirit, they are created, and you do renew the face of 

the earth.

352

31. The glory of JEHOVAH endures for ever; JEHOVAH rejoices in his works;
32. He looks down upon the earth, and it trembles; he touches the mountains, and 

they smoke!

33. I will sing to JEHOVAH, while I live; I will sing praise to my GOD, while I have 

my being

34. May my meditation be pleasing to him! I will be glad in JEHOVAH.
35. Sinners shall be consumed out of the earth, and the wicked shall be no more: 

bless JEHOVAH, O my soul! HALLELUJAH!

The Internal Sense

Celebration of the LORD, because from him are Divine truths from the Word, verses 1 
to 4; of the literal sense of the Word, upon which the church is founded, verses 5 to 9; 
that from there all may be instructed, each according to the state of his understanding, 
verses 10 to 23; that from there are the knowledges of truth and goodness, of which 
consists spiritual nourishment, verses 24 to 30; that the good may be saved, and that 
the wicked may perish, verses 31 to 35.

Exposition

Verse 1. O my soul, see Psalm 103:1, Exposition.

Verses 1 to 9. JEHOVAH my GOD, you are very great, you are clothed with glory and 
majesty, etc. etc. The glory and majesty with which JEHOVAH, that is, the LORD, 
clothes himself, is Divine truth; the light with which he is covered as with a garment, 
is the Divine truth, such as it is in heaven and in the church; that this truth in the world
is light, see what is cited above, AC 9429; the chambers of which he lays the beams in
the waters, are the heavenly societies, and the waters are truths; the clouds which he 
makes his chariot, are truths from which doctrine is derived; the earth, concerning 
which it is said that it is founded upon its foundations, and that it shall never be 
moved, is the church; the foundations on which it is founded, are truths in ultimates, 
such as are those of the Word in its literal sense, hence it is said, that it shall never be 
moved; the deep, or abyss with which it is covered as with a garment, is scientific 
truth for the natural man; hence is evident what is meant by the boundary which they 
may not pass, namely that it is the ultimate of truth divine into which the interior 
things close, and on which as on a prop or foundation they subsist and rest. AC 9433.

Verse 2. He stretches out the heavens like a curtain. To cover himself with light as 
with a garment denotes Divine truths; hence to stretch out the heavens as a curtain 
denotes to enlarge the heavens by the influx of truth divine, whence comes 
intelligence and wisdom. AC 9595.

Verse 3. Who lays the beams of his chambers in the waters, who makes the clouds his 
chariot, who walks upon the wings of the wind. By waters, clouds, and wings of the 
wind is signified Divine Truth in ultimates, which is as the truth, or the sense of the 
letter of the Word; inasmuch as this is in ultimates, it is said that he lays the beams of 
his chambers in the waters, that he makes the clouds his chariot, that he walks on the 
wings of the wind; waters are truths in ultimates, in like manner clouds and wings of 
the wind; chariot is the truth of doctrine; that he makes his angels winds and his 

353

ministers a flaming fire, signifies that he makes them to become receptions of Divine 
truth and Divine good; by angels are meant those who are in the LORD'S spiritual 
kingdom, who as being receptive of Divine truth, it is said that he makes them winds, 
and by ministers are meant those who are in the Lord's celestial kingdom, who as 
being receptive of Divine good, it is said of them, that he makes them a flaming fire. 
AE 419.

In these few words are described heaven and the church, and at the same time doctrine
from the Word, he lays the beams of his chambers in the waters, signifies that the 
LORD forms heaven and the church from Divine truths; waters signify Divine truths, 
the chambers of JEHOVAH signify the heavens and the church, and to lay beams 
signifies to form; he makes his clouds his chariot, signifies doctrine from ultimate 
Divine truths; clouds are ultimate Divine truths, such as are in the sense of the letter 
of the Word, and chariot is doctrine; this is said because the all of the doctrine of the 
Word must be formed from the sense of the letter of the Word; he walks on the wings 
of the wind, signifies life from spiritual influx; to walk, signifies to live, and when it 
relates to the Lord, signifies life itself; the wings of the wind are the spiritual things of 
the Lord. AE 594.

Verse 3. Who walks upon the wings of the wind. That wings denote truth divine, is 
manifest from the following passages: "They that wait on JEHOVAH are renewed in 
strength, they ascend on wings as eagles," Isaiah 11:31; and in David, "GOD rode upon
the clouds and did fly, he was carried on the wings of the wind" Psalm 18:10. Psalm 
104:3, speaking of the Divine truth and its power. AC 8764.

Verse 4. JEHOVAH makes his angels winds; his ministers a flaming fire. Thatfire 
signifies love, is evident from these words; that he makes his angels winds signifies 
that he makes them receptive of Divine truth, consequently Divine truths; and that he 
makes his ministers a flaming fire signifies that they are receptive of Divine good, 
consequently that they are Divine goods; that by angels in the Word is meant the 
LORD as to Divine truth, and in a respective sense are meant the recipients of Divine 
truth from the LORD, may be seen above, AE 130, 200; and that by ministers are 
signified the recipients of Divine good, which is of the Divine love, may be seen also 
above, AE 155; hence it is evident that by flaming fire is signified the good of love. 
AE 504.

Verses 10, 11, 12. He sends forth springs into rivers, they run between the mountains. 
They give drink to every beast of the field; the wild asses quench their thirst. About 
them do the birds of the heavens dwell, from amidst the branches they utter their 
song. To send forth springs into rivers signifies to give intelligence by truths from the 
Word; they run between the mountains signifies that they must be from the good of 
love; springs are truths from the Word, rivers are those things which are of 
intelligence, mountains are the goods of love; the instruction of those who are in the 
good of the church, is signified by giving drink to the beasts of the fields; the 
instruction of those in the church who desire truths is signified by the wild asses 
quenching their thirst; that hence the understanding is perfected, is signified by the 
birds dwelling near them; by the beasts of the fields in a spiritual sense are meant the 
nations which are in the good of life; by wild asses are signified natural truths, by 
thirst desire for truths, and by the birds of the heavens are signified thoughts grounded
in understanding. AE 423.

354

Springs or fountains signify knowledges, beasts of the field goodness, wild asses 
rational truths. AC 1949.

Springs or fountains denote truths; mountains the love of good and of truth; to afford 
drink is to instruct; the beasts of the field are those who live thereby; the wild asses 
are those who are principled only in rational truth. AC 2702.

Verse 13. He waters the mountains out of his chambers; the earth is satisfied with the 
fruit of your works. To water the mountains in the spiritual sense is to bless those who
are principled in love to the LORD, and in love towards their neighbour; that mountain 
denotes the celestial principle of love, see AC 795; hence out of his chambers denotes 
from the interiors of heaven. AC 5694.

Such things would not have been said in the Divine Word, unless each of them had 
been correspondences of spiritual and celestial things, and hence holy, for otherwise 
what had been meant by rivers from springs, by going among the mountains, by 
affording drink to the wild beast of the field, by the wild asses thence quenching their 
thirst, and by the birds of the heavens dwelling near them, and uttering their song 
among the branches; but when by springs are meant the truths of the Word, by rivers 
intelligence thence derived, by mountains the good things of love, by the wild beasts 
of the field the affections of truth, by the wild asses the rational principle, and by birds
of the heavens knowledges from Divine truths, in this case the Word is holy and 
Divine, which otherwise would be merely huma. AE 1100.

It is to be noted that in several passages, at one time mention is made of beasts, and at
another time of wild beasts, and that by wild beasts is not meant wild beasts in that 
sense in which it is generally received, for wild beast in the Hebrew tongue is derived 
from an expression which signifies life, hence instead of wild beasts in certain 
passages it would have been better called animal, which may also appear from this, 
that the four animals, in which the cherubs were seen, by which is signified Divine 
providence and protection, in Ezekiel i to x, are called wild beasts, in like manner by 
John in the Apocalypse, where the subject treated of is concerning the four animals 
about the throne, by which are also meant cherubim; still however in the Word a 
distinction is clearly made between beasts and wild beasts, and by beasts are signified
the affections of the natural man, which are of his will, and by wild beasts the 
affections of the natural man, which are of his understanding. AE 650. See Psalm 
50:10, Exposition.

Verse 14. He causes the grass to grow for the cattle, and herb for the service of man, 
that he may bring forth bread out of the earth. Here also grass denotes the produce of 
the field, and by it in the internal sense is there signified truth. AC 7571.

Verses 14, 15. Bread,—wine. Few know what is meant by the bread and wine in the 
Holy Supper. The Holy Supper was instituted by the LORD, that by means thereof 
there may be conjunction of the church with heaven, thus with the LORD: it is 
therefore the most holy thing of worship.

But in what manner conjunction is effected by it is not apprehended by those who do 
not know any thing concerning the internal or spiritual sense of the Word, for they do 
not think beyond the external sense, which is the sense of the letter. From the internal 

355

or spiritual sense of the Word it is known what is signified by body and blood, and 
what by bread and wine, also what is signified by eating.

In that sense, the body or flesh of the LORD is the good of love, as is the bread 
likewise; and the blood of the LORD is the good of faith, as is the wine likewise; and 
eating is appropriation and conjunction. The angels who are attendant on man when 
he receives the sacrament of the supper, understand those things in no other manner, 
for they perceive all things spiritually; hence it is that a holy principle of love, and a 
holy principle of faith then flows in with man from the angels, thus through heaven 
from the LORD; hence a conjunction takes place.

From these considerations it is evident, that when man takes the bread, which is the 
body, he is conjoined to the LORD by means of the good of love to him from him; and 
when he takes the wine, which is the blood, he is conjoined to the LORD by means of 
the good of faith in him from him. But it is to be noted, that conjunction with the 
LORD by means of the sacrament of the holy supper takes place solely with those who 
are in the good of love to, and faith in the LORD from the LORD: with these, there is 
conjunction by means of the Holy Supper; with others, there is presence but not 
conjunction.

Besides, the Holy Supper includes and comprehends all the divine worship instituted 
in the Israelitish church; for the burnt offerings and sacrifices, in which the worship of
that church principally consisted, were called, in a single word, bread; hence also the 
Holy Supper is the completion [or fullness] of that representative worship. NJHD 210
—214.

Verses 16, 17. The trees of JEHOVAH are full; the cedars of Lebanon which he has 
planted. Wherein the birds make their nests; the stork makes the fir-trees her house. 
The trees of JEHOVAH and the cedars of Lebanon denote the spiritual man, birds 
denote his rational or natural truths, which are a kind of nest. AC 776.

Verse 19. He made the moon for the appointed seasons; the sun knows his setting. 
Where the moon denotes intelligence, and the sun wisdom from the LORD; the setting 
of the sun denotes the obscurity of each principle; to make darkness and it is night 
denotes the moderating a state of obscurity; for, that the angels have changes of state 
between the highest degree of light and a less degree, or between the highest degree of
wisdom and a less degree, and that these changes of state are as the morning when the
sun rises, and as mid-day when he is in his meridian height, and as the evening when 
he sets, and afterwards as morning again, by the Divine mercy of the LORD will be 
shown elsewhere. AC 3623. See also the Work on Heaven and Hell, 154,—161.

Verses 21, 22. The young lions roar after their prey, and seek their food from GOD; the
sun arises, they gather themselves together, and lie down in their dwellings. By these 
words is described the state of the angels of heaven when they are not in a state of 
intense love and of wisdom thence derived, and when they return into that state; the 
former state is described by the young lions roaring for their prey, and by seeking 
their food from GOD; the latter state is described by the sun arising, and their being 
gathered together, and lying down in their dwellings; by the young lions are 
understood the angels of heaven; by roaring is understood desire, by prey and food 
the good which is of love, and the truth which is of wisdom; by the sun arising is 

356

understood the LORD as to love, and thence wisdom; by being gathered together, their 
returning into a celestial state, and by lying down in their dwellings, a state of 
tranquillity and peace, concerning these two states of the angels of heaven, see the 
Work on Heaven and Hell, 154 to 161. Not only the angels, but the LORD himself is 
called a lion; " Behold, the lion has conquered, who is of the tribe of Judah, the root 
of David," Apoc 5:5. AE 278.

Verses 24, 25, 26, 27. How manifold are your works, O JEHOVAH! in wisdom have you
made them all; the earth is full of your riches. This great and wide sea, wherein are 
things creeping innumerable; both small and great beasts. There go the ships; that 
leviathan, which you have made to sport therein. All these wait upon you, that you 
may give them their food in due season. In this passage is not meant the sea, neither 
are meant creeping things, animals, leviathan, and ships, but such as appertain to the 
man of the church, for these wait for JEHOVAH; by the great and wide sea is signified 
the external or natural man, who receives goods and truths scientifically, great being 
predicated of good, and wide of truth; by creeping things are signified living 
scientifics; by great and small animals are signified the knowledges of good and truth
of every kind, superior and inferior, also in general and specifically; by ships are 
signified doctrinals; by leviathan all things of the natural man in the complex, who is 
said to sport in the sea, from the delight of knowing and thence growing wise; since 
man by virtue of those things is affected with the desire of knowing and of 
understanding, it is said, all things wait for you, that you may give them their food in 
due season, to wait signifies to desire, and food signifies science and intelligence, for 
man of himself does not desire them, but by virtue of those things which appertain to 
him from the LORD, although it appears as if man did it of himself. AE 514.

Verse 25. Things creeping innumerable; see Psalm 69:34, Exposition.

Verse 26. Leviathan which you have made to sport therein. He who does not know 
that there is a spiritual sense in singular the things of the Word, knows no otherwise 
than that by the sea and by the ships in this passage are meant the sea and ships, and 
by leviathan the whales that are therein, and by sporting their consociations; but the 
Word, which as to every iota is divine, does not consist in such things; but when the 
spiritual things which are signified are understood in their stead, then it becomes 
divine; sea in the internal sense denotes the congregation of scientific truths, thus 
what is external with man, and in the church; leviathan denotes the scientific principle
in general, and sporting denotes the delight thence derived. AC 10416.

Verses 27, 28. All these wait upon you, that you may give them their food in due 
season, etc. In this passage celestial and spiritual food is meant in the internal sense, 
when the material is meant in the sense of the letter; hence it is evident how the 
interior and exterior things of the Word, or the things which are of the spirit therein, 
and the things which are of the letter, correspond to each other, so that whilst man 
understands them according to the sense of the letter, the attendant angels understand 
the same according to the spiritual sense; thus the Word was written, not only to be 
serviceable to the human race, but also to heaven, on which account all the 
expressions therein are significative of heavenly things, and all the things are 
representative thereof, and this even to the smallest jot and tittle. AC 5149.

357

Verses 28, 30. You give it to them, they gather it; you open your hand, they are filled 
with good, you sendest forth your spirit, they are created, and you renewest the face 
of the earth. That to create here denotes to reform is evident, for by giving to them 
and by their gathering is signified that they receive truths which are given by the 
LORD; by you open your hand, they are filled with good, is signified that they receive 
the good which flows in from the LORD; by you sendest forth your spirit, they are 
created, is signified that they are reformed as to life according to Divine truth; and by 
you renewest the face of the earth, is signified the establishment of the church. AE 
294.

Verse 29. You hide your face, they are troubled, etc. What is here meant by the face of 
JEHOVAH, every one may comprehend, namely the DIVINE BEING, and whatever is of 
the DIVINE BEING, thus mercy, peace, and all good, but in the universal sense the 
Divine truth, since in the Divine truth is all good; both with man and with angels there
is Divine good in Divine truth, and without the latter there is not the former; for truth 
is the recipient of good, thus also of mercy and of peace; hence now it follows, that 
where Divine good is not in Divine truth, there the faces of JEHOVAH are not. AC 
10579.

Verse 30. You sendest forth your spirit, they are created, etc. That by the wind of 
JEHOVAH, or his breath, or spirit, is signified the life which is of heaven, and which is 
of man who is in heaven, that is, of a regenerate man, is manifest from these words, 
the reason why the wind of the nostrils of JEHOVAH or the LORD denotes heaven is 
because by it is meant the breath of life, thus life divine, and as this constitutes the life
of heaven, by the wind of the nostrils of JEHOVAH is signified heaven. AC 8286.

By making heaven and earth in the Word is not meant the first creation itself of the 
visible heaven and earth, but the establishment of the church, and the regeneration of 
man therein; by heaven is meant his internal, and by earth his external; that this 
creation is meant, is manifest from the passages in the Word, where mention is made 
of creating, as in David, "You sendest forth your spirit, they are created, and you 
renewest the face of the earth." Psalm 104:30. AC 10373.

To be created denotes to be created anew, that is, to be regenerated. AC 10570.

Concerning regeneration, or being created anew, see Psalm 87:5, Exposition.

The Internal Sense

Concerning the establishment of the church by the LORD, and the reformation of the 
natural man; celebration of the LORD by reason of his works for the establishment of 
the church, verses 1 to 7; of the establishment of the church in the beginning, and its 
protection from the falsities of evil, verses 8 to 15; when there was no longer any 
truth, verse 16; that the LORD came, and they afflicted him, verses 17, 18; who 
afterwards was made the GOD of heaven and earth, verses 19 to 22; thence they of the 
church were natural men, and in scienti-fics, verses 23, 24; wherefore their natural 
man was purged of falsities and evils of all kinds, which infested them, concerning 
which, verses 25 to 36; and afterwards they had truth, and goodness, and protection 
from falsities, verses 37 to 41; which makes them to become a church, verses 42 to 
45.

Exposition

Verses 2 to 6. Sing to him, sing psalms to him, tell of all his wonderful works, glory in
his holy name, let the heart of those who seek JEHOVAH rejoice. Seek you JEHOVAH 
and his power, seek his face continually; remember his wonders which he has done, 
his miracles, and the judgements of his mouth, etc. That by these words is signified 
that from the LORD are all the means productive of power, appears from the 
signification of wonderful works and miracles, as denoting the means of Divine 
power. The reason why wonderful works denote the means of Divine power is because
by these men were led to believe that JEHOVAH was the supreme GOD, yea, that there 
was no GOD besides him, consequently that he alone was to be worshiped; and they 
who were in this truth were next introduced into the truths which teach the worship of 
him, which truths are the means of power; for all power in the spiritual sense is in the 
truths which are from the LORD; for power in the spiritual sense consists in shunning 
and ejecting from ourselves the infernal crew, which is effected solely by truths: 

360

hence now it is, that by doing what is wonderful is signified that from the LORD are all
the means productive of power. AC 8304.

Verse 4. That the face of JEHOVAH or of the LORD is mercy, may be evident from the 
Word, for the face of JEHOVAH or the LORD in a proper sense, is the Divine love itself, 
and because it is the Divine love, it is of mercy, for mercy is grounded in love towards
the human race beset with so great misery. AC 5585.

Verse 6. You seed of Abraham his servant, you sons of Jacob his chosen. By Abraham 
his servant is meant the LORD as to the Divine Human principle; in like manner also 
the LORD as to the Divine Human principle, is meant by Israel his servant, by Jacob 
his servant, and by David his servant. AC 3441.

Verse 9. By confirmation here, which is signified by an oath, is meant the LORD'S 
conjunction with those who are in his kingdom, for an oath is the confirmation of a 
covenant, and by covenant is signified conjunction. AC 3375.

Verse 16. When he called a famine upon the land, he broke the whole staff of bread. 
Inasmuch as staff signifies the power of Divine truth, it also signifies the power of 
resisting falsities and evils; by breaking the staff of bread is signified that good and 
truth in the church shall fail, for bread here signifies both. AE 727.

Verse 16. When he called a famine upon the land; he broke the whole staff of bread. 
That a famine signifies a scarcity of knowledge, appears from other parts of the Word,
as in David, "Again when he called for a famine upon the land, he broke the whole 
staff of bread," where to break the whole staff of bread, signifies to be deprived of 
celestial food, for the life of good spirits and of angels is supported by no other food 
than by the knowledges of goodness and truth, and by goods and truths themselves, 
hence comes the signification of famine and of bread in the internal sense. AC 1460.

Inasmuch as by bread is signified the LORD, it denotes also the celestial things which 
appertain to love and which are of the LORD, for the LORD is the very celestial 
essential principle, because he is the very essential love, that is, the very-essential 
mercy; and in consequence thereof bread is also all that is celestial.

Verses 17 to 23. He sent a man before them, even Joseph who was sold for a servant, 
whose feet they afflicted with fetters, his soul came into iron, until the time when his 
word came, when the saying of JEHOVAH tried him, then the king sent and loosed him, 
even the ruler of the peoples, and let him go free; he made him lord over his house, 
and ruler over all his possessions, to bind his princes at pleasure, and to teach his 
senators wisdom; Israel came into Egypt, and Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham. 
By Joseph in this passage is described the LORD, how he was received when he came 
into the world, how he was tempted, and afterwards made LORD of heaven and earth, 
how he subjugated the hells, reduced the heavens to order, and established the church:
how he was received and tempted is described by Joseph's being sold for a servant, 
by his feet being afflicted with fetters, and his soul coming into iron: his being sold 
for a servant, signifies that he was esteemed as vile; by his feet being afflicted with 
fetters signifies that he was, as it were, bound and in prison, because there was no 
longer any natural good; by his soul coming into iron signifies affliction, because 
there was no longer any natural truth, but instead thereof the false: his conquering the 

361

hells by the Divine truth from his Divine principle, is signified by until the time when 
his Word came, and the saying of JEHOVAH proved him, his Word signifying the Divine
truth, and the saying of JEHOVAH the Divine good, from which Divine truth proceeds; 
that the LORD thus acquired to his Human from his Divine full power over all things 
of heaven and earth is described by the king sent and loosed him, even the ruler of the
peoples, and let him go free, and made him lord over his house, and ruler over all his 
possessions; by the king who sent, and the ruler of the peoples who set him free, is 
signified the Divine truth and the Divine good, which were in him, and from him, by 
king the Divine truth, and by ruler the Divine good, for in the Word the LORD is called
king from Divine truth, and LORD or ruler from Divine good; by the house over which
he was set, is signified heaven and the church as to good, and by possessions heaven 
and the church as to truth; the same is hereby signified as by the words of the LORD 
himself, "that all things of the Father's are his, and all his are the Father's, and that all 
power is given to him in heaven and on earth," John 17:10, Mat 28:18; that from the 
Divine he withholds the heavens from falsities, and keeps them in truths, and thus 
gives them intelligence and wisdom is described by his binding the princes at 
pleasure, and teaching the senators, or elders, wisdom, by princes are signified those 
who are in truths, and by senators those who are in intelligence and wisdom. That in 
such case the church on earth is established by him is meant by Israel then coming to 
Egypt, by Israel is signified the church, for the establishment of the church by the 
LORD was represented by the sons of Israel coming into Egypt, also by the LORD when
an infant being brought into Egypt, Matt 2:14, 15; that all things of the church at that 
time perished, is understood by Jacob becoming a sojourner in the land of Ham; by 
Jacob is signified the church belonging to all who are in the good of life, and by the 
land of Ham is signified the church destroyed. In this and other passages in the Word 
by Jacob and Israel are not meant the Jewish nation, but the church formed in those 
who are in love to the LORD; for with the sons of Israel, or the posterity of Jacob, 
there was not any church, but only the representative of a church. AE 448.

Verses 23 and 36. Israel came Into Egypt, and Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham; 
he smote also all the first-born of their land, the beginning of all their strength. The 
worship of the Egyptians grounded in principles of what is false arising from truth 
separate from good, or, from faith separate from charity is called the tents of Ham; 
hence is further confirmed what is signified by the first-born of Egypt being slain. AC
3325. See Psalm 78:51, Exposition, what is further meant by Ham.

Verse 26. He sent forth Moses his servant, and Aaron whom he had chosen. Moses is 
called a servant, because servant is predicated of truths, AC 3409, and chosen of 
good, AC 3755. AC 9506.

Verse 26. What Moses and Aaron signify when mentioned together, see Psalm 99:6, 
Exposition.

Verse 27. Signs and wonders; see Psalm 78:43, Exposition.

Verses 29 and 30. He turned their waters into blood, and caused their fish to die; 
their land swarmed with frogs, even in the chambers of their kings. It is said in the 
chambers of their kings, because reasonings against truths from false principles is 
meant; the chambers of kings denote interior truths, and in the opposite sense, interior 
falsities. AC 7351.

362

Frogs denote reasonings, and the ground of this signification is because they are in the
waters, and because they make a croaking noise, and are also among things unclean. 
What reasonings from mere false principles are, may be illustrated by examples; he 
reasons from mere falsities, who attributes all things to nature, and scarcely any thing 
to the Divine Being, when yet all things are from the Divine Being, and nature is only 
an instrument by which the Divine Being operates. AC 7351, 7352.

Verse 31. Lice in all their borders. Lice denote the evils which are in the sensual 
principle, or altogether in the external man, hence is the correspondence, because lice 
are in the outermost skin, and are there within filth, and under a scab; of this 
description also is the sensual principle of those who have been in the knowledge of 
faith, but in a life of evil; when that knowledge is taken away from them, as is the 
case with such in the other life, they then become of a gross and stupid mind; they 
have occasionally appeared, being filthy and causing aversion; infestations of evil are 
signified by their biting. That lice have this signification cannot be confirmed by other
passages from the Word, for they are mentioned only in David, where he is speaking 
of Egypt, "lice in all their borders;" borders signify in extremes. AC 7419.

Verse 32. He gave them hail for rain, flaming fire in their land. Hail and shower 
denote the vastation of good and truth by the falsities arising from evil. AC 7553.

Verse 33. He smote their vines and their fig-trees, etc. Inasmuch as in the genuine 
sense vine signifies the good of the intellectual principle, and fig-tree, the good of the 
natural principle, or what is the same thing, vine the good of the interior man, and fig-
tree, the good of the exterior, therefore very frequently in the Word, where mention is 
made of vine, the fig-tree is also named. AC 5113.

Verse 36. He smote also all the first-born of their land, the beginning of all their 
strength. That hereby is signified that by it truth has first ability, appears by the 
signification of the beginning of strength, as denoting the first ability, and whereas 
strength is predicated of truth, it is the first ability belonging to truth which is 
signified. AC 6344..

Verse 40. They asked and he brought quails. By selav, or quails, is signified natural 
delight productive of good; the reason why selav, or the quail, denotes natural delight 
is because it was a bird of the sea, and by a bird of the sea is signified the natural 
principle, and by its flesh which was desired, delight, see above, AC 8341. The reason
why it denotes also the productive of good is because it was given in the evening; for 
in the other life when there is a state which corresponds to evening, then the good 
spirits, and also the angels, are remitted into a state of natural affections in which they
were principled when in the world, consequently into the delights of their natural 
man; the reason is, that hence may come good, that is, that hence they may be 
perfected, AC 8426. All are perfected by the implantation of faith and charity in the 
external or natural man, for unless those principles are there implanted, good and truth
cannot flow-in from the internal or spiritual man, that is, from the LORD through that 
man, for there is no reception; and if there be no reception, the influx is at a stand and 
perishes, yea the internal man is also closed. Hence it is evident that the natural 
principle must be altogether accommodated, that it may be receptacle: This is done by
delights, for the goods which are of the natural man are called delights, because they 
are made sensible. The reason why selav denotes natural delight is, as was said, 

363

because it was a bird of the sea, for it was said that it was fetched from the sea, "A 
wind went forth from JEHOVAH, and fetched selav from the sea., and let [it] down over
the camp," Numb 11:31, and by a bird of the sea and its flesh is signified natural 
delight, and in the opposite sense the delight of craving; this is signified by selav in 
the following passage in Moses, "The rabble which was in the midst of the people 
lusted craving, and were desirous to have flesh, and said, now is our soul dry, nor is 
there any thing but this manna before our eyes: A wind went forth from JEHOVAH, and
fetched selav from the sea, and let it down over the camp: The people arose all that 
day, and all the night, and all the following day, and gathered selav; they who 
gathered the least, gathered ten omers, which they spread forth for themselves, by 
spreading forth around the camp: The flesh was yet between their teeth, before it was 
swallowed, when the anger of JEHOVAH was kindled into the people, and JEHOVAH 
smote the people with an exceeding great plague; whence he called the name of that 
place the sepulchres of craving, because there they buried the people that lusted," 
Numb 11:5, 6, 31, 32, 33, 34, in which passage selav denotes the delight of craving. It
is called the delight of craving when the delight of any corporeal or worldly love bath 
dominion, and occupies the whole man, so as to extinguish the good and truth of faith 
belonging to him; this delight" is what is described as occasioning their being smitten 
with a great plague; but the natural delight, which is signified in this chapter by selav, 
which was given to the people in the evening, is not the delight of craving, but it is the
delight of the natural or external man corresponding to the good of the spiritual or 
internal man; this delight has in it spiritual good, whereas the delight of craving, 
spoken of Num. xi. has in it infernal evil; each is called delight, and each is also made
sensible as delight, but there is the greatest difference between them, for one has 
heaven in it the other has hell. In it, also one becomes heaven to man, and the other 
becomes hell to man, when the external is put off. The case herein is like that of two 
women, who appear in their external form alike beautiful in countenance and 
agreeable in their manners, but in the internal form they are altogether dissimilar, one 
for instance is chaste and sound, the other is wanton and corrupt, thus one as to her 
spirit belongs to the angels, the other as to her spirit belongs to the devils; but their 
respective qualities do not appear, except when the external is unfolded, and the 
internal is revealed. These observations are made to the intent that it may be known 
what the natural delight is in which is good, which is signified by the selav, or quail, 
in this chapter, and what the natural delight is in which is evil, which is signified by 
the selav, or quail, in Num. xi. AC 8452.

Verse 45. HALLELUJAH, praise you JAH. The reason why Jah denotes the Divine Truth 
proceeding from the Divine Human principle of the LORD is because Jah is from 
JEHOVAH, and is called Jah, because it is not the esse, but the existere from the esse, 
for Divine Truth is the existere, but the Divine Good is the esse. AC 8267.

PSALM 106

1. O, give thanks to JEHOVAH, for he is good, for his mercy is for ever.
2. Who can express the mighty acts of JEHOVAH? Who can show forth all his 

praise?

3. Blessed are they who keep judgement, who at all times do justice.
4. Remember me, O JEHOVAH, with the favour which than bearest to your 

people; O, visit me with your salvation!

5. That I may behold the good of your chosen, that I may rejoice in the gladness 

of your nation; that I may glory with your inheritance.

6. We have sinned, with our fathers, we have committed iniquity, we have done 

wickedly.

7. Our fathers understood not your wonders in Egypt, they remembered not the 
multitude of your mercies, but were rebellious at the sea, even at the Red Sea.
8. Yet he saved them for his name's sake, that he might cause his mighty power 

to be known.

9. Yea, he rebuked the Red Sea and it was dried up, so he led them through the 

depths, as through the desert.

10. He saved them from the hand of him that hated them, and redeemed them 

from the hand of the enemy.

11. But the waters covered their adversaries; there was not one of them left.
12. Then they believed his words, they sang his praise.
13. Soon they forgot his works, and they waited not for his counsel;
14. But lusted exceedingly in the wilderness, and tempted GOD in the desert;
15. And he gave them their request, but sent leanness into their soul.
16. They envied Moses also in the camp, Aaron, the saint of JEHOVAH.
17. The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan, and covered the company of 

Abiram.

18. A fire was kindled in their company; the flame burned up the wicked.
19. They made a calf in Horeb, and worshiped a molten image.
20. Thus they changed their glory into the likeness of an ox that eats grass.
21. They forgot GOD their SAVIOUR, who had done great things in Egypt,
22. Wonderful works in the land of Ham, fearful things by the Red Sea.
23. Therefore he said that he would destroy them, unless Moses his chosen had 
stood before him in the breach, to turn away his wrath from destroying them.

24. They despised the desirable land; they believed not his words,
25. But murmured in their tents, and hearkened not to the voice of JEHOVAH;
26. Therefore he lifted up his hand against them, to cast them down in the 

wilderness;

27. To cast down their seed amongst the nations, and to scatter them through the 

lands.

28. They joined themselves to Baal-peor, and did eat the sacrifices of the dead.
29. Thus did they provoke him to anger by their deeds; a plague broke in upon 

them.

30. Then stood up Phineas, and executed judgement, and the plague was stopped;
31. Which has been accounted to him for justice, from generation to generation, 

even for ever.

365

32. They excited him to anger at the waters of Meribah, and evil befell Moses on 

their account;

33. Because they provoked his spirit, so that he spoke rashly with his lips.
34. They destroyed not the peoples, as JEHOVAH had commanded them;
35. But mingled themselves with the nations, and learned their works;
36. Yea, they served their idols; they were a snare to them.
37. They even sacrificed their sons and their daughters to devils.
38. And shed innocent blood, the blood of their sons and of their daughters, whom
they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan; so that the land was polluted with 
blood.

39. Thus did they defile themselves with their works, and go a whoring with their 

own deeds.

40. Therefore was the anger of JEHOVAH kindled against his people, so that he 

abhorred his own inheritance.

41. And he gave them up into the hand of the nations, and they that hated them 

ruled over them.

42. Their enemies oppressed them, and they were bowed down under their hand.
43. Many times did he deliver them, but they provoked him with their counsel, 

and were brought low for their iniquity.

44. Yet when he looked upon their distress, when he heard their cry,
45. He remembered his covenant with them, and repented according to the 

multitude of his mercies.

46. Yea, he caused them to be pitied by all who held them captive.
47. Save us, O JEHOVAH, our GOD, and gather us from amongst the nations, to give

thanks to your holy name, to triumph in your praise.

48. Blessed be JEHOVAH, the GOD of Israel, from eternity to eternity, and let all the 

people say, Amen. HALLELUJAH.

THE INTERNAL SENSE.

Of the church established among the Jewish nation, that it became perverse and fell 
off. A prayer of the LORD to the FATHER, to assist him, that he may see the church 
restored, verses 1 to 5; that they of the church, although they saw Divine miracles, fell
off and yet were preserved, verses 6 to 8; as at the Red Sea, and afterwards again in 
the wilderness; and nevertheless they rebelled, verses 9 to 34; that they entirely 
destroyed and profaned the goods and truths of the Word, verses 35 to 39; that 
therefore the church among them was left by the LORD, and destroyed, verses 40 to 
43; that then they without the church were heard, verses 44 to 46; and that out of them
a church will be established, which will worship the LORD, verses 47, 48.

EXPOSITION

Verse 1. Hallelujah. That hereby is signified that the all of faith, and hence of glory, is
from Divine truth, which is from JEHOVAH, appears from the signification of a song, 
when concerning JEHOVAH, as denoting the glorification of the LORD, the reason why 
Jah denotes the Divine truth proceeding from the Divine Human principle of the 
LORD, is because Jah is from Jehovah, and is called Jah, because it is not the esse, but
the existere from the esse. AC 8267.

366

Verse 4. Remember me, O JEHOVAH, with the favour of your people; O, visit me with 
your salvation. That to remember, when concerning the LORD, denotes to have 
compassion, and thus to preserve or deliver from a principle of mercy, is manifest 
from this and many other passages, where Divine remembrance is spoken of. AC 
9849.

Verse 5. That I may behold the good of your chosen, that I may rejoice in the gladness
of your nation; that I may glory with your inheritance. That nation in the internal 
sense, where the LORD is treated of, and the celestial things of his love, signifies him, 
and all celestial things, may appear from the signification of a nation or nations, when
spoken of in the Word. The signification of a nation, as denoting the celestial things of
love, and the good thence derived, had its rise in that perceptivity, which distinguished
the men of the most ancient church into house, families, and nations, and thus 
rendered them perceptive of the LORD'S kingdom. AC 1416.

Verse 7. Your wonders in Egypt; see Psalm 78:43, Exposition.

Verse 9. He rebuked the Red Sea, and it was dried up; so he led them through the 
depths, as through the wilderness. By depths in old time was signified hell, and the 
phantasies and persuasions of what is false were likened to waters and streams of 
water; so also hells occasionally appear, namely as depths and seas. The wicked 
spirits who devastate man, also who tempt him, are from that source; and the 
phantasies which they infuse, and the lusts which they kindle in man, are as 
inundations and exhalations from that source. AC 756.

Verse 17. The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan, and covered the company of 
Abiram. The reason why Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, with their company, were 
swallowed up by the earth, although they took the fire from the altar, and therewith 
burnt incense, was because by their murmuring against Moses and Aaron, was 
signified the profanation of the good of celestial love, since by Moses and Aaron was 
represented the LORD; for to murmur, that is, to rebel against the LORD, and at the 
same time to be engaged in holy offices, is profanation. AE 324.

Verse 19. They made a calf in Horeb, and worshiped the molten image. By making a 
calf in Horeb, and by worshiping a molten image, is signified idolatrous worship, 
which is that of ceremonies, of statutes, of judgements, and of precepts, in the external
form only, and not at the same time in the internal; and that thus in their heart they 
were idolaters; by changing glory into the effigy of an ox that eats grass, is signified 
that they alienated themselves from the internal things of the Word and of the church, 
and worshiped what is external, which is merely a scientific principle. From these 
considerations it may now be manifest what is signified by a calf, or what is molten, 
and what is meant in David, where he says, "They made a calf in Horeb, and changed 
glory into the effigy of an ox that eats grass." AC 10407.

Verse 22. Wondrous works in the land of Ham. That Ham signifies what is corrupt in 
the church, arising from worship in externals, without internals. Such persons in the 
ancient church were called Ham, because they lived the life of all lust, only supposing
that they may be saved by faith without regard to their life. AC 61063. See further 
concerning Ham, Psalm 78:51, Exposition.

367

Verse 23. Therefore he said that he would destroy them, had not Moses his chosen 
stood before him in the breach, to turn away his wrath, lest he should destroy them. 
That by a breach is signified the infraction and perversion of truth by separation from 
good, is evident from this passage, where to stand in the breach denotes also to take 
heed lest falsities break in, as in David, "JEHOVAH said that he would have destroyed 
the people, had not Moses his chosen stood in the breach before him," where, to stand
in the breach denotes also to take heed lest falsities break in. AC 4926.

Verses 26, 27. Therefore he lifted up his hand against them, to cast them down in the 
wilderness. To cast down their seed amongst the nations, and to scatter them in the 
lands. By casting down their seed amongst the nations, and dispersing them into the 
lands, is signified that Divine Truth with them will perish by evils and by falsities. AE
768.

Verse 28. They joined themselves to Baal-peor. By Baal-peor is signified the 
adulteration of good. AE 655.

Verse 30. Then stood up Phineas, and executed judgement, and the plague was 
stopped. They who are born within the church, and from infancy have imbued the 
principles of the truth of the church, ought not to enter into marriages with those who 
are out of the church, and have thereby imbued such things as are not of the church; 
the reason is because there is no conjunction between them in the spiritual world, for 
every one in that world is consociated according to good and the truth thence derived; 
and since there is no conjunction between such in the spiritual world, neither ought 
there to be any conjunction on earth; for marriages regarded in themselves are 
conjunctions of minds, [animi,] and of minds, [mentes,] the spiritual life of which 
[minds] is derived from the truths and goods of faith and charity; on this account 
marriages on earth, between those who are of a different religion, are also accounted 
in heaven as heinous; and especially between those who are of the church with those 
who are out of the church; this also was the reason why the Jewish and Israelitish 
nation was forbidden to contract matrimony with the Gentiles, Deut 7:3, 4, and why it 
was altogether heinous to commit whoredom with them, this was signified by the 
plague mentioned in Numb 25:1 to 9, which Phineas stopped. This appears still more 
evident from the origin of conjugial love, as being from the marriage of good and 
truth, see AC 2727 to 2759; when conjugial love descends thence, it is heaven itself in
man; this [heaven] is destroyed when two conjugial partners are of dissimilar hearts 
grounded in dissimilar faith. AC 8998.

Verse 32. At the waters of Meribah; see Psalm 95:8, 9, 10, Exposition.

Verse 37. Yea, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters to devils. This was 
altogether infernal; but by sacrificing sons and daughters, in the spiritual sense, were 
signified by evil lusts, to destroy the truths and goods of the church, for sons signify 
the truths of the church, and daughters its goods. AE 586.

Verses 38, 39. And shed innocent blood, the blood of their sons and of their 
daughters, whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan, etc. To shed the blood of sons
and of daughters, in the internal sense, denotes that they extinguished all the truths of 
faith and goods of charity; to sacrifice sons and daughters to the idols of Canaan, 

368

signifies to profane those things which are of faith and charity by external worship, 
separate from internal. AC 1167.

369

PSALM 107

1. O, give thanks to JEHOVAH, for he is good; for his mercy endures for ever.
2. Thus let the redeemed of JEHOVAH say, whom he has redeemed from the hand 

of the adversary,

3. And gathered together out of the lands, from the east and from the west, from 

the north and from the south.

4. They wandered in the wilderness, in a desolate way, they found no city of 

habitation.

5. Hungry and thirsty, their souls fainted within them.
6. Then they cried to JEHOVAH in their straight; he delivered them out of their 

distresses.

7. And he led them forth by the right way, that they might go to a city of 

habitation.

8. Let them praise JEHOVAH for his goodness, for his wonderful works to the sons

of man!

9. For he satisfies the longing soul, and fills the hungry soul with goodness;
10. Such as sit in darkness and the shadow of death, bound in affliction and iron.
11. Because they rebelled against the words of God, and condemned the counsel 

of the MOST HIGH,

12. Therefore he brought down their heart with trouble; they fell down, and there 

was none to help.

13. Then they cried to JEHOVAH in their straight, he saved them out of their 

distresses;

14. He brought them forth out of darkness and the shadow of death, and burst their

bonds to pieces.

15. Let them praise JEHOVAH for his goodness, and his wonderful works to the 

sons of man;

16. For he has broken in pieces the gates of brass, and cut the bars of iron to 

pieces.

17. Fools, because of their transgression, and because of their iniquities, were 

afflicted;

18. Their soul abhorred all food, and they drew near to the gates of death;
19. Then they cried to JEHOVAH in their straight, he saved them out of their 

distresses.

20. He sent his Word and healed them, and delivered them from their pits.
21. Let them praise JEHOVAH for his goodness, and his wonderful works to the 

sons of man;

22. Yea, let them sacrifice the sacrifices of thanksgiving, and declare his works 

with a song!

23. They who go down to the sea in ships, that do business upon the mighty 

waters;

24. They behold the works of JEHOVAH, and his wonders in the deep;
25. For he commands and raises the stormy wind, which lifts up the waves 

thereof.

26. They ascend to the heavens, they go down to the depths, their soul is melted 

because of trouble;

370

27. They reel and stagger like a drunken man, and all their wisdom is swallowed 

up;

28. Then they cry to JEHOVAH in their straight, and he brings them out of their 

distresses.

29. He makes the storm a calm, so that the waves thereof are still.
30. Then are they glad because they are still, and he guides them to the haven 

which they desired.

31. Let them praise JEHOVAH for his goodness, and his wonderful works to the 

sons of man;

32. Let them exalt him in the congregation of the people, let them praise him in 

the assembly of the elders!

33. He turns rivers into a wilderness, springs of water into a parched land.
34. A fruitful land into barrenness, for the wickedness of those who dwell therein.
35. He turns the wilderness into a lake of waters, and dry land into springs of 

water.

36. And there he makes the hungry to dwell, that they may erect a city of 

habitation;

37. And sow fields, and plant vineyards, which may yield fruits of increase.
38. He blesses them, so that they multiply greatly, and he suffers not their cattle to 

decrease.

39. Again they are reduced and brought low through the oppression of wickedness

and sorrow.

40. He pours contempt upon princes, and causes them to wander in the wilderness,

where there is no way.

41. But the poor he sets on high from affliction, and makes families like a flock.
42. The upright shall behold and rejoice, and all iniquity shall stop her mouth.
43. They who are wise will observe these things, yea, they shall understand the 

mercies of JEHOVAH!

The Internal Sense

Of the new church which the LORD redeemed, verses 1 to 3; that it is in the falsities of
ignorance, but in the desire of truth and good, verses 4 to 8; that it is in ignorance and 
defect of truth, verses 9 to 15; that they have no spiritual nourishment, which 
nevertheless they will have through the Word, verses 16 to 21; when in knowledges, 
that they will be admitted to temptations and preserved, verses 22 to 31; thanksgiving 
to the LORD, because they of the vastated church are rejected, verses 32 to 34, 39, 40; 
and they of the new church accepted, with whom truths and goods will be multiplied, 
Verses 35 to 38, 41 to 43.

EXPOSITION

Verses 2, 3, 4. Thus let the redeemed of JEHOVAH say, whom he has redeemed from the
hand of the adversary; and gathered together out of the lands from the east and from 
the west, from the north and from the south. They wandered in the wilderness in a 
desolate way, they found no city of habitation. Speaking of those who are in ignorance
of good and truth; from the east and from the west denotes those who are in ignorance
of good, from the north and from the south denotes those who are in ignorance of 
truth; of those who are in ignorance of good it is said, that they wandered in a 

371

wilderness, and of those who are in ignorance of truth that they wandered in a 
desolate way; and concerning the ignorance of both, it is said that they found no city 
of habitation, that city denotes doctrine of truth may be seen, AC 402, and that 
habitation is predicated of good, see AC 2268. AC 3708.

These words are spoken in general of the redeemed, specifically of the sons of Israel 
in the wilderness, and by them are described the temptations of those who are 
regenerated by the LORD; by the city of habitation which they did not find is signified 
the doctrine of life, which with man makes the church; and whereas the church is 
formed with man by a life according to doctrine, through the enduring of temptations,
it is said that JEHOVAH led them forth by a right way, that they might go to a city of 
habitation; the want of truth even to despair, and still the desire thereof, is signified 
by being hungry and thirsty, and their soul fainting in the way. AE 730.

Verse 9. For he satisfies the longing soul, and fills the hungry soul with goodness. 
Denoting those who desire knowledges. AC 1460.

Verses 10, 14. Shadow of death; see Psalm 23:4, 5, Exposition.

Verse 18. Gates of death; see Psalm 9:13, 14. Exposition.

Verse 20. He sent his word and healed them, and delivered them from their pits. That 
the Word in the supreme sense is the LORD as to Divine truth, or, what is the same 
thing, that the Word is the Divine truth proceeding from the LORD, is manifest from 
this passage. AC 9987.

That pits denote falsities of doctrine, and falsities of evil, see Psalm 57:4, Exposition.

Verses 23, 24. They who go down to the sea in ships, that do business upon the mighty
waters. They behold the works of JEHOVAH, and his wonders in the deep. In this 
passage also ships denote knowledges and doctrinals, and therefore it is said, they 
who go down to the sea in ships see the works of JEHOVAH, and his wonders in the 
deep, for such things are seen by those who are in knowledges and doctrinals derived 
from the Word. AC 6385.

Verses 33, 34. He turns rivers into a wilderness, springs of water into a parched land;
a fruitful land into barrenness, for the wickedness of those who dwell therein. By the 
rivers which are turned into a wilderness, is signified intelligence from the 
understanding of truth, and also of the Word as to its interior sense, devastated by 
falsities from evil, rivers denoting such things as are of intelligence, and a wilderness 
where those things are not, but instead thereof falsities from evil. By the springs of 
waters which are turned into a parched land, is signified that the ultimate things of 
the understanding, which are called the knowledges of truth and good, are without all 
light and spiritual affection of truth, waters denoting truths, parched land the 
deprivation thereof by reason of there being no light and affection, and the springs 
denoting the ultimates thereof, such as are the truths of the literal sense of the Word. 
By the fruitful land which shall be turned into barrenness or saltness, is signified the 
good of love and of life deeply vastated by falsities, barrenness or saltness denoting 
the devastation of truth by falsities, and whereas all devastation by falsities is from 

372

evil of the life, it is therefore added, for the wickedness of them that dwell therein. AE 
730.

Verses 35, 36. He turns the wilderness into a lake of waters, and dry land into springs
of water, and there he makes the hungry to dwell, that they may erect a city of 
habitation. In this passage the illustration of the gentiles is treated of; by making the 
wilderness a lake of waters are signified similar things as above; and there he makes 
the hungry to dwell, signifies for those who desire truths, these being understood by 
the hungry in the Word; that they may erect a city of habitation, signifies that from 
those truths they may make for themselves doctrine of life, a city denoting doctrine, 
and to inhabit denoting to live. AE 730.

Verses 36, 37, 38. And sow fields, and plant vineyards, which may yield fruits of 
increase, etc. The subject treated of in the whole of this Psalm is concerning the 
coming of the LORD and redemption by him; that then they will have truths, by which 
the church will be planted amongst them, is signified by their sowing fields and 
planting vineyards; that thence they will have the good things of the church, and 
thereby an increase of truths, is signified that, they will produce fruit, that JEHOVAH 
will bless them, no that they will be multiplied greatly; that in such case all good 
affections of the natural man will remain with them, is signified by their cattle not 
being diminished; that those affections otherwise will perish by evils, is signified by 
their being diminished and bowed down by the oppression of wickedness, AE 650.

373

PSALM 108

A Song, a Psalm of David.

1. O GOD, my heart is prepared; I will sing and utter a psalm, even my glory is 

prepared.

2. Awake, O psaltery and harp! I will awake in the morning.
3.

I will praise you, O JEHOVAH, amongst the peoples; and I will sing praises to 
you amongst the nations.

4. For great above the heavens is your mercy, and your truth to the skies.
5. Be you exalted above the heavens, O GOD, and your glory above all the earth;
6. That your beloved ones may be delivered; save with your right hand, and 

answer me.

7. GOD has spoken by his holiness, I will exult, I will divide Shechem, and 

measure out the valley of Succoth.

8. Gilead is mine, Manasseh is mine, Ephraim is the strength of my head, Judah 

is my lawgiver.

9. Moab is my washpot, over Edom will I cast out my shoe; over Philistia will I 

triumph.

10. Who will bring me into the fortified city? Who will lead me into Edom.
11. Will not you, O GOD, you that have cast us off, and will not you, O GOD, go 

forth with our hosts?

12. Give us help from trouble, for vain is the help of man.
13. With GOD we shall do valiantly, for he will tread down our adversaries.

The Internal Sense

A prayer of the LORD to the FATHER to assist and show his power, verses 1 to 5; that 
they who are about to be of the church may be delivered, verse 6; an answer that the 
former must be destroyed, verse 7; and an internal and an external church established, 
verses 8, 9; that the HUMAN essence will be made DIVINE, when the hells are subdued, 
verses 10 to 13.

Exposition

Verse 2. Awake, O psaltery and harp; I will awake in the morning. Confession and 
glorification from the good of truth, or from spiritual good, and from the truth of good
or from spiritual truth, are expressed in these words, the good of truth is expressed by 
singing, and making confession amongst the nations, and the truth of good, by playing
on instruments amongst the people, for by nations in the Word are meant those who 
are in good, and by people those who are in truth; the reason why it is so said is 
because in the Word, where mention is made of good, mention is also made of truth, 
and this by reason of their marriage. AE 323.

Verse 4. For great above the heavens is your mercy, and your truth to the skies. In 
these words mercy signifies the Divine good of the Divine love, and truth the Divine 
truth, and since Divine truth is the light of heaven, as has been just now said, therefore

374

it is said, your truth even to the skies; by skies therefore, in the plural number, is 
signified Divine light even to the highest heaven, where it is in the highest degree. AE
541.

Verse 7. God has spoken by his holiness, I will exult; I will divide Shechem, and 
measure out the valley of Succoth. The holy principle of truth is the good which is 
from truth; that this is the signification of the huts or tents which are called Succoth, is
also evident from many passages in the Word. The quality of this state is what is 
involved in Succoth, namely the quality of the holy state of truth from good at that 
time, for Succoth signifies tents, and tents the holy principle of truth, as was shown 
just above. The like also is signified by Succoth in David, "I will divide Sechem, and 
measure out the valley of Succoth." AC 4392.

Verse 8. Gilead is mine, etc.; see Psalm 60:7. Exposition.

Verse 8. Ephraim is the strength of my head. Many parts of the prophetical writings, 
where the church is treated of, treat also of the understanding of the Word, and it is 
taught that the church cannot exist but where there is a just understanding of the 
Word, and that the state and nature of the church is always to be determined by the 
manner in which the Word is understood by those who belong to the church. The 
prophets, in many parts of their writings, describe the Israelitish and Jewish church as 
totally destroyed and annihilated, in consequence of falsifying the meaning or 
understanding of the Word; for the destruction of the church proceeds from no other 
source than this. The understanding of the Word, both true and false, is described in 
the prophetic writings, particularly in the prophet Hosea, by Ephraim; for the 
understanding of the Word in the church is signified in the Word by Ephraim, 
inasmuch as the understanding of the Word constitutes the church, therefore Ephraim 
is called "A dear son, and a pleasant child," Jerem 31:20; "The firstborn," Jerem 31:9; 
"The strength of the head of JEHOVAH," Psalm 60:7, 108:8; "A mighty man," Zech 
10:7; "He that fills the bow," Zech 9:13; and the children of Ephraim are called 
"Armed and shooters with the bow," Psalm 78:9; for by a bow is signified doctrine 
derived from the Word, combating with falsities. For the same reason also, "Israel set 
his right hand upon Ephraim, and blessed him," Gen 48:14; and he was also accepted 
in lieu of Reuben, Gen 48:5: and for the same reason, Ephraim, with his brother 
Manasseh, under the name of their father Joseph, was exalted by Moses, in his 
blessing of the children of Israel, above all the rest, Deut 33:13 to 17. But the state 
and nature of the church, when the understanding of the Word is destroyed, is also 
described in the writings of the prophets by Ephraim, particularly in Hosea, as in 
these passages: "Israel and Ephraim shall fall in their iniquity; Ephraim shall be 
desolate; Ephraim is oppressed and broken in judgement; I will be to Ephraim as a 
lion; I, even I, will tear and go away, I will take away, and none shall rescue him," 
Hos 5:5, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14; "O Ephraim, what shall I do to you? For your goodness is 
as a morning cloud, and as the early dew it goes away," Hosea 6:4; "They shall not 
dwell in the land of JEHOVAH, but Ephraim shall return to Egypt, and shall eat unclean
things in Assyria," Hosea 9:3; the land of JEHOVAH is the church; Egypt is the 
scientific principle of the natural man; Assyria is reasoning founded on it; therefore it 
is said, that Ephraim shall return into Egypt, and shall eat unclean things in Assyria. 
"Ephraim feeds on wind, and follows after the east wind; he daily increases lies and 
desolations; he makes a covenant with Assyria, and oil is carried into Egypt," Hosea 
12:1; to feed on wind, to follow after the east wind, to increase lies and desolations, is

to falsify truths, and so to destroy the church. The same is also signified by the 
whoredom of Ephraim, for whoredom signifies the falsification of the understanding 
of the Word, that is, of its genuine truth; as in these passages: "Eor now, O Ephraim, 
you commit-test whoredom, and Israel is defiled," Hosea 5:3; "I have seen a horrible 
thing in the house of Israel; Ephraim has committed whoredom there, and Israel is 
defiled," Hosea 6:10; Israel means the church itself, and Ephraim the understanding 
of the Word, which determines the state and quality of the church; wherefore it is said,
Ephraim commits whoredom, and Israel is defiled. But as the church amongst the 
children of Israel and Judah was totally destroyed by falsifications of the Word, 
therefore it is thus said of Ephraim, "I will give you up, Ephraim, I will deliver you 
up, Israel, I will make you as Admah, I will set you as Zeboim," Hosea 11:8. Now 
since the prophet Hosea, from the first chapter to the last, treats of the falsification of 
the Word, and of the consequent destruction of the church, and because the 
falsification of the Word is there signified by whoredom, therefore he was 
commanded, for the purpose of representing that state of the church, "to take to 
himself a wife of whoredoms, and children of whoredoms," Hos 1:1; and again, "to 
take to himself an adulteress," Hos 3:1. We have quoted these passages, for the sake 
of showing and proving from the Word, that the quality of the church is always 
determined by its understanding of the Word; and that it is excellent and precious, if 
its understanding be grounded on the genuine truths of the Word, but that it is ruined, 
yea, filthy, if it be grounded on truths falsified. For a further confirmation, that by 
Ephraim is signified the understanding of the Word, and in a contrary sense the 
falsification of it, and that thence proceeds the destruction of the church, the other 
places which treat of Ephraim may be referred to; as in Hosea 4:17, 18, 7:1, 11, 8:9, 
11, 9:11, 12, 13, 16, 10:11, 11:3, 12:1, 8, 14, 13:1, 12; Isaiah 17:3, 28:1; Jeremiah 
4:15, 31:6, 18, 1. 19; Ezekiel 37:16, 48:5; Obadiah 1:19; Zechariah 9:10. D. S. S. 79.

Verse 8. Judah in my lawgiver. That hereby are signified the truths which are from the 
celestial kingdom in inferior principles, appears from the signification of lawgiver, 
and from the signification of feet, as denoting natural principles, thus inferior 
principles, for natural things are beneath, and celestial things are above; it is said, a 
lawgiver from beneath the feet, that the spiritual of the celestial principle may be 
signified or truth which is from good; therefore also it is said, from between the feet, 
that the truth which is from good may be signified. AC 6372.

Verse 9. Moab is my washpot. The subject treated of in this Psalm is concerning 
Moab, and by him concerning those who suffer themselves to be tempted by false 
principles, where washpot denotes good defiled by false principles. AC 2468.

Verse 9. Over Philistia will I triumph. The reason why Philistia, which also was a 
continent of the land of Canaan, even to Tyre and Sidon, signified the interior truths of
faith was because the ancient representative church had been there also, as is evident 
from the remains of divine worship amongst them. AC 9340.

PSALM 109

To him that presides: a Psalm of David.

1. O GOD of my praise, be not you silent!
2. For the mouth of the wicked, and the mouth of the deceitful, are opened 

against me; they speak against me with a lying tongue.

3. Yea, they encompass me with words of hatred, and fight against me without 

cause.

4. For my love they are my adversaries, but I give myself to prayer.
5. But they place upon me evil for good, and hatred for my love.
6. Set you over him a wicked man, and let Satan stand at his right hand.
7. When he shall be judged, let him go forth condemned, and let his prayer 

become sin.

8. Let his days be few; let another take his office;
9. Let his children be fatherless, and his wife a widow; 
10. Yea, let his children be vagabonds and beggars; let them seek their bread out 

of their desolate places;

11. Let the usurer take all that he has; and let strangers plunder his labour;
12. Let there be no one extending mercy to him; let there be no one to pity his 

fatherless children;

13. Let his posterity be cut off; in the generation following let their name be 

blotted out;

14. Let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered by JEHOVAH, and let not the sin 

of his mother be blotted out;

15. Let them be before JEHOVAH continually, that he may cut off their memory 

from the earth.

16. Because he remembered not to show mercy, but persecuted the afflicted and 

needy man, yea, the broken-hearted in order to put him to death.

17. Since he loves cursing, let it come upon him; since he delights not in blessing, 

let it be far from him.

18. Since he clothes himself with cursing as with his vest, let it come into the 

midst of him like water, and like oil into his bones;

19. Let it be to him as the garment with which he is covered, and as the girdle with

which he is continually girded.

20. Let this be the reward of JEHOVAH to mine adversary, and to those who speak 

evil against my soul.

21. But do you, O JEHOVIH, my LORD, deal with me according to your name; 

deliver me, for good is your mercy.

22. For I am afflicted and needy, and my heart is wounded within me.
23. I am gone like the shadow when it declines; I am driven away like a locust.
24. My knees are weak through fasting, and my flesh fails of fatness.
25. I am become a reproach to them; they who see me, shake their heads.
26. Help me, O JEHOVAH, my GOD, O save me according to your mercy.
27. That they may know that this is your hand, and that you, O JEHOVAH, have 

done it.

28. Let them curse, but do you bless; when they rise up let them be ashamed; but 

let your servant rejoice.

377

29. Let mine adversaries be clothed with disgrace, and let them be covered with 

their shame as with a mantle.

30. I will greatly celebrate JEHOVAH with my mouth; yea, I will praise him 

amongst the multitudes.

31. For he shall stand at the right hand of the poor, to save him from those who 

condemn his soul.

The Internal Sense

Of the perverse Jewish church, that it rejected the LORD, and despised and hated him, 
verses 1 to 6; that they will perish in the judgement, and that others will be received in
their stead, among whom the church will be, verses 7 to 12; that it will be the same 
with their posterity, who will perish because they will be in the falsities of evil, and 
will reject the LORD, verses 13 to 20; to the FATHER that he would succour him 
because he is esteemed as evil and of no account, verses 21 to 25; that they may be 
put to shame, verses 26 to 29; thanksgiving to the FATHER for his assistance, 30, 31.

Exposition

Verse 1. Be not you silent. That the LORD appears absent and silent in temptations, see
Psalm 88:1, Exposition.

Verse 2. For the mouth of the wicked, and the mouth of the deceitful are opened 
against me, etc. Evils are done either from enmity, or from hatred, or from revenge, 
and either by deceit or without deceit; but evils by deceit are the worst because deceit 
is a poison which destroys with infernal venom, for it goes through the whole mind, 
even to its interiors; the reason is because he who is in deceit meditates evil, and 
thereby nourishes his understanding and delights it, and thus destroys every thing 
therein which is of man. AC 9013.

Verse 4. But I give myself to prayer. Prayer considered in itself is discourse with GOD, 
and at such time a certain internal contemplation of those things which are the objects 
of prayer, to which corresponds a certain similar principle of influx into the 
perception or thought of the mind of him who prays, so that there is a kind of opening 
of man's internals towards God; but this with a difference according to man's state, 
and according to the essence of the thing which is the object of prayer. If the prayer 
be grounded in love and faith, regarding only celestial and spiritual things as its object
and ends, then in the prayer there exists somewhat resembling a revelation, which is 
manifested in the affection of the person praying, as to hope, consolation, or some 
internal joy; hence it is that to pray, in an internal sense, signifies to be revealed. In 
the present case this is more especially signified because it is said of a prophet, and a 
prophet is meant the LORD, whose prayer was nothing else but internal discourse with 
the Divine [principle,] and at the same time revelation; that revelation attended the 
prayer of the LORD, appears from Luke, "It came to pass, when JESUS was baptized, 
and prayed, that heaven was opened," Luke 3:21: and again, "It came to pass, that 
JESUS took Peter, James, and John, and went up into a mountain to pray; and as He 
prayed, the fashion of His countenance was changed, and his clothing was white 
glistering," Luke 9:28, 29: So in John, "When He prayed, saying, FATHER, glorify 
your name, then came there a voice from heaven, I have both glorified it, and will 

378

glorify it again;" John 12:27, 28; where it is evident, that the prayer of the LORD was 
discourse with the Divine principle, and revelation at that time. AC 2535.

Worship does not consist in prayers and in external devotion, but in a life of charity, 
prayers are only the externals thereof, for they proceed from the man by his mouth, 
wherefore according to the quality of the man as to his life, such are his prayers; it 
matters not for a man to assume an humble deportment, to be upon his knees, and sigh
when he prays, these are external things, and unless the externals proceed from 
internals, they are only gestures and sounds without life. In every thing which a man 
speaks there is affection, and every man, spirit and angel, is his own affection, for 
their affection is their life; it is the affection itself which speaks, and not the man 
without it, wherefore according to the quality of the affection, such is the praying. 
Spiritual affection is what is called charity towards our neighbour; to be in that 
affection is true worship; prayer is what thence proceeds; hence it may appear that the
essential principle of worship is a life of charity, and the instrumental thereof is 
gesture and prayer, or that the primary [constituent] of worship is a life of charity, and
its secondary is praying, from which it is evident that they who place all divine 
worship in oral piety, and not in actual piety, err exceedingly; actual piety is to act in 
every work and in every function from what is sincere and right, and from what is just
and equitable, and this because it is commanded by the LORD in the Word; for thus 
man in every work looks to heaven and to the LORD, with whom he is thus conjoined; 
but to act according to sincerity and rectitude, justice and equity, solely from fear of 
the law, of the loss of fame, or of honour and gain, and to think nothing concerning 
the divine law, concerning the precepts of the Word, and concerning the LORD, and 
notwithstanding to pray devoutly in temples, is external piety, which however holy it 
may appear, yet it is not piety, but is either hypocrisy, or somewhat feigned derived 
from habit, or somewhat persuasive from a false principle that therein alone consists 
divine worship; for such a one does not look from his heart to heaven and to the 
LORD, but only with the eyes, the heart looking to self and to the world, and the mouth
speaking from the habit of the body only and its memory; by such worship man is 
conjoined to the world and not to heaven, also to himself and not to the LORD. AE 
325.

Verse 6. Place you over him a wicked man, and let Satan stand at his right hand. This 
is prophetic respecting the LORD, and concerning his temptations, which he sustained 
in a measure of severity exceeding those of all other persons; and whereas the LORD in
his temptations from Divine love fought against the hells which were most hostile to 
Him, it is said, they place upon me evil for good, and hatred for my love; and whereas 
infernal evil and false principles prevail amongst them, it is said, "Place you over him 
a wicked man, and let Satan stand at his right hand," when to stand at the right hand 
signifies to be altogether possessed, and Satan signifies the infernal false principle, 
with which he was to be possessed. AE 740.

Verse 10. Let his children be vagabonds. That to be a vagabond, denotes not to know 
what is true and good, AC 382.

Verse 14. Let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered by JEHOVAH, and let not the 
sin of his mother be blotted out. Whereas several expressions in the Word have also an
opposite sense, so likewise has the word father, and in this sense it signifies evil, and 
in like manner mother, which in the genuine sense signifies truth, in the opposite sense

379

the false principle; that this is the case, may be evident from the following passage: 
"Let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered by JEHOVAH, and let not the sin of his 
mother be blotted out." AC 3703.

Verses 18 to 20. Since he clothes himself with cursing as with his vest, let it come into 
the midst of him like water, and like oil into his bones, etc. These words in the spiritual
sense, are to be understood concerning the LORD; for where David speaks concerning 
himself in the Psalms, it is understood in that sense concerning the LORD, for David, 
as a king, represents the LORD, and thence signifies him as to the Divine spiritual 
[principle,] which is the royalty of the LORD: the reward of them that are adversaries 
to the LORD, and that speak evil against his soul, is described as hell originating in the
love of the false and evil, namely by putting on cursing as his vest, and by its entering
into the midst of him as waters, and as oil between his bones; hell is thus described as 
received in the externals and in the internals; as received in the externals by the 
cursing being put on as a vest, and as received in the internals by its entering into the 
midst of him like water, and as oil between his bones; it is said as water and as oil, 
because water signifies the falsities of faith, and oil evils of the love, whence by both 
is understood the love or affection of the false and evil, which is hell; this may appear 
also from this consideration, that love imbibes all things which agree with it, 
altogether as a sponge does waters and oil; for the love of evil nourishes itself from 
falsities, and the love of the false nourishes itself from evils; and whereas love is of 
such a nature, it is therefore said that cursing entered into the midst of him like water, 
and as oil between the bones. AE 695.

Verse 21. But do you, O JEHOVIH! In the Word frequent mention is made of the LORD 
JEHOVIH, yea, wherever JEHOVAH the LORD is spoken of, he is called not LORD 
JEHOVAH but LORD JEHOVIH; and he is especially so called where the subject treated of
is concerning temptations; as in Isaiah: "Behold the LORD JEHOVIH will come with 
strong hand and his arm shall rule for him; behold his recompense is with him, and his
work before him. He shall feed his flock like a shepherd, he shall gather his lambs 
with his arm, and carry them in his bosom, and shall gently lead those that give suck,"
Isaiah 40:10, 11; where the LORD JEHOVIH coming with strong hand denotes victory in
temptation-combats, and his arm ruling for him denotes it to be derived from his own 
power: what the recompense is, which was spoken of in the foregoing verse is here 
declared, namely that it is the salvation of the whole human race; which is what is 
meant by his feeding his flock like a shepherd, gathering the lambs with his arm, 
carrying them in his bosom, and gently leading those that give suck; all which are 
operations of inmost or Divine love. AC 1793.

Verse 30. I will confess, or celebrate, JEHOVAH with my mouth; yea, I will praise him 
among the multitude. That to confess, in an external, or proximate interior sense, 
signifies doctrine derived from the Word, is evident, for confession is nothing else, 
even as the Word is applied in common discourse, but a man's declaration of his faith 
before the LORD, thus it comprehends in it whatever the man believes, consequently 
whatever constitutes the doctrine which he maintains. AC 3880.

380

PSALM 110

A Psalm of David.

1. JEHOVAH has said to my LORD: Sit you at my right hand until I make your enemies 
your footstool.

2. JEHOVAH will send out from Zion the sceptre of your strength; you shall rule in the 
midst of your enemies.

3. Your people shall be ready in the day of your strength; in the honours of holiness; 
from the womb of the morning you have the dew of your nativity.

4. JEHOVAH has sworn, and he will not repent: You are a priest for ever according to 
the order of Melchizedek.

5. The LORD is at your right hand, he shall crush kings in the day of his anger;

6. He shall execute judgement amongst the nations; he shall fill the earth with dead 
bodies; he shall crush the head over many countries.

7. He shall drink of the stream in the way; therefore will he raise up the head.

The Internal Sense

Of the LORD'S victory over the hells, whereby he obtained the dominion over heaven 
and earth, verses 1 to 3; thence his power over the hells, verses 4 to 7.

Exposition

That these words relate to the LORD, does not appear from the literal sense of the 
passage as it stands in the book of Psalms, and yet that the LORD alone is here meant, 
he himself teaches, Matt 22:41—43. AC 2135.

Verses 1 to 7. From the above Psalm it is evident what the LORD is as a priest, 
consequently what the priesthood in the LORD represented, namely all the work of the 
salvation of the human race; for the subject treated of in the above Psalm is 
concerning the LORD'S combats with the hells, when he was in the world, by which he 
acquired to himself Divine omnipotence over the hells, by which omnipotence he 
saved the human race, and also at this day saves all who receive him. This salvation 
itself, inasmuch as it is from the Divine good of the Divine love, is that from which it 
is said of the LORD, you are a priest for ever, according to the order of Melchizedek; 
Melchizedek is the king of justice, thus the LORD was called from his being made 
justice, and thereby salvation, according to what was shown, AC 9715. But whereas 
singular things in the above passage contain arcana concerning the LORD'S combats 
when he was in the world, which cannot be revealed without the internal sense, 
therefore it is allowed briefly to unfold them, Jehovah has said to my Lord, signifies 

381

that it was concerning the LORD when in the world; that by LORD is there meant the 
LORD as to to the Divine Human [principle,] is manifest from Matthew 22:41, 42, 43; 
Mark 12:35, 30; Luke 20:41, 42, 43, 44; sit you at my right hand, signifies the 
omnipotence of Divine good by Divine truth, which the LORD then was, and from 
which he fought and conquered; that to sit on the right hand denotes a state of power, 
and when concerning the Divine [being,] that it denotes omni-potence, see AC 3387, 
4592; and that all power is of good by truth, see AC 6344, 6413; until I make your 
enemies your footstool, signifies until the evils, which are in the hells and from the 
hells, shall be subjugated, and made subject to his divine power; the sceptre of 
strength shall JEHOVAH send out of Zion, signifies power on this occasion from 
celestial good; that Zion denotes such good, see AC 2362; you shall rule in the midst 
of your enemies, signifies which good has dominion over evils; evils are enemies, 
because they are against the Divine [being or principle,] especially against the LORD; 
your people [are a people] of promptnesses in the day of your strength, signifies 
Divine truth combating on this occasion; in the honours of holiness, signifies which 
are from Divine good; from the womb of the morning you have the dew of your 
nativity, signifies conception from the Divine good itself, from which he had Divine 
truth; JEHOVAH has sworn and will not repent, signifies what is firm and certain; you 
are a priest for ever, signifies the Divine good of the Divine love in him; according to
the order of Melchizedek, signifies his Divine Human [principle] alike; Melchizedek is
king of justice, thus JEHOVAH made justice by combats and victories, AC 9715; the 
LORD at your right hand, signifies the Divine truth on this occasion from him, by 
which he has omnipotence, as above; shall crush kings in the day of his anger, 
signifies the destruction of falsities on the occasion; the day of anger was when he 
fought against evils, and destroyed them; kings are truths, and in the opposite sense 
falsities, AC 2015, 2069; he has judged among the nations, signifies the dissipation of
evils, for nations denote goods, and in the opposite sense evils, AC 1259, 1263; he 
has filled with dead bodies, signifies thus spiritual death, which is the total 
deprivation of truth and good; he shall crush the head over much earth, signifies the 
casting down of infernal self-love into the hells, and its damnation; he shall drink of 
the stream in the way, therefore will he raise the head, signifies the attempt to emerge 
by reasoning concerning truths; this is the sense of the above words, which is 
perceived in heaven, when that Psalm is read by man. AC 9809.

The LORD, when he was in the world, was Divine truth, but when he was glorified, 
that is, when he made the Human principle in himself divine, he was then made 
Divine good, from which afterwards Divine truth proceeds, hence it is, that the 
disciples after the resurrection did not call him Master, as before, but LORD, as is 
manifest in John 21:7, 12, 16, 17, 20, and also in the rest of the Evangelists. AC 4973.

Verse 1. Until I make your enemies your footstool. By your footstool here signified 
things natural, both sensual and scientific, and hence the rational things of man, which
are called enemies when they pervert worship, and this by the literal sense of the 
Word, so that there remains only worship in externals, and internal worship either 
totally perishes or is defiled. When things natural and rational are thus perverted and 
defiled, they are called enemies; but inasmuch as in themselves they have relation to 
internal worship, when this worship is restored they then become a footstool. AC 
2162.

382

Verse 4. According to the order of Melchizedek. That Melchizedek signifies the LORD, 
see AC 1725.

Verses 5, 6, 7. These things are said of the LORD, and of his combat against false and 
evil principles which are from hell, and of their subjugation; by kings are meant false 
principles from hell, by nations are meant evils thence derived; his Divine 
omnipotence is meant by the LORD at your right hand; the subjugation of the false and
evil principles from the hells, is signified by smiling them in the day of his anger, by 
judging amongst the nations, and filling with dead bodies; by the head which is smote
is meant self-love, from which come all evil and false principles; by the river from 
which the head drinks, and by reason of which it exalts itself, is signified the Word in 
the letter; to drink of it is to learn something thence, and to exalt the head is so long to
be repugnant; for all who are in false principles grounded in evil cannot be cast into 
hell until those things are taken away from them which they learn from the Word, 
since all things of the Word communicate with heaven, by which communication they
exalt the head, but when those things are taken away they are cast down into hell. AE 
518.

383

PSALM 111

1.

I will praise JEHOVAH with my whole heart in the assembly of the upright, and 
in the congregation.

2. Great are the works of JEHOVAH; sought out by all who take delight therein.
3. His work is honourable and glorious; and his justice endures for ever.
4. He has made his wonderful works to be remembered; JEHOVAH is gracious and

full of compassion.

5. He has given food to them that fear him; he will ever be mindful of his 

covenant.

6. He has showed his people the power of his works, that he flight give them the 

heritage of the nations.

7. The works of his hands are truth and judgement; all his Commandments are 

sure.

8. Secure for ever, to eternity; they are made in truth and rectitude.
9. He has sent forth redemption to his people; he has commanded his covenant 

for ever; holy and reverend is his name!

10. The fear of JEHOVAH is the beginning of wisdom; a good understanding have 

all those who do them; his praise endures for ever.

The Internal Sense

Celebration and confession of the LORD, verses 1 to 4; because he redeemed mankind 
and will save them to eternity, verses 5 to 9; that to worship him is wisdom, verse 10. 

EXPOSITION

Verse 4. He has made his wonderful works to be remembered, etc. That to remember, 
when concerning the LORD, denotes to have compassion, and thus to preserve or 
deliver from a principle of mercy, is manifest from this and several other passages 
where the Divine remembrance is spoken of. AC 9849.

Verse 9. He has sent forth redemption to his people; he has commanded his covenant 
for ever, etc. Denoting regeneration; it is called covenant, because it is given and 
received; but they who are not regenerated, or what is the same thing, who place 
worship in things external, and themselves, and what they desire and think, estimate 
and worship them as gods, these, inasmuch as they separate themselves from the  
LORD, are said to render his covenant of none effect. AC 666.    From these words it 
may be manifest what is signified by the LORD redeeming the human race, namely that
he delivered them from hell, and from the evil and false principles which continually 
rise up from there, and bring man into damnation, and that he continually delivers 
him. AE 325.

Verse 10. The fear of JEHOVAH is the beginning of wisdom. Inasmuch as fear has 
respect to Divine truth From which holiness in worship is derived, and from which are
wisdom and intelligence, therefore it is said, the fear of JEHOVAH is the beginning of 

384

wisdom, a good understanding, that is, intelligence have all those who do them. AE 
696.

385

PSALM 112

HALLELUJAH.

1. Blessed is the man that fears JEHOVAH, that delights greatly in his 

commandments.

2. His seed shall he mighty upon earth; the generation of the upright shall be 

blessed.

3. Wealth and riches shall be in his house, and his justice shall endure for ever.
4. Unto the upright there arises light in darkness; he is gracious and full of 

compassion, and just.

5. A good man shows favour and lends; he will restrain his words with 

judgement.

6. Surely he shall never be moved; the just shall be in everlasting remembrance,
7. He shall not be afraid of evil tidings; his heart is fixed, trusting in JEHOVAH.
8. His heart is established, he shall not be afraid, until he shall have beheld the 

downfall of his enemies.

9. He distributes, he gives to the poor; his justice endures for ever; his horn shall 

be exalted with honour.

10. The wicked shall see and be indignant; he shall gnash with his teeth and melt 

away; the desire of the wicked shall perish.

The Internal Sense

That he who trusts in the LORD, and lives well, will be saved, verses 1 to 7, 9; he will 
not be afraid of the hells, though they rise up against him, verses 8, 10.

EXPOSITION

Verse 1. Blessed is the man that fears JEHOVAH, that delights greatly in his 
commandments. To fear Jehovah means also to think holily and reverently concerning
GOD, and to walk in his ways is to live according to Divine truths worship is effected 
by both, but in external worship which is to live according to Divine truth, there must 
be internal worship, which is to fear JEHOVAH, wherefore it is said, that it is he that 
fears JEHOVAH, who walks in his ways, in like manner as above, for to delight in the 
commandments of JEHOVAH, is to love them, thus to will and to do them. AE 696.

Verse 3. Wealth, and riches shall be in his house, etc. That these words signify what 
he had collected together, may appear from the signification of house, as denoting in 
the present case the scientifics which are collected together, to collect scientifics, and 
thereby to raise and build up the external man, is not unlike the building of a house, 
wherefore also the like is signified throughout the Word by building, and by building 
houses, as in Isaiah, "Behold, I create new heavens and a new earth, they shall build 
houses, and inhabit them; and they shall plant vineyards, and eat the fruit of them; 
they shall not build and another inhabit," Isaiah 65:17, 21, 22; house here signifies 
whore there is wisdom and intelligence, consequently where there are the knowledges

386

of good and truth, for the subject treated of is concerning the LORD'S kingdom. AC 
1488.

Verse 5. A good man shows favour and lends, etc. By being merciful and lending is 
described the state of those who are in genuine charity; in like manner see Psalm 
37:21, Exposition. AC 9174.

Verse 9. His horn shall be exalted with honour. That horn signifies Divine truth, is 
evident from this consideration, that his justice, it is said, endures for ever, and his 
horn shall be exalted with honour or glory; justice in the Word is predicated of good, 
wherefore horn is predicated of truth, for in singular the things of the Word there is a 
marriage of goodness and truth. AE 316.

Verse 10. The wicked shall see and be indignant, he shall gnash with his teeth, etc. 
Inasmuch as the teeth signify false principles in the extreme, therefore by gnashing 
with the teeth is signified to combat against truths from false principles with 
vehemence and anger, see Psalm 3:7, Exposition. AE 556.

PSALM 113

HALLELUJAH.

1. Praise, O you servants of JEHOVAH, praise the name of JEHOVAH.
2. Blessed be the name of JEHOVAH, from now on even for ever!
3. From the rising of the sun, even to the place of his setting, praised be the name

of JEHOVAH!
JEHOVAH is exalted above all nations, his glory is above the heavens.

4.
5. Who is like JEHOVAH our GOD, who has exalted himself on high?
6. Who humbles himself to behold the things that are in heaven, and on earth?
7. He raises the poor out of the dust, and lifts the needy from the dunghill;
8. To place him with princes, even with the princes of his people.
9. He causes the barren woman to dwell in a house, to be a joyful mother of 

children. HALLELUJAH.

The Internal Sense

Celebration of the LORD because he is omnipotent, verses 1 to 5; because he came into
the world, verse 6; because he will save those who shall be of his church, verses 7 to 
9.

EXPOSITION

Verses 7, 8, 9. He raises the poor out of the dust etc, In the above verses, by barren is 
meant the nations who are, called to the church, and to whom the church is transferred
when the old church ceases, that is, when they who were before of the church are no 
longer in faith, because in no charity; this latter is meant by her who had many 
children, who had failed, and by her that was married; but the former, namely the new
church of the nations, is meant by the barren and the desolate who should have many 
sons, and by the barren of the house being a joyful mother of sons; to bear seven 
denotes to be regenerated to the full, for seven does not signify seven, but to the full. 
AC 9325.

That they who are in false principles from ignorance, and hence are not in principles 
of good, are to be instructed by the LORD in truths, is signified by JEHOVAH raises up 
the poor out of the dust, and exalts the needy from the dunghill; the poor and needy 
are those who are in false principles from ignorance, and thence not in principles of 
good. The primary truths of the church, in which they are to be instructed, are 
signified by princes, the princes of the people with whom they are to be placed; that 
life, from the marriage of truth and of good, would be with those who had not before 
enjoyed it, is signified by making the barren woman to dwell in a house, a joyful 
mother of children; to dwell signifies to live, the barren, where there is no marriage of
truth and of good; a joyful mother of children is the church, where are truths from 
good; a joyful mother of children denotes where truths from good are nascent. AE 
721.

PSALM 114

1. When Israel went out of Egypt, the house of Jacob from a people of strange 

language.

2. Judah became his sanctuary, Israel his dominion.
3. The sea saw and fled; Jordan turned back.
4. The mountains leaped like rams, the hills like the sons of the flock.
5. What ails you, O you sea, that you flee, you Jordan, that you turn back?
6. You mountains, that you leap like rams; you hills, like the sons of the flock?
7. The earth brings forth at the presence of the LORD, at the presence of the GOD 

of Jacob.

8. Who turned the rock into a lake of waters, the stony rock into a fountain of 

waters.

The Internal Sense

Of the church of the gentiles established by the LORD, verses 1, 2; that its falsities are 
removed, and succeeded by the good things of love and charity, verses 3 to 6; because
the church is of the LORD, who will instruct those who are in ignorance, verses 7, 8.

Exposition

Verse 1. From a people of strange language; see Psalm 81:5, Exposition.

Verses 2 to 8. Thus is described the departure of the sons of Israel out of Egypt, 
nevertheless, without an explication by the internal sense, no one can know what 
these words signify, that the mountains will leap like rams, and the hills like the sons 
of the flock, also what is meant by the sea seeing and fleeing, and by Jordan turning 
back, wherefore it must be explained. In the internal sense the establishment of the 
church is meant, or the regeneration of the men of the church, for the church which 
was to be established is signified by the sons of Israel, and its establishment by their 
departure; the separation of evils by the passage through the Red Sea, of which it is 
said that it fled; and their introduction into the church by the passage over Jordan, of 
which it is said that it turned back; but to be particular,—that Judah was made for a 
sanctuary, and Israel for dominion, signifies that the good of love to the LORD is the 
very holy principle of heaven and the church, and that the truths from that good are 
productive of government, since by Judah is signified celestial good, for Divine truth 
proceeding from Divine good is the LORD'S government; by the sea seeing and 
fleeing, by Jordan turning back, is signified that when evil and false principles are 
separated, which are in the natural man, they are succeeded by scientific truth, and the
knowledges of truth and good; the mountains leaping like rams, the hills like the sons 
of the flock, signify that celestial good, which is the good of love, and spiritual good, 
which is from that good; from joy make goods or yield effect; mountains signify the 
good of love, hills the goods of charity, which in their essence are truths from that 
good; to leap, as having respect to them, signifies to do goods from joy; it is said as 
rams, and as the sons of the flock, because rams signify the goods of charity, and the 
sons of the flock, truths from that good; the establishment of the church, or the 

389

regeneration of the men of the church, is signified by the earth bringing forth before 
the LORD, before the GOD of Jacob, who turns the rock into a lake of waters, and the 
stony rock into a fountain of waters; the earth is the church, and it is said to bring 
forth when it is established, or the man of the church is born anew. It is said before the
LORD, and before the GOD of Jacob, since, where the good of love is treated of, the 
LORD, in the Word, is called Lord, (adon) and when good principles in act are treated 
of, he is called the God of Jacob; regeneration by truths from good is signified by 
turning the rock into a lake of waters, and the stony rock into a fountain of waters; by 
a lake of waters is signified the knowledges of truth, and by a fountain of waters is 
signified the Word from which they are derived, and by rock, the natural man as to 
truth before reformation, and by stony rock, the natural man us to good before 
reformation. AE 405.

Verse 2. Judah was his sanctuary, and Israel his dominion, etc. Sanctuary signifies in 
the supreme sense, the LORD himself, and in the respective sense, the worship of him 
from the good of love; by Israel is signified the truths of the church from that good; 
and whereas all power belongs to truths from good, or to good by truths, therefore it is
said that Israel was made for his dominion. AE 433.

390

PSALM 115

1. Not to us, O JEHOVAH, not to us, but to your name give glory; for the sake of 

your mercy and your truth.

2. Wherefore should the nations say, where indeed is their GOD?
3. But our GOD is in the heavens, he does whatever it pleases him.
4. Their idols are silver and gold, the work of men's hands.
5. They have a mouth, but they speak not; they have eyes, but they see not;
6. They have ears, but they hear not; they have a nose, but they smell not;
7. They have hands, but they handle not; they have feet, but they walk not; they 

do not speak through their throat.

8. Like to them are those who make them, all who place confidence in them.
9. O Israel, trust you in JEHOVAH, he is their help and their shield.
10. O house of Aaron, trust in JEHOVAH; he is their help and their shield.
11. O you who fear JEHOVAH, trust in JEHOVAH; he is their help and their shield.
12. JEHOVAH has been mindful of us, he blesses; yea, he blesses the house of 

Israel, he blesses the house of Aaron.

13. He blesses those who fear JEHOVAH, both the small and the great.
14. JEHOVAH shall increase you more and more, you and your sons.
15. Blessed are you of JEHOVAH, who has made heaven and earth.
16. As to the heavens, the heavens are JEHOVAH'S, but the earth has he given to the

sons of man.

17. The dead cannot praise JEHOVAH, nor any who go down into silence.
18. But we will bless JEHOVAH, now on even for ever. HALLELUJAH!

The Internal Sense

That the LORD is omnipotent, verses 1 to 3; that man is nothing of himself, but the 
false of evil, verses 4 to 8; that the trust of all who are in goodnesses and truths, must 
be in the LORD, verses 9 to 11; that the LORD will save them, verses 12 to 15, 18; that 
heaven and the church are his, verse 16; that they who do not trust in the LORD will 
not be saved, verse 17.

Exposition

Verse 1. For the sake of your mercy and your truth, see Psalm 85:10, Exposition.

Verse 4. Their idols are silver and gold, the work of men's hands. Inasmuch as the 
falsities and evils of doctrine, which are signified by graven and molten images, are 
fabricated by man's own proper intelligence under the guidance of his love, therefore 
also in the Word they are called the work of the hands of man, the work of the hands 
of the artificer, and the work of the hands of the smith. AC 10406.

Their idols are silver and gold. By these words is signified external worship without 
internal, confirmed from the sense of the letter of the Word not understood, and 
likewise from the fallacies of the senses; the work of men's hands signifies man's own 
intelligence. AE 587.

391

That hereby are signified false doctrinals, which are from self-derived intelligence, 
favouring the loves of the body and of the world, and the principles thence conceived,
appears from the signification of idols, as denoting falsities of doctrine, of religion, 
and of worship, which are from self-derived intelligence. But what idols of gold, 
silver, brass, stone and wood, specifically signify, may appear from the signification 
of gold, silver, brass, stone, and wood; by gold is signified spiritual good; by silver, 
spiritual truth; by brass, natural good; by stone, natural truth; and by wood, sensual 
good; all these goods and truths enter into genuine doctrine, because this is both from 
the spiritual and natural sense of the Word. When a false doctrine is confirmed by the 
spiritual things of the Word, it then becomes an idol of gold, and are idol of silver; but
when it is confirmed by the natural things of the Word, such as are in the sense of the 
letter thereof, it then becomes an idol of brass and stone; and when it is from the mere
sense of the letter, it becomes an idol of wood; for the sense of the Word, as well the 
interior or spiritual, as the exterior or natural, may be applied to confirm falsities as 
may appear from the innumerable heresies, which are all thence confirmed. 
Confirmations of falsities take place in consequence of the genuine sense of the Word 
not being understood; and the reason of this is because the loves of man's proprium 
have rule, and thereby the principles thence conceived; and when these have rule, man
sees nothing from the light of heaven, but whatever he sees is from the light of the 
world, separate from the light of heaven; and when the light of the world is separated 
from the light of heaven, then thick darkness takes place in things of a spiritual nature.
It is to be observed, that the sons of Israel brought with them from Egypt, and also 
from the nations round about, the filthy custom of worshiping idols; and inasmuch as 
they were merely external men, they had that worship also implanted in them from 
natural inclination, as may appear from the idolatries of so many kings of Judah and 
Israel related in the Word, and also from Solomon himself, who was the wisest of 
them; but still, the idols which they made for themselves, and which they worshiped, 
where they are mentioned in the Word, signify, in the spiritual sense, false doctrinals, 
which are from self-derived intelligence, from which, and according to which, 
worship is performed. This signification of idols also derives its cause from the 
spiritual world; for there the evil spirits, who frame for themselves falsities of 
doctrine, appear as it were to form idols, and mark them by various insignia, until they
appear in a form, as it were human; they also pick out or select from various 
representatives, and adapt them so as to cohere, that thus they may give a semblance 
of that form in things external. AE 587.

Verse 9. O Israel, trust in JEHOVAH, he is their help and their shield. As war signifies 
temptations, so all the arms used in war signify some particular of temptations, and of 
defence against evils and falsities, wherefore each kind of arms has a distinct 
signification peculiar to itself, whether it be shield, buckler, helmet, spear, dart, 
sword, bow, arrows, or breast-plate; the ground and reason why shield, in respect to 
the LORD, signifies defence against evils and falsities, and in respect to man, 
confidence in the LORD, is because it was armour for the security of the breast, and by 
the breast is signified goodness and truth, goodness by reason of the heart being 
therein, and truth by reason of the lungs. AC 1788.

Verse 10. O house of Aaron, trust in JEHOVAH. The house of Israel denotes those who 
are in truths; the house of Aaron denotes those who are in goods; for in the Word, 
where truth is treated of, good is also treated of, on account of the heavenly marriage. 
AC 9806.

392

Verse 11. O you who fear JEHOVAH, trust in JEHOVAH; he is their help and their shield.
The fear of GOD is worship either grounded in fear, or in the good of faith, or in the 
good of love; but in proportion as fear prevails in worship, in the same proportion 
there is the less of faith, and still less of love; and on the other hand, in proportion as 
faith prevails in worship, and especially as love prevails, in the same proportion there 
is less of fear. AC 2826.

Verse 12. Both the small and the great. By the small are understood those who know 
but little of the truths and goods of the church, and by the great those who know 
much, thus those who worship the LORD little and much, for in proportion as man 
knows the truths of faith, and lives according to them, in the same proportion he 
worships the LORD, for worship is not from man, but from the truths originating in 
good, which are with man, since these are from the LORD, and the LORD is in them. 
The reason why small and great signify less and more, namely who worship the 
LORD, thus who are less and more in truths from good, is because the spiritual sense 
of the Word is abstracted from all respect to persons, for it simply regards the thing, 
and in the expression, small and great, there is respect to person, for thereby are 
understood the men who worship GOD. Hence it is, that instead of small and great, is 
understood, in the spiritual sense, less and more, thus those who worship more and 
less from genuine truths and goods; the case is the same also with respect to the 
servants, the prophets, and saints, treated of just above, by whom, in the spiritual 
sense, are not understood prophets and saints, but, abstractedly from persons, the 
truths of doctrine and a life according to them; whilst these are understood, all who 
are in the truths of doctrine, and in a life according to them, are also inclusively 
comprehended, for these things are in subjects which are angels and men; but to think 
in such case of angels and men only, is natural, but to think of the truths of doctrine 
and the life which constitute angels and men, this is spiritual. Hence it may appear, 
how the spiritual sense, in which the angels are, distinguishes itself from the natural 
sense, in which men are, namely that in every thing which men think, there inheres 
somewhat derived from person, space, time, and matter, but that the angels think, 
abstractedly from these, of things only; hence it is that the speech of angels is 
incomprehensible to man, inasmuch as it flows from contemplation of the thing, and 
consequently from a wisdom abstracted from such things as are proper to the natural 
world, and thus respectively indeterminate to such things. AE 696.

PSALM 116

I love JEHOVAH, because he has heard my voice and my supplication.

1.
2. Because he has inclined his ear to me, therefore will I call upon him as long as

I live.

3. The cords of death encompassed me, and the hands of hell took hold of me; I 

found trouble and sorrow.

4. Then I called upon the name of JEHOVAH, saying, O JEHOVAH, I beseech you, 

deliver my soul!

5. Gracious and just is JEHOVAH, yea, our GOD is merciful.
6.
JEHOVAH preserves the simple; I was brought low and he helped me.
7. Return to your rest, O my soul; for JEHOVAH has dealt kindly with you.
8. Truly you have delivered my soul from death, mine eyes from tears, and my 

feet from falling.
I will walk before JEHOVAH in the land of the living.

9.
10. I believed, therefore have I spoken; I was greatly afflicted.
11. I said in my terror, all men are liars.
12. What shall I render to JEHOVAH for all his benefits towards me?
13. I will take the cup of salvations, and call upon the name of JEHOVAH.
14. I will pay my vows to JEHOVAH, now, in the presence of all his people.
15. Precious in the eyes of JEHOVAH is the death of his saints.
16. O JEHOVAH, truly I am your servant, I am your servant, and the son of your 

handmaid; you have loosened my bands.

17. Unto you will I offer the sacrifice of thanksgiving, and will call upon the name

of JEHOVAH.

18. I will pay my vows to JEHOVAH, now, in the presence of all his people;
19. In the courts of the house of JEHOVAH, in the midst of you, O Jerusalem. 

HALLELUJAH!

The Internal Sense

Celebration of the FATHER by the LORD, because he succoured him in grievous 
temptations, verses 1 to 11; that so the DIVINE BEING will be worshiped in the LORD, 
verses 12 to 19,

Exposition

Verse 13. I will take the cup of salvations, etc. To take the cup of salvations denotes 
the appropriation of the goods of faith. It is said cup, not wine, because wine is 
predicated of the spiritual church, but blood of the celestial church, although each 
signifies the holy truth proceeding from the LORD, but in the spiritual church, the holy 
principle of faith, grounded in charity towards the neighbour, whereas in the celestial 
church, it is the holy principle of charity grounded in love to the LORD; the spiritual 
church is distinguished from the celestial in this, that the former is principled in 
charity towards the neighbour, but the latter in love to the LORD, and the Holy Supper 
was instituted that it might represent and signify the LORD'S love towards the universal
human race, and the reciprocal love of man towards him. AC 5120.

394

Verse 15. Precious in the sight of JEHOVAH, is the death of his saints. That the death of
the saints does not signify damnation, but the separation and removal of unclean 
spirits, thus regeneration and resurrection. The case is similar with man, who as to the 
body must die that he may rise again, and as to his selfhood, which in itself is infernal,
for unless the former and the latter die, man has not the form of heaven. AE 899.

395

PSALM 117

1. O praise JEHOVAH, all you nations; praise him, all you peoples.

1. O give thanks to JEHOVAH, for be is good; because his mercy is for ever.

valiantly.

17. I shall not die but live, and declare the works of JAH.
18. JAH chastised me severely, but he did not give me over to death,
19. Open to me the gates of justice; I will enter them; I will praise JAH.
20. This is the gate of JEHOVAH, into which the just shall enter.
21. I will praise you, for you have answered me, and are become my salvation.
22. The stone which the builders rejected is become the head of the corner.
23. This is the doing of JEHOVAH, it is marvelous in our eyes.
24. This is the day which JEHOVAH has made; we will rejoice and be glad in it.
25. Save, I beseech you, O JEHOVAH; O JEHOVAH, I beseech you, send prosperity!
26. Blessed is he that comes in the name of JEHOVAH; we have blessed you out of 

the house of JEHOVAH.

27. GOD is JEHOVAH, he has showed us light; bind the sacrifice with cords to the 

horns of the altar.

28. You are my GOD, and I will praise you; you are my GOD, and I will exalt you.
29. O give thanks to JEHOVAH, for he is good; for his mercy endures for ever.

The Internal Sense

The LORD'S thanksgiving to the FATHER for the church, verses 1 to 4; that he 
succoured him when he was straightened, verses 5 to 9; that the wicked assaulted him,
but that he was aided by the Divine principle, verses 10 to 14; his joy that there is 
Divine power through his Human essence, verses 15, 16; that Divine Truth is from 
him, verse 17; that it is he from whom comes all salvation, verses 18 to 21; that it is 
the Divine Human from the Divine principle within himself, from whom it proceeds, 

397

verses 22 to 25; that he is blessed who confesses and worships the LORD, verses 25 to 
29.

EXPOSITION

Verse 5. I called upon JAH in distress; JAH answered me, and set me in a broad place. 
By breadth, or broad place, in this passage, nothing else is signified but the truth of 
the church; the reason why breadth has this signification is because in the spiritual 
world, or in heaven, the LORD is the centre of all things, for he is the sun therein. They
who are in a state of good are more inward according to the quantity and quality of 
the good in which they are; hence altitude is predicated of good; they who are in a like
degree of good are also in a like degree of truth, and thereby as it were in a like 
distance; hence breadth is predicated of truth; wherefore nothing else is understood by
breadth, by the attendant angels, whilst man reads the Word. AC 4482.

Verse 12. They encompassed me like bees; they are extinguished as the fire of thorns. 
The fire of thorns denotes the craving of evil; the falsities of craving, which are 
signified by thorns, are the falsities confirming those things which are of the world 
and its pleasures, for these falsities above others catch fire and burn, because they are 
from cravings in the body which are filth, therefore also they inclose the internal man,
so that nothing is relished that relates to the salvation of the soul and eternal life. AC 
9144.

By bees are signified false reasonings, because the rational principle collects what 
belongs to it from scientifics falsely applied; the reason why these things are likened 
to flies and bees, is grounded in correspondence, for in the spiritual world there appear
flying insects of various kinds, but they are appearances from the ideas of the 
thoughts of spirits. AE 410.

Verse 16. The right hand of JEHOVAH is exalted; the right hand of JEHOVAH does 
valiantly. In this passage the right hand of JEHOVAH denotes omnipotence, and, in the 
supreme sense, the LORD as to Divine truth. AC 8281.

Verse 22. The stone which the builders rejected is become the head of the corner. 
Inasmuch as by stone in old time was signified truths, and afterwards, when worship 
began to be celebrated on statues, on altars, and in the temple, by statues, altars, and 
the temple, were signified holy truths, therefore the LORD was also called the stone, as
in Isaiah, "Behold I lay in Zion a stone, a stone of probation of the corner, of a price, 
of a sure foundation." AC 1298.

Corner-stone signifies all Divine truth on which is founded heaven and the church, 
thus every foundation; and since a foundation, is the ultimate, on which a house or 
temple is built, therefore it signifies all things; inasmuch as by a cornerstone is 
signified all things on which the church is founded, therefore it is said, "He will found
in Zion a stone, a cornerstone of price, and it is called a stone for a corner, and a 
stone of foundations;" and since by a corner-stone is signified all Divine truth on 
which the church is founded, therefore also is signified the LORD as to his Divine 
Human principle, because all Divine truth proceeds from that principle: the builders 
who rejected that stone, as we read in the Evangelists, are they who were of the 

398

church, which rejected the LORD, and with him all Divine truth; for they were 
governed by vain traditions taken from the sense of the letter of the Word, by which 
the truths of the Word were falsified, and the goods adulterated. AE 417.

I will run in the way of your commandments, because you have enlarged my 
heart.

delight.

comfort me?

on them that persecute me?

you me.

87. They had almost consumed me upon earth; but I forsook not your precepts.

The Internal Sense

That the LORD fulfilled the law, or the Word, from its first principles to its ultimates, 
and was therefore hated, and suffered temptations, and that thus he united his Human 
to his Divine, verses 1—176.

EXPOSITION

Aleph. All syllables and letters of the alphabet in the spiritual world signify things, 
hence originate the speech and writing of those who are there, and hence it is, that the 
LORD describes his divinity and infinity by Alpha and Omega, by which is signified 
that he is the All in All of heaven and the church, since every letter signifies a thing in 
the spiritual world, and consequently in the language of angels, therefore David wrote
the cxix. Psalm, in order, according to the letters of the alphabet, beginning with 
Aleph and ending with Thau, as may appear from the initials of the verses; something 
similar appears in Psalm cxi, but not so evidently. Ap. Re. 38.

Verse 1. Blessed are the perfect in the way. By the perfect in the way are meant those 
who are in truth grounded in good, or who speak and do the truth from charity. AC 
612.

Verses 1 to 27. The subject treated of throughout the whole of this Psalm is 
concerning the Word, and concerning the things belonging to the Word, which, it is 
evident, are precepts, statutes, judgements, testimonies, commandments, and ways; 
but what is specifically meant by these expressions cannot possibly be seen from the 
sense of the letter, in which they appear only as a repetition of the same thing; it may, 
however, be seen from the internal sense, in which things altogether different are 
signified by precepts, by statutes, by judgements, testimonies, commandments, and 
ways. AC 3382

Verses 2 to 7. In several passages mention is made of testimonies, and at the same 
time of law, precepts, commandments, statutes, and judgements, and in those passages
by testimonies and commandments are signified such things as teach life, by law and 
precepts such things as teach doctrine, by statutes and judgements such things as 
teach ceremonies of worship. AE 392.

The precepts of the decalogue were called a testimony, because they had relation to a 
covenant, thus to conjunction between the LORD and man, which conjunction cannot 

406

exist unless man keeps those precepts, not only in the external form, but also in the 
internal. AC 4197.

Verses 6 to 17. Word denotes doctrine in general; that a distinction is here made 
between precepts, judgements, testimonies, commandments, statutes, ways, and lips, is
evident, all which things appertain to the Word or doctrine; in other parts of the Word 
also these expressions have a distinct signification. AC 1288.

Verse 25. My soul cleaves to the dust, etc. The reason why dust denotes what is 
damned is because the places where evil spirits are, at the sides beneath the soles of 
the feet, appear as earth, and indeed as earth uncultivated and dry, under which are 
certain hells; this earth is what is called damned earth, and the dust there signifies 
what is damned. AC 7418.

Verse 27. Make me to understand the way of your precepts, etc. The way of 
commandments and precepts is called the way of truth, the contrary way is called the 
way of a lie,—false doctrine. AC 627.

Verse 37. Turn away mine eyes from beholding vanity, etc. That vanity denotes the 
false principle of doctrine and religion is evident from this passage. AC 9248.

Verse 103. How sweet are your words to my palate, yea, sweeter than honey to my 
mouth! The reason why honey denotes delight is because it is sweet, and every thing 
sweet in the natural world corresponds to what is delightful in the spirit; the reason 
why it is said the delight thereof, namely the delight of truth derived from good in the 
exterior and natural principle is because every truth, and especially every truth of 
good, has its delight, but a delight arising from the affection of good and truth, and 
from consequent use. AC 5620.

Verse 135. Make your face to shine upon your servant, etc. That the face of JEHOVAH 
or the LORD is mercy, and also peace and good, because these are of mercy, may 
likewise be manifest from this passage, where face also denotes mercy, AC 5585.

Verse 154, Plead you my cause and deliver me; revive me according to your word. To 
plead my cause denotes to defend truth against falsehood, and to liberate. AC . 9024.

Verse 164. Seven times a day do I praise you because of your just judgements. The 
number seven was accounted holy to the six days of creation: hence in the ceremonies
of the Jewish church, the number seven so often occurs, and is everywhere accounted 
holy. AC 395.

That seven signifies an entire period from beginning to end, thus what is full, is 
manifest from several passages in the Word, as in Isaiah, "The light of the moon shall 
be as the light of the sun, and the light of the sun shall be seven-fold, as the light of 
seven days, in the day wherein JEHOVAH shall bind up the breach of his people," Isaiah
30:26; where the subject treated of is concerning the salvation of the faithful, and 
concerning their intelligence and wisdom in the LORD'S kingdom; the moon is faith 
from the LORD, thus faith in the LORD, and the sun love from the LORD, thus love to 
the LORD; the light of the sun being seven-fold as the light of seven days, denotes a 

407

full state of intelligence and wisdom derived from love and faith from the LORD. AC 
9228

As this Psalm treats of the Word, and of the life according to the Word, the reader is 
especially recommended to peruse the two works of the New Jerusalem on those very 
important subjects, the heads of which shall be here adduced:—

On the Word, or Sacred Scripture.

I. That the Sacred Scripture, or Word, is Divine Truth  itself     SS 1

II. That in the Word then; in a spiritual sense, heretofore unknown,—

1. What the spiritual sense is   SS 5

3. That it is owing to the spiritual sense that the Word is divinely inspired, and holy in 

every syllable    SS 18

5. That hereafter the spiritual sense of the Word will be made known to none, but those

III. That the literal sense of the Word is the basis, the continent, and the firmament of its spiritual and 
celestial sense    SS 27

IV. That Divine Truth, in the literal sense of the Word, is in its fullness, in its sanctity, and in its power  
SS 37

1. That the truths of the literal sense of the Word are meant by the precious stones, of which the 
foundations of the New Jerusalem were built, as mentioned in the Revelation 21:17 to 21    SS
43

2. That the truths and goods of the literal sense of the Word, are meant by the Urim and 

Thummim...... SS 44

3. That the truths of the literal sense of the. Word are meant by the precious stones in the Garden 

of Eden, wherein the King of Tyre is said to have been . SS 45

4. That the literal sense of the Word is signified by the curtains and veils of the tabernacle   . SS 

46

5. That the externals of the Word, or the things belonging to the literal sense, were represented 

by the externals of the temple at Jerusalem    SS 47

6. That the Word in its glory was represented in the person of the Lord, at his Transfiguration   

SS 48

V. That the doctrine of the church ought to be drawn from the literal sense of the Word, and to be 
confirmed thereby SS 50

1. That the Word, without doctrine, cannot be understood   SS 51
2. That doctrine ought to be drawn from the literal sense of the Word, and to be confirmed 

thereby... SS 53

3. That genuine truth, which doctrine is to teach, is apparent in the literal sense of the Word, to 

those only who are in illustration from the Lord   . SS 57

VI. That by the literal sense of the Word, man has conjunction with the Lord and consociation with the 
angels    SS 62

VII. That the Word is in all the heavens, and that the wisdom of the angels is thence derived   SS 70

408

VIII. That the church exists from the Word, and that, with man, the quality of the church is according to
his understanding of the Word    SS 76

IX. That there is a marriage of the Lord and the church, and thence a marriage of good and truth, in 
every part of the Word   . SS 80

X. That heretical opinions may be collected and imbibed from the letter of the Word, but that to 
confirm such opinions is hurtful    SS 91

XI. That the Lord came into the world that he might fulfill all things contained in the Word, and thereby
become Divine Truth or the Word in its ultimates    SS 98

XII. That previous to the Word which the world now possesses, there existed a Word which is lost    SS 
101

XIII. That by means of the Word, light is communicated to those who are out of the pale of the church, 
and are not in possession of the Word    SS 104

XIV. That without the Word, no one would have any knowledge of God, or of heaven and hell, or of a 
life after death, and much less of the Lord   . SS 114

PSALM 120

A Song of degrees.

In my distress I cried to JEHOVAH, and he answered me.

1.
2. Deliver my soul, O JEHOVAH, from lying lips, from a deceitful tongue.
3. What shall he give to you? Yea, what shall he add to you, O false tongue!
4. Sharp arrows of the mighty, with coals of juniper,
5. Woe to me that I sojourn in Mesech, that I dwell amongst the tents of Kedar!
6. My soul has long dwelt with him that hates peace.
I am for peace; but when I speak, they are for war.
7.

The Internal Sense

To the FATHER against those in the perverted church, who secretly endeavour to 
destroy him, verses 1 to 7.

EXPOSITION

Verse 2. Deliver my soul, O JEHOVAH, from lying lips, etc. Lying lips and a deceitful 
tongue denote false principles grounded in evil, the dispersion of truth by them is 
signified by sharp arrows of the mighty. AE 908.

Concerning deceit see Psalm 52:2, Exposition.

Verse 5. Woe is me that I sojourn in Mesech, etc. They who are not principled in truth,
because not in good, are those who are represented by Mesech and Kedar in the 
wilderness, as in the above passage. AC 3268.

By Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babel, are signified evils and false principles which 
devastated the church, and like things are signified by the tents of Kedar in the above 
words, AE 799.

411

PSALM 121

A Song of degrees.

1.
I lift up mine eyes to the mountains, whence comes my help.
2. My help is from JEHOVAH, who has made heaven and earth.
3. He will not suffer your foot to be moved; your guardian will not slumber.
4. Behold the guardian of Israel will neither slumber nor sleep,
5.

JEHOVAH will be your guardian; JEHOVAH will be your shade upon your right 
hand.

6. The sun shall not smite you by day, nor the moon by night.
7.
8.

JEHOVAH will guard you from all evil; he will guard your soul.
JEHOVAH will guard your going out and your coming in, from this time forth 
even for ever.

The Internal Sense

To the FATHER that he would preserve him, verses 1 to 8.

EXPOSITION

Verse 1. I will lift up mine, eyes to the mountains, etc. Inasmuch as mountain signifies 
the good of love, and in the supreme sense the Divine good, and from Divine good 
proceeds Divine truth, therefore the mountain of Zion was above Jerusalem, and by 
the mountain of Zion in the Word is signified the church which is in the good of love 
to the LORD, and by Jerusalem the church which is in truths from that good, or the 
church as to doctrine; on this account also Jerusalem is called the mountain of 
holiness, and likewise the hills, for by the mountain of holiness is signified spiritual 
good, which in its essence is truth from good, in like manner as by hill. AE 405.

Verses 3, 4, 5, 6. It is called the morning watch, because the night was divided into 
watches, of which the last of the night and the first of the day was the morning watch:
the watchers were upon the walls, observing whether an enemy approached, and by a 
cry announcing what they saw; by them, in the internal representative sense, is meant 
the LORD, and by watch his continual presence and protection, as in David, " Thy 
guardian, or watchman, will not slumber, behold the guardian of Israel will neither 
slumber nor sleep; JEHOVAH is your guardian." AC 8211.

Verse 6. The sun shall not smite you by day, nor the moon by night. By the sun is there
meant the love of self, and by the moon the false principle thence derived; inasmuch 
as from that love is derived all evil, and the false principle derived from evil, therefore
it is said that "JEHOVAH will guard you from all evil, he shall guard your soul," for by 
soul is signified the life of truth. AE 401.

Verse 8. JEHOVAH will guard your going out and your coming in, etc. To guard the 
coming in and going out denotes every thing of the life according to a state of good 
and of truth; wherefore to enter in and to go out denote to be led of the Lord as to 

412

every state of life; to enter into a house, to abide there, and thence go forth, denotes to
enjoy heavenly consociation with those who receive the LORD in faith and love; for in 
heaven, they who are together in one society, are also in one house, and enter in there 
and go out, for they are in similar good; but they who are in dissimilar, cannot do so; 
and if they enter in, they enter not through the doors, but some other way. AC 9927.

413

PSALM 122

A Song of degrees of David.

I rejoice, when they say to me: Let us go into the house of JEHOVAH!

1.
2. Our feet shall stand within your gates, O Jerusalem!
3. Jerusalem is built as a city, which is compact together.
4. Whither the tribes go up, the tribes of JAH, to the testimony of Israel, to give 

thanks to the name of JEHOVAH!

5. For there are placed the thrones for judgement, the thrones of the house of 

David.

6. Pray for the peace of Jerusalem! they shall be prosperous who love you!
7. Peace be within your walls, and prosperity within your palaces.
8. Because of my brethren and my companions, I will now say: May peace be 

within you!

9. Because of the house of JEHOVAH our GOD, I will seek your good.

The Internal Sense

The LORD'S joy over the new church where he himself reigns, verses 1 to 9.

EXPOSITION

Verse 3. Jerusalem is built as a city, compact together. By Jerusalem is here signified 
the church as to doctrine, which is said to be built as a city, compact together, when all
things of doctrine are in agreement and unanimity, and when they mutually regard the 
LORD and love to him, from him, as their beginning and end; it is said to be built as a 
city, because a city signifies doctrine. AE 431.

Verse 4. Whither the tribes go up, the tribes of JAH, to the testimony of Israel, to give 
thanks to the name of JEHOVAH. In general the twelve tribes signified all things 
belonging to the doctrine of truth and good, or of faith and love; these principles 
constitute the LORD'S kingdom, for the things belonging to truth or faith are the all of 
thought therein, and the things belonging to good or love are the all of affection. AC 
3859.

That testimony denotes good from which truth is derived, and truth from which good 
is derived is evident from this consideration, that the ten commandments of the 
Decalogue, written on the tables of stone, are called in one expression the testimony; 
and whereas those tables were placed in an ark, the ark is called the ark of testimony; 
hence it is evident what is signified in the Word by testimony. AC 4197.

Verse 6. Pray for the peace of Jerusalem, etc. By Jerusalem is not meant Jerusalem, 
but the church as to doctrine and worship; by peace is meant the all of doctrine and 
worship, for when these are from a celestial origin, that is, out of heaven from the 
LORD, then they are from peace and in peace, hence it is manifest what is meant by 
praying for the peace of Jerusalem; and whereas they who are in that peace are said to

414

be quiet, or at rest, it is said also, let them be quiet or at rest that love you, namely that
love the doctrine and worship of the church; by peace being within your walls, and 
prosperity within your palaces, is signified that they are in the interior man and in the 
exterior, for the exterior man with the things therein, which are scientifics and natural 
delights, is like a rampart or wall to the interior man, because it is without it and 
protects it. AE 365.

Verse 8. Because of my brethren and companions, I will now say, May peace be 
within you! This name and salutation of brethren and companions has its ground in 
this circumstance, that the LORD in heaven is the FATHER of all, and that he loves all as
his children, and heaven resembles, as it were, one family derived from love and 
charity; therefore all the sons of Israel, as representing the Lord's celestial kingdom, 
amongst each other were called brethren and companions, but when called 
companions, it was not from the good of love but from the truth of faith. AC 2060.

415

PSALM 123

A Song of degrees.

1. Unto you do I lift up mine eyes, O you that dwell in the heavens!
2. Behold, as the eyes of servants are upon the hand of their masters, and as the 
eyes of a maiden are upon the hand of her mistress, so are our eyes upon 
JEHOVAH our GOD, until he have mercy upon us.

3. Have mercy upon us, O JEHOVAH, have mercy upon us! for we are exceedingly

filled with contempt.

4. Our soul is exceedingly filled with the scorn of those who are at ease, and with

the contempt of the proud.

The Internal Sense

To the FATHER that he will give assistance, seeing he is totally neglected by the Jewish
nation, Verses 1 to 4.

Exposition

Verse 2. Behold as the eyes of servants look upon the hand of their masters, and as 
the eyes of a maiden are upon the hand of her mistress. These words denote that the 
human understanding should always have respect to use, which is the good of 
heavenly love and charity.

416

PSALM 124

A Song of degrees of David.

1. Had it not been JEHOVAH who was with us, may Israel now say;
2. Had it not been JEHOVAH who was with us when men rose up against us;
3. We had long ago been swallowed up alive, because their wrath was kindled 

against us.

4. Long ago the waters had overwhelmed us, the stream had gone over our soul;
5. Long ago had the waters gone over our soul, even the waters of the proud.
6. Blessed be JEHOVAH, who has not given us up a prey to their teeth!
7. Our soul is escaped as a bird from the snare of the fowler; the snare is broken, 

and we are escaped! 

8. Our help is in the name of JEHOVAH who has made heaven and earth!

The Internal Sense

To the FATHER, for his preservation in temptations, verses 1 to 5; from the deceitful 
and hypocrites, verses 6 to 8.

EXPOSITION

Verses 2, 4, 5. By the waters of the proud which are here mentioned, are signified 
false principles favouring self-love and confirming it, also false principles of doctrine 
which are from man's own intelligence; by a stream is signified reasonings from those
principles against truths; hence it is evident what is meant by had not JEHOVAH been 
with us when men rose up against us, namely, that when man from himself with his 
own love and from his own intelligence rises up and endeavours to destroy the truths 
of the church, for the subject treated is concerning Israel, by whom is signified the 
church; by the waters which were overwhelming them, and by the rivers which would 
pass over their soul, are signified false principles and reasonings grounded in them, 
and hence the destruction of spiritual life, which man has by truths and by a life 
according to them; by waters are signified false principles, by streams reasonings 
grounded in them, and by overwhelming and passing over the soul is signified the 
destruction of spiritual life. AE 518.

Verse 6. Blessed be JEHOVAH, who has not given us up a prey to their teeth. Blessing 
implies every good celestial, and spiritual, and also natural, which is signified by 
blessing in the internal sense; and in the external sense by blessing is signified every 
corporeal, and worldly, and terrestrial good, but these goods, if they be a blessing, 
must necessarily be from internal good, for this alone is blessing, because it is eternal 
and joined with all happiness, and is the very esse of all blessings. That all good 
belongs to those who from internal principles worship the LORD, may be manifest 
from the order of things; for this is the order: from the LORD comes all that is celestial,
from the celestial is all that is spiritual, from what is spiritual is all that is natural, this 
is the order of the existence of all things, and hence is the order of influx; what is 
celestial is love to the LORD and also neighbourly love; where there is no love, their 

417

connection is broken and the LORD is not present, who alone flows in through what is 
celestial, that is, by love; where there is not a celestial principle, there cannot be given
a spiritual principle, since all that is spiritual is through what is celestial from the 
LORD; what is spiritual is faith, wherefore there can be no faith unless by charity and 
love from the LORD; hence it follows, that they are in possession of every good, who 
from internal principles, that is from charity, worship the LORD, but they who do not 
worship from charity are not in possession of any good, only such as considered in 
itself is nothing but of excrementious delight, as the delight of hatred and adultery. AC
1096.

By the waters which would have overwhelmed them, are signified the false principles 
which overflow, and as it were overwhelm the man who is in temptations; wherefore it
is said, "Blessed be JEHOVAH, who has not given us up a prey to their teeth," that is, to
the hells, which by false principles destroy truths, thus the destructive false principles.
AE 556.

What teeth signify in an internal sense, see Psalm iii, 7, Exposition.

418

PSALM 125

A Song of degrees.

1. They who trust in JEHOVAH are like Mount Zion, which cannot be moved; it 

abides for ever!

2. As the mountains are round about Jerusalem, so is JEHOVAH round about his 

people, from now on, even for ever.

3. Truly, the sceptre of the wicked shall not rest upon the lot of the just; lest the 

just should put forth their hands to iniquity.

4. Do good, O JEHOVAH, to the good, to the upright in heart.
5. But as for those who turn aside to their crooked ways, JEHOVAH shall lead 

them forth with the workers of iniquity: peace shall be upon Israel!

The Internal Sense

That the new church will be preserved by the LORD from the false principles of evil, 
verses 1 to 5.

EXPOSITION

Verse 3. Truly the sceptre of the wicked shall not rest upon the lot of the just, lest the 
just should put forth their hands to iniquity. By breaking the sceptre of the wicked is 
signified to destroy the power of the false principle grounded in evil. AE 727.

419

PSALM 126

A Song of degrees.

1. When JEHOVAH brought back the captivity of Zion, we were like them that 

dream!

2. Then was our mouth filled with laughter, and our tongue with singing; then 
was it said amongst the nations, JEHOVAH has done great things for them.
3.
JEHOVAH has done great things for us; therefore are we glad!
4. Bring back our captivity, O JEHOVAH, like the streams in the south.
5. They that sow in tears shall reap with songs of joy.
6. He that goes forth weeping, bearing precious seed, shall, doubtless, come 

again with singing, bearing his sheaves.

The Internal Sense

The joy of the gentiles, among whom the new church is established, verses 1 to 4; that
they will be instructed, verses 5, 6.

EXPOSITION

Verse 5. They that sow in tears shall reap with songs of joy. Speaking of those who 
have been in spiritual captivity, and are set at liberty; to bear the casting of seed 
denotes instruction in truths, to come with singing denotes the gladness of the 
affection of truth, to bear sheaves denotes the doctrinals of that truth. AC 4686.

It is to be noted that shedding of tears and weeping signify grief on account of false 
principles, and grounded in false principles, but shedding of tears the grief of the 
mind, and weeping the grief of the heart on their account; the grief of the mind is the 
grief of thought and understanding, which is of truth, and the grief of the heart is the 
grief of the affection or will, which is of good; and since in the Word throughout there
is a marriage of truth and of good, therefore mention is made of both weeping and 
shedding of tears, when grief is expressed on account of false principles of doctrine or
religion; that weeping is grief of heart may be manifest from this consideration, that 
weeping is sobbing from the heart, bursting forth into lamentations through the 
mouth; and that shedding of tears is a grief of the heart may be manifest from this 
consideration, that it issues forth from the heart through the eyes, that is, by tears; in 
both cases, both of weeping and shedding of tears, water goes forth, but bitter and 
astringent, which goes forth from the influx from the spiritual world into the grief of 
man, where bitter water corresponds to the defect of truth on account of false 
principles and the grief thence derived; from these considerations it may be seen, that 
in the Word where mention is made of shedding of tears, mention is also made of 
weeping, namely that is on account of the marriage of good and of truth, and singular 
the things thereof. AE 484. Verse 6. He that goes forth weeping, bearing precious 
seed, shall doubtless come again with singing, bearing his sheaves. The series into 
which truths are arranged with the good, and the series into which false principles are 
arranged with the evil, are signified in the Word by sheaves and bundles. AC 10303.

420

PSALM 127

1. Except JEHOVAH build the house, they who build it labour but in vain; except 

2.

JEHOVAH guard the city, the watchman wakes but in vain.
It is vain for you to rise up early, to sit up late, to eat the bread of sorrows: 
truly, he gives his beloved sleep.

3. Behold, sons are an heritage from JEHOVAH; the fruit of the womb is his 

reward.

4. Like arrows in the hand of a mighty man, so are the sons of youth.
5. Blessed is the man whose quiver is filled with them; they shall not be 

ashamed, when they speak with the enemies in the gate.

The Internal Sense

That all things of the church are from the LORD, and nothing from man, verses 1 to 3; 
that he will rest in safety who is in truths from the LORD, verses 4, 5.

EXPOSITION

Verse 1. Except JEHOVAH build the house, etc. To build a house denotes to instruct the 
external man in intelligence and wisdom, see AC 1488; and since intelligence is of 
truth, and wisdom is of good, by building a house in the present case is signified the 
increase of good from truth; that house is good, may be seen, AC 2233, 2234. What 
the good of truth is, was said above, AC 4337, namely that it is truth in will and act; 
this truth is what is called good, and the conscience, which is from that good, is called
the conscience of what, is true. This good, which is from truth, increases in proportion
as a man exercises charity from a principle of good-will, thus in proportion as he 
loves his neighbour, and its quality is according to the quality of that love. The reason 
why so frequent mention is made of good and truth in these explications is because all
things which are in heaven, and hence all things which are in the LORD'S church, have 
reference to truth and good; these two principles include in general all things which 
are of doctrine and which are of life, the truths which are of doctrine, and the goods 
which are of life. The human mind also, in the universal, has no other objects than 
what are of truth and of good, its understanding (having for objects) such things as are
of truth, and its will such things as are of good. Hence it is evident, that truth and 
good are terms of most extensive signification, and that their derivations are in 
number ineffable. It is for this reason, and from this ground, that good and truth are so
frequently mentioned. AC 4390.

Verse 2. Truly, he gives his beloved sleep. That sleep, in a good sense, denotes 
tranquillity and peace, especially in that state which intervenes between temptation-
combats; see Psalm 3:5, Exposition.

Verses 3, 4, 5. By the sons who are the heritage from JEHOVAH, and by the fruit of the 
womb which is his reward, are understood the truths and goods of the church, by sons,
truths, and by the fruit of the womb, goods, for both these are rewards, and the 
heritage from JEHOVAH, that is, heaven, which is from truths and goods, namely, from 

421

the reception of them; by the sons of youth, who are like arrows in the hand of a 
mighty man, are signified the truths of the ancient church, which were natural truths 
from a spiritual origin; this church is understood by youth; and whereas all power is in
those truths against evils and falsities, therefore it is said, like arrows in the hand of a 
mighty man, arrows denoting truths destroying falsities; doctrine from truths is 
signified by the quiver, the same as by the bow; and whereas they who are in doctrine 
from those truths fear nothing from falsities, it is said, "Blessed is the man whose 
quiver is filled with them; they shall not be ashamed when they speak with the 
enemies in the gate," not to be ashamed, denoting not to be conquered, and enemies in
the gate denoting the falsities of evil which are from hell. AE 725.

Verse 5. To speak with enemies in the gate. As to what concerns the signification of 
gate, it is to be observed that in general with every man there are two gates, one leads 
to hell, which is open to evils and false principles, therein originating, in this gate are 
infernal genii and spirits; the other gate leads towards heaven, and is open to 
goodnesses and truths therein originating, and in this gate are angels; thus there is a 
gate which leads to hell and a gate which leads to heaven: the gate of hell is open to 
those who are principled in what is evil and false, in which case, through chinks only 
in all directions upwards there enters somewhat of light from heaven, whereby they 
are enabled to think and reason; but the gate of heaven is open to those who are 
principled in good and truth thence derived: for there are two ways which lead to 
man's rational mind, a superior or internal way, whereby good and truth from the 
LORD enters, and an inferior or external way, whereby evil and the false principles 
enter underneath from hell; the rational mind itself is in the middle point to which 
these two ways tend; this mind, by reason of the goodnesses and truths which are 
therein, is in the Word compared to a city, and in consequence of being go compared 
and called, it has gates allotted it, and is everywhere described as subject to be 
besieged and assaulted by enemies, that is, by wicked genii and spirits, whilst angels 
from the LORD, that is, the Lord defends it; infernal genii and spirits, with evil and 
false principles, can come no further than to the inferior or external gate, and in no 
wise into the city, for if they could come into the city, or into the rational mind, all 
would be over with man; but when they come so far, that they seem to themselves to 
have mastered the city, then it is shut, so that good and truth from heaven no longer 
flow into it, only, as was observed, somewhat through chinks round about; hence it is 
that persons in this situation have no longer any thing of charity or any thing of faith, 
but place good in evil, and truth in what is false; hence also it is that such are no 
longer truly rational, although they seem to themselves to be so, see AC 1914; and 
hence it is that they are called dead men, although to themselves they seem to live 
more than others, see AC 81; and this is in consequence of the gate of heaven being 
closed; that it is closed with persons of such a character, appears manifestly and is 
plainly perceived in another life; and it is as plainly perceived on the other hand, that 
the gate of heaven is opened to those who are principled in good and truth. As to what
particularly concerns the gate of enemies spoken of in this verse, it is to be observed, 
that this gate is with man in his natural mind, and when he is altogether a natural man,
or unregenerate, then evils and false principles possess it, or, what is the same thing, 
evil genii and spirits flow into it with the lusts of evil and the persuasions of what is 
false, see n, 687; but when man becomes spiritual or is regenerated, then evils and 
false principles, or, what is the same thing, wicked genii and spirits, are driven away 
from that gate, or from that mind, and when they are driven away, goodnesses and 
truths, or charity and faith, take their place, which is signified by the words, "Your 

422

seed shall possess the gate of your enemies;" this is effected in particular with every 
individual man during regeneration, and in like manner in another life with those who 
come into the LORD'S kingdom. 

The same is effected also in general, or in the church, which consists of several 
individuals: this was represented by the children of Israel driving out the nations from 
the land of Canaan, which circumstance, in a literal sense, is meant by the expression, 
"Your seed shall inherit the gate of your enemies," but in an internal sense is signified 
what has been said above: it was from this ground that in ancient times it was 
customary to use this expression, in blessing those who were joined together in 
marriage, as it is also evident from the blessing of Laban, when his sister Rebecca 
went betrothed to Isaac, "O our sister, be you for thousands of myriads, and may your 
seed inherit the gate of your haters," Gen 24:60. 

That such things are signified in the Word by the gate of enemies or haters, may 
appear from the following passages, "I will kill your root with famine, and will slay 
your remains; howl, O gate, cry, O city, you whole Philisthea are melted, because 
smoke comes from the north," Isaiah 14:30, 31; where to kill the root with famine, 
and to slay remains, denotes to take away goodnesses and truths which were stored up
in the interiors by the LORD; that these things are remains, may be seen, AC 468, 530, 
560, 561, 562, 661, 798, 1050 2284; gate denotes the passage to the interiors or 
rational mind; city denotes the mind itself, or goodnesses and truths therein, see AC 
402, 2268, 2450, 2451, 2712; Philisthea denotes the science of the knowledges of 
faith, or, what is the same thing, those who are principled in the science of those 
knowledges, but not in the good things of faith, see AC 1197, 1198; smoke from the 
north denotes the false principle which is from hell; that smoke is the false principle 
originating in evil may be seen, AC 1861. Again, in the same prophet, "The city of 
emptiness shall be broken, every house shall be shut up from entering in; a cry over 
the wine in the streets, all gladness shall be desolated, the joy of the earth shall be 
banished, what remains in the city shall be desolation, and the gate shall be smitten 
with vastation, for thus shall it be in the midst of the earth, in the midst of the people,"
Is 24:10, 11, 12, 13; the city of emptiness which shall be broken denotes the human 
mind in it is deprived of truth; the shutting of every house denotes that it is without 
good; that house is good, may be seen, AC 2233; a cry over wine in the streets 
denotes the state of the false principle; that cry is predicated of what is false, may be 
seen, AC 2240; that wine is truth, concerning which there is a cry that it is not, see AC
1071; that streets are what lead to truths, see AC 2336; gladness which is desolated is 
predicated of truths, the joy of the earth which is banished is predicated of 
goodnesses; hence it is evident what is signified by this, that what remained in the city
should be desolation, and that the gate should be smitten with vastation; the gate is 
said to be vas-tated, when nothing but evils and falsities have rule. 

So in Jeremiah, "The ways of Zion do mourn, so that they come not to the appointed 
festival, all her gates are desolate, her priests groan, her virgins are anxious, and it is 
bitter to her; her enemies are become the head, her foes are secure, because JEHOVAH 
has affected with anxiety, on the multitude of her transgressions, her infants have gone
away captive before the enemy," Lam 1:4, 5; the ways of Zion that mourn denote that 
there were no longer any truths grounded in good; that ways are truths, may be seen, 
AC 189, 627; all her gates desolate denote that all the passages were possessed by 
falsities; the enemies becoming the head denote that evils had rule. 

423

Again, in the same prophet, "JEHOVAH has made the outwork to mourn, and the wall 
of the daughter of Zion, they languish together, her gates are sunk into the earth, he 
has destroyed and broken her bolts, her kings and her princes are amongst the 
gentiles; the law is not, even the prophets have not found vision from JEHOVAH; all 
your enemies have opened their mouth upon you, they have hissed and gnashed with 
the tooth, they have said, we have swallowed her up, certainly this is the day which 
we have waited for, have found, have seen," Lam 2:8, 9, 16; where the gate sunk into 
the earth denotes that the natural mind was seized upon by evils and falsities; her 
kings and princes being amongst the gentiles, denote that truths were immersed in 
evils; that king denotes truth in general, see AC 1672; that princes are primary truths, 
see AC 1482; that gentiles (nations) are evils, see AC 1259, 1260. 

So in Moses, "A nation from afar, from the extremity of the earth, shall straighten you
in all your gates, in your whole land, thus shall your enemy straighten you," Deut 
28:52, 53; speaking of the curses denounced against the people, if they did not 
continue steadfast in the commandments and statutes; a nation from afar, from the 
extremity of the earth, in an internal sense denotes evils and falsities, or those who are
principled in what is evil and false; to straighten in all the gates denotes the shutting 
up of every passage for good and truth. 

So in Nahum, "Behold your people women in the midst of you, the gates of your land 
are open with opening to your foes, the fire devours your bolts; draw out for yourself 
waters of a siege, strengthen your fortifications, enter into the mire, and tread pitch, 
make strong the brick-kiln," Nahum 3:13, 14; the gates of the land being open to foes 
denotes that evils possess the place where goodnesses should be. So in the book of 
Judges, "Ways have ceased, and they have gone in paths, they have gone in winding 
paths, villages have ceased in Israel, he has chosen new gods, then were the gates 
assaulted, was there a shield seen, or spear among forty thousand in Israel," Judges 
5:6, 7, 8; the prophetic song or enunciation of Deborah and Barak; to assault the gates
denotes the assaulting goodnesses and truths. So in David, "The inhabitants of the 
gate conceive thoughts against me, they that drink strong drink make melody," Psalm 
69:12; where the inhabitants of the gate denote evils and falsities, also infernals. So in
Ezekiel, "In the visions of GOD I was led to the door of the inner gate looking towards
the north, where I saw the abominations of the house of Israel: I also was led to the 
door of the gate of the house of JEHOVAH looking towards the north, where were also 
abominations," Ez 8:3, 6, 14, 15; the door of the inner gate looking towards the north 
denotes the place where were interior falsities; the door of the gate of the house of 
JEHOVAH denotes the place where were interior evils; that there are interior falsities 
and evils, and that there is an interior sphere wherein are such spirits and genii may be
seen, AC 2121. 

So in David, "Lo, sons are an heritage from JEHOVAH, the fruit of the womb is his 
reward, as arrows in the hand of a strong one, so are the sons of youth, blessed is the 
man who has filled his quiver from them, they shall not be ashamed, when they shall 
speak with the enemies in the gate" Psalm 127:3, 4, 5; to speak with enemies in the 
gate denotes not to fear evils and falsities, consequently not to fear hell: so in Isaiah, 
"In that day shall JEHOVAH of Zebaoth be for a spirit of judgement to him that sits for 
judgement, and for strength to them that turn the battle to the gate, and also these are 
insane with wine, and err with strong drink," Isaiah 28:5, 6, 7; again, in the same 
prophet, "Elam lifted up the quiver in the chariot of a man, and horsemen, Kir made 

424

naked the shield, and the choice of your valleys was full of chariots and horsemen, 
they set themselves at the gate, and he looked in that day to the armoury of the house 
of the forest," Isaiah 22:6, 7, 8. So in Jeremiah, "Judah has mourned, and her gates 
have languished, they are black to the earth, and the cry of Jerusalem is gone up, the 
great ones have sent the little ones to the waters, they have come to the pits, and have 
not found waters," Jer 14:1, 2, 3; again, in the same prophet, "The elders have ceased 
from the gate, the youths from their music," Lam 5:14; from these passages it may 
appear what is signified by the gate of enemies, namely hell, or infernals, who 
continually assault goodnesses and truths, and whose habitation is with man, as was 
said, in his natural mind; but when man is such as to admit goodnesses and truths, 
consequently angels, then the infernals are driven away by the LORD from their 
habitation, and when they are driven away, the gate of heaven, or heaven itself, is 
opened; this gate is also frequently mentioned in the Word, as in the following 
passages, "A song in the land of Judah, we have a strong city, salvation will set walls 
and outworks; open you the gates, and the righteous nation shall enter, that keeps 
faithfulnesses," 26:1, 2; again, in the same prophet, "Thus says JEHOVAH to his 
anointed Cyrus, whose hand I have taken hold of, to cause the nations to go down 
before him, and I will open the loins of kings, to open before him valves, and the 
gates shall not be shut; I will go before you, and make the crooked things straight, I 
will break in pieces the gates of brass, and cut in sunder the bars of iron," 45:1, 2. 
Again, "The sons of the stranger shall build your walls, and their kings shall minister 
to you, they shall open your gates continually, they shall not be shut day and night; 
violence shall no more be heard in your land, wasteness and breaking to pieces in 
your borders, and you shall call your walls salvation, and your gates praise," 60:10, 
11, 18; again, "Pass through, pass through the gates, prepare a way for the people, 
make level, make level the path, say to the daughter of Zion, behold your salvation 
comes," 62:10, 11, 12; so in Micah, "They shall pass through the gate, and they shall 
go forth thereby, and their king shall pass through before them, and JEHOVAH in their 
beginning," Micah 2:13. 

So in David, "Lift up your heads you gates, and be you lifted up you everlasting 
doors, and the King of Glory shall come in; Who is the King of Glory? JEHOVAH 
strong and mighty, JEHOVAH mighty in war; lift up your heads you gates, and be you 
lifted up you everlasting doors," Psalm 24:7, 8, 9, 10; again, "Celebrate JEHOVAH, O 
Jerusalem, praise your GOD, O Zion, because he secures the bars of your gates, he 
blesses your children in the midst of you," Psalm 147:12, 13. Hence it is evident that 
the gate of heaven is where the angels are with man, that is, where the influx of good 
and truth from the LORD is; consequently, that there are two gates, as was said: 
concerning these two gates the LORD thus speaks in Matthew, "Enter you in by the 
straight gate, because wide is the gate and broad the way which leads to destruction, 
and many there be that enter therein, because straight is the gate and narrow the way 
which leads to life, and few there be that find it," Matt 7:12, 13, 14; Luke 13:23, 24. 
Moreover the gates to the New Jerusalem, and the gates to the New Temple, are much
treated of in Ezekiel, and also in the Revelation, by which gates nothing else is meant 
but the passage to heaven; concerning these gates see Ezekiel 40:6 to 49; 43:1, 2, 4; 
44:1, 2, 3; 46:1 to 9, 12; 48:31, 32, 33, 34; Rev 21:12, 13, 21, 25; 22:14; Isaiah 54:11, 
12; hence Jerusalem is called "the gate of the people," Micah 1:9; Obadiah 1:13. AC 
2851. "

PSALM 128

A Song of degrees.

1. Blessed is every one who fears JEHOVAH, who walk-eth in his ways!
2. Truly, you shall eat the labour of your hands; blessed are you, yea, it shall be 

well with you!

3. Your wife shall be as a fruitful vine by the sides of your house; your sons shall

be like olive plants around your table.

4. Behold, truly, thus shall the man be blessed who fears JEHOVAH!
5.

JEHOVAH shall bless you from out of Zion, and you shall behold the good of 
Jerusalem all the days of your life.

6. Yea, you shall see your children's children, and peace upon Israel.

The Internal Sense

That they are blessed who are of the LORD'S church, because in the church there is 
goodness in abundance, verses 1 to 6.

Exposition

Verse 1. Blessed is every one who fears JEHOVAH, who walks in his ways. To fear 
JEHOVAH is here to think reverently and holily of God, and to walk in his ways is to 
live according to Divine truth, by both there is a performance of worship; but in 
external worship, which is to live according to Divine truths, there must be internal 
worship, which is to fear JEHOVAH, wherefore it is said, that he who fears JEHOVAH is 
one who walks in his ways. AE 696.

Verses 1 to 6. By being blessed is not here meant to be blessed naturally, as by eating 
the labour of his hands, by his wife being fruitful, by having many sons around his 
table, but it means to be spiritually blessed; for by those who fear JEHOVAH are meant 
such as love to do his precepts, wherefore it is said, "Blessed is every one who fears 
JEHOVAH, who walks in his ways," whore to walk in his ways signifies to do his 
precepts; by the labour of his hands which he should eat, is signified application of 
life, accordingly by the wife on the sides of the house is signified the affection of 
spiritual truth, wherefore also it is said, as a fruitful vine, for by vine is signified the 
spiritual church from the affection of truth; by the sons around the table are signified 
the truths of good thence derived; tables are instructions, wherefore it is also said, as 
olive plants; plants signifying truths, and olives goods. AE 340.

Verse 2. Truly, you shall eat the labour of your hands, blessed are you, yea, it shall be
well with you! By eating the labour of your hands is signified celestial good which 
man receives by a life according to Divine truths from the LORD, and which he, as it 
were, acquires by his own labour and study, wherefore it is said, that he eats who 
fears JEHOVAH and walks in his ways, and afterwards, blessed are you, and it shall be 
well with you. AE 617.

426

Verse 3. Your wife shall be as a fruitful vine by the sides of your house, your sons 
shall be like olive plants around your table. Where wife as a fruitful vine denotes the 
spiritual church; sons denote the truths of faith, which are called olive plants, because 
from the goods of charity. AC 886.

In the Word, where good is treated of, truth is also mentioned, by reason of their 
marriage; in like manner where the celestial principle is treated of, the spiritual 
principle is also mentioned; the celestial principle is also predicated of good, and the 
spiritual of truth; therefore of the vine and of the olive: that a vine denotes the spiritual
church and its good and truth, see AC 1069; on this account also the vine and the olive
are mentioned together in other places, as in David, "Your wife shall be as a fruitful 
vine by the sides of your house, your sons shall be like olive plants around your 
table." AC 10261.

Verse 6. Yea, you shall see your children's children, and peace upon Israel. Children's
children, or sons of sons, signify the truths of doctrine and their multiplication to 
eternity, since all these things are from the LORD, and by the peace which is from him,
therefore it is concluded that you may see peace upon Israel, Israel denoting those 
who are of the church. AE 365.

PSALM 129

A Song of degrees.

1. Many a time have they distressed me from my youth, may Israel now say:
2. Many a time have they distressed me from my youth, yet, they have not 

prevailed against me.

3. The ploughers have ploughed upon my back; they have made long their 

furrows.
JEHOVAH is just! He has cut to pieces the cords of the wicked.
4.
5. May all who hate Zion be put to shame and driven backward!
6. May they be like grass upon the house-top, which withers before it is plucked 

up.

7. With which the mower fills not his hand, nor he who binds sheaves his bosom.
8. Nor do they who pass by say, May the blessing of JEHOVAH be upon you! We 

bless you in the name of JEHOVAH!

The Internal Sense

That the wicked have done great injury to the LORD'S church from the beginning, 
verses 1 to 3; but that they have been frustrated in their endeavours and constrained to
recede, verses 4 to 8.

Exposition

Verse 6. May they be like grass upon the house-top, which withers before it is plucked
up. By green grass is signified the scientific truth, which is alive, but by grass burnt 
up or withered, the scientific false, which is dead. When truth and good, which come 
out of heaven, have not a receptacle in knowledges and scientifics with man, but evils 
and falsities which are from hell, then scientifics are not alive, but dead, and 
correspond to grass withered and burnt up; the same is the case with man himself, for 
the quality of man is such as the quality of living knowledges and scientifics 
belonging to him; for from the sciences which live, or are alive, he derives 
intelligence, whereas from the sciences which do not live, he has no intelligence, and 
if they are dead in consequence of the confirmation of falsities by them, he derives 
thence insanity and folly: such a man, from correspondence, is, in the Word, 
compared to grass, and is also called grass, as in the following passages: in Isaiah, 
"The inhabitants are become as the herb of the field, the pulse of grass, the grass of 
the house-tops, and as the corn blasted before it be grown up," Isaiah 37:27; 2 Kings 
19:26; and in David, "The wicked shall be suddenly cut off as the grass, and shall 
decay as the pulse of the herb," Psalm 32:2; again, "As for man, his days are as the 
grass, as the flower of the field so he flourishes," Psalm 103:15; and again, "The 
haters of Zion shall be as the grass on the house-tops, which withers before it is 
plucked," Psalm 129:6; again in Isaiah, "The glory of JEHOVAH shall be revealed, and 
they shall see: the voice said, cry, and he said what shall I cry; all flesh is grass, and 
all the holiness thereof as the flower of the field; the grass withers, and the flower 
fades, because the wind of JEHOVAH breathes upon it; truly, the people is grass, the 

428

grass withers, the flower fades, but the word of our GOD shall stand for ever," Isaiah 
40:5, 6, 7, 8. 

These things are said concerning the advent of the LORD, and the revelation of Divine 
truth then to take place from him, which is understood by the glory of JEHOVAH shall 
be revealed, and they shall see; that then there would be no scientific truth nor 
spiritual truth with man, is signified by all flesh is grass, and all the holiness thereof 
as the flower of the field, the grass withers and the flower fades, grass denoting 
scientific truth, and the flower of the field denoting spiritual truth; that man is of such 
a nature and quality, is understood by all flesh is grass, and by truly the people is 
grass, the grass withers, all flesh denoting every man, and the people, those who were
in truths but are now in falsities. AE 507.

Verse 7. With which the mower fills not his hand, nor he who binds sheaves his 
bosom. What is specifically signified by bruising and grinding cannot be known, 
unless it be known how the case is with man in respect to the goods and truths which 
are signified by wheat, barley-meal, fine flour, oil, frankincense, and spices, when 
they are arranged for uses; when grinding is predicated of the goods which are 
signified by wheat or barley, then by grinding is signified the arrangement and 
production of good into truths, and thereby application to uses; good also, in no case, 
puts itself forth into uses except by truths, it is arranged into truths and is thereby 
qualified, for good, unless it be arranged into truths, has not any quality, and when it 
is arranged into truths, it is then arranged into series in application to things according
to uses, into which things good enters as the affection of love, whence comes what is 
grateful, pleasant, and delightful. What is meant by arrangement into series, it may 
also be expedient briefly to explain; truths are said to be arranged into series, when 
they are arranged according to the form of heaven, in which form the angelic societies
are. The series into which truths are arranged with the good, and the series into which 
false principles are arranged with the evil, are signified in the Word by sheaves and 
bundles, Psalm 126:6, 129:7. AC 10303.

429

PSALM 130

A Song of degrees.

1. Out of the depths do I cry to you, O JEHOVAH!
2. O LORD, hearken to my voice; let your ears be attentive to the voice of my 

supplications.
3.
If you, O JAH, should mark iniquities, O LORD, who could stand?
4. But with you there is forgiveness, therefore should you be feared.
5.
6. My soul waits for the LORD, more than they who watch for the morning, yea, 

I wait for JEHOVAH, yea, my soul does wait, and in his Word do I hope.

than they who watch for the morning.

7. Let Israel hope in JEHOVAH, for with JEHOVAH is mercy, and with him is 

plentiful redemption.

8. And he will redeem Israel from all his iniquities.

The Internal Sense

A prayer to the LORD that they may be preserved, verses 1 to 4; that the coming of the 
LORD and redemption are expected, verses 5 to 8.

EXPOSITION

Verses 5, 6, 7, 8. The subject here treated of is concerning the coming of the LORD 
into the world, and his reception by those who are in the good of love; the coming of 
the LORD is signified by waiting for JEHOVAH, as expressed by the words my soul 
waits for the LORD, because with him is redemption, and he will redeem Israel; and 
his reception by those who are in the good of love, is signified by watching for the 
morning, morning there signifying in the supreme sense, the LORD, and in the internal 
sense, his kingdom and church, and they that watch for the morning signify those who
expect the coming of the LORD, who are they that are in the good of love, inasmuch as
they are the persons to whom the LORD is the morning; since morning signifies the 
LORD, his coming, also his kingdom and church, and the good of love which is from 
him, it may hence be manifest what is meant by morning in the following passages, 
"Make me to hear your mercy in the morning;" " I will sing in the morning of your 
mercy." AE 179.

Verses 7, 8. Let Israel hope in JEHOVAH, for with JEHOVAH is mercy, and with him is 
plentiful redemption. And he will redeem Israel from all his iniquities. Redemption 
denotes deliverance, Israel denotes the church, to reform and deliver from false 
principles those who were of the church, is signified by his redeeming Israel from all 
his iniquities, AE 328.

430

PSALM 131

A Song of degrees of David,

1. O JEHOVAH, my heart is not haughty, nor mine eyes lofty; neither do I walk in 

great things, nor in things too high for me.

2. Surely I have composed and quieted my soul, as a child that is weaned of his 

mother; my soul is even as a weaned child.

3. Let Israel hope in JEHOVAH, now on even for ever!

The Internal Sense

Concerning the LORD, that he operated from his Human essence; that he operated 
indeed by influx from his Divine principle, but not from his Divine principle alone, 
verses 1, 2; the church is to put her trust in him, verse 3.

Exposition

Verse 2. My soul is even as a weaned child. That to be weaned denotes to be 
separated, and in relation to the LORD the separation of the maternal human, see AC 
2649. It is to be observed, that the LORD successively and continually, even to the last 
period of his life in the world, when he was glorified, separated from himself, and put 
off that which was merely human, namely what he derived from the mother, till at 
length he was no longer her son, but the son of GOD, as well with respect to nativity as
to conception, and thus became one with the FATHER, and himself JEHOVAH; that he 
separated from himself and put off all the human principle which he had from the 
mother, so that he was no longer her son, appears plain from the LORD'S words in 
John, "When they wanted wine, the mother of Jesus said to him, they have no wine; 
JESUS said to her, Woman, what have I to do with you?" John 2:3, 4; and in Matt. 
"Then said one to him, behold, your mother and your brethren stand without, seeking 
to speak to you; but Jesus answering said to him that had told him, who is my mother, 
and who my brethren? and stretching forth, his hand over his disciples he said, behold
my mother, and my brethren; for whoever shall do the will of my FATHER, who is in 
the heavens, the same is my brother, and sister, and mother," 12:47, 48, 49; Mark 
3:32, 33, 34, 35; Luke 8:20, 21; and in Luke, "A certain woman of the people lifting 
up her voice said to him, blessed is the womb which bare you, and the paps which you
have sucked; but JESUS said, blessed are they who hear the Word of GOD and keep it," 
Luke 11:27, 28; where when the woman spoke of a mother, the LORD spoke of those 
above-mentioned, namely whoever shall do the will of my FATHER, the same is my 
brother, my sister, and mother, which is the same thing with what is here said, blessed 
are they who hear the Word of GOD and keep it; so in John, "JESUS seeing the mother, 
and the disciple standing by whom he loved, said to his mother, woman, behold your 
son; then said he to the disciple, behold your mother, wherefore from that hour the 
disciple took her to himself," John 19:26, 27; from which words it is evident, that the 
LORD spoke to her agreeably to what she thought when she saw him on the cross, but 
still he does not call her mother, but woman, and transfers the name of mother to 
those who are signified by the disciple, wherefore he said to the disciple, behold your 

431

mother; this appears still more manifestly from the LORD'S words in Matthew, Jesus 
asked the Pharisees, saying, What think you concerning Christ? Whose son is he? 
They say to him, David's. He says to them, How then does David in spirit call him 
LORD, saying, the LORD said to my LORD, sit on my right hand, until I make your 
enemies your footstool; if David therefore call him LORD, how is he his son? Matt 
22:41, to the end; Mark 12:35, 36, 37; Luke 20:42, 43, 44; thus he was no longer the 
son of David as to the flesh. As to what further concerns the separation and putting off
of the maternal human principle, it is to be observed, that it is inconceivable to those 
who form merely corporeal ideas concerning the LORD'S Human principle, and think 
of it as of the human principle of another man, whereby they are offended at it; such 
persons are not aware, that according to the nature and quality of the life, such is the 
man, and that the LORD had by conception a Divine esse of life, or JEHOVAH, and that 
a like esse of life had existence in his Human principle by union. AC 2649.

For the use of those who are in the internal sense three arcana shall he here explained,
the first is, that the LORD'S Divine Human [principle] existed from the essential Divine
[principle,] which subject is further treated of in this verse. The second is, that the 
LORD'S Divine Human [principle] was not only conceived of JEHOVAH, but also born 
of JEHOVAH, hence the LORD, as to his Divine Human [principle,] is called the Son of 
GOD, and the Only-begotten, John 1:14, 18, 49, 3:16, 18, 35, 36, 5:19-27, 6:69, 9:35, 
10:36, 11:27, 14:13-14, 17:1, 20:31, in like manner with the other Evangelists. The 
third is, that the LORD'S Divine Human [principle] is the name of JEHOVAH, that is, his 
quality, see John 12:28. AC 2628.

432

PSALM 132

A Song of degrees.

JEHOVAH, remember David, in all his afflictions.

1.
2. How we swore to JEHOVAH, and made a vow to the mighty one of Jacob:
3. Surely I will not come into the tabernacle of my house, nor go up into my bed;
4.
5. Until I shall have found a place for JEHOVAH, a habitation for the mighty one 

I will not give sleep to mine eyes, nor slumber to mine eyelids.

of Jacob.

6. Lo, we heard of it at Ephrata; we found it in the fields of the forest.
7. We will go into his habitation; we will worship at his footstool.
8. Arise, O JEHOVAH, and enter into your resting-place, you, and the ark of your 

strength.

9. Let your priests be clothed with justice, and let your saints sing for joy,
10. For the sake of David your servant, turn not away the face of your anointed.
11. JEHOVAH has sworn in truth to David, he will not turn from it: saying, of the 

fruit of your body will I set upon your throne!

12. If your sons will keep my covenant, and my testimony which I shall teach 

them, their children also for ever shall sit upon your throne.

13. For JEHOVAH has chosen Zion; he has desired it for a habitation for himself.
14. Saying, this shall be my resting-place for ever; here will I dwell for I have 

desired it.

15. I will assuredly bless her provision, I will satisfy her poor with bread.
16. Her priests also will I clothe with salvation, and her saints shall sing aloud for 

joy.

17. There will I cause the horn of David to flourish; I have prepared a lamp for 

mine anointed.

18. His enemies will I clothe with shame, but upon himself shall his crown 

flourish.

The Internal Sense

Concerning the Lord, that he rested not until he saw his church established, verses 1 
to 5; that he was born in Bethlehem; let us adore him, verses 6, 7; who united the 
Divine to his Human essence, verse 8; he is worshiped in goodness and in truth, 
verses 9, 10; that it is an eternal truth that they who worship him will be saved, verses 
11, 12; that the LORD dwells in his church because he loves it, verses 13, 14; because 
it is in truths and goodnesses, verses 15, 16; that thence it is in power and in light, 
against the false principles of evil, verses 17, 18.

Exposition

Verse 3. Surely I will not come into the tabernacle of my house, nor go up on the 
couch of my bed. To go up on the couch of the bed denotes upon the natural principle 
to the truth which is from the good of love; that to enter within the tent of the house, 

433

and to ascend on the couch of the bed, is a prophetic saying, which without the 
internal sense cannot be understood, may be manifest to every one. AC 6188.

Verses 6, 7, 8. Speaking of the LORD, where Ephrata is Bethlehem, where the LORD 
was born; you and the ark of your strength denotes the LORD and his representative. 
That the ark was worshiped instead of JEHOVAH by the Israelitish and Jewish people, 
and that it was believed that he dwelt there, and between the cherubs, is evident from 
the second book of Samuel 6:2. The reason why the inmost heaven was signified by 
the ark was, because by the whole tabernacle or tent was signified the universal 
angelic heaven, its external by the court, its middle by the habitation where the 
priests ministered, and the inmost by the habitation within the veil, where the ark was,
in which was the testimony. AC 9485.

Verses 6, 7, 8, 9. The subject here treated of is concerning the LORD, who is also here 
meant by David, as may be manifest from this consideration, thus it is said, we have 
found him in Ephrata, and in the fields of the forest, also, they bowed themselves at 
his footstool; Ephrata is Bethlehem where the LORD was born, and by Ephrata is 
signified the Word as to its natural sense, and by Bethlehem the Word as to its spiritual
sense, and he was willing to be born there, because the LORD is the Word, by the 
fields of the forest are signified those things which are of the natural sense of the 
Word, thus which are the sense of the letter; the spiritual sense of the Word is also 
signified by his habitation, and hence also heaven, because heaven is in that sense; 
and by the footstool to which they should bow themselves, is signified the natural 
sense of the Word, and hence also the church on earth, because it is in that sense; by 
the rest to which JEHOVAH shall rise, is signified the union of the Divine and Human 
principle, and his conjunction with heaven and the church; and since the LORD has 
rest and peace, and they also have rest and peace who are in heaven and the church, 
when he has subdued the hells, and arranged all things in order there and in the 
heavens, it is said, arise you in the ark of your strength; by you is meant the LORD 
himself, and by the ark of your strength is meant the Divine truth proceeding from 
him, for by this truth the LORD has Divine power; by the priests who should be 
clothed with justice, and by the saints who should sing for joy, are signified similar 
things, as by the hundred and ten thousand of Israel, by the priests those who are in 
good, and by the saints those who are in truths, thus abstractedly the goods and truths 
of heaven and the church, AE 700.

Verse 7. We will go into his habitation; we will worship at his footstool. In the 
representative church, consequently amongst the Jews, it was supposed that the house 
of GOD and the temple was his footstool, not knowing that by the house of GOD and 
the temple was signified representative external worship; they were altogether 
ignorant of the nature of the internal things of the church, which were signified by 
heaven, or the throne of GOD: again, "JEHOVAH says to my LORD, sit on my right hand 
until I make your enemies a footstool, Psalm 110:1;" by footstool in like manner are 
here signified things natural, as well sensual as scientific, and hence the rational 
things of man, which are called enemies when they pervert worship, and this by the 
literal sense of the Word, so that there remains only worship in externals, and internal 
worship either totally perishes or is defiled, but inasmuch as in themselves they have 
relation to internal worship, when this worship is restored they then become a 
footstool. AC 2162.

434

Verse 11. JEHOVAH has sworn in truth to David, he will not turn from it: of the fruit of 
your body will I set upon your throne. By David here, as also in other passages, is 
meant the LORD as to the spiritual kingdom, which is his royalty, wherefore by setting
on the throne the fruit of his body, is meant who is regenerated by him; he is called 
the fruit of his body, from this consideration, because he is in truths, and in a life 
according to them; by the throne which is his, is meant heaven; these are the things 
which are signified in the spiritual sense by those words, but in the supreme sense by 
them is meant the LORD and his glorification. AE 710.

Verse 11. JEHOVAH has sworn in truth, etc. JEHOVAH swearing in truth to David 
manifestly denotes the confirmation of eternal truth, wherefore it is said, "From which
he will not recede;" that by David is meant the LORD, was shown above, nevertheless 
an oath was made to David, inasmuch as he was such, that he believed it to be 
confirmed respecting himself and his posterity, for David was principled in the love of
himself and his posterity, and hence he believed that the oath had respect thereto, 
namely that his seed should be established for ever, and his throne to generation and 
generation, when yet this was spoken of the LORD. By JEHOVAH or the LORD swearing
to give the land to Abraham, to Isaac, and Jacob, or their posterity, in an internal 
sense, is signified confirmation, that he would give the heavenly kingdom to those 
who are principled in love and faith towards himself; these are they who are meant in 
the internal sense of the Word by the sons and posterity of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob,
or the fathers; which was also actually represented by this, that the land of Canaan 
was given to their posterity, and that the church at that time with them represented the 
LORD'S celestial kingdom, as did also the land itself. AC 2842.

Verse 17. There will I cause the horn of David to flou-rish; I have prepared a lamp for
mine anointed. The reason why kings were called the anointed of JEHOVAH, and that 
on this account it was sacrilegious to hurt them, was, because by the anointed of 
JEHOVAH is meant the LORD as to the Divine Human principle, although as to the 
sense of the letter, the term was applied to the king, who was anointed with oil, for the
LORD, when he was in the world, was Divine truth itself as to the Human principle, 
and was Divine good itself as to the very esse of his life, which esse with man is 
called the soul derived from the FATHER, for he was conceived of JEHOVAH, and 
JEHOVAH in the Word is the Divine good of the Divine love which is the esse of the 
life of all; hence it is that the LORD alone was the anointed of JEHOVAH in very essence
and very act, inasmuch as the Divine good was in him, and the Divine truth 
proceeding from that good in his Human principle when he was in the world, AC 
9194; but the kings of the earth were not the anointed of JEHOVAH, but represented the
LORD, who alone is the anointed of JEHOVAH, and on this account it was sacrilegious 
to hurt them by reason of the anointing; but the anointing of the kings of the earth 
was effected by oil, whereas the anointing of the LORD was of the Divine good itself 
of the Divine love, which the oil represented. AC 9954.

435

PSALM 133

A Song of degrees of David.

1. Behold, how good and how delightful it is for brethren to dwell together in 

2.

3.

unity!
It is as the precious oil upon the head, which descends upon the beard, the 
beard of Aaron, which descends upon the hem of his garments!
It is as the dew of Hermon, which descends upon the mountains of Zion! truly,
there has JEHOVAH commanded a blessing, even life for ever more.

The Internal Sense

That essential good is the conjunction of good and truth, verse 1; for the good of love 
must flow into the truth of the external or natural man, verse 2; that the truth of good 
is from heaven upon those who are of the church, in which is salvation, verse 3.

EXPOSITION

Verses l, 2, 3. It is impossible to know what these words signify, unless it be known 
what is signified by brethren, what by the oil upon the head of Aaron, what by his 
beard, and the hem (or collar) of his garments, and what by the dew of Hermon, and 
the mountains of Zion; by brethren are there signified good and truth, for these are 
called brethren in the Word, wherefore by behold how good and how delightful it is 
for brethren to dwell together, is signified that all celestial good and delight is in the 
conjunction of good and truth, because they originate in that conjunction. By the oil 
upon the head, descending upon the beard, the beard of Aaron, that descends upon 
the hem of his garments, is signified that thence is derived every good and every 
delight of heaven, from inmost [principles] to ultimates, for by the head is signified 
what is inmost, by the beard what is ultimate, and by descending upon the hem of his 
garments is signified the influx and conjunction of celestial good and spiritual good; 
that in the Word good and truth are called brethren, may be seen, AC 367, 3160; that 
the head signifies what is inmost, AC 4838, 4939; that the beard signifies what is 
ultimate, AC 9960; that the hem (or collar) of his garments signifies the influx and 
conjunction of celestial and spiritual good, consequently of good and truth, AC 9913; 
and it is said of Aaron, because by Aaron was represented the LORD as to Divine good,
for all good, and all conjunction of good and truth is from him, see AC 9806, 9966; by
the dew of Harmon is signified Divine truths, and by the mountains of Zion is 
signified Divine good, hence by these words, as the dew of Herman, which descends 
upon the mountains of Zion, is signified the conjunction of truth and good which is 
there treated of; and inasmuch as all the spiritual life of men and angels exists by 
virtue of that conjunction, it is also said, there JEHOVAH has commanded the blessing, 
even life for ever more; that dew signifies Divine truth, may be seen, AC 3579, 8455. 
That mountains signify Divine good, and whence this is, AC 795, 4210; and that Zion 
signifies the church which is principled in the good of love, AC 2362, 9055; hence it 
is evident what is the nature and quality of the Word in the spiritual sense. AE 375.

As this Psalm treats of mutual love and charity, or the love of the neighbour, it may be
well, in this place, to show who and what the neighbour is, and likewise what it is that
constitutes true charity. It shall be first shown who and what our neighbour is, as it is 
our neighbour who is to be loved, and towards whom charity is to be exercised: for 
unless it be known what our neighbour is, charity may be exercised in a similar 
manner, without distinction, towards the evil as well as towards the good, whence 
charity becomes no charity: for the evil, from the benefactions conferred on them, do 
evil to their neighbour, but the good do good.

It is a common opinion at this day, that every man is equally our neighbour, and that 
benefits are to be conferred on every one who needs assistance; but it is the business 
of Christian prudence, to examine well the quality of a man's life, and to exercise 
charity to him accordingly. The man of the internal church, exercises his charity with 
discrimination, consequently with intelligence; but the man of the external church, for
as much as he is not so able to discern things, does it indiscriminately.

The distinctions of the relationship of neighbour, which the man of the church ought 
well to know, depend upon the good which is with every one; and for as much as all 
goods proceed from the LORD, therefore the LORD is our neighbour in a supreme sense
and in a supereminent degree, and the origin of the relationship is from him. Hence it 
follows that so much of the LORD as is resident with any one, in that degree he is our 
neighbour; and for as much as no one receives the LORD, that is, good from him, in 
the same manner as another, therefore no one is our neighbour in the same manner as 
another: for all who are in the heavens, and all the good who are on the earth, differ in
good; no two ever receive a good that is altogether one and the same; it must be 
various that each may subsist by itself. But all these varieties, consequently all the 
distinctions of the relationship of neighbour, which depend on the reception of the 
LORD, that is, on the reception of good from him, can never be known by any man, 
nor indeed by any angel, except in a general manner, or with respect to their kinds and
the species thereof: neither does the LORD require any more of the man of the church, 
than to live according to what he knows.

For as much as good is different with every one, it follows, that the quality of his 
good determines in what degree and in what proportion any one is our neighbour. 
That this is the case is plain from the LORD'S parable concerning him that fell among 
robbers, who, when half-dead, the priest passed by, and also the Levite; but the 
Samaritan, after he had bound up his wounds, and poured in oil and wine, took him up
on his own beast, and led him to an inn, and ordered that care should be taken of him; 
he, for as much as he exercised the good of charity, is called his neighbour, Luke 
10:29 to 37; whence it may be known that they are our neighbour who are in good: oil
and wine which the Samaritan poured into the wounds, also signify good and its truth.

It is plain from what has now been said, that in a universal sense, good is our 
neighbour, for as much as a man is our neighbour according to the quality of the good 
that is with him from the LORD; and for as much as good is our neighbour so is love, 
for all good is of love; consequently every man is our neighbour according to the 
quality of the love which he possesses from the LORD.

That love is what causes any one to be our neighbour, and that every one is our 
neighbour according to the quality of his love, appears manifestly from the case of 

437

those who are in the love of self, who acknowledge for their neighbour those who 
love them most, that is, so far as they are their own favourers, they embrace them, 
they treat them with kindness, they confer benefits on them, and call them brothers; 
yea, for as much as they are evil, they say, that these are their neighbour more than 
others: they esteem others as their neighbour in proportion as they love themselves, 
thus according to the quality and quantity of their love: such persons derive the origin 
of the relationship of neighbour from self, by reason that love constitutes and 
determines it. But they who do not love themselves more than others, as is the case 
with all who belong to the kingdom of the LORD, will derive the origin of the 
relationship of neighbour from him whom they ought to love above all things, 
consequently, from the LORD; and they will esteem every one as their neighbour 
according to the quality of his love to him and from him. Hence it appears from 
whence the origin of the relationship of neighbour is to be drawn by the men of the 
church; and that every one is our neighbour according to the good which he possesses 
from the LORD, consequently that good itself is our neighbour.

That this is the case, the LORD also teaches in Matthew, "for he said to those who were
in good, - that they had given him to eat, that they had given him to drink, that they 
had gathered him, had clothed him, had visited him, and had come to him in prison; 
and afterwards, that so far as they had done it to one of the least of their brethren, they
had done it to him," Matt 25:34 to 40; in these six kinds of good, when understood in 
the spiritual sense, are comprehended all the kinds of the relationship of neighbour. 
Hence likewise it is evident, that when good is loved, the LORD is loved, for it is the 
LORD from whom good proceeds, who is in good, and who is good itself.

But our neighbour is not only man singly, but also man collectively, as a less or 
greater society, our country, the church, the LORD'S kingdom, and above all, the LORD 
himself; these are our neighbour to whom good is to be done from love. These are 
also the ascending degrees of the relationship of neighbour, for a society consisting of 
many is our neighbour in a superior degree than a single man is; in a still superior 
degree is our country; in a still superior degree is the church; and in a still superior 
degree is the LORD'S kingdom; but in the supreme degree is the LORD: these ascending
degrees are as the steps of a ladder, at the top of which is the LORD.

A society is our neighbour more than a single man, because it consists of many. 
Charity is to be exercised towards it in a like manner as towards a man singly, that is, 
according to the quality of the good that is with it; consequently in a manner totally 
different towards a society of well-disposed persons, than towards a society of ill-
disposed persons: the society is loved when its good is provided for from the love of 
good.

Our country is our neighbour more than a society, because it is like a parent; for a 
man is born therein, and is thereby nourished and protected from injuries. Good is to 
be done to our country from a principle of love according to its necessities, which 
principally regard its sustenance, and the civil and spiritual life of those therein. He 
who loves his country, and does good to it from good-will, in the other life loves the 
LORD'S kingdom, for there the LORD'S kingdom is his country, and he who loves the 
LORD'S kingdom, loves the LORD, because the LORD is all in all in his kingdom.

438

The church is our neighbour more than our country, for he who provides for, or 
consults the good of the church, provides for the souls and eternal life of the men who
dwell in his country; wherefore he who provides for the church from love, loves his 
neighbour in a superior degree, for he wishes and wills heaven and happiness of life 
to eternity, to be the portion of others.

The LORD'S kingdom is our neighbour in a still superior degree, for the LORD'S 
kingdom consists of all who are in good, as well those on earth as those in the 
heavens: thus the LORD'S kingdom is good with all its quality in the complex: when 
this is loved, the individuals are loved who are in good.

These are the degrees of the relationship of neighbour, and love ascends, with those 
who are principled in love towards their neighbour, according to these degrees. But 
these degrees are degrees in successive order, in which what is prior or superior is to 
be preferred to what is posterior or inferior; and for as much as the LORD is in the 
supreme degree, and he is to be regarded in each degree as the end to which it tends, 
consequently he is to be loved above all persons and things. Hence now it may appear,
in what manner love to the LORD conjoins itself with love towards our neighbour.

It is a common saying, that every one is his own neighbour, that is, that every one 
should first consider himself; [or, that charity begins at home;] but the doctrine of 
charity teaches how this is to be understood. Every one should provide for himself the
necessaries of life, such as food, clothing, habitation, and other things which the state 
of civil life, in which he is, necessarily requires, and this not only for himself, but also
for his family and dependents, and not only for the present time, but also for the 
future; for unless a man procures for himself the necessaries of life, he cannot be in a 
state to exercise charity, for he is in want of all things.

But in what manner every one ought to be his own neighbour may appear from this 
comparison: every one ought to provide food and clothing for his body; this must be 
the first object of his attention; but it should be done to the end that he may have a 
sound mind in a sound body: and every one ought to provide food for his mind, 
namely such things as are of intelligence and wisdom, to the end that it may thence be
in a state to serve his fellow-citizens, human society, his country, and the church, thus 
the LORD. He who does this, provides for his own good to eternity; whence it is plain, 
that the end, whatever it be, for the sake of which such intermediate things are 
provided, is the first object of attention, for all other things look thereto. The case 
herewith is like that of a man who builds a house: he first lays the foundation, but the 
foundation is for the house, and the house is for habitation: he who believes that he is 
his own neighbour in the first place, is like him who regards the foundation as the 
end, not the house and habitation, when yet the habitation is the very first and ultimate
end, and the house with the foundation is only the medium to it.

The end declares in what manner every one should be his own neighbour, and provide
for himself first. If the end be to grow richer than others only for the sake of riches, or
for the sake of pleasure, or for the sake of eminence, and the like, it is an evil end, and
that man does not love his neighbour, but himself: but if the end be to procure himself 
riches that he may be in a state of providing for the good of his fellow-citizens, of 
human society, of his country, and of the church, in like manner if he procure himself 
offices for the same end, he loves his neighbour. The end itself, for the sake of which 

439

he acts, constitutes the man; for the end is his love, for as much as every one has for a 
first and ultimate end, that which he loves above all things.

What has hitherto been said is concerning the relationship of neighbour; love towards 
him, or CHARITY, shall now be treated of.

It is believed by many, that charity consists in giving to the poor, in assisting the in 
need, and in doing good to every one; but charity consists in acting prudently, and to 
the end that good may result. He who assists a poor or in need villain, does evil to his 
neighbour through him, he confirms him in evil, and supplies him with the means of 
doing evil to others: it is otherwise with him who gives support to the good.

But charity extends itself much more widely than to the poor and in need; for charity 
consists in doing what is right in every work, and our duty in every office. If a judge 
does justice for the sake of justice, he exercises charity; if he punishes the guilty, and 
absolves the innocent, he exercises charity, for thus he consults the welfare of his 
fellow-citizens, and of his country. The priest who teaches truth, and leads to good, 
for the sake of truth and good, exercises charity. But he who does such things for the 
sake of self and the world, does not exercise charity, because he does not love his 
neighbour, but himself.

The case is the same in all other instances, whether a man be in any office or not; as 
with children towards their parents, and with parents towards their children; with 
servants towards their masters, and with masters towards their servants; with subjects 
towards their king, and with a king towards his subjects; whoever of these does his 
duty from a principle of duty, and what is just from a principle of justice, exercises 
charity.

The reason why such things belong to the love towards our neighbour, or charity, is 
because, as was said above, every man is our neighbour, but in a different manner. A 
less and greater society is more our neighbour than a single man; our country is still 
more our neighbour; the LORD'S kingdom still more; and the LORD above all; and in a 
universal sense, good, which proceeds from the LORD, is our neighbour; consequently,
sincerity and justice are so too; wherefore he who does any good for the sake of good,
and he who acts sincerely and justly for the sake of sincerity and justice, loves his 
neighbour and exercises charity; for he does so from the love of what is good, sincere,
and just, and consequently from the love of those in whom good, sincerity, and justice
are.

Charity therefore is an internal affection, from which man wills to do good, and this 
without remuneration; the delight of his life consists in doing it. With them who do 
good from internal affection, there is charity in every thing which they think and 
speak, and which they will and do; it may be said that a man or angel, as to his 
interiors, is charity, when good is his neighbour. So widely does charity extend itself.

They who have the love of self and of the world for an end, cannot in any way be in 
charity; they do not even know what charity is, and cannot at all comprehend that to 
will and do good to his neighbour without reward as an end is heaven in man, and that
there is in that affection a happiness as great as that of the angels of heaven, which is 
ineffable; for they believe, if they are deprived of the joy proceeding from the glory of

440

honours and riches, that nothing of joy can be experienced any longer; when yet it is 
then that heavenly joy first begins, which infinitely transcends the other. Heav. Doc. 
84—105.

A Song of degrees.

1. Behold, bless JEHOVAH, all you servants of JEHOVAH, who, by night, stand in 

the house of JEHOVAH.

2. Lift up your hands towards the holy place, and bless you JEHOVAH.
3. May JEHOVAH bless you from out of Zion, who has made heaven and earth!

The Internal Sense

Celebration of the LORD by those who worship him, when the church is devastated, 
verse 1; let them worship the LORD, who is the GOD of heaven and the church, verses 
2, 3.

442

PSALM 135

1. HALLELUJAH! Praise you the name of JEHOVAH: praise it, you servants of 

JEHOVAH!

2. You who stand in the house of JEHOVAH, in the courts of the house of our GOD.
3. HALLELUJAH! for JEHOVAH is good; sing praises to his name, for it is 

delightful.

4. For JAH has chosen Jacob for himself, Israel for his own possession.
5. Truly, I know that JEHOVAH is great, and that our Lord is above all gods.
6.

JEHOVAH does all things which it pleases him, in heaven, and upon earth, in the

The Internal Sense

Celebration of the LORD in his Divine Human, verses 1 to 3; who has established the 
church, verse 4; and who is the only GOD, verse 5; who alone teaches the church 
external and internal truths, verses 6, 7; who delivers the natural man from the 
falsities of evil, verses 8 to 11; and implants therein the church, verse 12; that the 
LORD does this, verse 13; who leads the church, verse 14; that self-intelligence avails 
nothing, verse 15 to 18; the spiritual and celestial church worships the LORD, who is 
the GOD of the church, verses 19 to 21.

EXPOSITION

Verse 1. Praise you the name of JEHOVAH. What is signified by the name of Jehovah, 
see Psalm 79:9, Exposition.

443

Verses 1, 2. Praise you the name of JEHOVAH who stand in his house, in the courts of 
the house of our GOD. By court in the Word is signified the external of the church; for 
there were two courts, through which it was necessary to pass, in order to go into the 
temple at Jerusalem, and because by the temple was signified the church as to its 
internal, therefore by the courts was signified the church as to its external; for which 
reason strangers from among the gentiles were admitted into the courts, but not into 
the temple itself: and whereas the external of the church is signified by court, 
therefore by it also is signified the church on earth, and likewise heaven in ultimates, 
because the church on earth is the entrance into heaven, and in like manner it is 
heaven in ultimates. AR 487.

Verses 1, 3, 4. Hallelujah—Jah. For the meaning of Jah, see Psalm 68:4, Exposition.

Verse 7. He causes the vapours to rise from the ends of the earth; he makes lightnings
with rain, he brings the wind out of his treasures. Ultimate truths, which are 
knowledges from the literal sense of the Word, are signified by vapours from the ends
of the earth, spiritual things thence derived, are signified by lightnings with rain, 
lightnings being predicated of the light of heaven, and rain of influx; reformation 
thence by Divine truth from the LORD, is signified by he brings the wind out of his 
treasures.F AE 419.

Verse 9. Signs and wonders; see Psalm 77:43, Exposition.

Verse 11. Sihon king of the Amorites. As to what concerns the Amorites, it is to be 
noted, that by them is signified evil, as also by the Canaanites; and by the rest of the 
nations in that land, which are named in the Word, are signified the various kinds" of 
evil and also of the false; such things the nations represented, when the sons of Israel 
came into possession of the land of Canaan; the reason was, that when the sons of 
Israel represented things celestial, those nations represented things infernal, and 
thereby the land of Canaan represented every state of the other life; and inasmuch as 
the nations represented things infernal, therefore they were given to the curse, and 
with those which remained, it was forbidden to enter into a covenant. That the sons of 
Israel took possession of and dwelt in the land of those who represented the hells, was
a representative that the infernals, about the time of the LORD'S coming, occupied a 
consider-able part of heaven, but that the LORD, by coming into the world, and making
the Human principle in himself Divine, expelled them thence, and cast them down 
into the hells, and thus delivered heaven from them, which he then gave for an 
inheritance to those who were of his spiritual kingdom. That by the nation of the 
Amorites was represented evil in general, is evident from those passages where it is 
named, as in Ezekiel, "Jerusalem, your tradings and your generations were from the 
land of the Canaanite; your father was an Amorite, and your mother an Hittite," 
Ezekiel 16:3, 45; inasmuch as father in the internal sense signifies the good of the 
church, but in the opposite sense evil, and mother signifies the truth of the church, but
in the opposite sense the false, therefore it is said, your father was an Amorite, and 
your mother an Hittite, And in Amos, "I destroyed the Amorite before them, whose 
height was as the height of cedars, and he was strong as the oak. I led them in the 
wilderness, to possess the land of the Amorite" Amos 2:9, 10, where also the Amorite 
denotes evil, for the evil of self-love is described by the height of cedars and the 
strength of the oak. The reason why the Amorite denotes evil in general is because the 
whole land of Canaan was called the land of the Amorite., for it is said, I led you in 

444

the wilderness to possess the land of the Amorite. Moreover in the Book of Kings, 
"Manasseh king of Judah did evil above all the evil which the Amorites did who were 
before him," 2 Kings 21:11. AC 6306.

Verse 11. Og, the king of Bashan. In Deuteronomy we read these words concerning 
Og, the king of Bashan: "Og, the king of Bashan, was left of the remains of the 
Rephaim, or giants; behold, his bed was a bed of iron! Is it not in Rabbath, of the sons
of Ammon? the length thereof was nine cubits, and the breadth thereof four cubits, 
after the cubit of a man," [viri] Deut 3:11. The bed of Og is here described, because he
was of the remains of the Rephaim, and because he was king of Bashan; for by the 
Rephaim were signified those who above all others were in the love of self, and hence
most natural, and from the persuasion of their own eminence above others, were in 
falsities of every kind, see AC 581, 1268; and by Bashan was signified the external of 
the church, thus the natural principle, for Bashan was out of the land of Canaan where
the church was, therefore the bed of Og the king of Bashan, was described, which 
would not have been done, but on account of the spiritual signification of Og, as 
mentioned above. For whatever is related in the Word, even in the historical part 
thereof, as to every expression, is significative; hence it is that the Word is spiritual in 
all its contents, and the singulars thereof, and consequently divine from inmost 
principles to ultimates; it is for this reason also related, that the bed was of iron, and 
that it was in Rabbath of the sons of Ammon, and that the length thereof was nine 
cubits, and the breadth thereof four cubits, after the cubit of a man, for iron signifies 
what is natural, as may be seen below, AE 176; Rabbath of Ammon signifies 
falsifications of truth, as may be seen in the Arcana Coelestia, AC 2468; and the 
length of nine cubits, and the breadth of four, after the cubit of a man, signifies the 
conjunction of evil and the false. From these considerations it may be seen, what is 
the quality of the Word in its inmost bosom. AE 163.

Verse 14. He will repent concerning his servants. JEHOVAH never repents, because he 
foresees all and everything from eternity; and when he made man, that is, created him 
anew, and perfected him till he became celestial, he also foresaw, that in process of 
time he would be reduced to the state here described; and therefore he could not 
repent: this appears very plain from what Samuel said, "The invincible One of Israel 
does not lie, nor repent, for he is not a man that he should repent," 1 Sam 15:29.; and 
in Moses, "GOD is not a man that he should lie, or the son of man that he should 
repent; has he said, and shall he not do; or has he spoken, and shall he not make it 
good?" Numb 23:19. But to repent signifies to be merciful. The mercy of JEHOVAH, or
of the LORD, implies all and every thing done by the LORD towards mankind, who are 
in such a state, that the LORD pities them, and each one according to his state; thus he 
pities the state of him whom he permits to be punished, and of him also to whom he 
grants to enjoy good; it is of mercy to be punished, because mercy turns all the evil of 
punishment into good; and it is of mercy to grant the enjoyment of good, because no 
one merits any thing that is good; for all mankind are evil, and of himself every one 
would rush into hell, wherefore it is a mercy that he is delivered thence; nor is it any 
thing but mercy, inasmuch as the LORD has no need of any man. Mercy has its name 
from this circumstance, of its delivering man from miseries and from hell; thus it is 
called mercy in respect to mankind, as being in such a state of misery, and is the effect
of love towards all, because they are in such a state.

445

But repentance and grief of heart are predicated of the LORD, inasmuch as such 
affections appear to be in all human mercy, wherefore what is said here of the LORD'S 
repenting and grieving, is spoken according to appearance, as is the case in various 
other passages in the Word. What the mercy of the LORD is, none can know, because it
infinitely transcends the understanding of man; but what the mercy of man is, man 
knows, namely that it is to repent and grieve; and unless man were to form his ideas 
of mercy and other affections, according to his own apprehension of their qualities, it 
would be impossible for him to have any conception at all about them, and of 
consequence he could never receive instruction; and this is the reason why human 
properties are often predicated concerning the attributes of JEHOVAH, or the LORD, as 
that JEHOVAH or the LORD punishes, leads into temptation, destroys, is angry, when yet
the truth is, that he never punishes any one, never leads any into temptation, never 
destroys any, and is never angry. Wherefore since such things are predicated of the 
LORD, it follows that repentance also and grief must be predicated of him, for the 
predication of the one is a consequence of the predication of the other, as plainly 
appears from these passages in the Word: in Ezekiel, "Mine anger shall be 
accomplished, I will cause my wrath to rest, and it shall repent me," Ezekiel 5:13; 
where because anger and wrath are predicated of JEHOVAH, repentance is also 
predicated; so in Zechariah; "When I thought to do evil, when your fathers provoked 
me to wrath, said JEHOVAH of Hosts, and I repented not, so again in these days will I 
think to do good to Jerusalem, and to the house of Judah," Zech 8:14, 15; where it is 
said that JEHOVAH thought to do evil, when yet he never thinks to do evil to any one, 
but to do good to all and every one; so in Moses, when he besought the faces of 
JEHOVAH, "Return from the wrath of your anger, and repent of this evil against your 
people; and JEHOVAH repented of the evil which he spoke to do to his people," Exodus
22:12, 14; in this passage also, wrath of anger is attributed to JEHOVAH, and 
consequently repentance; so the king of Ninevah says in Jonah, "Who can tell if GOD 
will turn and repent, and turn away from the wrath of his anger that we perish not?" 
where in like manner repentance is predicated because anger is predicated; so in 
Hosea, "My heart is turned upon me, my repentings are kindled at the same time, I 
will not execute the wrath of mine anger," Hos 11:8, 9; where in like manner it is said 
of the heart, that repentings were kindled, as it is here said, that he grieved at heart, 
repentings evidently signify much mercy; to the same purport in Joel, "Turn you to 
JEHOVAH your GOD, for he is gracious and merciful, long-suffering, and abundant in 
mercy, and repents him of the evil," Joel 2:13; where also it is very evident, that to 
repent signifies mercy; so in Jeremiah, "If so be they will hearken, and turn every man
from his evil way, that I may repent me of the evil," Jer 16:3; where to repent signifies
to be merciful; again in the same prophet, "If that nation turn from their evil, I will 
repent of the evil," Jer 18:8; where also to repent signifies to be merciful, in case they 
would turn themselves, for it is man who turns away from himself the mercy of the 
LORD, and not the LORD who turns himself away from man.

From these and several other passages of the Word it may be manifest, that what is 
said therein is spoken according to appearances in man, wherefore whoever is 
disposed to confirm false principles by the appearances according to which the Word 
is written, may do so in innumerable instances: but there is a difference between 
confirming false principles by passages from the Word, and believing in simplicity 
what is spoken in the Word: he who confirms false principles, first assumes some 
principle of his own, from which he is unwilling to depart, and whose authority he is 
determined at all events to support, for which purpose he collects and accumulates 

446

corroborating proofs from every quarter, consequently from the Word, till he is so 
thoroughly self-persuaded with regard thereto, that he can no longer see the truth; but 
whoever in simplicity, or out of a simple heart, believes what is spoken in the Word, 
does not first assume principles of his own, but thinks what is spoken to be true, 
because the LORD spoke it; and in case he is instructed in the right understanding 
thereof, by what is spoken in other parts of the Word, he instantly acquiesces, and in 
his heart rejoices. Nay, even supposing a person through simplicity to believe that the 
LORD is wrathful, that he punishes, repents, grieves, etc. whereby he is restrained from
evil, and led to do good, such belief is not at all hurtful to him, inasmuch as it leads 
him to believe also, that the LORD sees all things both generally and particularly, and 
when he is principled in such belief, he is afterwards capable of being enlightened in 
other points of faith, at least in another life, if not before; the case is different with 
those who are self-persuaded in consequence of preconceived principles, and who are 
rivetted in the belief thereof through the pernicious influence of selfish and worldly 
love. AC 587—589.

Verses 15, 16. The idols of the nations are silver and gold, the work of men's hands; 
they have mouths, but they speak not; they have eyes, but they see not. Their idols are 
silver and gold, signifies external worship without internal, confirmed from the literal 
sense of the Word not understood, and also from the fallacies of the senses; the work 
of men's hands signifies from self-derived intelligence, see above in the preceding 
article; they have a mouth and speak not, they have eyes and see not, signifies that 
from those things they have not any thought, nor any understanding of truth. The 
reason why nothing can come thence, but what is false, is because the proprium of 
man is nothing but evil, for it favours his own love and his own intelligence, 
wherefore they do not study truths for the sake of truths, but only for the sake of fame,
of a name, glory, and gain, and when these rule, heaven cannot flow in with its light, 
and open the sight and illustrate, wherefore they see like owls, moles, and bats, in the 
dark; according to Isaiah 2:18, 20. AE 587.

Silver and gold which are idols, denote falsities and evils. AC 8932.

The work of men's hands denotes what is from the proprium of man, thus what is from
his own proper understanding, and from his own proper will, and those things are 
from the proprium of each, which are of self-love, hence the origin of all falsities in 
the church. AC 10406.

Verse 19. O house of Aaron, bless you JEHOVAH. Aaron was chosen to perform the 
office of the priesthood, because he was the brother of Moses, for thus was at the 
same time represented the brotherhood of the Divine truth and Divine good in heaven,
for, as was above said, by Moses was represented the Divine truth, and by Aaron the 
Divine good. All things in the universe, both in heaven and in the world, have 
reference to good and to truth, that they may be something, for good is the esse of 
truth, and truth is the existere of good: wherefore good without truth does not exist, 
and truth without good is not; hence it is evident that they ought to be conjoined 
together: this conjunction is represented in the Word by two conjugial partners, and 
also by two brothers; by two conjugial partners, when the subject treated of is 
concerning the heavenly marriage, which is that of good and truth, and concerning the
successive derivation thence; by two brothers, when the subject treated of is 
concerning double ministry, which is that of judgement and of worship; they who 

447

executed the ministry of judgement were called judges, afterwards kings; but they 
who performed the ministry of worship were; called priests; and all judgement is 
effected by truth, and all worship from good. On account of that brotherhood which is
between truth, which is of judgement, and good which is of worship, Aaron the 
brother of Moses was chosen to perform the office of the priesthood; that by Aaron 
and his house is, on this account, signified good, is manifest from David, "O house of 
Israel, bless you JEHOVAH; O house of Aaron, bless you JEHOVAH," Psalm 135:19; the 
house of Israel denotes those who are in truths; the house of Aaron those who are in 
goods; for in the Word, where truth is treated of, good is also treated of, on account of 
the heavenly marriage. AC 9806.

Verse 21. Blessed be JEHOVAH out of Zion, who inhabits Jerusalem. It was a 
customary form of speech amongst the ancients to say, blessed be Jehovah; by which 
they meant, that all blessing is from him, that is, all good; and it was also a form of 
thanksgiving for the LORD'S blessing both past and present, as in David, Psalm 
135:21. AC 1096.

By Zion is signified heaven and the church, in which the LORD reigns by Divine truth, 
and by Jerusalem, heaven and the church, as to doctrine from that Divine truth. AE 
850.

The Internal Sense

An exhortation to confess the LORD, who is the only God and LORD, verses 1 to 3; 
who by Divine truth has formed heaven and the church, verses 4 to 6; from whom 
comes every truth of doctrine, and good of love, and the knowledge thereof, verses 7 
to 9; who delivers the natural man from the falsities of evil, and establishes therein the
church, and dissipates evils of every kind, verses 10 to 22; celebration and confession 
of the LORD, who delivers from falsities and evils, and gives truths and goods, verses 
23 to 26; and this from pure mercy, verses 1 to 26.

449

EXPOSITION

Verses 1, 2, 3. O give thanks to JEHOVAH, etc. There is frequent mention made of Lord
in the Word, and he who is not acquainted with the internal sense, supposes that 
nothing else is meant by Lord, than what is meant in common discourse, when the 
expression is used; but Lord is in no case expressed in the Word, unless the subject 
treated of is concerning good, and the same observation is true respecting the name 
Jehovah; but when the subject treated of is concerning truth, the expressions God and 
also King are used; hence it is that by Lord is signified good, as may be manifest from
the following passages, "Jehovah, your God, he is God of gods, and Lord of lords," 
Deut 10:17; and in David, "Confess you, or give thanks, to Jehovah, confess you to 
the God of gods, confess you to the Lord of lords," Psalm 136:1, 2, 3. AC 4973.

Verses 1 to 9. Unto him who by his intelligence made the heavens, who spread out the
earth above the waters; who made great luminaries, the sun to rule by day, the moon 
and stars to rule by night. In this passage, luminaries signify love and faith towards 
the LORD, and it was on this account ordained in the Jewish church, that a perpetual 
luminary, or light, should be kept burning from evening till morning, inasmuch as 
every ordinance in that church was representative of the LORD. AC 31.

Stars denote the knowledges of good and truth; the ground and reason why stars in 
the Word have this signification is because they are small luminaries which shine in 
the night, and in such case emit from themselves into our atmosphere sparks of light, 
in like manner as knowledges emit those things which are of good and truth. AC 
4697.

Verse 4. Who does great wonders; see Psalm 78:43, Exposition.

Verses 5 to 11. Unless something be known of the spiritual sense of the Word, it may 
be supposed that there is nothing more involved in these words than what appears in 
the sense of the letter, when, notwithstanding singular the things therein, involve such 
things as relate to angelic wisdom, all which things are divine, celestial, and spiritual; 
the new creation or regeneration of the men of the church, or of the men of whom the 
church consists, is here described; by the heavens which JEHOVAH has made by his 
intelligence, are signified the internal things of the men of the church, which in one 
expression are called the spiritual man, where intelligence resides, and where their 
heaven is; by the earth which he spread out above the waters, is signified the external 
of the church, which is called the natural man, and is here said to be spread out above 
the waters, because therein are the truths by which man is regenerated, waters 
signifying truths; by the great luminaries, the sun, the moon, and the stars, are 
signified the good of love, the truth from that good, and the knowledges of good and 
truth; by the sun the good of love, by the moon the truth from that good, and by the 
stars the knowledges of good and truth; the reason why it is said, that the sun was 
made to rule by day, is because the day signifies the light of the spiritual man, who 
has illustration and perception from the good of love; and the moon and the stars are 
said to rule by night, because the night signifies the light of the natural man, for this 
light, with respect to the light of the spiritual man, is comparatively as the light of the 
night from the moon and the stars, to the light of the day from the sun; by reason of 
the regeneration of the men of the church being treated of, it therefore also follows, 
who smote Egypt in their first-born, and brought out Israel from the midst of them, for

450

by Egypt is signified the natural man, such as he is from birth, namely in mere 
falsities from evil; the first-born thereof denote the things which are primary, and the 
destruction of these during regeneration, is understood by JEHOVAH smiting Egypt in 
their first-born; by Israel is signified the spiritual man, and by leading Israel out from
the midst of them, is signified to open that man, and so to regenerate; for the man of 
the church is regenerated of the LORD by the dissipation of the falsities derived from 
evils, which are in the natural man, and by the opening of the spiritual man, which is 
effected of the LORD by spiritual light, which is the Divine truth. AE 401.

Verse 12. With a mighty hand, and with a stretched-out arm. That the hand and arms 
signify power, see Psalm 10:15, Exposition.

Verse 15. Shook off Pharaoh and his host into the Red sea. Pharaoh signifies the 
natural mind in general, and also the scientific principle of the church in general, for 
by Egypt is signified the scientific principle of the church, AC 1462, 4749, 4964, 
4966, hence by the king thereof is signified the scientific principle in general, as also 
in other parts of the Word; but in several passages, as by Egypt, so also by Pharaoh, is
signified the scientific principle perverted: that Pharaoh denotes the scientific 
principle in general, is evident from the following passages in Isaiah, "The princes of 
Zoan are fools, the wise ones of the counsellors of Pharaoh, counsel is brutish; how 
will you say to Pharaoh, I am a son of the wise, a son of the kings of antiquity," 
Isaiah 19:11: in this passage Pharaoh denotes the, scientific principle of the church in 
general, hence he was called a son of the. wise, and a son of the kings of antiquity; the
wise and the kings of antiquity denote the truths of the ancient church; but this 
scientific principle is here understood to be infatuated, for it is said, The princes of 
Zoan are become fools, counsel is brutish. Again, "They depart to go down to Egypt, 
but they have not asked my mouth, to strengthen themselves in the strength of 
Pharaoh, and to confide in the shadow of Egypt; therefore shall the strength of 
Pharaoh be to you for shame, and confidence in the shadow of Egypt for ignominy," 
Isaiah 30:2, 3; to strengthen themselves in the strength of Pharaoh, and to confide in 
the shadow of Egypt, denotes to trust to scientifics in the things of faith, and not to 
have faith in any spiritual truth, unless it be agreeable to the dictate of the scientific 
and sensual principle, which nevertheless is of perverted order; for the truths of faith 
ought to have the first place, and confirming scientifics the second, inasmuch as 
nothing of truth is believed, in case the latter be in the first place. And in Jeremiah, 
"JEHOVAH ZEBAOTH the GOD of Israel says, behold I visit upon Ammon in No; and 
upon Pharaoh, and upon Egypt, and upon the gods thereof, and upon the kings 
thereof; especially upon Pharaoh, and them that confide in him," Jer 46:25; in this 
passage also Pharaoh denotes the scientific principle in general; they that confide in 
him denote those who trust to scientifics but not to the Word, that is, to the LORD in 
the Word, hence every thing is perverted in the doctrine of faith, and hence comes the 
false, and also a denial that the divine and celestial principle is any thing; persons of 
this description are yet especially bold in profession, and say, Give me ocular proof or
scientific demonstration that it is so, and then I will believe; nevertheless, if they had 
ocular proof and demonstration, they would not yet believe, by reason that a principle 
of negation has universal rule in them. Again, in the same prophet, "Against Pharaoh;
behold waters come up from the north, which shall become an overflowing stream, 
and they shall overflow the earth and the fullness thereof, the city and those who 
dwell therein, that men shall cry, and every inhabitant of the earth shall howl, because 
of the voice of the trampling of the hoofs of the horses of his mighty ones, and the 

451

tumult of his chariot, the noise of his wheels," Jer 47:1, 2, 3; from each of the things 
here said concerning Pharaoh, it is plain that he denotes the scientific principle in 
general, in the present instance in perverted order, which destroys the truths of faith; 
an overflowing stream denotes the scientific principle destroying the understanding of
truth, and thus vastating; they shall overflow the earth and the fullness thereof, 
denotes the whole church; the city and they that dwell therein, denotes the truth of the 
church and the good thence derived; the trampling of the hoofs of the horses, denotes 
the lowest scientifics which are immediately derived from the things of sense; the 
tumult of the chariot, denotes the false doctrinals thence derived; the noise of the 
wheels, denotes sensual things and the fallacies thereof which promote. AC 6015.

Verse 19. Sihon, king of the Amorites; see Psalm 135:11, Exposition.

Verse 20. Og, the king of Bashan; see Psalm 135:11, Exposition.

Verse 23. Who remembered us. To remember, when concerning the LORD, denotes to 
have compassion, and thus to preserve or deliver, from a principle of mercy. AC 9849.

452

PSALM 137

1. By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down; yea, we wept, when we 

remembered Zion!

2. Upon the willows, in the midst thereof, we hanged our harps.
3. For, there did those who held us captive, require of us a song; yea, those who 
had laid us on heaps, required of us mirth, saying, Sing to us one of the songs 
of Zion.

4. How could we sing the song of JEHOVAH in the land of the stranger?
If I forget you, O Jerusalem, may my right hand forget its skill!
5.
6. May my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth, if I do not remember you,—if 

I do not exalt Jerusalem above my highest joy!

7. Remember, O JEHOVAH, the day of Jerusalem, against the children of Edom, 

who said: Lay it bare, Lay it bare even to the foundation thereof!

8. O daughter of Babylon, who is to be destroyed! Blessed is he, who deals with 

you, as you have dealt with us!

9. Blessed is he, who seizes your little ones, and dashes them against the rock!

The Internal Sense

A lamentation by the gentiles, who are in falsities from ignorance, because they have 
not the Word, verses 1 to 4; that a church will be formed of them by the LORD, which 
he will love, verses 5, 6; that they will perish who have devastated the church, verses 
7 to 9.

Exposition

Verse 1. By the rivers of Babylon, etc. By Babylon, or Babel, is denoted worship 
grounded in self-love, the externals of which appear holy, but the internals are 
profane. From self-love, or proprium, flow all evils, as hatred, revenge, cruelty, 
adultery, deceit, hypocrisy, impiety; wherefore when self-love, or proprium, is within 
man's worship, those evils are within it also, but with a difference and degree as to 
measure and quality, proportioned to the influence of that love; hence comes all 
profanation of worship. The truth of the case therefore is this; in proportion to the 
measure of self-love or proprium that intrudes itself into man's worship, internal 
worship recedes, or is annihilated. Internal worship consists in the affection of 
goodness and the acknowledgement of truth; but in proportion as self-love or 
proprium comes in, or enters, the affection of goodness and the acknowledgement of 
truth recede or go out. What is holy can by no means abide with what is profane, any 
more than heaven can abide with hell, but one must needs retire from the other. Such 
is the state and order which prevail in the LORD'S kingdom. This is the reason that 
with such, whose worship is called Babel, there cannot exist any internal worship, but 
what they inwardly worship is somewhat dead, and, indeed, like a dead carcase: hence
it is evident of what quality their external worship is, when its inward principle is thus
corrupt. That Babel is such worship, appears from every part of the Word where 
Babel is described: as in Daniel, where the image which Nebuchadnezzar king of 
Babel, or Babylon, saw in a dream, the head of which was of gold, its breast and arms 

453

of silver, its belly and thighs of brass, its legs of iron, and its feet partly of iron and 
partly of clay, signifies that true worship at length became such worship as is called 
Babel; wherefore also a stone cut out of a rock break in pieces the iron, the brass, the 
clay, the silver, and the gold, Daniel 2:31, 32, 44, 45. The image of gold, which 
Nebuchadnezzar king of Babel set up to worship had a like signification, Daniel 3:1 to
end. The like is signified also by the king of Babel with his lords drinking wine out of 
the vessels of gold, which were brought from the temple at Jerusalem, and praising 
the gods of gold, of silver, of brass, of iron, and of stone; on which account appeared 
the writing on the wall, Daniel 5:1 to end. The like also is signified by Darius the 
Mede requiring to be worshiped as a god, Daniel 6:1 to end; and likewise by the four 
beasts appearing in a dream to Daniel 7:1 to end; and also, by the beast and by 
Babylon in the Revelation. That such worship was signified and represented, appears 
plainly, not only from Daniel and John, but likewise from the prophets: as in Isaiah, 
"Their faces shall be faces of the flames—The stars of the heavens and the 
constellations thereof shall not give their light; the sun shall be darkened in his going 
forth, and the moon shall not cause her light to shine. The wild beasts of the desert 
(ziim) shall lie there, and their houses shall be full of doleful creatures (ochim;) and 
the daughters of the owl shall dwell there, and satyrs shall dance there, and wild 
beasts of the islands (iim) shall cry in her palaces, and dragons in the pleasant 
houses," Isaiah 13:8, 10, 21, 22; speaking of Babel; where the internal of such 
worship is described by faces of flames, which are evil lusts, and by the stars not 
shining, which are the truths of faith, and by the sun being darkened, which is holy 
love, and by the moon not shining, which is the truth of faith, and by ziim, ochim, the 
daughters of the owl, satyrs, iim, and dragons, which are the interior principles of 
such worship, inasmuch as such things appertain to self-love or proprium; wherefore 
also, in the Revelation, Babylon is called "the mother of whoredoms and 
abominations," Rev 17:5; and again, "a habitation of dragons, and a cage of every 
unclean spirit, and of every unclean and hateful bird," Rev 18:2; whence it is evident, 
and when such things dwell within, nothing of goodness and truth can abide there, 
and, that in proportion as such things enter, in the same proportion the good principles
of affection, and the truths of faith, recede. Such things are also called the graven 
images of the gods of Babel, Isaiah 21:9. That Babel is self-love or proprium when 
contained in worship, or that it is self-worship, appears evidently in Isaiah, "Take up 
this parable against the king of Babel:—You have said in your heart, I will ascend 
into the heavens, I will exalt my throne above the stars of GOD; I will sit also on the 
mount of meeting together, in the sides of the north; I will ascend above the heights of
the clouds; I will be like the Most High,—yet you shall be brought down to hell," 
Isaiah 14:4, 13, 14, 15; where it is evident that Babel is that which wishes to be 
worshiped as a GOD, that is, that it is self-worship. Again in the same prophet, "Come 
down and sit in the dust, O virgin daughter of Babel; sit on the earth, there is no 
throne, O daughter of the Chaldeans. — For you have trusted in your wickedness; you
have said, None sees me: your wisdom and your knowledge it has averted you; you 
have said in your heart, I am, and there is none beside as I," 47:1, 10; so in Jeremiah, 
"Behold I am against you, O destroying mountain, that destroyest all the earth, and I 
will stretch out my hand upon you, and roll you down from the rocks, and I will make 
you a mountain of burning — Though Babel should mount up to the heavens, and 
though she should fortify the height of her strength, from me shall spoilers come upon
her," Jer 51:25, 53; hence also it appears that Babel is self-worship. That such self-
worshipers have no light of truth, but mere darkness, that is, that they have not the 
truth of faith, is thus described in Jeremiah: "The word that JEHOVAH spoke against 

454

Babel, against the land of the Chaldeans: — O ut of the north there comes up a nation 
against her, which shall make her land desolate, and none shall dwell therein: they 
shall remove, they shall depart, both man and beast," Jer 50:1, 3: the north signifies 
darkness, or what is not true; the departure of man and of beast denotes the 
deprivation of good. AC 1326.

Verse 2. Upon the willows. By the willows of the brook are signified the lowest goods 
and truths of the natural man, which appertain to the sensual externals. AE 458.

Verse 2. We hanged our harps. For the signification of harp, see Psalm 43:4, 
Exposition.

Verse 4. The land of the stranger. The land of the stranger signifies where the church 
is not, and where there is nothing genuine. AC 850.

Verse 5. If I forget you, O Jerusalem, may my right hand forget its skill. Jerusalem 
signifies the church, as to the doctrine of Divine truth, and the right hand of JEHOVAH,
Divine truth in light, inasmuch as they are at the right of the LORD in heaven, who are 
in light and in wisdom from Divine truth, as was said above; hence it is manifest why 
it is said, "If I forget you, O Jerusalem, may my right hand forget its skill." AE 298.

Verse 8. O daughter of Babylon. Mention is made of daughters in many passages of 
the Word, and every one may see that in those passages are not meant daughters, as 
where mention is made of the daughter of Zion, of the daughter of Jerusalem, of the 
daughter of Tarshish, of the daughter of my people, denoting affections of good and 
of truth, as has been shown in the passages above adduced; and whereas they denote 
the affections of good and of truth, they denote also churches, for churches are 
churches by reason of those affections; hence it is that by the daughter of Zion is 
signified the celestial church, and this from the affection of good, whereas by the 
daughter of Jerusalem is signified the spiritual church, and this from the affection of 
truth, AC 2362; hence it is evident what is signified by the daughters of the nations, as
by the daughters of the Philistines, the daughters of Egypt, the daughters of Tyre and 
Sidon, the daughters of Edom, the daughters of Moab, the daughters of the Chaldeans
and of Babel, and the daughters of Sodom, namely the affections of what is evil and 
false, in which their religious principles were grounded, consequently the religious 
principles themselves; that this is the signification of daughter may appear from the 
following passages: "A people shall come from the north, put in array like a man to 
the battle, upon you O daughter of Babel," Jer 50:41, 42; so in Zechariah, "Deliver 
yourself O Zion, that dwell with the daughter of Babel," Zech 2:7; and in David, "The
daughter of Babylon who are to be destroyed," Psalm 137:8; that in these passages, 
by daughters are not meant daughters, but affections which disagree with the truth, 
consequently reli-gious principles which are thence derived, every one may plainly 
see. AC 3024.

Verse 8. Blessed is he who deals with you, or recompenses you, as you have dealt with
us. It is according to the literal sense that the whom they had seduced and destroyed 
were to recompense them, whereas according to the spiritual sense, they were to 
recompense themselves, because every evil carries along with it its own punishment; 
the case herein is similar to what is said in many parts of the Word, that GOD will 
recompense and take vengeance upon the injustice and injuries done to him, and will 

455

destroy the unjust out of anger and wrath, when nevertheless the evils themselves, 
which they have committed against GOD, do this, consequently they do it to 
themselves. AE 762.

Verse 9. Blessed is he who seizes your little ones, and dashes then against the rock. 
By little ones, or infants here are not understood infants, but falsities springing up, for 
the subject there treated of is concerning Babylon, whereby are signified the falsities 
of evil destroying the truths of good belonging to the church; the destruction thereof is
signified by dashing them against the rock, the rock denoting the ruling false of evil, 
and to dash against denoting to destroy. They who abide in the literal sense of the 
Word, and think no further, may easily he induced to believe that he is called blessed 
who does thus with the children of his enemies, when, notwithstanding, this is an 
enormous crime; whereas it is hereby meant, that he is blessed who disperses the 
falsities of evil springing up in the church, which are here signified by the infants of 
Babylon. AE 411.

I will praise you with my whole heart; before the gods will I sing praise to

of mine enemies you will stretch forth your hand, and your right hand will 
save me.
JEHOVAH performs for me; O JEHOVAH, your mercy is everlasting; forsake not 
the work of your hands.

The Internal Sense

Celebration of the LORD by the church; that the LORD is to be worshiped from the 
Word, wherein is his Divine truth, verses 1 to 5; that there is salvation from the LORD 
for those who are humble, and life and protection, verses 6 to 8.

Exposition

Verse 1. Before the gods will I sing praise to you. By gods in a good sense are meant 
the angels, who are called gods, because they are substances, or forms recipient of 
truth in which is good from the LORD; the angels, consequently the truths of good 
which are from the LORD, are meant by gods in the above words.

Verse 2. I will bow myself down towards your holy temple. By temple, in a supreme 
sense, the LORD is signified as to his Divine Humanity, in particular as to Divine truth;
but in a representative sense, by temple is signified the LORD'S church in heaven; as 
also the LORD'S church in the world. That temple in a supreme sense signifies the 
LORD as to his Divine Humanity, and in particular as to Divine truth, is evident from 
these passages: "Behold the LORD whom you seek shall suddenly come to his temple, 
even the messenger of the covenant," Malachi 3:1; "I will bow myself down towards 
your holy temple" Psalm 138:2; the temple of the holiness of JEHOVAH, or the LORD, is
his Divine Humanity, for that is bowed down to, looked to, and prayed to, and not the 
temple only, for the temple in itself is not holy, it is called the temple of holiness, 
because holiness is predicated of Divine truth. AR 191.

Verse 8. Forsake not the work of your hands. All things which are done by the LORD, 
are called the works of his hands, which are proper to him, and in themselves are 
goods and truths; as in these passages: "The works of JEHOVAH'S hands are truth and 
judgements," Psalm 111:7; "O JEHOVAH, your mercy is everlasting; forsake not the 
work of your hands" Psalm 138:8. AR 457.

PSALM 139

To him that presides; a Psalm of David.

1. O JEHOVAH, you searchest me, and you know me.
2. You know my sitting, and my rising; you understand my thought afar off.
3. You encompass my path, and my lying down; and you are perfectly acquainted

with all my ways.

4. For there is not a word upon my tongue, but lo! O JEHOVAH, you know it 

altogether.

5. You surround me behind and before, and you lay your hand upon me.
6. Such knowledge is too wonderful for me; it is too high, I cannot attain to it.
7. Whither can I go from your spirit? Whither can I flee from your presence?
8.

If I go up into heaven, you are there! If I make my bed in hell, behold, you are 
there!
If I take the wings of the morning, and dwell in the extremity of the sea;

9.
10. Even there does your hand lead me, and your right hand does hold me!
11. Or, if I say, surely the darkness will cover me! Even the night shall be light 

about me.

12. Yea, the darkness does not conceal from you, but the night is as bright as the 

day; the darkness and the light are both alike to you!

13. Truly, you did possess my reins; you did cover me in the womb of my mother.
14. I will praise you, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made: wonderful are your

works! And my soul knows it exceedingly.

15. My bones were not hidden from you, when I was fashioned in secret,—when I

was curiously worked in the lower parts of the earth.

16. Yours eyes beheld my yet unformed substance, and in your book were all my 

days written and arranged, ere yet there was one of them.

17. How precious to me are your thoughts, O GOD! How great is the sum of them!
18. If I should count them, they are more in number than the sand: when I awake I

am still with you.

19. O that you would slay the wicked, O GOD! Depart from me you blood-thirsty 

men.

20. Who speak wickedly against you, and your enemies take your name in vain.
21. Do I not hate those, O JEHOVAH, who hate you? And do I not abhor those who 

rise up against you?

22. With perfect hatred do I hate them, they are enemies to me.
23. Search me, O God, and know my heart; prove me, and know my anxious 

thoughts.

24. And see, if there he any wicked way in me, and lead me in the way 

everlasting.

The Internal Sense

Celebration of the FATHER by the LORD, that he knows all things of his thought and 
will, because he is united to him, verses 1 to 5; that he is omniscient and omnipresent, 
verses 6 to 10; that from him is illustration in the natural man, verses 11, 12; that he 
was formed and purified by him, verses 13 to 15; that thence all things of the FATHER 

459

were united with him, verses 16 to 18; that the LORD rejected from himself all evil and
the false, verses 19 to 22; that he has integrity, verses 23, 24.

EXPOSITION

Verse 2. You know my sitting and my rising. Mention is made of sitting, because to sit 
signifies to be permanent in state; for progressions from place to place signify 
changes of the state of the interiors, as may be manifest from what was shown, AC 
2837. Hence sitting signifies permanent abiding in the state of the interiors: inasmuch 
as sitting had such a signification, therefore to sit was a ritual received amongst the 
sons of Israel, when they represented a permanent state of the interiors; as in the book 
of Judges, "The sons of Israel came to Bethel, and wept, and sat there before 
JEHOVAH, and fasted on that day even to the evening," Judges 20:26; in which passage
is signified permanence in a state of grief. Hence it may be manifest why mention is 
made of sitting, and what it involves in the following passages: as in David, 
"JEHOVAH, you know my sitting and my rising; you understand my thought afar off," 
Psalm 139:2; and in Jeremiah, "You shall not enter the house of feasting, to sit with 
them," Jer 16:8. AC 9422.

To know his sitting has respect to the esse of life which is the will, and to know his 
rising has respect to his intention thence derived: and whereas the thought, follows the
intention of the will, it is added, you understand my thought afar off. AE 687.

Verse 8. If I go up into heaven, you are there: if I make my bed in hell, behold, you are
there. It is to be observed, that the perception of opposites differs from the perception 
of relatives; for opposites are things that are external, and contrary to things that are 
internal; and an opposite has birth from the cessation of existence in some one thing, 
and the rising up of another at that time with a tendency contrary to what the former 
existence had, acting as a wheel against a wheel, or as a stream against a stream. But 
relatives have respect to the disposal of a variety and multiplicity of things in suitable 
and agreeable order; as of precious stones of different colours in the stomacher of a 
queen, or of different coloured flowers in an ornamental garland. Relatives therefore 
exist in each opposite, both in the good and the evil, in the true and the false, 
consequently both in heaven and in hell; but the relatives in hell are all opposite to the
relatives in heaven. Now since GOD perceives, and sees, and thereby is acquainted 
with all the relatives in heaven, by virtue of the order in which he himself is, and in 
consequence thereof perceives, sees, and is acquainted with all the opposite relatives 
in hell, as was shown above, it is evident that GOD is omniscient in hell, as well as in 
heaven, and also amongst men upon earth; and that he thus perceives, sees, and is 
acquainted with their evils and falsities, by virtue of the goodness and truth in which 
he himself is, and which in their essence are himself: for it is written, "If I go up into 
heaven, you are there: if I make my bed in hell, behold, you are there," Psalm 139:8; 
"Though they dig in hell, thence shall mine hand take them," Amos 9:2. AR 62.

Verse 8. Heaven—hell. There are two things which constitute the life of man's spirit, 
love and faith; love constituting the life of his will, and faith the life of his 
understanding. The love of good and the faith of truth thence derived, constitute the 
life of heaven; and the love of evil, and the faith of what is false thence derived, 
constitute the life of hell.

460

Love to the LORD and love towards our neighbour, constitute heaven; and so does 
faith, so far as it has life from those loves; and for as much as each of those loves and 
the faith thence derived, is from the LORD, it is evident from here that the LORD 
constitutes heaven.

Heaven is resident with every one according to his reception of love and faith from 
the LORD; and they who receive heaven from the LORD whilst they live in the world, 
come into heaven after death.

They who receive heaven from the LORD are they who have heaven in themselves; for
heaven is in man; as the LORD also teaches; "They shall not say, the kingdom of GOD, 
lo it is here! or lo there! for behold the kingdom of GOD is within you," Luke 17:21.

Heaven with man resides in his internal, thus in willing and thinking from love and 
faith, and thence in his external, which consists in acting and speaking from love and 
faith; but it does not reside in the external without being in the internal; for all 
hypocrites are capable of acting and speaking well, but not of willing well and 
thinking well.

When man comes into the other life, which takes place immediately after death, it is 
then manifest whether heaven is in him, but not whilst he lives in the world; for in the 
world the external appears, and not the internal; but in the other life the internal is 
made manifest, because man then lives as to his spirit.

Eternal happiness, which is also called heavenly joy, is imparted to those who are in 
love and faith to the LORD, from the LORD; that love and that faith have in them that 
joy, into which the man, who has heaven in himself, comes after death: in the 
meantime it lies stored up in his internal. In the heavens there is a communion of 
goods; the peace, the intelligence, the wisdom, and the happiness of all, are 
communicated to every one therein; hence it appears how great peace, intelligence, 
wisdom, and happiness are in heaven.

As love to the LORD, and love towards our neighbour, constitute the life of heaven 
with man, so the love of self and the love of the world, when they reign, constitute the
life of hell with him, for these latter loves are opposite to the former; wherefore they 
with whom the loves of self and of the world reign, are incapable of receiving any 
thing from heaven; but the things which they receive are from hell: for whatever a 
man loves and whatever he believes, is either from heaven or from hell.

They with whom the loves of self and of the world reign, do not know what heaven 
and the happiness of heaven are; and it appears incredible to them that happiness is 
given in any other loves than in those, when yet the happiness of heaven only enters, 
so far as those loves, as ends, are removed; the happiness which succeeds on their 
removal is so great, that it exceeds all human comprehension.

The life of man cannot be changed after death, but remains then such as it had been in
the world: for the whole spirit of man is such as his love is, and infernal love cannot 
be transcribed into heavenly joy, because they are opposite: this is understood by the 
words of Abraham to the rich man in hell, "There is a great gulf between us and you, 
so that they who would pass to you cannot, neither can they pass from there to us," 

461

Luke 16:26. Hence it is plain, that they who come into hell remain there to eternity, 
and that they who come into heaven remain there to eternity. NJHD 230—239.

Verses 11, 12. If I say, surely the darkness will cover me, even the night shall be light 
about me; yea, the darkness does not conceal from you, but the night is as bright as 
the day; the darkness and the light are both alike to you. By these words is signified 
that the natural man is illustrated by the LORD, equally as the spiritual; natural light is 
signified by darkness and night, and spiritual light by light and day, and as the 
darkness so is the light, signifies the same as where it is said in Isaiah, "The light of 
the moon shall be as the light of the sun," Isaiah 30:26. AE 527.

Verse 13. You did possess my reins, you did cover me in the womb of my mother. By 
possessing the reins is signified to purify truths from falsities, see above, AE 167; by 
covering me in the womb of my mother, is signified to defend from the falsities of evil 
which are from hell, and this from the beginning of regeneration, and afterwards, 
continually. AE 710.

Verses 13, 15. You did possess my reins, my bones were not hidden from you, when I 
was fashioned in secret. To possess the reins is to know falsities and truths belonging 
to man; hence it is said, my bones were not hidden from you, when I was fashioned in 
secret, whereby is signified that no false that was made could be hid: that bones 
signify truth in the ultimate of order, and in the opposite sense the false, may be seen, 
AC 3818, 5560. For as much as the reins signified truths purified from falsities, 
therefore in the sacrifices the fats and reins [or kidneys] alone were offered up, which 
may be seen in Exodus 29:13; Levit 3:4, 10, 15, 4:9; and elsewhere. The reason that 
the fat and reins alone were offered up in sacrifice was, because the fat signified the 
goods of love, and the reins the truths of faith; that fat signified the goods of love may
be seen, AC 353, 5943; that the reins [or kidneys] signify the truths of faith, 
examining, purifying, and rejecting from themselves falsities, is from correspondence,
for all and singular the things of the body correspond, an may appear in the work 
concerning "HEAVEN AND HELL," where it, is shown under its proper article, that, there
is a correspondence of all things of heaven with all things of man, HH 87 to 102; and 
there concerning the reins, HH 96, 97. Unless it be known that there is such a 
correspondence, who could know why it is so often predicated in the Word of 
JEHOVAH, or the LORD, that he searches and proves the reins and the heart? AE 167.

Verse 16. In your book ware all my days written and arranged, ere yet there was one 
of them. He who does not know from the internal sense what the book of life is, also 
what the books are, out of which the dead are to be judged, cannot form any other 
idea, than that in heaven there are such books, and that in them are written the actions 
of all, whereof the memory is thus preserved; when yet by book, in the above passage,
are not meant books, but the remembrance of all things which have been done; for 
every one carries along with him into the other life the memory of his actions, thus the
book of his life, AC 2474; but no one except the LORD alone can judge any one 
according to his actions, for all actions proceed from final causes, which final causes 
lie deeply concealed within; according to those causes man is judged, and no one 
knows them but the LORD, wherefore judgement belongs to him alone. AC 8620.

Inasmuch as to write, signifies to implant in the life, therefore also it is said of 
JEHOVAH, or the LORD, that he writes, and has written in a book, whereby is 

462

understood what is inscribed by the LORD on the spirit of man, that is, in his heart and 
soul, or what is the same, in his love and faith, as in David, "In your book were all my
days written and arranged, ere yet there was one of them," Psalm 139:16. AE 222.

By all the days which were written in the book, are understood all the states of life; 
that all and singular the things which man has thought, willed, spoken, and done, yea, 
which he has seen, and heard, are with him in his spirit as if inscribed therein, so that 
nothing thereof is wanting, may be seen in the work concerning "HEAVEN AND HELL," 
HH 462, 463. AE 199.

PSALM 140

To him that presides: a Psalm of David.

1. Deliver me, O JEHOVAH, from the evil man; preserve me from the roan of 

violence.

2. Who devise evils in their heart, who, all the day long, are gathered together for

war.

3. They sharpen their tongues like serpents, the venom of asps is under their lips. 

Selah.

4. Guard me, O JEHOVAH, from the hands of the wicked; preserve me from the 

man of violence, who devise how they may overthrow my steps.

5. The proud have hidden a snare for me, and cords; they have spread a net by 

6.

the way-side; they have set traps for me. Selah.
I say to JEHOVAH: You are my GOD! Hearken to the voice of my supplications, 
O JEHOVAH.

7. O LORD JEHOVIH, you are the strength of my salvation; you have covered my 

head in the day of battle.

8. Grant not, O JEHOVAH, the desires of the wicked; suffer not his wicked device 

to prevail, lest they be exalted.

9. May the gall of those who beset me,—may the mischief of their lips 

overwhelm them!

10. May burning coals be cast down upon them!—May they be cast by fire into 

deep pits, whence they cannot rise again!

11. Let not an evil speaker be established in the earth: let evil hunt the man of 

violence to his overthrow.

12. I know that JEHOVAH will maintain the cause of the afflicted, and the right of 

the poor.

13. Surely, the just shall give thanks to your name; the upright shall dwell in your 

presence.

The Internal Sense

A prayer of the LORD to the FATHER, that he may be delivered from false speakers and 
hypocrites, who seek to do him evil in the perverted church, verses 1 to 8; that they 
will perish by their falsities and evils, verses 9 to 11; and that they who confess the 
Lord will be saved, verses 12, 13.

Exposition

Verses 1, 2, 3. Deliver me from the evil man, and preserve me from the man of 
violence, who think evils in their heart, who all the day long are gathered together for
war, they sharpen their tongues like serpents. By the evil man, and the man of 
violences, are signified those who pervert the truths of the Word, for he is called a 
man of violences, who, from a wicked intention, offers violence to the truths of the 
Word, by perverting them; such wicked intention is further described by devising evils
in the heart, and the perversion of the truths of the Word by being gathered together 

464

all the day for war; the ratiocinations by which they prevail, are signified by wars, 
wherefore it is also added, they sharpen their tongues like serpents. AE 734.

Verse 5. Snare—cords—traps. For the signification of snares, etc. see Psalm 141:9, 
10, Exposition.

Verse 7. O Lord (Adonai) Jehovih; see Psalm 109:21, Exposition.

Verses 9, 10, 11. May the gall of those who beset me, — may the mischief of their lips 
overwhelm them, — may burning coals be cast down upon them, — may they be cast 
by fire into deep pits, whence they cannot rise again; a man of a tongue shall not be 
established on the earth. By gall is signified truth falsified, which in itself is the false;
by the mischief of their lips, is signified the false of doctrine thence derived, for lips 
signify doctrine; by the burning coals which are cast upon them, and by the fire by 
which they are cast into deep pits, is signified the pride of self-derived intelligence 
and. the love of self, by which they fall into mere falsities, burning coals signifying 
the pride of self-derived intelligence, fire, the love of self, and deep pits, falsities; all 
falsities of doctrine in the church, and all falsifications of the Word, exist also from 
the pride of self-derived intelligence, and from the love of self; hence it is evident 
what is signified by a man of a tongue shall not be established on the earth, namely a 
false religion. AE 455.

Verse 13. The just shall give thanks. For the signification of just, and being justified, 
see Psalm 143:2, Exposition.

465

PSALM 141

A Psalm of David.

1. O JEHOVAH, I call upon you, hasten to me; give ear to my voice.
2. Let my prayer be set as incense before you; the lifting up of my hands, as the 

evening oblation.

3. Place, O JEHOVAH, a watch upon my mouth; set a guard over the door of my 

lips.

4. Let not my heart incline to any evil thing, to practise wicked works with men 

who work iniquity, nor let me feed upon their dainties.

5. Let the just one smite me, it will be a kindness; let him reprove me, it will be 
oil to my head; my head will not refuse it; for, my prayer shall still be against 
their evil doings.

6. Their judges shall be cast over the sides of the rock; then shall my words be 

heard, for they are sweet.

7. As one plows and cleaves the ground, so our bones are scattered at the mouth 

of hell.

8. Truly, upon you, O LORD JEHOVIH, are mine eyes; with you do I take refuge, 

leave not my soul naked.

9. Guard me from the snare which they have laid for me, and from the traps of 

the workers of iniquity.

10. Let the wicked, all together, fall into their own toils; let me ever pass over 

them.

The Internal Sense

A prayer of the LORD to the FATHER, that he would regard his integrity, verses 1,2; that
he has no communion with those who are in evils, because he is united with his 
Divine principle, verses 3, 5; that his words, which are divine, are in no estimation 
with them, verses 6 7: confidence that their evil thoughts and intentions whereby they 
themselves perish, do him no harm, verses 8 to 10.

EXPOSITION

Verses 1 to 5. Prayers in this passage are called incense, and the lifting up of the 
hands is called an oblation, and this because by prayers is signified the same as by 
incense, and by the lifting up of the hands the same as by oblation; by incense is 
signified spiritual good, which is the good of charity towards our neighbour, and by 
oblation is signified celestial good, which is the good of love to the LORD, thus both 
signify worship; and because prayers are not from the mouth, but from the heart by 
the mouth, and all worship which is from the heart is from the good of love and 
charity, which is signified by the heart, therefore it is also said, set a guard over the 
door of my lips, let not mine heart incline to any evil thing, to practise wicked works; 

466

 
and because David was lamenting, that evils as yet prevail against him, therefore he 
says, for my prayer shall still be against their evil doings. AE 325.

Concerning prayer, see Psalm 109:4, Exposition.

Verse 6. Their judges shall be cast over the sides of the rock. By judges are signified 
those who are in falsities, and in the abstract sense, the falsities of the thought and of 
doctrine, for by judges in the Word is signified the same thing as by judgements, and 
judgements signify the truths according to which judgements are made, and in an 
opposite sense falsities; inasmuch as they who are in falsities dwell in rocks in the 
spiritual world, therefore it is said, they shall be cast over the sides of the rock, by 
which is signified that they shall be let into their falsities, and dwell in hells 
corresponding thereto. AE 411.

Verse 8. O Lord Jehovih, or, O Jehovih Adonai; see Psalm 109:21, Exposition.

Verse 8. Leave not my soul naked. As to nakedness, it derives its signification from 
the parts of the body which appear naked, in like manner as garments from the parts 
of the body which they clothe, AC 9827; therefore it has one signification when it 
respects the head, which is baldness, another, when it respects the whole body; and 
another, when it respects the loins and genitals: when nakedness respects the head, 
which is baldness, it signifies deprivation of the intelligence of truth and the wisdom 
of good; when it respects the whole body, it signifies deprivation of the truths which 
are of faith; but when it respects the loins and the genitals, it signifies the deprivation 
of the good of love. 

As to what concerns the first, that when nakedness respects the head, which is 
baldness, it signifies deprivation of the intelligence of truth, and of the wisdom of 
good, it is manifest from Isaiah, "In that day, the LORD shall shave by the king of 
Ashur the head, and the hairs of the feet, and shall consume the beard," Is 7:20; to 
shave the head denotes to deprive of the internal truths of the church; to shave the 
hairs of the feet and to consume the beard, denote to deprive of its external truths; by 
the king of Ashur denotes by reasonings from falsities; it must be evident to every one
that neither the head, nor the hair of the feet, nor the beard was to be shaved by the 
king of Ashur, and that still they are significative; that the head denotes the interiors 
that are of wisdom and intelligence, see AC 6292, 6496; that the king of Ashur 
denotes reasoning, AC 119, 1186; that hair denotes the external truth of the church, 
AC 3301, 5247; that feet also denote things external or natural, AC 2162, 3147; that 
the beard denotes sensual scientifics, which are ultimate truths, is manifest from the 
passages in the Word where beard is named. 

Again in the same prophet, "On all heads shall be baldness, every beard shall be 
shaven," Is 15:2; where the sense is the same; and in Jeremiah, "Baldness shall come 
upon Gaza, how long will you cut yourself," Jer 47:5; and in Ezekiel, "On all faces 
shall be shame, and on all heads baldness: their silver they shall cast into the streets, 
and gold shall be an abomination," Ezekiel 7:18, 19; baldness on all heads denotes the
deprivation of the intelligence of truth and of the wisdom of good; and whereas this is 
signified it is also said, "Their silver they shall cast into the streets, and gold shall be 
an abomination," for silver denotes the truth which is of intelligence, and gold the 
good which is of wisdom, AC 1551, 5658; that baldness upon all heads is not meant, 

467

neither that they should cast silver into the streets, and that gold should be an 
abomination, is evident; and in Moses, "Moses said to Aaron, and to Eleazar and to 
Ithamar his sons, you shall not shave your heads, and your garments you shall not 
unsew, lost you die, and anger come upon the whole assembly," Levit 10:6; and in 
Ezekiel, "The priests the Levites shall not shave the head, and their hair they shall not 
let down," Ezekiel 44:20; inasmuch as Aaron and his sons represented the LORD its to 
Divine Good and as to Divine Truth, AC 9806, 9807; and since by a shaven head and 
by misewn garments was signified the deprivation of those principles, therefore it was
forbidden to shave the head, and to unsew the garments, and it is said lest, you die and
anger come upon the whole assembly, by which is signified that thus the 
representative of the LORD as to Divine Good and as to Divine Truth would perish, 
thus the representative of the church. Inasmuch as mourning represented spiritual 
mourning, which is mourning for the deprivation of the truth and good of the church, 
therefore in mourning they brought baldness on their head, as in Jeremiah, "They shall
not bewail them, neither shall baldness be induced on their account," Jer 16:6; and in 
Amos, "I will turn your feasts into mourning, and I will cause baldness to come up on 
every head, and I will set it as the mourning of an only begotten son," Amos 8:10. 
And in Micah, "Put on baldness, and shave yourself on account of the sons of your 
delights dilate your baldness, as an eagle, because they are removed from you," Micah
1:16; the sons of delights denote Truths Divine, their removal denotes deprivation; 
that sons denote truths, see AC 9807. 

Secondly, when nakedness respects the whole body, that it signifies the deprivation of 
the truths of faith, is manifest from the Revelations, "To the angel of the church of the 
Laodiceans write, because you say I am rich, and have need of nothing, when you 
know not that you are wretched and miserable, and needy, and blind, and naked: I 
counsel you to buy of me gold purified in the fire, and white clothing that you may be 
clothed, that the shame of your nakedness may not be manifested," Rev 3:17, 18; the 
angel of the church denotes the Divine Truth there; to say that it is rich denotes that it 
is in the knowledges of truth and good; wretched, needy, blind, and naked, denote that
still it is without truths implanted in the life, thus without good; to buy gold purified 
in the fire denotes to procure to themselves good; white clothing denotes the genuine 
truths of faith derived from good; hence it is evident what is meant by the expression, 
"Lest the shame of your nakedness be manifested;" again, "Behold, I come as a thief, 
blessed is he who watches, and keeps his clothing, that he walk not naked, and they 
see his shame," Rev 16:15, where the sense is the same; again, "They shall hate the 
whore, and shall make her devastated and naked," Rev 17:16; the whore denotes those
who falsify Truths Divine; to make her naked manifestly denotes to deprive of those 
truths, for it is said devastated and naked, and to devastate is to deprive of truths. By 
nakedness is also signified ignorance of truth, and by clothing information, as in 
Isaiah, "When you shall see the naked, and shall cover him, your light shall break 
forth as the day-dawn," Isaiah 58:7, 8; and in Matthew, "The king shall say to those 
who are on the right hand, I was naked and you clothed me; and to those on the left 
hand, I was naked and you did not clothe me," Matt 25:36, 38, 43, 44; in this passage 
naked denotes those who are not in truths, and still desire truths, also who 
acknowledge that there is nothing of good and of truth in them, see AC 4956, 4958. 

Thirdly, that nakedness, when it respects the loins and genitals, signifies deprivation 
of the good of love, is manifest from Isaiah, "O virgin, daughter of Babel, take a mill-
stone, and grind flour, uncover your hair, make bare your feet, uncover the thigh, pass 

468

over the rivers: let your nakedness be uncovered, let your disgrace also be seen," Is 
47:2, 3; the daughter of Babel denotes the church, or what resembles the church, 
where there is a holy principle in externals, but a profane principle in internals; the 
profane principle which is in internals is this, that they regard themselves and the 
world as an end, thus dominion and abundance of wealth, and holy things as means 
conducive to that end; to take a mill-stone, and to grind flour, denotes to trim out 
doctrine from such things as are likely to serve as means to promote the end, AC 
7780; to uncover the hair, to make bare the feet, and to uncover the thigh, denotes to 
prostitute holy things both external and internal without shame and fear; thus to 
uncover nakedness denotes to cause to appear the filthy and infernal things, which are
ends. 

But when the interiors are chaste, then nakedness signifies innocence, because it 
signifies conjugial love, by reason that love truly conjugial in its essence is innocence;
that love truly conjugial is of innocence, see AC 2736; consequently that nakedness in
this sense is innocence, AC 165; wherefore also the angels of the inmost heaven, who 
are called celestial angels, appear naked, AC 165, 2306; inasmuch as the most ancient 
church, which is described in the first chapters of Genesis, and is meant in the internal
sense by man or Adam, and by his wife, was a celestial church, therefore it is said of 
them, "That they were both naked and were not ashamed," Gen 2:25; but when that 
church lapsed, which was effected by eating of the tree of science, by which was 
signified reasoning from scientifics concerning things Divine, then it is said that they 
knew that they were naked, and sewed for themselves fig-leaves, and made 
themselves girdles, thus that they covered their nakedness; and also that the man said, 
when JEHOVAH cried to him, that he was afraid because he was naked; and then that 
JEHOVAH made for them waistcoats of skin, and clothed them, Gen 3:6 to 11, and 21; 
by fig-leaves, of which they made themselves girdles, and also by waistcoats of skin, 
are meant the truths and goods of the external man; the reason why their state after the
fall is thus described was, because from internal men they became external; their 
internal principle is signified by Paradise, for Paradise denotes the intelligence and 
wisdom of the internal man, and its being closed up is signified by ejection out of 
Paradise; that a leaf denotes natural truth which is scientific, see AC 885; that a fig 
denotes natural good, or good of the external man, AC 217, 423; and that a waistcoat 
of skin also denotes the truth and good of the external man, AC 294, 295; that skin 
denotes what is external, see AC 3544. AC 9960.

Verses 9, 10. Guard me from the snare which they have laid for me, and from the 
traps of the workers of iniquity. Let the wicked, all together, fall into their own toils, 
let me ever pass over them. That a snare, in the spiritual sense, signifies enticement 
and deception by the delights of the loves of self and of the world, thus the enticement
and deception of evils, and this by reasonings grounded in the fallacies of the senses, 
which favour those delights, is evident to every one, for ensnarings and entrappings 
are from no other source: neither do the diabolical crew assault any thing else with 
man except those his loves, which they render delightful by every method, until he is 
taken, and when he is taken, the man reasons from falsities against truths, and from 
evils against goods; and in such case he is not content herewith, but also takes delight 
in ensnaring and enticing others to falsities and evils; the reason why he also takes 
this delight is because in such case he is one of the diabolical crew. Inasmuch as a 
snare, a trap, a net, signify such things, they also signify the destruction of spiritual 
life, and thereby perdition, for the delights of those are what destroy and lead into 

469

perdition, since in those loves, as was said above, all evils originate; for in the love of 
self originate contempt of others in comparison of self, and presently, a scornful look 
and abusive speech, afterwards, enmity if they do not favour, at length, the delight of 
hatred, the delight of revenge, thus the delight of tyrannical behaviour, yea, of cruelty.

This love in the other life rises to such an excess, that unless the LORD favours it, and 
gives to those who are influenced by it dominion over others, they not only despise 
him, but also treat with scorn the Word which speaks of him, and at length from 
hatred and revenge they act against him, and so far as they cannot effect their 
purposes against him, they practise them with fierceness and cruelty against all who 
profess him; hence it is evident what is the origin of such qualities in the diabolical 
crew, namely that it is from self-love. Wherefore a snare, as it signifies the delight of 
the love of self and the world, signifies also the destruction of spiritual life and 
perdition; for the all of faith and love to the LORD, and the all of love towards the 
neighbour is destroyed by the delight of the love of self and the world, where it has 
dominion, see what was cited, AC 9335. That those loves are the origin of all evils, 
and that hell is from them and in them, and that those loves are fires there, is at this 
day unknown in the world; when yet it might be known from this consideration, that 
those loves are opposite to love towards the neighbour and to the love of GOD, and 
that they are opposite to humiliation of heart, and that from them alone exist all 
contempt, all hatred, all revenge, and all fierceness and cruelty, as every considerate 
person may know. AC 9348.

PSALM 142

An instructive Psalm of David; a prayer when he was in the cave.

1. With my voice I cry aloud to JEHOVAH; with my voice to JEHOVAH do I make 

my supplication.
I pour out before him my complaint, I declare before him my distress.

2.
3. When my spirit within me is faint, you know my path; in the way wherein I 

walk have they secretly laid a snare for me.

4. Look on my right hand and behold! For there is no one who cares for me; the 

5.

way of escape has perished from me; no one inquires after my soul.
I cry aloud to you, O JEHOVAH, I say, You are my refuge, and my portion in the
land of the living.

6. Attend to my cry, for I am brought very low, deliver me from my persecutors, 

for they are stronger than I.

7. Bring my soul out of prison, that I may praise your name; the just shall 

encompass me, when you shall have dealt bountifully with me.

The Internal Sense

A prayer of the LORD to the FATHER, that he would assist in temptation, verses 1 to 3; 
because no one knows him but the FATHER alone, in whom is his trust, verses 4, 5; that
he may be delivered from temptation, and come amongst those who acknowledge 
him, verses 6, 7.

EXPOSITION

Verse 3. When my spirit within me is faint. By the spirit of man in the concrete 
nothing else is meant but his mind, for it is this which lives after death, and is then 
called a spirit; if good, an angelic spirit, which afterwards becomes an angel, but if 
evil, a satanical spirit, which afterwards becomes a satan. The mind of every one is 
his internal man, which is actually a man, and dwells within the external man, that 
makes its body; wherefore, on the rejection of the body by death, it is in a complete 
human form. It is therefore a palpable error to suppose that the mind of man is only in
his head; this is indeed the mind's seat in its first principles, from which primarily 
issues all that man thinks from the understanding and acts from the will; but as to its 
principiates, or derivations from those first principles, formed for the purposes of 
sensation and action, the mind dwells in the body also, and in consequence of this 
internal adherence to the particles of the body, it imparts to them sense and motion, 
and likewise infuses into the body a perception, as if thought and action were its own, 
and self-derived; but every wise man is well aware that this is a fallacy. Now since the
spirit of a man is alone possessed of the power of thought by virtue of the 
understanding, and of action by the will, and since the body of itself possesses no 
such powers, but only by derivation from the spirit, it follows, that by the spirit of a 
man is signified his intelligence and love-affection, and whatever proceeds as an 
operation from them. That the spirit of man signifies such things as have relation to, 
and respect the mind, is evident from many passages of the Word, which need only be

471

adduced to evince the truth of this observation; the following may suffice, out of 
many which might be mentioned: "Bezaleel was filled with the spirit of wisdom, of 
understanding, and of knowledge," Exod 31:3; Nebuchadnezzar says of Daniel, that 
"an excellent spirit of knowledge, of understanding, and of wisdom was in him," Dan.
v. 12; "Joshua was full of the spirit of wisdom," Deut 34:9; "Make you a new heart 
and a new spirit," Ezek 18:31; "Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the 
kingdom of heaven," Matt 5:3; "I dwell in a contrite and humble spirit, to revive the 
spirit of the humble," Isaiah 57:15; "The sacrifices of GOD are a broken spirit," Ps 
51:19; "I will give the cloak of praise instead of a contracted spirit," Isaiah 61:3; not 
to mention other passages to the like purport. That spirit also signifies such things as 
relate to a perverse and wicked mind, is evident from the following passages: "Wo to 
the foolish prophets, who go away after their own spirits!" Ezek 13:3; "You shall 
conceive chaff, you shall bring forth stubble, as to your spirit, fire shall devour you," 
Isaiah 33:11; " A man, who wanders in spirit, and utters a lie," Micah 2:11; "A 
generation whose spirit was not steadfast with GOD," Psalm 78:8; "The spirit of 
whoredoms," Hosea 5:4, Zech 4:12; "Every heart shall melt, and every spirit shall be 
contracted," Ezek 21:7; "Blessed is the man in whose spirit there is no guile," Psalm 
32:2; "The spirit of Pharaoh was troubled," Gen 41:8. From these and many other 
passages it is very evident, that the spirit signifies the mind of man, and whatever 
belongs to it. AR 156.

Verse 3. Have they secretly laid a snare; see Psalm 141:9, 10, Exposition.

Verse 5. In the land of the living. It is not possible that more than one single fountain 
of life can exist, whence the life of all things is derived; and it is not possible that any 
life can exist, which is truly life, except by faith in the LORD, who is real essential life 
itself; nor can faith exist in which is life, except from him, consequently, except he be 
in it: wherefore in the Word the LORD alone is called living, and is named the living 
Jehovah, Jeremiah 5:2, 12:16, 16:14, 15, 23:7; Ezekiel 5:11; Living for ever, Dan 
4:24; Rev 4:10, 5:14, 10:6; A fountain of life, Psalm 36:9; A fountain of living waters, 
Jeremiah 17:13. Wherefore heaven, which lives by or from him, is called the land of 
the living, Isaiah 37:11, 57:8; Ezekiel 26:20, 32:23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 32; Psalm 27:13, 
142:5.

And they are called living, who are in faith in the LORD, as in David, "Who holds our 
soul amongst the living," Psalm 66:9; and they who are in faith are said to be in the 
book of lives, Psalm 69:28, and in the hook of life, Rev 13:8, 20:15; wherefore also 
they are said to he made alive who receive faith in him, Hosea 6:2; Psalm 85:6. On 
the contrary, they who are not in faith are called dead, as in Isaiah, "The dead shall 
not live; the deceased shall not rise, because you have visited and destroyed them," 
Isaiah 26:14; where the dead signify those who are puffed up with self-love; and to 
rise signifies to enter into life, they are also said to be thrust, through, [confessi] 
Ezekiel 22:23, 24, 25, 26, 28, 29, 30, 31; and hell is called death, Isaiah 25:8, 28:15; 
they are also called dead by the LORD, Matt 4:16; John 5:25, 8:21, 24, 51, 52, AC 290.

The LORD alone is love itself, because he is life itself, and angels and men are 
recipients of life from the LORD. The LORD, who is the GOD of the universe, is 
uncreate and infinite, whereas man and angel is created and finite; and because the 
LORD is uncreate and infinite, he is being [esse] itself, which is called JEHOVAH, and 
he is life itself or life in himself. From the uncreate, infinite esse itself and life itself, 

472

no being can be immediately created, because the Divine is one and not divisible, but 
from created and finite substances, so formed that the Divine may be in them, beings 
may be created. Inasmuch as men and angels are such beings, they are recipients of 
life: wherefore if any man suffers himself so far to he misled, as to think that he is not 
a recipient of life, but life itself, he cannot be withheld from thinking that he is a GOD. 
That man feels as if he were life itself, and thence believes that he is, is grounded in 
fallacy, for in the instrumental cause the principal cause is no otherwise perceived 
than as one with it. That the LORD is life in himself, he himself teaches in John, "As 
the FATHER has life in himself, so has he given to the SON to have life in himself," John
5:26; and, "that he is the life," John 11:25, 14:6. Now inasmuch as life and love are 
one, as appears from what has been said above, DLW 1, 2, it follows that the LORD, 
because he is life itself, is love itself.

But in order that this matter may be rightly apprehended, it is necessary to be known 
that the LORD, inasmuch as he is love in its very essence, that is, Divine love, appears 
before the angels in heaven as a sun, and that from that sun proceeds heat and light, 
and that the heat thence proceeding, in its essence, is love, and the light thence 
proceeding, in its essence, is wisdom; and that the angels, in proportion as they are 
recipients of that spiritual heat and spiritual light, are loves and wisdoms, not loves 
and wisdoms from themselves, but from the LORD. This spiritual heat and spiritual 
light not only descend by influx into angels and affect them, but descend also by 
influx into men and affect them, altogether in proportion as they become recipients, 
and they become recipients according to their love of the LORD, and their love towards
their neighbour. This sun itself, or Divine love, cannot by its heat and light create any 
one immediately from itself, for in that case he would be love in its essence, which is 
the LORD himself, but it can create beings from substances and materials so formed, as
to be capable of receiving its heat itself and light itself, comparatively as the sun of 
this world cannot, by its heat and light, immediately produce germinations in the 
earth, but it can produce them from earthly materials, in which it may be present by its
heat and light, and give vegetation. That the Divine love of the LORD appears as a sun 
in the spiritual world, and that therefrom proceed spiritual heat and spiritual light, 
from whence the angels have their love and wisdom, may be seen in the work 
concerning "HEAVEN AND HELL," HH 116 to 140.

Since therefore man is not life, but a recipient of life, it follows that the conception of 
a man from his father is not a conception of life, but only a conception of the first and 
purest form capable of receiving of life, to which, as a stamen or beginning, 
successively accede, in the womb, substances and matters in forms adapted to the 
reception of life in their order and degree. DLW 4—6.

PSALM 143

A Psalm of David.

1. O JEHOVAH, hear my prayer, give ear to my supplications; in your truth, and in 

your justice answer me.

2. And enter not into judgement with your servant, for before you shall no man 

living be justified.

3. For, the enemy pursues my soul, he dashes my life down to the earth, he 

makes me to dwell in dark places, as those long dead.
4. My spirit faints within me, my heart within me is desolate.
5.

I remember the days of old; I meditate upon all your works; I muse upon the 
work of your hands.
I spread forth my hands towards you; my soul thirsts for you, like a parched 
land. Selah.

6.

7. Quickly answer me, O JEHOVAH! My spirit fails; hide not your face from me, 

lest I become like those who descend into the pit.

8. Cause me to hear your mercy in the morning, for in you do I trust; cause me to

know the way wherein I should walk, for to you do I raise up my soul.

9. Deliver me from mine enemies, O JEHOVAH! I hide myself with you.
10. Teach me to do your will, for you are my GOD; let your good spirit lead me 

into the land of uprightness.

11. Revive me, O JEHOVAH, for your name's sake, in your justice bring my soul 

out of distress.

12. And in your mercy cut off mine enemies, and destroy all those who afflict my 

soul; for I am your servant.

The Internal Sense

A prayer of the LORD to the FATHER, that he would hear, who is true and just, verses 1,
2; lest he should sink under temptations, verses 3, 4, 7; that he wishes for the ancient 
state of the church, verses 5, 6; that his trust is in him for deliverance from the hells, 
which powerfully assault him, verses 8 to 12.

EXPOSITION

Verse 1. O JEHOVAH, hear my prayer, give ear to my supplication. That to hear, when 
predicated of JEHOVAH, or the LORD, denotes providence, and that to see denotes 
foresight, appears from those passages in the Word, in which eyes, and also ears, are 
attributed to JEHOVAH, as in Isaiah, "O JEHOVAH, incline your ear, and hear, open your 
eyes and see, O JEHOVAH," Isaiah 37:17. AC 3869.

Concerning prayer, see Psalm 109:4, Exposition.

Verse 2. Before you shall no man living be justified.

474

Mention is frequently made in the Word of a just one, of justice, and of justifying, but 
what is specifically signified by those expressions, is not yet known; the reason why it
is not known is because hitherto it has been unknown that singular the expressions in 
the Word signify such things as are of the internal church and of heaven, thus which 
are of the internal man, for in the internal man is the internal of the church and 
heaven; also that those interior things in the Word differ from its exterior things, 
which are of the letter, as spiritual things differ from natural, or celestial things from 
earthly, the difference of which is so great, that before the natural man there scarce 
appears a likeness, although there is a full concordance. 

Inasmuch as this has been unknown, it could not be known what is signified by just, 
by justice, and by being justified, in the spiritual and celestial sense in the Word. It is 
believed by those who are considered as oracles in the church, that he is just and 
justified, who is acquainted with the truths of faith derived from the doctrine of the 
church and from the Word, and hence is in trust or confidence, that he is saved by the 
justice of the LORD, and that the LORD had justice in consequence of fulfilling all 
things of the law; and that he had merit, because he endured the cross, and thereby 
expiated and redeemed man; by this faith alone man is believed to be justified; and it 
is believed further that these are they who in the Word are called just, But there are no
others who are called just in the Word, but those who from the LORD are in the good 
of charity towards the neighbour, for the LORD alone is just, because alone justice . 

Therefore man, so much as he receives of good from the LORD, that is, so much of the 
LORD as he has belonging to him and according to its quality, so much he is just and 
justified; the LORD being made Justice consisted in his making his Human principle 
Divine by his own proper power; this Divine principle belonging to man, who 
receives it, is the justice of the LORD belonging to him, and is the essential good of 
charity towards the neighbour; for the LORD is in the good of love and by it in the 
truth of faith, because the LORD is Divine Love itself. The good of charity towards the 
neighbour is exterior good, which is signified by just; and the good of love to the 
LORD is interior good, which is signified by innocent, and which was treated of in the 
foregoing article. That the good of love towards the neighbour from the LORD is what 
is just in a proper sense, may be manifest from the passages in the Word where 
mention is made of just, of justice, and of being justified; . As in Matthew, "Then shall
the just answer, saying, when saw we you hungry and fed you, or thirsty and gave you
drink; when saw we you a sojourner and gathered you; and naked and clothed you; 
when saw we you sick or in prison, and came to you: but the King answering shall say
to them, Verily I say to you, insomuch as you have done it to one of these the least of 
my brethren, you have done it to me: and the just shall go into eternal life," Matt 
25:37, 38, 39, 40, 46; in this passage they are called just, who have performed the 
goods of charity towards the neighbour, which are there recounted; and that the goods 
of charity are the LORD belonging to them, is said manifestly, "insomuch as you have 
done it to one of the least of these my brethren, you have done it to me," see AC 4807 
to 4810; 4954 to 4959; 5063 to 5071; these are also called sheep, for by sheep, are 
signified those who from the LORD are in the good of charity, AC 4169; but by the 
goats who are on the left hand, and are damned, are signified those who are in faith 
separate from charity, AC 4169, 4769. The same are signified by the just in another 
passage in Matthew, "The angels shall go forth, and shall separate the evil from the 
midst of the just," Matt 13:49; and in Luke, "You shall be recompensed in the 
resurrection of the just," Luke 14:14. Hence it is evident what is signified by "the just 

475

shining as the sun in heaven," Matt 13:43, namely that they are in the good of love 
from the LORD, for the LORD is the sun in the other life, and what is from the LORD as 
a sun in that life is the good of love, see AC 1053, 1521, 1529; hence the LORD is 
called the Sun of Justice," Mal 4:2. AC 9263.

With respect to justification, it is not to be understood according to the common 
manner of apprehending it, namely that all evils and sins are wiped away, and 
altogether blotted out, when the sinner, as he imagines, receives faith, though at the 
very point of death, however he may have lived in evil and wickedness during the 
whole course of his life. For I have been fully instructed, that not the smallest evil 
which a man has thought and actually done in the life of the body is wiped away and 
altogether blotted out, but that all remains, even to the smallest particular. The truth is 
this; they who have lived in the thought and practice of hatred, revenge, cruelty, and 
adultery, and thus not in any charity, retain after death the life which they have 
thereby contracted, including all things belonging to such life, even to the minutest 
particulars, which successively return: hence their torments in hell. 

They who have lived in love to the LORD, and in charity towards their neighbour, 
likewise retain all the evils of their lives; but in them they are tempered by the good 
principles which they have received from the LORD, through the life of charity, during 
their abode in the world; and thus they are elevated into heaven, yea, are withheld 
from the evils, which they still have with them, so that they do not appear. Such in the
other life as doubt concerning this circumstance of their having evils with them, 
because they do not appear, are again let into them, till they are convinced it is so; and
then they are again elevated into heaven. This then is being justified; for thus they 
acknowledge that their righteousness is not their own, but the LORD'S. The common 
saying, that they are saved who have faith, is true: but by faith nothing else is meant, 
in the Word, but love to the LORD and love towards one's neighbour, consequently, a 
life agreeable to such love. Doctrinals and tenets of faith are not faith, but are only 
things belonging to faith; for all and each of them are given for the sake of this end, to
make man such as they teach him to be. This may appear evident from the LORD'S 
words where he teaches, that the law and all the prophets, that is the whole doctrine of
faith, consists in love to GOD, and in love towards our neighbour, Matt 22:34—39; 
Mark 12:28—35. AC 2116.

Verse 3. He makes me to dwell in dark places, as those long dead. By the dead are 
meant those who have not in themselves the life of heaven, consequently, who are in 
evils and thence in falsities. AE 186.

Verse 4. My spirit faints; see Psalm 142:3, Exposition.

Verses 6, 8, 11, 12. My soul; see Psalm 103:1, and 43:5, Exposition.

Verse 7. Quickly answer me, O JEHOVAH! My spirit fails. That in this passage by spirit
is meant the very life of man, is manifestly evident; that it denotes intellectual life, or 
the life of truth, may be manifest from this consideration, that by spirit in the natural 
sense is meant the life of the respiration of man; and the respiration, which is of the 
lungs, corresponds to the life of truth, which is the life of faith, and thence of the 
understanding, whilst the pulse, which is of the heart, corresponds to the life of the 
will, thus of the love; that such is the correspondence of the lungs and of the heart, see

476

AC 3883, 3896, 9300, 9494; hence it may be manifest, what life, in the spiritual 
sense, is meant by the spirit. AC 9818.

When it is known what is signified by spirit belonging to man, it may be known what 
is signified by spirit when it is predicated of JEHOVAH or the Lord, to whom are 
attributed all things which belong to man, as a face, eyes, ears, arms, hands, and also 
heart and soul, thus also spirit, which in the Word is called the spirit of GOD, the spirit
of JEHOVAH, the spirit of his mouth, the spirit of holiness, or the Holy Spirit; that by it
is meant the Divine truth proceeding from the LORD, is manifest from several 
passages in the Word; the reason why the Divine truth proceeding from the LORD is 
signified by the spirit of GOD is because all the life of man is from there, and heavenly
love to those who receive that Divine truth by faith and love; that this is the spirit of 
GOD, the LORD himself teaches in John, "The words which I speak to you are spirit 
and are life," John 6:63; the words which the LORD spoke are Divine truths. AC 9818.

Verse 7. Hide not your face; see Psalm 27:9, Exposition.

Verse 7. Who descend into the pit. For the signification of pit, see Psalm 88:4, 
Exposition.

Verse 10. Teach me to do your will, or good pleasure; let your good spirit lead me 
into the land of uprightness, To do the good pleasure of JEHOVAH GOD, signifies to 
live according to his precepts; this is his good pleasure or will, because from Divine 
love he wills that all may be saved, and by it they are saved. The expression good 
pleasure, in the Hebrew tongue also signifies will, for whatever is done according to 
the will is well pleasing, and the Divine love wills no other than that the love which is 
from himself may be with angels and men, and his love is then with them, when they 
love to live according to his precepts; that this is love to the LORD, he himself teaches 
in John 14:15, 21, 23, 24, 15:10, 14. AE 295.

Verses 10, 11, Lead me into the land of uprightness; revive me, O JEHOVAH, for your 
name's sake. Where the land of uprightness denotes the church in which is what is 
right and true; and because the spirit of Jehovah signifies the Divine truth, and every 
one thereby receives spiritual life, it is therefore said, "Let your good spirit lead me, 
revive me, O JEHOVAH!" AE 304.

PSALM 144

A Psalm of David.

1. Blessed be JEHOVAH my rock, who teaches my hands to war, and my fingers to

8. Whose mouth speaks vanity, and whose right hand is a right hand of 

falsehood.

9. O GOD, I will sing a new song to you, with the ten stringed lute will I sing 

praises to you.

10. Unto him who gives salvation to kings, who delivered! David his servant from

the evil sword.

11. Rescue me, and deliver me from the hand of strange children, whose mouth 

speaks vanity, and whose right hand is a right hand of falsehood.

12. That our sons may be like plants, well-grown in their youth; that our daughters

may be like corner-pillars beautifully carved after the model of a palace.
13. That our garners may be full, supplying all kinds of provision, that our flocks 

may bring forth thousands, and ten thousands in our fields.

14. That our oxen may be strong to labour; that there be no breaking in, nor going 

out, nor any complaining in our streets.

15. Happy are the people, who are in such a state! Happy are the people, whose 

GOD is JEHOVAH!

The Internal Sense

A prayer to the FATHER that he may be assisted in his conflicts, verses 1, 2; because 
without him he has no power, verses 3, 4; that he may be delivered from the hells 
which assault him with falsities, verses 5 to 8, 11; that so there will be salvation, 
verses 9, 10; and Divine truth and Divine good in him and from him, verses 12 to 14; 
blessed is he who acknowledges him, verse 15.

EXPOSITION

Verse 1. Blessed be JEHOVAH. Blessing implies all good celestial, and spiritual, and 
also natural, which are signified by blessing in an internal sense; and in an external 
sense, by blessing is signified all worldly, corporeal, and terrestrial good; but in order 
to make these a blessing, they must needs be connected with internal blessing, for this

478

alone is blessing, because it is eternal, and joined with all happiness, and is the very 
esse of blessing, for what can be said to be, except it be eternal; every other thing 
ceases to be. It was a customary form of speech amongst the ancients to say, blessed 
be Jehovah, by which they meant, that all blessing is from him, that is, all good; and it
was also a form of thanksgiving for the LORD'S blessing both past and present; as in 
David, Psalm 28:6, 31:21, 41:13. AC 1096.

Verse 1. Who teaches my hands to war, and my fingers to fight. That the hands signify 
power, and that all power is of truth derived from good, see AC 10019, and that the 
right hand signifies the power of truth derived from good, and the left hand truth 
productive of good, AC 10061. The reason why the intellectual principle is what is 
meant is because every thing intellectual is formed from truths, but every thing 
voluntary, or of the will, from goods, for all things in the world and in heaven have 
reference to truth and to good, and the understanding of man was given for truths, and
the will for goods. Therefore, since by the hands is signified truth in its power, the 
understanding, or intellect, is also signified. Inasmuch as the thumb of the hand, in 
like manner as the hand, signified the power which is of truth derived from good, 
therefore in ancient times amongst the nations, and also with the Israelitish people, it 
was usual to cut off the thumbs of the hands and the thumbs of the feet of their 
enemies, Judges 1:6, 7; by which was represented the taking away of all power; in the 
thumb also is the primary power of the hand, for when that is cut off the hand is of no
avail in battle. As the thumb, so also the fingers signify power, as in David, "JEHOVAH 
teaches my hands to war, and my fingers to fight," Psalm 144:1; again, "When I look 
at the heavens, the work of your fingers," Psalm 8:3; and in Luke, "JESUS said, if by 
the finger of GOD I cast out devils, certainly the kingdom of GOD is come to you," 
Luke 11:20. AC 10062.

Verse 2. See Psalm 18:2, Exposition.

Verses 5, 6. Bow your heavens, and come down: touch the mountains that they may 
smoke; hurl your lightning and scatter them. By bowing the heavens and coming 
down, is here signified the same as above, by rending the heavens and descending, by 
coming forth out of his place, by descending and treading upon the high places of the 
earth, namely, visitation and judgement; to touch the mountains that they may smoke, 
signifies by his presence to destroy those who are in the evils of the loves of self and 
of the world, and thence in falsities; to smoke signifies to he let into the evils of those 
loves, and into their falsities, for fire signifies those loves, and smoke the falsities 
thence arising; by hurl your lightning and scatter them, is signified the Divine truth, 
by which they are dissipated, for by the presence of Divine truth evils and falsities are
discovered, and by the collision which then takes place, there appear as it were 
lightnings. AE 405.

Verses 11, 12. Deliver me from the hand of strange children, whose mouth speaks 
vanity, and whose right hand is a right hand of falsehood; that our sons may be like 
plants, well-grown in their youth; that our daughters may be like corner-pillars 
beautifully carved after the model of a palace. That by the sons of the stranger are 
understood falsities, is evident, for it is said, whose mouth speaks vanity, and whose 
right hand is a right hand of falsehood; and that by our sons are signified truths, is 
also evident, for it is said, that they are as plants, well-grown in their youth, plants 
also denoting truths, and youth denoting here, as above, the ancient church, which was

479

in genuine truths; by our daughters are signified the affections of truth, which are 
therefore compared to corner-pillars beautifully carved after the model of a palace, 
because a palace is a representative of the understanding in which truths are in a 
beautiful form, and they are in a beautiful form, when they are from the affection of 
truth. AE 724.

Verses 13, 14. That our garners may be full, supplying all kinds of provision, that our 
flocks may bring forth thousands, and ten thousands in our fields; that our oxen may 
be strong to labour; that there be no breaking in, nor going out, nor any complaining 
in our streets. By the garners full of food, are signified doctrinals from the Word, thus 
the Word itself, wherein are all the truths of doctrine, from which is instruction and 
spiritual nourishment; by the flocks bringing forth thousands, and ten thousands in 
the fields, are signified goods and truths spiritual, by thousands of flocks, goods, and 
by ten thousands, truths; by oxen burdened, are signified natural goods and their 
affections; by no breaking in, is signified their coherence; by none going away, is 
signi-fied no loss of any; by no complaining in the streets, is signified no lamentation 
any where over the want of them, AE 652.

Celebration of the LORD for his works and his justice, verses 1 to 7; for his mercy, 
verses 8, 9; that all in the heavens will confess him, verses 10 to 12; because his 
kingdom is eternal, verse 13; that he raises up sinners, and leads them into truths that 
they may live, verses 14 to 16; that he is Divine, verse 17; that he saves those who 
believe in him, and that they who believe not, perish, verses 18 to 20; that he is to be 
worshiped, verse 21.

481

EXPOSITION

Verses 4, 5, 12. The glorious honour of your majesty denotes the Divine good united 
to the Divine truth, and the glorious majesty of his kingdom denotes the Divine truth 
united to Divine good; the reason of its being so expressed is because the unification 
is reciprocal, for from the LORD proceeds the Divine good united to the Divine truth, 
but by angels in heaven and the men in the church Divine truth is received, and is 
united to Divine good; it is therefore said, the glory of the honour of his kingdom, and 
by his kingdom is signified heaven and the church. AE 288.

Verse 4. Generation to generation; see Psalm 14:4 Exposition.

Verse 9. Good is JEHOVAH to all, and his tender mercies are over all his works. GOD is
love or goodness itself, and wisdom or truth itself, and these two constitute his 
essence. That love or goodness, and wisdom or truth, are the two essentials, to which 
all the infinite properties that are in GOD, and that proceed from him, have relation, 
was a truth known in the earliest ages of the world; but succeeding generations, as 
they withdrew their minds from heaven, and immersed them in worldly and corporeal 
things, could not discern that truth; for they began to lose the knowledge of what love 
is in its essence; not knowing that love abstracted from form cannot exist; and that in 
and by form it effects its operations. Now since GOD is the very, the one only, and thus
the first substance and form, whose essence is love and wisdom; and since by him all 
things were made which are made, it follows that he created the universe with all its 
parts, both general and particular, out of or from love, by means of wisdom; and that, 
consequently, Divine love, in union with Divine wisdom, is in every created subject. 
Love, moreover, is not only the essence which forms all things, but which likewise 
unites and conjoins them, and so keeps them, when formed, in order and connection. 

These truths are capable of receiving illustration from numberless objects in nature; 
as, for instance, from the heat and light proceeding from the sun, which are the two 
essentials and universals by which all things upon earth, both in general and in 
particular, exist and subsist: heat and light exist in nature, because they correspond 
with the Divine love and Divine wisdom; for the heat which proceeds from the sun of 
the spiritual world, in its essence, is love; and the light derived thence, in its essence, 
is wisdom. They may be illustrated also by the two essentials and universals, by 
which human minds exist and subsist, which are the will and the understanding; for of
these two every man's mind consists; and they are, and operate in all its parts, both in 
general and in particular; the reason is because the will is the recipient and habitation 
of love, and the understanding of wisdom; wherefore those two faculties correspond 
with the Divine love and Divine wisdom, from whence they derive their origin. 

Moreover, the same truths may be illustrated by those two essentials and universals, 
by which human bodies exist and subsist, the heart and lungs, or the systole and 
diastole of the heart, and the respiration of the lungs; which, it is well known, operate 
in all parts of the human body, both generally and particularly: the reason is because 
the heart corresponds to love, and the lungs to wisdom; which correspondence is fully
demonstrated in the work entitled "ANGELIC WISDOM CONCERNING DIVINE LOVE AND 
DIVINE WISDOM." That love, as the bridegroom and husband, produces or begot all 
forms, but still by wisdom as the bride and wife, may be proved by numberless 
testimonies, both in the spiritual and the natural world; here however we shall only 

482

make this observation, that the whole angelic heaven is arranged into its form, and 
preserved in it, from the Divine love operating by the Divine wisdom. 

Where men deduce the creation of the world from any other source, than from the 
Divine love operating by Divine wisdom, and do not know that these two constitute 
the Divine essence, they descend from rational vision to material, embrace nature as 
the creatrix of the universe, and thence conceive chimeras, and bring forth phantoms; 
their thoughts are fallacies, and their reasonings from them terminate in the formation 
of eggs, that are pregnant with birds of night: such men cannot properly be 
denominated minds, but rather eyes and ears without understanding, or thoughts 
without a soul: they talk of colours as existing without light; and of trees as produced 
without seed; and of all created subjects as formed without a sun; inasmuch as they 
put derivatives in the place of primitives, effects in the place of causes, and thus turn 
every thing upside down, and, laying the powers of reason asleep, see as in a dream. 
AR 37.

Verse 13. Your kingdom is an everlasting kingdom; see the Work concerning "HEAVEN 
AND HELL," HH 20 to 28.

Verse 13. Your kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and your dominion endures 
through all generations. In this passage, dominion is predicated of good, because from
good the LORD is called LORD, and kingdom is predicated of truth, because from this 
the LORD is called king. AE 685.

Verse 18. JEHOVAH is near to all who call upon him, to all who call upon him in truth.
Where to be near, denotes to be present and conjoined; the reason why the 
conjunction and presence of the LORD is by the Word is because the Word is the union
of man with heaven, and by heaven with the LORD; for the Word is the Divine truth 
proceeding from the LORD, wherefore they who are in that truth as to doctrine and life,
or as to faith and love, are in the Divine principle proceeding from the LORD, thus are 
conjoined to him. From these considerations it is evident that by the words, "Moses, 
he alone shall approach to JEHOVAH," is signified the conjunction and presence of the 
LORD by the Word. The reason why to approach denotes conjunction and presence is 
because in the other life the distances of one from another are altogether according to 
the dissimilitudes and diversities of the interiors, which are of thoughts and affection, 
see n. 1273 to 1277; removals also from the LORD and approaches to him are 
altogether according to the good of love, and thence of faith from him and to him; 
hence it is, that the heavens are near to the LORD according to goods, and on the other 
hand, the hells are remote from the LORD according to evils; hence it is evident from 
what ground it is that to be near and to approach in the spiritual sense denote to be 
conjoined. AC 9378.

Verse 20. JEHOVAH preserves all those who love him. It may be expedient briefly to 
state what is meant by love to the LORD, or by loving the LORD. He who believes that 
he loves the LORD, and does not live according to his precepts, is very greatly 
deceived; for to live according to his precepts is to love the LORD, those precepts 
being truths which are from the LORD, thus in which the LORD is; wherefore so far as 
they are loved, that is, so far as from love the life is formed accordingly, so far the 
LORD is loved. 

483

The reason is because the LORD loves man, and from love wills him to be happy to 
eternity, and man cannot become happy except by a life according to his precepts; for 
by them man is regenerated, and becomes spiritual, and is thus capable of being 
elevated into heaven: but to love the LORD without a life according to his precepts is 
not to love him, for in such case there is not any thing belonging to man, into which 
the LORD can flow, and elevate man to himself; for he is as an empty vessel, in which 
there is not any thing of life in his faith, nor any thing of life in his love;. for the life 
of heaven, which is called eternal life, is not infused into any one immediately, but 
mediately. 

From these considerations it may be manifest what it is to love the LORD, and likewise
what it is to see the LORD, or his faces, namely that he is seen from such faith and 
love. To live according to the LORD'S precepts, is to live according to the doctrine of 
charity and faith, which may be seen prefixed to each chapter of the book of Exodus. 
That this is the case, the LORD also teaches in John, "He that has my precepts, and 
does them, he it is who loves me; but he that loves me will be loved of my FATHER, 
and I will love him, and will manifest myself to him: if any one love me, he will keep 
my Word, and my FATHER will love him, and we will come to him, and make our 
abode with him. He that loves me not, keeps not my words," John 14:21, 23, 24. AC 
10578.

So far as any one is principled in good, and from good loves truths, so far he loves the 
LORD, inasmuch as the LORD is good itself and truth itself; therefore the LORD is with 
man in good and in truth, and if the latter be loved from the former, then the LORD is 
loved, and not otherwise. This the LORD teaches in John, "He that has my precepts, 
and does them, he it is who loves me; but he that loves me not, keeps not my words," 
John 14:21, 24. DLife 38. 

Inasmuch as the church at this day does not know that conjunction with the LORD 
makes heaven, and that conjunction is effected by the acknowledgement that he is the 
GOD of heaven and earth, and at the same time by a life according to his precepts, it 
may therefore be expedient to say something on the subject. It may be asked by him, 
who is uninstructed in this case, what is conjunction? How can acknowledgement and 
life make conjunction? What need is there of these things, when every one may be 
saved by mercy alone? What necessity for any other medium of salvation but faith 
alone? Is not GOD merciful and omnipotent? But let such a one know that in the 
spiritual world knowledge and acknowledgement make all presence, and that the 
affection which is of love makes all conjunction; for spaces in that world are nothing 
else but appearances according to the similitudes of minds, that is, of affections and 
consequent thoughts; wherefore when any one knows another either from reputation, 
or from communication with him, or from conversation, or from affinity, whilst he 
thinks of him from the idea of that knowledge, he is presented to view, although he 
were a thousand miles off as to appearance; and if any one loves another with whom 
he is acquainted, he dwells with him in one society, and if he loves him inmostly, in 
one house. This is the state of all throughout the spiritual world, and it derives its 
origin from this circumstance, that the LORD is present with every one according to 
faith, and conjoined according to love; faith, and the consequent presence of the 
LORD, is given by the knowledges of truths from the Word, especially concerning the 
LORD himself there, but love and consequent conjunction is given by a life according 
to his precepts, for the LORD says, "He that has my precepts, and does them, he it is 

484

who loves me; and I will love him, and make abode with him," John 14:21 to 24. But 
in what manner this is effected, it may also be expedient to say. The LORD loves every 
one, and is willing to be conjoined to him, but he cannot be conjoined so long as man 
is in the delight of evil, as in the delight of hatred and revenge, in the delight of 
adultery and whoredom, in the delight of defrauding or stealing under any pretence 
whatever, in the delight of blaspheming and lying, and in the cravings of the love of 
self and of the world; for every one, who is in those evils, is in concert with devils 
who are in hell; the LORD indeed loves them even there, but he cannot be conjoined 
with them, unless the delights of those evils be removed, and they cannot be removed 
by the LORD, unless man explores himself, so as to know his own evils, 
acknowledging and confessing them before the LORD, and being willing to desist from
them, and thus doing the act of repentance; this man ought to do as from himself, 
because he is not sensible that he does any thing from the LORD; and this has been 
given to man, because conjunction, in order to be conjunction, must be reciprocal, of 
man with the LORD, and of the LORD with man: so far therefore as evils with their 
delights are thus removed, so far the love of the LORD enters, which, as was said, is 
universal towards all, and in such case man is withdrawn from hell, and brought into 
heaven. AR 937.

16:9, Exposition.

Verse 21. Holy name; see Psalm 79:9, Exposition.

PSALM 146

1. HALLELUJAH! O my soul, praise JEHOVAH.

I will praise JEHOVAH while I live, I will sing praises to my GOD while I have 
my being.

3. Place not your trust in princes, in the son of man, with whom there is no

5. Happy is he who has the GOD of Jacob for his help, whose hope is in JEHOVAH 

his GOD.

JEHOVAH looses the prisoners.
JEHOVAH opens the eyes of the blind; JEHOVAH raises them that are bowed 
down; JEHOVAH loves the just.
JEHOVAH preserves the strangers; he supports the orphan and the widow; but 
makes crooked the way of the wicked.

10. JEHOVAH shall reign for ever! Your GOD, O Zion, through all generations! 

HALLELUJAH!

The Internal Sense

Celebration of the LORD, verses 1, 2; that man of himself is nothing, verses 3, 4; that 
he is blessed who trusts in the LORD, who is the GOD of heaven and earth, verses 5, 6; 
who teaches and leads all who are in falsities from ignorance, and desire truths, verses
7 to 9; that he reigns to eternity, verse 10.

EXPOSITION

Verse 3. Place not your trust in princes, in the son of man, with whom there is no 
salvation. As most expressions in the Word have also an opposite sense, so likewise is
the signification of the son of man, which in that sense, denotes the false opposite to 
truths, as in Isaiah, "What are you, that you are afraid of man, he dies, and of the son 
of man, to whom grass is given," Isaiah 51:12; where grass given to the son of man, 
denotes the scientific principle, productive of what is false; and in David, "Place not 
your trust in princes, in the son of man, with whom there is no salvation," Psalm 
146:3; princes denote primary truths, AC 2085, 5044; thus in the opposite sense, 
primary falsities, and the son of man is the false itself. AC 9807.

Verse 4. He returns to his earth, [or ground.] That by returning to the ground from 
whence he was taken, is signified that the church should return to the external man, 
such as it was before regeneration, is evident from this circumstance, that the ground 
signifies the external man, as was said above; and that dust signifies what is damned 
and infernal, is plain also from what was said of the serpent, who in consequence of 
being cursed, is warned that he should eat dust. To what was there said of the 

486

signification of dust, may be added the following passages from David: "All they that 
go down to the dust shall bow before JEHOVAH, and they whose souls he has not 
quickened," Psalm 22:29; and in another place, "You hide your face, they are 
troubled; you take away their breath, they die, and return to their dust," Psalm 104:29;
as is the case when men turn themselves from the face of the LORD, they then expire 
or die, and thus return to dust, that is, become damned and infernal. AC 278.

Verse 7. Who executes judgement for the oppressed; who gives bread to the hungry; 
JEHOVAH looses the prisoners. By the oppressed are here understood those who are in 
falsities from ignorance, the oppression which they suffer is from spirits who are in 
falsities, wherefore it is said, JEHOVAH executes judgement for them, which is to 
vindicate them from those that oppress; by the hungry are understood those who 
desire goods, and inasmuch as the LORD nourishes them, it is said, JEHOVAH gives 
bread to the hungry, to give bread denotes to nourish, and spiritual nourishment is 
science, intelligence, and wisdom; by the prisoners, or bound, are understood those 
who desire truths, but are detained from them by the falsities of doctrine, or by 
ignorance, in consequence of not having the Word, wherefore to loose denotes to 
liberate them; that such are called bound may be seen, AC 5037. AE 386.

Verses 7, 8. JEHOVAH looses the prisoners, or bound; JEHOVAH opens the eyes of the 
blind. They are called bound who are in falsities, and desire to be loosed from them; 
the blind are they who thence are not in the understanding of truth, to open their eyes 
is to make them understand. AE 239.

Verse 8. JEHOVAH loves the just; see Psalm 145:20, Exposition.

Verse 9. He supports the orphan and the widow; see Psalm 10:14, 18, Exposition.

487

PSALM 147

1. HALLELUJAH! Truly, it is good to sing praises to our GOD! Truly, it is 

delightful! Yea, praise is becoming.
JEHOVAH builds Jerusalem! He gathers together the outcasts of Israel.

2.
3. He heals the broken in heart; and binds up their wounds.
4. He counts the number of the stars, he calls them all by their names.
5. Great is our Lord, and of great power; his understanding is infinite!
6.

JEHOVAH raises up the meek, he brings low the wicked, even down to the 
ground.

7. Sing to JEHOVAH with thanksgiving; sing praise to our GOD with the harp!
8. He covers the heavens with clouds, he prepares rain for the earth, he causes 

grass to grow upon the mountains.

9. He gives to the cattle their food, to the sons of the raven which cry.
10. He delights not in the strength of a horse, he takes no pleasure in the legs of 

man.

11. The good pleasure of JEHOVAH is in those who fear him, in those who hope in 

his mercy.

12. Praise JEHOVAH, O Jerusalem; praise your GOD, O Zion!
13. For he strengthened the bars of your gates; he blesses your sons within you.
14. He establishes peace in your borders, he fills you with the fatness of wheat,
15. He sends forth his command upon the earth; his word runs very swiftly.
16. He gives snow like wool; he scatters abroad the hoar frost like ashes.
17. He casteth forth his hail like balls! Before his cold who can stand?
18. He sends forth his word and melts them; he causes his wind to blow, and the 

waters flow.

19. He declares his words to Jacob, his statutes and judgements to Israel.
20. He has not dealt thus with any nation, nor do they know his judgements. 

HALLELUJAH!

The Internal Sense

Celebration of the LORD by his church, verses 1, 2, 7; who reforms by the knowledges
of truth, verses 3, 4; who alone is able to do this, verse 5; who teaches those who are 
in ignorance truths, verses 6, 8, 9; that self-intelligence is nothing, but only that which
is from him, verses 10, 11; that the church will worship the LORD, who protects it, and
teaches it the Word, verses 12 to 15; that he removes ignorance thereby, verses 16 to 
18; that he performs these things for his church, verses 19, 20.

EXPOSITION

Verse 1. HALLELUJAH, praise JAH; see Psalm 68:4, Exposition.

Verse 2. JEHOVAH builds Jerusalem; see Psalm 127:1, Exposition.

488

 
Verse 3. He heals the broken in heart, and binds up their wounds. Concerning 
temptations, and consolations afterwards, see Psalm lxxxviii. Exposition.

Verse 4. He counts the number of the stars, he calls them all by their names. That by 
numbering in this passage is signified to ordain and to arrange, is evident, for the 
subject treated of is concerning JEHOVAH, that is, the LORD, who does not number any 
army or stars, but ordains and arranges those things which are signified by an army or
host, and by stars, which are the truths and goods of faith and of love; for the subject 
treated of is not concerning wars in the natural world, but concerning wars in the 
spiritual world, which are wars or combats of truths derived from good against 
falsities derived from evil; that wars in the spiritual sense are such combats, see AC 
1664, 8295; that an army denotes the truths and goods of the church and of heaven,

10217.

Verses 8, 9. He prepares rain for the earth, he causes grass to grow upon the 
mountains; he gives to the cattle their food, to the sons of the raven which cry. The 
things here mentioned also signify spiritual things belonging to heaven and the 
church: to what purpose would it be for the Word, which is given for the sole purpose 
of leading man in the way to heaven, by teaching him the truths of faith and goods of 
love, to say that JEHOVAH prepares rain for the earth, he causes grass to grow upon 
the mountains, he gives to the cattle their food, to the sons of the raven which cry; 
these things, however, are worthy of the divine Word, when by rain is understood the 
influx of Divine truth, by mountains the good of love, by causing grass to grow, the 
instruction of the natural man by knowledges from the Word, by cattle the affections 
of the natural man, which desire to be thence nourished, which nourishment is 
signified by giving them food, and when by the sons of the raven, also are signified 
natural men who are in a dark lumen arising from fallacies concerning truth Divine, as
were many of the gentiles or nations, wherefore it is said, that he gives food to the 
sons of the raven which cry, for these can call upon JEHOVAH, but not the sons of the 
raven. AE 650.

Verse 10. He delights not in the strength of a horse, he takes no pleasure in the legs of
man. By the strength of a horse with which JEHOVAH is not delighted, are signified all 
things which are from self-derived intelligence, from which are mere falsities, and by 
the legs of man [viri] are signified what are from self-will, from which are mere evils. 
AE 355.

Verse 11. The good pleasure of JEHOVAH is in those who fear him, in those who hope 
in his mercy. Inasmuch as the fear of JEHOVAH signifies the reception of Divine truth, 
and mercy the reception of Divine good, therefore it is said, that "The good pleasure 
of JEHOVAH is in those who fear him, in those who hope in his mercy." AE 696.

Verse 13. The bars of your gates; see Psalm 27:5, Exposition.

Verse 14. Fatness of wheat; see Psalm 81:16, Exposition.

Verses 15, 16. He sends forth his command upon the earth, he gives snow like wool. 
Because wool signifies good in ultimates, therefore good is sometimes described in 
the Word by wool, and truth by linen and by snow. The reason why white wool 

489

signifies good in ultimates, is because the wool upon lambs and sheep has a similar 
signification with the hair upon man, and lambs and sheep signify good, lambs 
celestial good, see AC 3519, and sheep spiritual good, AC 4169; hence it is that the 
hairs, by which is signified Divine truth in ultimates, are said to be bright, white as 
wool, and as snow; as also concerning the LORD when he was transfigured, "His 
garments were glistering, exceeding bright as snow, such as no fuller on earth can 
whiten." AE 67.

Verses 17, 18, 19. He casteth forth his hail like balls! Before his cold who can stand? 
He sends forth his Word and melts them; he causes his wind to blow, and the waters 
flow; he declares his Word to Jacob, his statutes and judgements to Israel. By these 
words also is described reformation, but as to the natural man; the scientifics which 
are in that man, and the knowledges which appertain to man before reformation, are 
signified by the hail which is like balls, who can stand before his cold; for man before
reformation is altogether cold, and that cold is, also manifestly felt when the Divine 
principle flows in out of heaven. Inasmuch as that cold is dissipated by the reception 
of Divine Good and Divine Truth, thus by reformation, it is therefore said, he sends 
forth his Word and melts them; he causes his wind to blow, and the waters flow; by 
the Word is signified Divine Good united with Divine Truth, by the wind is signified 
Divine Truth, and by the waters flowing is signified the reception of truth; and by 
reason of this signification of those words, it is added, he declares his Words to Jacob,
his statutes and his judgements to Israel, Jacob and Israel signifying the church, the 
former the church which is principled in good, the latter the church principled in 
truths, and statutes and judgements denote external and internal truths, which are from
good. AE 419.

PSALM 148

1. HALLELUJAH! Praise JEHOVAH from the heavens: praise him in the heights.
2. Praise him, all you his angels: praise him, all you his hosts.
3. Praise him, sun and moon: praise him, all you stars of light.
4. Praise him, you heavens of heavens, and you waters which are above the 

heavens.

5. Let them praise the name of JEHOVAH, for he commanded, and they were 

created.

6. He has established them for ever and ever; he has given a decree which shall 

not pass away.

7. Praise JEHOVAH from the earth, you whales, and all deeps.
8. You fire, and hail; you snow, and vapour; you stormy wind doing his word.
9. You mountains, and all hills; you trees bearing fruit, and all cedars.
10. You beasts, and all cattle; you creeping things, and winged birds.
11. You kings of the earth, and all peoples; you princes, and all judges of the 

earth.

12. Both young men and maidservants; old men and children.
13. Let them praise the name of JEHOVAH, for his name alone is exalted; his glory 

is above earth and heaven.

14. He exalts the horn of his people,—the praise of all his saints,—of the sons of 

Israel,—of the people who is near to him! HALLELUJAH!

The Internal Sense

All in the heavens and on earth are exhorted to worship the LORD, from the goods and 
truths which are from him, verses 1 to 6; also all who are in the ultimates of heaven 
and the church, from truths and goods of every kind, verses 7 to 10; in general, from 
the understanding and will of truth and good, verses 11, 12; because salvation is by 
those things which he gives, verses 13, 14.

EXPOSITION

Verses 2, 3, 4. Praise JEHOVAH, all you his angels: praise him, all you his hosts; 
praise him, sun and moon: praise him, all you stars of light; praise him, you heavens 
of heavens. By praising JEHOVAH is signified to worship him; by the angels are 
signified those who are in Divine truths from the good of love, for all such are angels;
by all his hosts are signified goods and truths in all their complex, by the sun and 
moon are signified the good of love, and the truth from that good; by the stars of light
are signified the knowledges of truth from good; by the heavens of heavens are 
signified goods and truths both internal and external: inasmuch as man worships the 
LORD" from those things which are in him from the LORD, thus from the goods and 
truths which are in him, and as it is by virtue of these that man is man, it is therefore 
said to such things, namely to the sun, moon, and stars, by which are signified goods 
and truths, that they shall praise, that is, worship JEHOVAH; who does not know that 
this cannot be said to the sun, moon, and stars, that is, that they should worship 
JEHOVAH? For how can such things offer praise or worship? AE 401.

491

Verse 4. Praise him, you heavens of heavens, and you waters which are above the 
heavens. Inasmuch as it is not yet known, that waters in the Word signify the truths of 
faith and the knowledges of truth, perhaps by reason of its appearing so remote, I am 
desirous here briefly to show, that such things are understood by waters in the Word, 
which also is necessary, because without the knowledge of the signification of waters,
it cannot be known what is signified by baptism, nor what by the washings in the 
Israelitish church, of which mention is so frequently made. Waters signify the truths 
of faith, because bread signifies the good of love; the reason why waters and bread 
have such a signification is because the things which appertain to spiritual 
nourishment are expressed in the sense of the letter, by such things as appertain to 
natural nourishment; for waters and bread, by which are meant all drink and all food 
in general, nourish the body, and the truths of faith and the good of love, nourish the 
soul; this is also from correspondence, for when bread and water are read in the Word,
the angels, as being spiritual, understand those things which nourish them, which are 
the goods of love, and the truths of faith. But some passages shall be here adduced, 
from which it may be known that waters signify the truths of faith, likewise the 
knowledges of truth: as in Isaiah, "Then shall you draw waters with gladness from the
fountains of salvation;" and again, "I will pour out waters upon the thirsty, and floods 
upon the dry; I will pour out my spirit upon your seed, and my blessing upon your 
offspring." AE 71.

Verses 7, 10. Praise JEHOVAH from the earth, you whales, and all deeps; you beasts, 
and all cattle; you creeping things, and winged birds. In this Psalm, the things which 
shall praise JEHOVAH are enumerated by various things which are without life in the 
world, as fire, hail, snow, vapour, stormy wind, mountains, hills, trees, fruits, cedars: 
likewise as in this case, by beasts, cattle, creeping things, and birds, which things 
themselves cannot praise JEHOVAH; who cannot see therefore, that to recount such 
things in the Divine Word would be vain and superfluous, unless they were 
significative of such things in man as can praise, that is, worship JEHOVAH; from the 
science of correspondences it is known, that whales signify the scientifics of the 
natural man in general; abysses or deeps, and seas, the natural principle itself, where 
scientifics are; beasts and cattle, the affections of the natural man, both of his 
understanding and of his will; creeping things, the sensual principle, which is the 
ultimate of the natural man; and winged birds, the cogitative principle thence derived. 
AE 650.

Verse 8. Praise JEHOVAH, you fire, and hail; you snow and vapour; you stormy wind 
doing his word. That by these expressions, something more is signified than what 
appears in the letter is evident; for to what purpose could it be to say in the Divine 
Word, that such things should praise JEHOVAH? But by fire and hail, and by snow and 
vapour, are signified the delights of the loves of the natural man, and his scientifics 
and knowledges, for these things are fire and hail, and snow and vapour, before man is
regenerated and made spiritual, the sphere of their life, when it flows out from them, 
presenting such things in the spiritual world, and the worship of the LORD from those 
things, is signified by their praising JEHOVAH, to praise denoting to worship; but by 
the stormy wind is signified Divine truth as to reception, wherefore it is said, stormy 
wind doing his Word, to do his Word denoting to receive into the life the things which 
are of doctrine. AE 419.

492

Verses 9, 10. You trees bearing fruit, and all cedars; you beasts, and all cattle; you 
creeping things, and winged birds, praise the name of JEHOVAH. Trees bearing fruit, 
denote the celestial man, the cedar, the spiritual man; beast, cattle, and creeping 
things, the goods of the celestial and spiritual man, and the winged birds, the 
corresponding truths from which man can praise the name of JEHOVAH; since it is 
plainly impossible that beasts, cattle, creeping things, and winged birds can praise 
JEHOVAH; in profane writings such expressions may be called hyperbolical, but in the 
Word of the LORD nothing is hyperbolical, but every thing is significative and 
representative. AC 776.

Verse 10. Let them praise the name of JEHOVAH,—beast, and all cattle; creeping 
things, and winged birds. That birds signify such things as appertain to the thought of 
man, as well spiritual as infernal, thus both truths and falsities, for these appertain to 
thought, is from correspondence, appears from the birds seen in the spiritual world, 
where all things which appear before the eyes, and before the rest of the senses, are 
correspondences; in that world there appear animals of the earth of every kind, and 
also birds of the heaven, as well beautiful as unbeautiful, and they appear from the 
affections and thoughts of the angels and spirits, the animals from the affections, and 
birds from the thoughts: that they are correspondences is known to all there, who also 
know to what affections and thoughts they correspond; that they correspond to 
affections and thoughts, is made to appear manifestly, inasmuch as when the spirit or 
angel departs, or ceases to think upon the things to which they correspond, they are 
dissipated in a moment: inasmuch as birds are correspondences of the thoughts as 
well rational as not rational, thus both of truths and falsities, therefore the same are 
signified by them in the Word, for all things of the Word are correspondences. That 
birds signify thoughts which are derived from truths, as well rational as spiritual, may 
appear in the following passages: thus in David, "Let them praise the name of 
JEHOVAH, you beasts, and all cattle; you creeping things, and winged birds" Psalm 
cxlviii, 10; that by beast and all cattle are signified the affections of the natural man, 
both of truth and good, and, in the opposite sense, the cupidities of what is false and 
evil, may be seen above, AE 552, 650, 781; hence by winged birds are signified 
thoughts, and on this account it is that it is said, that they shall praise the name of 
JEHOVAH, for it is man who must praise from his affections and thoughts, thus from 
goods and truths; and in Hosea, "I will make for them a covenant in that day with the 
wild beast of the field, and with the bird of the heavens, and the creeping things out of
the earth; and the bow, and the sword, and the war, will I break off the earth," Hos 
2:18; treating concerning the advent of the LORD, and concerning heaven and the 
church from him: by in that day is understood the LORD'S coming; by the covenant 
which he will then make, is understood conjunction with those who believe in him; 
hence by the wild beast of the field, and the bird of the heavens, cannot be signified 
wild beasts and birds, but those things to which they correspond, which are the 
affections of good and of truth, and the thoughts thence derived; that in such case 
there shall be no infestation from falsities and evils from hell, is signified the bow, the
sword, and the war being broken out of the earth. AE 1100.

Verse 10. Creeping things; see Psalm 69:34, Exposition.

Verse 14. He exalts the horn of his people,—the praise of all his saints,—of the sons 
of Israel,—of the people who is near to him. By he has exalted the horn of his people,
is signified that he has filled them with Divine truths, wherefore it is said, the praise 

493

of all his saints,—of the sons of Israel,—and of the people who is near to him, for 
they are called saints who are in Divine truths, inasmuch as the Divine truth is what is
called holy, as may be seen above, AE 204; Israel denotes the church which is in 
truths, the sons thereof are truths, people is also predicated of those who are in truths, 
and they are said to he near to him who are thereby conjoined to the LORD. AE 316. 

Verse 14. Near to him; see Psalm 145:18, Exposition.

494

PSALM 149

1. HALLELUJAH! Sing to JEHOVAH a new song, sing his praise in the congregation

of the saints.

2. Let Israel rejoice in his Maker; let the sons of Zion exult in their King.
3. Let them praise his name in the dance; with timbrel and harp let them sing 

praises to him.

4. For JEHOVAH takes delight in his people; he adorns the meek with salvation.
5. Let the saints be joyful in glory; let them sing aloud upon their beds;
6. Let the high praises of GOD be in their mouth, and a two-edged sword in their 

hand;

7. To execute vengeance upon the nations, and punishments upon the peoples;
8. To bind their kings with chains, and their nobles with fetters of iron.
9. To execute upon them the judgement written; He is the honour to all his saints:

HALLELUJAH!

The Internal Sense

That the LORD is to be worshiped from the affection of truth and good, because he 
loves them, verses 1—4; inasmuch as they have Divine Truth, verses 5, 6; whereby 
the hells are restrained, verses 7—9.

Exposition

Verses 1, 2, 3. Sing to JEHOVAH a new song, sing his praise in the congregation of the 
saints. Let Israel rejoice in his Maker; let the sons of Zion exult in their King; let them
praise his name in the dance; with timbrel and harp let them sing praises to him. 
Again in Isaiah, "Sing to JEHOVAH a new song, his praise from the extremity of the 
earth, let the wilderness and the cities thereof lift up the voice," Isaiah 42:10; and 
again, "Sing, O you heavens, because JEHOVAH has done it, jubilate your lower parts 
of the earth, cry aloud, you mountains, with singing, O forest, and every tree therein, 
because JEHOVAH has redeemed Jacob, and has exhibited himself glorious in Israel," 
Isaiah 49:23; 49:13. The subject treated of in these passages is concerning the LORD, 
his advent and salvation by him; and because these things were about to come, 
therefore mention is made of a new song; the joy thence arising is described not only 
by singing, playing, making a loud noise, jubilating, clapping, but also by various 
musical instruments, whose sounds are in agreement therewith; it is likewise said that 
the rivers, the sea, the forest, the field, the trees therein, Libanus, the wilderness, the 
mountains, etc. should rejoice, exult, jubilate, sing, clap their hands, and cry aloud 
together; the reason why similar things are predicated of those objects is because they 
signify such things as appertain to the church, and consequently such as appertain to 
the man of the church; the rivers, things belonging to intelligence, the sea, things 
belonging to science, which are in agreement with truths and goods, the field, the 
good of the church, forests, the truths of the natural man, the trees, knowledges, 
Libanus, good and truth spiritual, the wilderness, the desire of truth that good may be 
thence attained, and the mountains, the goods of love: all these things are said to sing, 
to make a loud noise, to jubilate, to cry aloud, and clap the hands, when they are 

495

derived from heaven, for then celestial joy is in them, and thereby in man: for man is 
not in celestial joy, unless the truths and goods which are with him, are derived from 
heaven, the joy of the heart, which is truly joy being from there, and consequently the 
joy of the man with whom these things are; from these considerations it may appear 
why the like is predicated concerning them as concerning man, namely, because joy is
in them and thereby in man; such joy is in every spiritual and celestial good, and 
thence in those with whom those goods are; for heaven flows in with its joy, that is the
LORD through heaven, into the goods and thence into the truths which are from him 
with man, and thereby into the man and not into the man deprived of them, or void; 
those goods and the truths thence derived, are what exult, jubilate, make a loud noise, 
sing, play, and thus rejoice by virtue of influx out of heaven, and thence cause the 
same in the heart of man. AE 326.

Verse 4. He adorns the meek with salvation. The meek signify those who are in the 
good of charity. AE 304.

Verse 5. Let them sing aloud upon their beds. For the signification of bed, see Psalm 
63:6, Exposition.

Verse 6. And a two-edged sword in their hand. By a sword in the above passage is 
signified truth, combating, and destroying; this destruction especially appears in the 
spiritual world, where they who are in falsities cannot sustain the truth, but are in a 
state of anguish, as if they struggled with death, when they come into the sphere of 
light, that is, into the sphere of Divine Truth, and thus also they are deprived of truths,
and vastated. As most expressions in the Word have an opposite sense, so likewise has
the sword, and in that sense it signifies the false combating against truth, and 
destroying it. AE 131.

496

PSALM 150

1. HALLELUJAH! Praise GOD in his sanctuary; praise him in the firmament of his 

power;

2. Praise him for his mighty deeds; praise him according to his abundant 

greatness;

3. Praise him with the sound of the trumpet; praise him with the psaltery and 

harp;

4. Praise him with the timbrel and dance; praise him with stringed instruments 

and organs;

5. Praise him with the soft cymbals; praise him with the loud cymbals;
6. Let every thing that has breath praise JAH! HALLELUJAH!

The Internal Sense

That the LORD is to be worshiped, because he is omnipotent, verses 1, 2; that he is to 
be worshiped from every affection of good and truth, verses 3 to 6.

Exposition

Verses 1, 6. Hallelujah, praise Jah; see Psalm 68:4, Exposition.

Verse 1. Praise him in the firmament, or expanse, of his power. The internal man is 
called an expanse; the knowledges which are in the internal man are called the waters 
above the expanse, and the scientifics belonging to the external man are called the 
waters beneath the expanse. Man, before he is regenerated, does not even know that 
any internal man exists, much less does be know the nature and quality thereof, in 
consequence of his immersion in corporeal and worldly things, he cannot conceive 
there is any distinction between the internal and external man: and the things of the 
internal man being lost in the same immersion, he forms one obscure confused mass, 
out of two substances that are totally distinct, wherefore it is first said, Let there be an 
expanse in the midst of the waters; and further, Let it distinguish between the waters 
to the waters, but not distinguish the waters between the waters; as it is said 
afterwards in the next verses, "And GOD made the expanse, and divided between the 
waters which were under the expanse, and between the waters which were above the 
expanse: and it was so; and GOD called the expanse heaven," Gen 1:7, 8. The next 
thing therefore which man observes in the course of regeneration is, that he begins to 
know there is an internal man, or that the things which are in the internal man are 
goodnesses and truths which are of the LORD alone: and whereas the external man, 
when he is regenerating, is of such a nature, that he still supposes the good things 
which he does to be done of himself, and the truths which he speaks to be spoken of 
himself, and whereas, being such, he is led of the LORD, as by somewhat of the things 
of his proprium, to do good and to speak truth, therefore mention is first made of a 
distinction relating to the waters under the expanse, and afterwards of that relating to 
the waters above the expanse. It is also an arcanum of heaven, that man, by the things 
of his proprium, as well the fallacies of the senses as the sensual lusts, is led and 
inclined of the LORD to the things which are good and true, and thus that all and every 

497

moment of regeneration proceeds from evening to morning, as from the external man 
to the internal, or from earth to heaven; wherefore now the expanse, or internal man, 
is called heaven. AC 24.

Verses 2, 3, 4. See Psalm 149:1, 2, 3, Exposition.

Verse 4. Praise him with the timbrel and dance. That hereby is signified celebration 
from joy and gladness, appears from the signification of timbrel, as being predicated 
of the affection of spiritual good, or of the good of truth, and as signifying its delight 
or joy, see just above, AC 8337; and from the signification of dance, as being 
predicated of the affection of spiritual truth, and as signifying its pleasantness or 
gladness, of which we shall speak presently. In ancient times gladness of heart was 
testified not only by musical instruments and by singing, but also by dances; for joys 
of the heart, or interior joys in the body, burst forth into various acts, as into singing, 
and also into dances: and whereas in ancient times the gladnesses, which excelled all 
others, were spiritual gladnesses, that is, were derived from the affections of spiritual 
loves, which were those of good and truth, therefore also it was at that time allowed to
adjoin dances to songs and musical harmonies, and thus likewise by these methods to 
testify joy: hence it is that dances are mentioned in the Word, and thereby are 
signified the gladnesses of the affections of truth or faith derived from good or 
charity; as in Jeremiah, "Again you shall adorn your timbrels, and shall go forth into 
the dances of them that sport. Their soul shall become as a watered garden, and they 
shall not sorrow any more, then shall the virgin be glad in the dance, both young men 
and old together," Jer 31:4, 12, 13; again, "The joy of our heart shall cease, our dance 
has been turned into mourning," Lam 5:15; and in David, "You have turned my 
mourning into dancing," Psalm 30:11; again, "Let them praise his name in the dance, 
with timbrel and harp let them play to him," Psalm 149:3, 150:4. AC 8339.
