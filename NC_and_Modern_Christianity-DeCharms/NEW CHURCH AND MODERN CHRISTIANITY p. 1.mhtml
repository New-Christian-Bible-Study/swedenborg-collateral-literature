</p><p>PREFACE</p><p>In substance, what appears in the folio wing pages was=
 presented as a series of lectures to the Bryn Athyn Church in the spring o=
f 1949. The original manuscript has been revised and adapted to publication=
 in book form, with the addition of one or two quotations from more modern =
sources to bring the treatment up to date.</p><p>The work is designed to br=
ing before the members of the New Church the teaching of the Theological Wr=
itings of Emanuel Swedenborg concerning the state of the Christian world, a=
nd to show that that teaching is by no means obsolete, but applies with equ=
al force, though in a somewhat modified form, to our own day and time.</p><=
p>If what is here presented serves to bring into sharp outline and relief t=
he basic difference between the religious faith of the New Church and that =
of the modern Christian world it will have accomplished the purpose for whi=
ch it has been written. </p><p>GEORGE DE CHARMS, </p><p>Bryn Athyn, Pa. </p=

</p><p>CHAPTER I</p><p>THE STATE OF THE MODERN CHRISTIAN WORLD</p><p>Intell=
igent Newchurchmanship demands some definite and reliable insight into the =
state of the Christian world in the midst of which we live. Such insight ca=
n be derived only from Divine revelation. We are therefore profoundly impre=
ssed with the importance of the teaching given on this subject in the Theol=
ogical Writings of Emanuel Swedenborg.</p><p>Some have held that what Swede=
nborg wrote in the eighteenth century no longer applies. It is true that ma=
ny of the doctrines against which he inveighed have been openly repudiated,=
 or neglected as irrelevant, or reinterpreted in more modern terms by the p=
resent-day leaders of Christian thought. The Writings of Swedenborg have be=
en widely distributed. Many of the ministers and teachers of the Christian =
churches are quite familiar with them. In subtle but striking ways they hav=
e affected the interpretation of Christian doctrine. There is a strong appe=
arance that the Christian world has been drawing progressively closer to th=
e basic concepts of the New Church. </p><p></p><div align=3D"Right">11</div=

</p><p>
 This fact makes it all the more imperative that the fundamental difference=
 between the New Church and the sects of modern Christianity should be clea=
rly seen.</p><p>Because the state of the Christian Church does change, the =
teaching of the Writings must he examined anew by the men of every rising g=
eneration, in order that it may be seen in its relation to their own day. M=
odes of expressing that relation which were valid in the past tend to lose =
their meaning, and to leave the mind uncertain and confused. Yet no one can=
 truly understand the teaching of the New Church without seeing clearly how=
 it differs from the religious teaching of other Christian churches. Nor is=
 this as simple as might be supposed, because in outward form the two often=
 appear to be very much alike. When we tell others what our church teaches,=
 they often say: That is what we also believe. Yet the truth is that they d=
o not really understand what we mean, and it is frequently difficult to mak=
e our meaning clear.</p><p>The truth is that we can have no distinct unders=
tanding of anything in the world apart from comparison and contrast. Any ob=
ject, to be seen, must stand out against a background. It must have definit=
e boundaries marking it off from its surroundings. It must possess shape, f=
orm and color to distinguish it from other objects. </p><p></p><div align=

 It must differ from other objects in substance, structure and organization=
. Only by these things taken together, compared, and contrasted with simila=
r qualities in other objects, can we perceive the special quality of any th=
ing, or appreciate its particular use and value. It is in this way that we =
distinguish a chair from a table, a house from a barn, an animal from a bir=
d, a mountain from a plain, or a man from a statue. Shades of color that ar=
e very similar must be seen together in order to be distinguished. Length a=
nd breadth, volume, weight, or time must be measured by comparison with the=
se characteristics as found in other things, or by reference to some recogn=
ized standard of measurement.</p><p>This same law applies to the perception=
 of abstract ideas. These, too, must be seen against a background of though=
t. Unless the mind has been prepared by experience, by education, or by spe=
cific instruction, to perceive them, ideas have no meaning whatever. They m=
ust be clearly defined, and thus set apart from other similar ideas. They m=
ust be distinguished, not only in form but also in substance. Love is the s=
ubstance of all spiritual things, while thought is their form. The love det=
ermines the purpose, the use, and the end behind the thought. It not only l=
ends color to the thought but deeply qualifies it. </p><p></p><div align=3D=

 Therefore, to see ally spiritual object clearly, we must know and perceive=
 the particular love from which it springs. We must perceive not only the s=
uperficial shape of the idea, the words by which it is expressed, but also =
its inner form and organization as this is produced and determined by love.=
 We must judge of an idea by comparing it with other ideas that may be simi=
larly expressed and yet are inwardly very different because directed to a t=
otally different purpose. Only in this way can we learn to appreciate the i=
ntrinsic value or the characteristic quality of any abstract idea. Nothing,=
 in fact, can be understood rationally all by itself. Rationality is the pe=
rception of relations, of similarities and differences that set things apar=
t from one another. A rational faith, therefore, is one that is seen in its=
 relation to other faiths; one that is understood because of its distinguis=
hing characteristics as these are clearly visualized.</p><p>For this reason=
 we can have no clear understanding of our own religion unless we see it in=
 its actual setting, in its relation to the world of religious ideas and me=
ntal attitudes in the midst of which it must exist and grow. We must see it=
 sharply defined against a background of contrasting spiritual form and col=
or, organization and substance. Only in this way can our adherence to it be=
 a matter of intelligent choice and preference. </p><p></p><div align=3D"Ri=

 We cannot otherwise be armed to defend it against the attacks of those who=
 oppose it. Nor can we be otherwise prepared to meet with sympathetic under=
standing those who, learning of the New Church for the first time, may be f=
avorably disposed toward it, and yet are troubled by many doubts and diffic=
ulties imposed by their traditional faith. More important still, without ac=
curate knowledge we cannot recognize the states and the attitudes of the mo=
dern Christian world as they arise in ourselves, for we are part of that wo=
rld. We are born into it, even though our parents and our grandparents may =
have belonged to the New Church. By heredity, through many generations, we =
are imbued with the same tendencies of thought and affection. For that reas=
on we are readily swayed by the currents of religious thought and emotion t=
hat are active in the world about us.</p><p>Although the need for wide know=
ledge, for careful investigation, and for discriminating judgment is well r=
ecognized in other fields of human learning, many fail to see the necessity=
 for it in the realm of religion. Most people deeply resent any criticism o=
f the faith they profess. We all are aware that unfavorable comment about a=
ny particular religion tends to rouse indignant protest, as implying an unc=
haritable attitude toward others. </p><p></p><div align=3D"Right">15</div><=

 There is widespread feeling that in regard to religious beliefs, compariso=
ns are odious. This is a half-truth which, when mistaken for the whole, bec=
omes a dangerous falsity. It is true of course that whatever is regarded by=
 another as sacred should be treated with deep respect and consideration. A=
 sincere faith implanted in childhood, however mistaken it may be, is the s=
eed from which alone spiritual life can spring. The history of religion dem=
onstrates with what infinite patience and profound tenderness these preciou=
s remains of affection and loyalty are protected by the Lord in His provide=
nce--this because they are the only means to mans individual salvation. We =
should therefore have the same concern for their protection, recognizing th=
at it is a sin to ridicule anothers faith or to detract from it by statemen=
ts that are false. On the other hand, if we are really searching for the tr=
uth of religion we must be willing to face the truth in any religion, inclu=
ding our own. We must be willing to examine religion itself, wherever it ma=
y be found, in the light of Divine revelation, and measure it thereby. We m=
ust learn to do this impersonally, without rancor, in no spirit of condemna=
tion, but solely from a love of truth. This is not only right, it is a posi=
tive duty; for otherwise, whatever our traditional faith may be, we will ne=
ver discover its defects. </p><p></p><div align=3D"Right">16</div><hr><p>

 Without examination, every one merely follows blindly what he has been tau=
ght or what he has formulated out of his own thinking. Ready satisfaction w=
ith any religion in which one may happen to have been brought up, or which =
seems to offer temporary advantages, without careful analysis, is one of th=
e greatest faults of modern Christianity. It is a symptom of indifference t=
o religious truth.</p><p>For this very reason, an attitude of critical anal=
ysis is pre-eminently important at this time when the Lord has come with a =
new Divine revelation. In this new truth lies the only hope for the ultimat=
e redemption of the human race. If the New Church is ever to be established=
 widely among the nations of the earth, men must be roused to a realization=
 that the prime requisite of a genuine religious faith is the love of spiri=
tual truth, and an irresistible urge to discover it. By spiritual truth we =
mean the truth concerning God, concerning the life after death, and concern=
ing the primal causes that lie behind all the phenomena of the material uni=
verse. It is not enough to probe outer space or to delve into the microscop=
ic and submicroscopic worlds. It is imperative that we learn where this phy=
sical environment came from, how it was first created, how it is constantly=
 preserved and renewed, and for what Divine purpose it is intended. </p><p>=

 Lacking this, our knowledge will have no power to uplift and save. And for=
 this deeper knowledge we are dependent upon Divine revelation. Because thi=
s knowledge is desperately needed, the Lord has brought it within our grasp=
. The love of spiritual truth leads us to the Writings, where alone the ans=
wer to our anxious questioning may be found. But if we are to live our fait=
h, it leads us also to seek a correct idea of the world of nature, for here=
 it is that religious truth must be applied to life, in daily association w=
ith those of other faiths. </p><p>We must, then, examine the state of moder=
n Christianity. But how can we do so when we are clearly taught that the in=
terior states of men and of churches lie too deep for human discovery, and =
can be known only to the Lord?</p><p>We can judge the states of men only su=
perficially, as they are reflected in external speech and action, in forms =
of worship and modes of life, and in outward professions of faith. These ma=
y be extremely deceptive. They may be quite contrary to the deeper states o=

 It has been revealed for our instruction in the Heavenly Doctrine. Yet, as=
 we have noted, many have held that this revelation is applicable only to t=
he state of Christianity as it existed in Swedenborgs day. It is obvious th=
at radical changes have taken place since that time in the ideas of Christi=
ans concerning their own religion. Among the more learned, many of the medi=
eval doctrines have been either reinterpreted or discarded altogether. Cert=
ainly, violent insistence upon sectarian creeds is no longer the dominant t=
emper of the times. This has given place to an ever-increasing emphasis upo=
n mutual tolerance. Also, the doctrine of salvation by faith alone, against=
 which the Writings speak so vehemently, has been superseded largely by a p=
rimary concern for the good of life. How, then, can it be said that the Wri=
tings give us a true picture of the state of the Christian world as it exis=
ts today?</p><p>In answer to this we would point out that the Writings are =
more than the work of the man Swedenborg. They are, in truth, a Divine reve=
lation immediately from the Lord. Because of this they are not written mere=
ly for one generation, but contain a truth that is eternal. What they say a=
bout the state of the Christian Church must apply to that church not only a=
s it existed in Swedenborgs day but equally to the states of that church wh=
ich it was foreseen would inevitably follow. </p><p></p><div align=3D"Right=

 As the states of the world change in process of time, our understanding of=
 the Writings must also progress. The Writings are eternal, but our underst=
anding of them is limited, both by our individual capacity and by the times=
 in which we live. This human understanding must be modified continually if=
 we are to see the application of the Writings to the ever-changing states =
of the world, and of the church. For this reason our accustomed ideas conce=
rning the state of the Christian Church must be re-examined, and reappraise=
d periodically. The statements our fathers adopted to describe it may, in f=
act, be out of date. The analysis of it preserved for us in that first grea=
t publication of the Academy, WORDS FOR THE NEW CHURCH, does unquestionably=
 need some revision today. To say this is not in any way to invalidate the =
Divine teaching so carefully studied and so accurately quoted in that publi=
cation. Nevertheless, we must endeavor to see the teaching of the Writings =
on the subject of the state of the Christian Church, as on every other subj=
ect, in direct application to the world of our own day.</p><p>Furthermore, =
it is obvious to any candid observer that while there have been noticeable =
modifications of view in deference to the advance of scientific knowledge, =
the basic doctrines of the Christian Church have not changed in the least s=
ince Swedenborgs time. </p><p></p><div align=3D"Right">20</div><hr><p>

 In spite of a shift in emphasis, a large percentage of present-day Christi=
ans affirm the fundamental creeds as confidently as ever. This applies espe=
cially to the less educated, who hold to their traditional concepts with a =
blind allegiance born of deep affectional ties. An increasing number, it is=
 true, have forsaken the old doctrines. They are completely ignored by many=
; hut nothing is put in their place. A positive knowledge of God, of heaven=
, of the life after death, and of all that transcends the material universe=
 is admittedly lacking. Moral philosophy has arisen to fill the vacuum left=
 by religious ideas that are no longer acceptable to the educated mind. Yet=
 whatever of Christian faith has survived the intervening centuries is in n=
o essential way different from that faith of which the Writings speak. The =
difference lies in the fact that these doctrines are so widely by-passed. M=
ost Christians no longer know what they are because they are not taught, ei=
ther from the pulpit or in Sunday school. When they are questioned about th=
em, the answer most frequently given is that they are a mystery into which =
it is not permissible to probe. </p><p></p><div align=3D"Right">21</div><hr=

 More and more they are being regarded as things unknowable which it is fru=
itless to explore--things no longer to be taken seriously in our more enlig=
htened age.</p><p>Our chief concern lies with that far-flung realm of prese=
nt-day religious philosophy wherein these doctrines still lie concealed und=
er new forms of thought and expression. We are concerned with the prevailin=
g temper of religious thinking as it subtly dominates our universities, per=
meates our schools, our books and magazines, the screen, radio and televisi=

y the opinions and the emotional impulses of those who constitute the socie=
ty in which we live. Such an inquiry must be made in no spirit of smug self=
-satisfaction, with no sense of superiority, and with no contempt for other=

 to understand the teaching of the Heavenly Doctrine in its application to =

</p><p>CHAPTER II</p><p>THE DIVINITY OF JESUS CHRIST [1]</p><p>In our attem=
pt to analyze the state of the modern Christian world we must remember, of =
course, that there are many shades of religious opinion, and there is great=
 variety as to ritual, government and modes of life in the Christian Church=
. No statement could be made, therefore, that would have universal applicat=
ion. But the state of the church, as defined in the Writings, is determined=
 by its dominant affection or love, and thus by the governing spirit that a=
nimates it and by the prevailing opinions that arise therefrom. In every ch=
urch, as in every individual mind, love determines the center of interest, =
and that which is regarded as of supreme importance. Upon this the whole at=
tention is focused, and with reference to it everything else is oriented. I=
deas, opinions, modes of action, all are so ordered as to satisfy this high=
est love and to accomplish its purpose. Therefore the key to the state of t=
he church lies in that upon which attention is most widely centered by thos=
e who are the accepted leaders of thought, the recognized authorities to wh=
om the generality of people look for guidance and direction. </p><p></p><di=

</p><p>Our question therefore is, has there been a significant shift in thi=
s center of interest in the Christian Church, especially since the days of =
the early Academy? If so, what is that change? How does it affect our under=
standing of what the Writings teach about the state of the Christian world?=
 And how does it modify the relation of the New Church to present-day Chris=
tianity?</p><p>We are told in the Heavenly Doctrine that there are three es=
sentials which together determine the quality of any religion. First, there=
 is the idea of God that prevails therein; second, there is the concept of =
Divine Law, or what God requires of man for his salvation; and third, there=
 is a life from conscience according to that which is regarded as the law o=
f God. With reference to the New Church, these three essentials are said to=
 be: the acknowledgment of the Divinity of the Lord Jesus Christ, the ackno=
wledgment of the holiness of the Word, and the life that is called charity,=
 which arises out of these prior acknowledgments.1 These, therefore, are th=
e things we would first examine, as they are found in modern Christianity, =
and we would begin by directing attention to the idea of God which is most =
prevalent therein.</p><p>1. DP 259 </p><p></p><div align=3D"Right">26</div>=

</p><p>There can be no doubt that the prevailing concept of God which is ch=
aracteristic of educated Christian leadership today is a far cry from the s=
imple faith of the Apostles, and of those who immediately followed them in =
the Primitive Church. The cornerstone of original Christian faith was a bel=
ief in the Divinity of Jesus Christ. By this was meant that in some mysteri=
ous way Jesus Christ was one with God Himself. The Apostles did not clearly=
 understand how this could be, but at first they did not reason about it. T=
hey accepted it as a self-evident truth, fully attested by the Lords own te=
aching, by His miraculous power, by His Divine conception, and by His resur=
rection. They believed implicitly in the testimony of Mary and of Joseph in=
 regard to the manner of His birth. Their discovery of the empty tomb, and =
their vision of the risen Lord convinced them beyond all doubt that He was =
indeed a Divine Being. They spoke of Him as the Son of God, but in all simp=
licity, they believed Him when He said: I and My Father are one.2 He that h=
ath seen Me hath seen the Father.3 I am in the Father, and the Father in Me=

of the day, and especially against the highly developed and widespread phil=
osophy of Greece, the Apostles and their followers had to search for some r=
ational explanation of this mystery. They were confronted by questions whic=
h were extremely difficult to answer. How could an all-wise Creator, the Ru=
ler of the universe, be born an ignorant babe who had to learn slowly by wa=
y of experience and instruction, as all children do? If He were one with th=
e Father, how could He pray to Him as if to another? How could God have suf=
fered on the cross? With these, and many similar questions, the church wres=

 Fantastic solutions were proposed, and dissident sects were founded upon t=
hem. Councils of church leaders were called to judge these heretical belief=
s, and to define the orthodox faith of the church. We cannot here enter int=
o all the theological subtleties whereby these leaders sought to defend the=
 Divinity of Jesus Christ. They have but little bearing upon the thought of=
 modern Christianity. Few, aside from special scholars and antiquarians, ev=
en know what they are. What we are concerned with is the outcome of the str=
uggle.</p><p>Failing in his own mind to reconcile the human limitations of =
Jesus Christ as He appeared on earth with the infinite qualities that must =
be ascribed to God, Arius, and later Socinius, cut the Gordian knot by fran=
kly denying that Jesus Christ was God. They held that He was altogether hum=
an, similar in all respects to other men, except that He was blessed with a=
 greater wisdom and a deeper insight than others. He was said to be Divinel=
y inspired; yet His inspiration differed from that of other men, not in kin=
d, but only in degree. Because He was a chosen instrument through whom the =
invisible God was made known more fully than ever before, He could be right=
ly called the Son of God; but this term would apply in lesser degree to eve=
ry prophet, every seer, and every religious leader in the history of the wo=
rld who had contributed in some measure to the perfection of mans thought c=

 This was the precursor of the modern Unitarian view.</p><p>The early churc=
h repudiated this denial of the Lords Divinity; and in the effort to overco=
me the philosophic difficulties involved in the acknowledgment of that Divi=
nity they reached the following conclusions at the Council of Nice in the y=
ear 325 A. D.:</p><p>a) There are three eternal and coequal Persons in the =
Godhead-the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Each of these by Himself =
is God, yet they are one in essence and in substance.</p><p>b) Jesus Christ=
 was the Son born from eternity who came into the world by a virgin birth. =
He had, however, two natures, one Divine and the other Human. It was the Hu=
man nature, and not the Divine one, that suffered on the cross.</p><p>c) Th=
is Human nature the Lord retained after His resurrection. Such is the faith=
 established by the Athanasian Creed, which is officially acknowledged by a=
ll Christian Churches to this day, both Catholic and Protestant. On it is b=
ased the doctrine of the vicarious atonement by the blood of Christ, and a =

 This idea of atonement by the sacrifice of the cross would be impossible a=
part from the concept of the Son as a person distinct from the Father. The =
creed of Athanasius, therefore, can never be reconciled with a mental pictu=
re of one God. Yet many people, even to the present day, accept it without =
analysis, still clinging to the thought that God is one. We are told it was=
 so written in Divine Providence that this might be so; and this creed was =
permitted to prevail over the doctrine of Arius in order that some belief i=
n the real Divinity of Jesus Christ might be preserved.</p><p>At the time o=
f Swedenborg the dominant thought of the church was focused upon this Trini=
tarian belief. This was the doctrine, taught everywhere as orthodox Christi=
anity. Swedenborg, in the Writings, openly opposed this idea of three perso=
ns in God. He demonstrated at great length that there is no scriptural foun=
dation for it. With unassailable logic he showed that it is contrary to rea=
son and incompatible with a belief in one God. There can be only one who is=
 infinite, who is all-wise, who has all power, and who is everywhere presen=
t. These qualities of God cannot be divided. They cannot be shared by disti=
nct persons, each of whom by Himself is God. A Son of God, born from eterni=
ty, is a contradiction; for to be born implies a beginning, while eternity =
has no beginning. </p><p></p><div align=3D"Right">31</div><hr><p>

 In the Writings this untenable concept of God as three persons is replaced=
 by the idea of a trine in the one person of Jesus Christ. In Him, what the=
 Scriptures call Father, Son and Holy Spirit are related as are soul, body =
and operation in every man. We are taught that Jesus Christ was similar in =
all respects to other men with one exception, namely, that His soul was inf=
inite, while the soul of every other human being is finite. The human soul =
is defined as an inmost vessel receptive of life from God.5 Every such vess=
el has a distinct individual form; and although the inflowing life is infin=
ite, it can move or animate the vessel only according to its characteristic=
 form. We might compare this inflowing Life to electricity, which is relati=
vely infinite, unbounded, and capable of exercising force in innumerable wa=
ys. But when it is received by a machine its activity is channeled, circums=
cribed, limited to the particular motions of which the machine is capable. =
Thus it may turn a wheel, move a piston, press a lever, or light a bulb, al=
l according to the way in which the machine is constructed. The vessel call=
ed the human soul is a form designed to react to a particular love--the lov=
e of an individual use in the Grand Man of heaven. </p><p></p><div align=3D=

 It is this love that builds the body in the womb, and forms the mind, dete=
rmines the interests, and imparts the abilities that are characteristic of =
the man. It is this that gives him his personality, his individuality--that=
 which sets him apart as being distinct from all other human beings.</p><p>=
5. CL 315:11.</p><p>In the case of Jesus Christ, however, because there was=
 no human father, there was no such limiting vessel. It was the Divine love=
 itself that formed the body in the womb of Mary. It was the love, not of a=
 particular use, but of the complex of all uses--a love of the whole human =
race and of a heaven to be formed and eternally perfected from the human ra=
ce. This is the love of God Himself, the love that brought the entire unive=
rse into being, that preserves it and governs it continually. It was this l=
ove that ordered the mind of the Lord, progressively penetrating the appear=
ances of the senses, removing the fallacies, the errors, the falsities that=
 darkened the minds of men. From this love the Lord spoke with wisdom such =
as no mall had ever known. From it He acted with power to heal, to cast out=
 devils, to raise from the dead. Thus God Himself spoke and acted in Him an=
d through Him. As errors were removed gradually throughout His life on eart=
h, His mind became a body of Divine truth, completely one with the Divine l=
ove itself; and this Divine body, which was not only conceived but also bor=
n of Jehovah, became the Divine Human which is now revealed in its fullness=
 in the Heavenly Doctrine. </p><p></p><div align=3D"Right">33</div><hr><p>

 It is through this body of revealed truth that God Himself may now be seen=
 and known as He truly is--an infinite Divine Man, the risen and glorified =
Savior, Jesus Christ.</p><p>This new and entirely different explanation of =
the Trinity, so far from accepting the alternative offered by Arius of deny=
ing the Divinity of Jesus Christ, exalted Him as the one person in whom, an=
d through whom alone, God may be known and worshiped, both in heaven and on=
 earth. But because they rejected the traditionally established doctrine of=
 the Christian Church, the Writings of Swedenborg were violently attacked b=
y the ecclesiastical leaders of his day, and their attacks culminated in th=
e Gothenburg trial for heresy, brought against certain members of the Swedi=
sh clergy who had espoused the cause of the New Church.</p><p>About a hundr=
ed years later, when the Academy was first established, the Athanasian doct=
rine was still held to be the very cornerstone of Christian faith. It was n=
ot only universally accepted but was widely and consistently taught. In con=
sequence, it was a central point of difference between the teaching of the =
New Church and the active religious conviction of the average Christian. </=

 It was natural, therefore, for those who wrote the WORDS FOR THE NEW CHURC=
H to focus attention upon this all-important doctrinal difference between t=
he traditional faith of the church and the teaching of the Writings. But th=
is is no longer the case. The Athanasian Creed is still the professed belie=
f of all the main Christian sects. Priests and ministers at their ordinatio=
n confess allegiance to it. Although it has been sublimated by many theolog=
ical thinkers in an attempt to explain it, it has never been essentially ch=
anged. It appears prominently in the well-known hymns and rituals used in p=
ublic worship. It is markedly implied in the usual form of prayer, which is=
 addressed to God the Father, pleading that He show mercy for the sake of H=
is Son. Yet this doctrine of three persons in God is no longer at the cente=
r of popular interest or of widespread concern. A public lecture advertised=
 as defending the doctrine of a tripersonal God, or one proposing to overth=
row that doctrine, would not draw a full house today, as it did in the midd=
le of the last century. Certainly, among educated people, this question doe=
s not now occupy the same position of great importance it held in former da=
ys. The doctrine remains intact, but it has become merely a sort of intelle=
ctual ground on which the Christian Church stands, and over which it walks,=
 while its attention and interest are centered elsewhere. </p><p></p><div a=

 There are many indeed, taken collectively, who still believe that there ar=
e three persons in God, and who cling to that belief as earnestly as ever; =
and with those of whom this is the case, the teaching of the Writings conce=
rning that doctrine applies as cogently as it did in Swedenborgs day. But t=
hose who still stress this belief as a prime essential of their faith are n=
o longer in the main current of religious thought. They have been left stra=
nded on the shore by the receding tide of Christian opinion. Indeed, this i=
s the case, not only in regard to this doctrine, but also to many other doc=
trines which were once regarded as of prime importance. The prevailing atti=
tude may best be described as one of increasing indifference to all theolog=
ical speculation. This is true in spite of the recent resurgence of active =
interest on the part of many in some form of religious faith. </p><p></p><d=

</p><p>CHAPTER III</p><p>THE DIVINITY OF JESUS CHRIST [2]</p><p>As appears =
from the expressed opinion of leading proponents of Christian thought, the =
change which has been taking place gradually since the early days of the Ac=
ademy in regard to the doctrine concerning the Divine nature of Jesus Chris=
t has been in the direction of emphasizing His humanity, and detracting fro=
m His Divinity. The unmistakable trend has been toward the adoption of the =
Arian solution to the problem of the Lords incarnation in place of the doct=
rine of three persons in the Godhead, as set forth in the Athanasian Creed.=
</p><p>That this would be the tendency is definitely foretold in the Writin=
gs. The primitive or Apostolic church, we read, never could have divined ..=
. that an Arius would lift up his head, and when he was dead would rise aga=
in, and secretly rule even to the end.6 Referring to his own day, Swedenbor=
g. states that Socinianism and Arianism reign in more hearts than you belie=
ve.7 Faith, he says, is both spurious and adulterous with those who regard =
the Lord not as God but merely as a man. </p><p></p><div align=3D"Right">37=

 The truth of this is very evident from the two abominable heresies, Ariani=
sm and Socinianism, which have been anathematized in, and excommunicated fr=
om, the Christian Church, and this because they deny the Lords Divinity, an=
d climb up some other way. But I fear that those abominations lie concealed=
 at this day in the general spirit of the men of the church.8 Because it wa=
s foreseen, therefore the change that has taken place is not one that inval=
idates the teaching of the Writings in regard to the state of the Christian=
 world, but rather serves to confirm what was clearly implied as to the fut=
ure development of that church.</p><p>6. TCR 638.</p><p>7. DP 262.</p><p>8.=
 TCR 380.</p><p>This tendency to deny the Lords Divinity is, of course, not=
 universal. Many people, although subtly affected by its influence, are qui=
te unaware of what has taken place. The influence of Arianism is least noti=
ceable in the Catholic Church, which officially and boldly upholds the trip=
ersonal doctrine. Yet even there the great emphasis that is placed on the c=
rucifixion, with the image of the crucified Lord held ever before the mind;=
 the idea that Christ needs a vicar on earth in the person of the Pope; the=
 idea that the Lord gave to Peter the power to forgive sins, and to open or=
 close heaven to men, and that this power is shared by all who have apostol=
ic succession; </p><p></p><div align=3D"Right">38</div><hr><p>

 and finally, the idea that Divine revelation, equal in authority to that o=
f the Scripture, is given through the excathedra pronouncements of the Pope=
, and through the decisions of the church councils--all this reveals a conc=
ept of Jesus Christ as a human being with definite limitations, rather than=
 as the infinite Creator and Preserver of the universe.</p><p>The influence=
 of Arianism, however, is most obvious in the liberal branch of the Protest=
ant churches. This branch, we would point out, is most closely integrated w=
ith the scientific thought of the day. The opinions it sponsors in regard t=
o religion are based primarily on a scientific approach to the subject. The=
y are in harmony with the opinions held by the intellectual leaders in our =
universities, who exercise a profound influence on the entire educational s=
ystem. For this reason the ideas which are insinuated widely into the publi=
c mind through education dispose people to accept readily the religious ide=
as held by the more liberal Christian thinkers. In this way, the tendency t=
oward the doubt, and at last the denial, of the Lords Divinity becomes the =
unconscious but increasingly influential heritage of each rising generation=
.</p><p>A predisposition to question the Divinity of Jesus Christ appears i=
n the concerted effort that is made by many to cast doubt upon, and explain=
 away, all the supposedly supernatural implications of the Sacred Scripture=
. </p><p></p><div align=3D"Right">39</div><hr><p>

 The faith in these as having any historic foundation has been very widely =
undermined by biblical criticism. It is generally supposed that such things=
 have been introduced into the sacred narrative at a later date, as the res=
ult of gradually accumulating traditions. These traditions are thought to h=
ave no foundation in fact, but to have been invented because of a strong de=
sire on the part of the early Christians to idealize the Founder of their f=
aith. They are therefore relegated to the realm of imagination and religiou=
s symbolism. Included among the supernatural elements of the story that are=
 thus to be regarded as non-factual are both the account of the virgin birt=
h of the Lord and the testimony concerning His resurrection. These are held=
 to be imaginary embroideries of the Gospels. They need not be believed in =
order to think of Jesus Christ as Divine, because His Divinity is said to d=
epend, not on any factual incidents connected with His life, but purely on =
the exalted nature of His moral teaching. At the same time, while discredit=
ing everything that savors of the supernatural, modern thinkers lay great s=
tress on the idea that Christian faith must be based on an accurate knowled=
ge of the historic Jesus. </p><p></p><div align=3D"Right">40</div><hr><p>

 The Gospels must be judged in the light of scientific discoveries concerni=
ng contemporary events and the situation of the world at the time they were=
 written. The accounts that have come down to us of the incidents and the t=
eachings connected with the Lords life must be interpreted critically in ac=
cord with their historic setting. As they have been reported by the Evangel=
ists we need not accept them as literally true, but rather as the way thing=
s appeared to the writers of the Gospels, as a normal product of their day =
and time. Thus they represent a passing phase in the progressive developmen=
t of human knowledge and understanding. Behind this, of course, is the idea=
 that Jesus Christ, in common with other prophets and all the great thinker=
s of every age, was merely expressing the best formulation of moral truth t=
hat could be conceived in His own time. This best could not fail to be supe=
rseded as the knowledge of the race increased through succeeding centuries.=
</p><p>If, then, Divinity is the same thing as moral insight, it is certain=
ly not a unique attribute of Jesus Christ. He may have possessed this Divin=
ity in greater degree than others; but He obviously must be regarded as sha=
ring it, not only with the profound thinkers who have contributed significa=
ntly to the moral standards of the race, but also in some small degree with=
 all men who have any moral insight whatsoever. </p><p></p><div align=3D"Ri=

 If, because He was Divine in this sense, we can say that Jesus Christ is G=
od, then in the same sense it can be said of all men who possess moral insi=
ght that they, too, although in lesser degree, are gods. This mode of thoug=
ht is responsible for the idea, very widespread at the present day, that by=
 what is called the imitation of Jesus we may all become Christlike, and th=
erefore may partake of the Divinity which Jesus Christ exemplified in an em=
inent degree.</p><p>This was by no means what the Apostles meant by the Div=
inity of Jesus Christ. The profound difference illustrates the importance o=
f understanding the terms that are used. When a modern Christian of the lib=
eral school says, I believe with you that Jesus is God, we must inquire jus=
t what he means by God. And when he says, I fully accept the Divinity of Ch=
rist, although not the historic authenticity of the virgin birth and the re=
surrection, we must ask just what the term Divinity implies in his mind. Bu=
t we should let the liberal leaders of modern Christian thought speak for t=
hemselves.</p><p>We have therefore selected excerpts from a few well-known =
and highly regarded exponents of this new version of Christian faith. </p><=

 The Rev. Dr. Harry Emerson Fosdick, in his book, the Modern Use of the Bib=
le, puts it this way: The central struggle of the early church was not to g=
et people to believe in the Divine origin of Jesus. Rather, after the churc=
h achieved power and Jesus was exalted as Lord, current philosophy made it =
comparatively easy to believe that He came from the supernal realm, that He=
 was the influx of the Divine into the world. It was much more difficult th=
en to believe that at the same time He possessed a genuinely human life. Th=
e difference between the early centuries and our own in this regard is shar=
p and clear. They started with the certainty that Jesus came from the Divin=
e realm and then wondered how He could be truly man; we start from the cert=
ainty that He was genuinely man and then wonder in what sense He can be God=
.... It is not for an instant doubtful that Jesus must be considered as man=
 in the full sense of the term, and that anything Divine may be sought in H=
im only under the condition that His humanity is not put in question. This =
is the most inevitable attitude for any modern mind when it approaches the =
personality of Jesus.9 Whenever you look at the underlying presuppositions =
of mens thinking about God today you find, not the old dualism against whic=
h the ancient church had so long and fierce a conflict, but a gladly recogn=
ized affinity between God and man. </p><p></p><div align=3D"Right">43</div>=

 Yet in the presumably conservative Church of England, and among its most o=
utstanding representatives, we find the same opinions forcefully presented.=
 In the Report of the Commission on Christian Doctrine, appointed in 1922 b=
y the Archbishops of Canterbury and York, the adherents of this modern libe=
ral view were so numerous and influential that it was necessary to make a d=
ual statement--one presenting the traditional belief, and the other setting=
 forth the liberal conviction. The Report states: Many of us hold ... that =
belief in the Word made flesh is integrally bound up with belief in the Vir=
gin Birth, and that this will increasingly be recognized. There are, howeve=
r, some among us who hold that a full belief in the historical Incarnation =
is more consistent with the supposition that our Lords birth took place und=
er the normal conditions of human generation. In their minds the notion of =
a Virgin Birth tends to mar the completeness of the belief that in the Inca=
rnation God revealed Himself at every point in and through human nature....=
 We also recognize that both the views outlined above are held by members o=
f the Church, as of the Commission, who fully accept the reality of our Lor=
ds Incarnation, which is the central truth of the Christian faith.15 </p><p=

 And in regard to the resurrection, the Report continues: Belief that the d=
ead would rise again with their bodies at the last day had established itse=
lf in Judaism, though not universally, for some two centuries before the Cr=
ucifixion. It is possible, therefore, that antecedent beliefs as to the res=
urrection of the dead have played some part in shaping the tradition of the=
 Resurrection of Jesus Christ, even as that is recorded in the New Testamen=
t. This consideration, combined with others of a more general sort, incline=
s some of us to the belief that the connexion made in the New Testament bet=
ween the emptiness of a tomb and the appearances of the Risen Lord belongs =
rather to the sphere of religious symbolism than to that of historical fact=
.16</p><p>15. Page 82.</p><p>16. Doctrine In The Church Of England (The Mac=

 There are, of course, some thinkers who oppose this view, and who clearly =
see some of the logical consequences that flow from it. But these do not ex=
ercise the wide influence of the liberals. In opposing Arius they are compe=

hrist by the Rev. Dr. Gresham Machen, as follows:</p><p>What is this religi=
on that is founded upon a historical Jesus, and yet is independent of event=
s like the virgin birth? Is it not still a religion whose fundamental tenet=
 is the ability of man to save himself? Jesus attained to sonship with God,=
 say the adherents of this religion in effect, and we, if we will only foll=
ow Him, can attain to that sonship too. Certainly men who think thus will n=
ot be much interested in the fact of the virgin birth. Indeed, if they are =
interested in it at all, they can be interested only in rejecting it. The f=
undamental notion of their religion is that Jesus showed us what man can do=
; but if so it is important for our encouragement that He should be thought=
 to have begun where we too must begin. If He was born of a virgin He had a=
n advantage which we do not possess; how, then, can we in that case be sure=
 that we, who were not virgin-born, can do what He did? </p><p></p><div ali=

 We can all be Christs if we will only follow Christs example--that is the =
essence of this religion of the imitation of Jesus17</p><p>17. The Virgin B=

t forth should be sufficient to demonstrate that if we picture the modern C=
hristian world as one that still bases its faith primarily upon the doctrin=
e of three persons in God, we will often find ourselves fighting a straw ma=
n. The modern emancipated Christian is not vitally concerned about that doc=
trine. The real point of difference between present-day Christianity and th=
e New Church in regard to the concept of the Lord Jesus Christ, is the ques=
tion as to whether He is really God, or whether He was an historic characte=
r who, together with other religious leaders, contributed to mans understan=
ding of moral truth. The acknowledgment that the Lord Jesus Christ, in His =
Divine Human, is the one God of heaven and earth, one in person and in esse=
nce--this is the distinctive teaching of the New Church. Wherefore we read =
in the Preface to the Apocalypse Revealed, that after the Last Judgment, wh=
ich was accomplished in the spiritual world in the year 1757 ... there was =
formed a New Heaven from Christians; but from those only who could receive =
[the truth that] the Lord ... [is] the God of heaven and earth.... </p><p><=

</p><p>CHAPTER IV</p><p>THE HOLINESS OF THE WORD</p><p>Just as the Christia=
n Church has receded from its first acknowledgment of the Divinity of the L=
ord, and has accepted the Arian doctrine that He was merely a man, so also =
it has departed from the faith of the Apostolic age in the Bible as the sou=
rce of authoritative truth. In the minds of the early Christians there was =
not the slightest doubt that God had dictated the Sacred Scripture through =
the medium of the prophets and the evangelists. Thus they believed it to be=
 eternal and infallible truth. Many, especially among those who are less ed=
ucated, still clung to this idea, and accept every word of the Scripture as=
 literally true. But biblical scholars have found this concept to be untena=
ble. They find contradictions, gross inaccuracies and palpable errors in th=
e sacred text. They have therefore been compelled to abandon the idea of li=
teral infallibility. Although they continue to call the Bible the Word of G=
od, and to speak of it as Divine Revelation, they now use these terms in qu=
ite a different sense. They now profess to believe rather in the self-revel=
ation of God in history, by which they mean a gradual unfolding of a progre=
ssively more satisfying concept of morality, as mankind climbs painfully to=
 an ever higher level of intellectual achievement. </p><p></p><div align=3D=

 In this process there is no Divine dictation. New and more acceptable idea=
s of right and wrong are thought to have arisen out of bitter experience. T=
hey have been forged upon the anvil of human needs, which, with the advance=
ment of civilization, have become increasingly complex. In times of crisis,=
 it is said, the perceptive powers of certain leading minds, faced with gre=
at responsibilities, rise to unusual heights, and express truths never befo=
re so clearly seen. This is regarded as the secret of moral evolution; and =
although it is conceded that the new perceptions of moral truth are God-giv=
en, they are by no means perfect. They exercised great and beneficent power=
 at the time, but they possess no authority that should be binding on us to=
day. We should honor those who have contributed to this development of mora=
l concepts, for we owe them a great debt. Among them we find the deep intel=
lectual thinkers of all time, and of these Jesus Christ is but one outstand=
ing example. In this same category are placed, not only the prophets and ev=
angelists through whom the Bible was given, but also the Greek and Roman ph=
ilosophers, the writers of the sacred books of the East, and many of the mo=
re modern leaders of thought throughout the world. </p><p></p><div align=3D=

 We should accept these valued gifts of the past with gratitude; but we mus=
t judge them in the superior light of our own day, selecting from them only=
 that which is in accord with our vast accumulation of scientific knowledge=
, and that which is found to be acceptable to our modern mechanized society=
. We must, therefore, understand these moral teachings in terms of their hi=
storic setting, interpreting them, not according to what they mean to us, b=
ut according to what they meant to those who wrote them. We can understand =
them truly only if we put them into the framework of thought that was chara=
cteristic of their time, and see them in relation to the economic, social a=
nd cultural conditions then prevailing. In this respect the Bible is no dif=
ferent from other ancient literature, and must be subjected to the same cri=
tical analysis. </p><p>This historical approach to the Bible robs it of all=
 Divine authority. In spite of this fact the Bible is still called Divine, =
although its Divinity is not recognized throughout, but only in spots, in b=
its and pieces where exalted ideas of morality are openly expressed or clea=
rly implied. The rest is looked upon as obsolete, and as possessing no more=
 than antiquarian value. The selection of the parts to be regarded as Divin=
e is purely a matter of human judgment, and it is therefore on mans authori=
ty--the authority of individual insight--that any Divinity is ascribed to t=
hem. </p><p></p><div align=3D"Right">55</div><hr><p>

 Even those portions of the Scripture which are acknowledged to be Divinely=
 inspired are by no means regarded as absolute truth, but merely as reflect=
ing the level of cultural advancement to which the race had attained at the=
 time they were written. They may need to be radically modified in accommod=
ation to the vastly more sophisticated concepts of our modern day.</p><p>It=
 should be clearly understood that if we confine our thought to its moral c=
ontent, there is much in this attitude toward the Bible with which we would=
 agree. Moral concepts and customs, after all, are but the outer garments o=
f religion, and like garments they may, and indeed should be changed in ada=
ptation to changing conditions. What is morally right under one set of circ=
umstances may be wrong under another set. Standards of right and wrong that=
 have become matters of conscience in any particular part of the world, at =
any time, or with any set of people, may not be right for others. Modes of =
life that are binding in one generation may be modified, or entirely reject=
ed in the next. For instance, the requirements of the Mosaic Law in regard =
to ritual observances and forms of worship were rightly abrogated by the Ch=
ristian Church. </p><p></p><div align=3D"Right">56</div><hr><p>

 Many of the accepted moral concepts of the Jews were openly rejected by th=
e Lord. The law of retaliation, an eye for an eye, and hate thine enemies, =
were replaced by the golden rule and the admonition of resist not evil, and=
 to love thine enemies. Forms of moral conduct are largely dictated by the =
needs and requirements of human society. They are not fixed for all time or=
 upon all people by Divine dictation. They are actually worked out by men e=
xercising human judgment under the spur of necessity, or prompted by the re=
sponsibility to preserve social order and promote the public welfare. Such =
is the source of many man-made laws, and these are formulated in the light =
of past experience. This has always been the case, and only by an historica=
l approach can we attain to a just estimate of their value. This applies to=
 the moral injunctions of the Bible as well as to those found in other lite=
rature. To this extent we agree with the modern insistence upon a scholarly=
 and judicial appraisal of the literal Scripture.</p><p>We differ sharply, =
however, in holding that the Word is not given as a Divine revelation of mo=
ral truth, except as this may embody and reflect spiritual truth--that is, =
the truth concerning God, and heaven and eternal life. </p><p></p><div alig=

 This truth is unchanging from age to age, however it may be clothed in the=
 external forms of morality. It underlies all morality, qualifies it, gives=
 it life, soul and real significance. Spiritual truth alone discloses the u=
nifying principles that should govern in the development of moral ideas. It=
 should direct the modification of customs, rituals, and mores in accord wi=
th varying circumstances. Indeed, the whole purpose of morality is to serve=
 mans spiritual needs--to express and embody the spirit of religion, the sp=
irit of love to the Lord, and genuine charity toward the neighbor. These ar=
e the constant factors, the eternal and unchanging things, in the midst of =
all human change. The true quality of these things man cannot discover for =
himself. They must be learned from the Word. The Lord alone can teach them.=
 Their application to life will vary with circumstances; but in themselves =
they occupy a realm above all the shifting conditions of human life, a real=
m whence they can descend to order, dispose, control and govern all possibl=
e conditions, thus bringing mans external life into harmony with the eterna=
l Divine law and under obedience to the will of God. Unless this spiritual =
truth is known, and from it man derives a just idea of what is involved in =
love to the Lord and charity toward the neighbor, there is no guide to the =
discovery, under any circumstances, of what is truly moral, of what is real=
ly right, or of what will actually promote mans eternal welfare. </p><p></p=

 Apart from this, morality becomes no more than a temporary expedient, a wa=
y of adapting ones self to the demands of the society in which one lives. W=
hen this kind of morality is mistaken for truth itself, it frequently produ=
ces a false or a spurious conscience. Undue importance is ascribed to trivi=
al things, and matters of small consequence are proclaimed to be mortal sin=
s. Such modes of life may become a tool of wickedness, a source of pride an=
d contempt for others, as well as a shield of virtue.</p><p>Here is the rea=
l issue between modern Christianity and the New Church in regard to the nat=
ure of the Sacred Scripture. Men have lost sight of the spiritual truth con=
cealed within the letter of the Word, and they look to the Bible only for i=
ts moral content. Failing to find there any fixed or permanent code of mora=
lity--any code that holds good universally, and under all conditions--they =
are compelled to fall back upon human judgment as the final authority conce=
rning what is morally right. It is true that the moral injunctions of the B=
ible in large part no longer apply. Indeed, what applied to the Jews during=
 their wanderings in the wilderness ceased to have practical application af=
ter they had entered the land of Canaan. </p><p></p><div align=3D"Right">59=

 What then came to be regarded as of vital importance lost its meaning afte=
r the conquest of Jerusalem. Because of this, men conclude that the Bible, =
after all, is not infallible, but merely records what men have thought and =
what they have practiced through the ages in regard to the life of religion=
. This conviction has grown progressively through the centuries; but in rec=
ent times it has become the dominant factor in Christian thought concerning=
 the interpretation of the Bible.</p><p>In the early Christian Church there=
 was a perceptive realization that the Word must contain a deep spiritual m=
eaning. It was seen that God, speaking to men, must reveal Himself, and so =
doing make known the Divine laws of life, the Divine end and purpose in cre=
ation, and the eternal destiny toward which, in providence, He is leading b=
oth the individual and the race. This being true, the Word could not be reg=
arded as treating merely of ephemeral affairs, of passing events, of times,=
 places and persons which are constantly changing, although in outward form=
 it appears to do so. Men sought therefore to discover a deeper meaning in =
the sacred text. They tried to interpret it everywhere in terms of parable,=
 allegory and religious symbolism. </p><p></p><div align=3D"Right">60</div>=

 However, because they lacked a rational revelation of spiritual truth, in =
this endeavor they found themselves without guide or compass. Their unbridl=
ed imagination opened the way to wild, fantastic, and often trivial interpr=
etations. As long as they clung steadfastly to what the Writings call the d=
octrine of genuine truth in the Word; that is, as long as they carefully ob=
served those portions of the Scripture in which the internal sense plainly =
shines through the letter, their teaching was vital and spiritually instruc=
tive. But when they tried to unveil dark sayings, or to give a higher meani=
ng to the literal stories of the Word, they often strayed far from the trut=
h and fell prey to mere sentimentality. As the church declined, its thought=
 became more and more immersed in external things. The interests of men bec=
ame centered in worldly ambitions of wealth or power. As this came to pass,=
 the tendency to error in interpretation increased apace, and led to greate=
r and greater confusion of ideas in regard to religion. To halt this indulg=
ence of vain imagination, the Catholic Church ruled that the right of bibli=
cal interpretation was the sole prerogative of the clergy, and was to be ex=
ercised by them with due restraint in accord with the creeds and the decisi=
ons of the church councils. </p><p></p><div align=3D"Right">61</div><hr><p>

 By this ruling the Word was denied to the people, who in consequence were =
compelled to accept uncritically the official teaching of the church. In ti=
me, however, religious reformers rose in revolt against this claim of eccle=
siastical authority. Huss, Wycliffe, Luther, Calvin and others contended th=
at God should be permitted to speak directly to every man, and that each on=
e should be free to draw his own conclusions from the sacred text. Yet they=
 too were constrained to place some check upon the ill-considered exercise =
of imagination in matters of exegesis. This was to apply to clergy and lait=
y alike. To accomplish this, they repudiated the whole idea of allegorical =
interpretation, demanding that the Scripture should be understood literally=
, in accord with the plain and open meaning of every passage. This has been=
 the universal rule, in theory if not always in practice, with the Protesta=
nt churches ever since. It has produced a deep prejudice against any idea t=
hat the Sacred Scripture contains an internal sense.</p><p>When this litera=
listic mode is honestly pursued, however, it is found that the teaching of =
the Scripture is not everywhere in harmony with the orthodox creeds. It is =
inconsistent with itself, being full of apparent contradictions that cannot=
 be reconciled by any literal interpretation; and it is in many respects co=
ntrary to the laws of nature as they have been discovered by modern scienti=
fic scholarship. </p><p></p><div align=3D"Right">62</div><hr><p>

 For these reasons, the unavoidable conclusion is virtually forced upon the=
 mind that the Bible is by no means infallible. It can be regarded only as =
a reflection of the inadequate knowledge, the primitive superstitions, the =
childish fancies that prevailed with men at the time when it was written. O=
nly in quite recent times could it be said, however, that this view of the =
Bible has been openly espoused so as to become the predominant or widely pr=
evailing view of Christianity.</p><p>In the days of the early Academy most =
Christians still looked upon the Bible as an authoritative Divine revelatio=
n. References to it and quotations from it were regarded with deep reverenc=
e and implicit faith. This is far less the case today. At least with those =
who are educated in the scientific tradition of our time, doctrinal argumen=
ts based on the Scripture no longer command the attention or make the impre=
ssion that they did when Words For The New Church, was published. We call n=
o longer prove the validity of the Writings by quoting the Bible in their s=
upport. The central issue between the New Church and the Christian world to=
day is not whether the Writings are borne out by the Old and New Testaments=
, but whether, either in the former Scriptures or in the Writings, God has =
ever spoken to man with a voice of authority. </p><p></p><div align=3D"Righ=

</p><p>CHAPTER V</p><p>THE SCIENTIFIC ATTITUDE OF MIND</p><p>No just estima=
te of the state of the modern Christian world is possible apart from a clea=
r understanding of what is involved in the scientific attitude of mind. In =
fact, the development of this attitude is largely responsible for the chang=
e in the whole concept of religion that has gradually come about since Swed=
enborgs day. It is this that makes it increasingly difficult for men to bel=
ieve in the real Divinity of Jesus Christ. It is this also that has progres=
sively weakened the faith of the Christian Church in the Divine authority o=
f the Sacred Scripture. And it is under the influence of this scientific ap=
proach to all learning that religion itself has come more and more to be re=
garded as nothing but the expression of mans insatiable longing for immorta=
lity. It is important to note, however, that these effects, so destructive =
of spiritual faith, are not due to anything that is inherent in the scienti=
fic method itself, but rather to a wrong interpretation of it.</p><p>The sc=
ientific method of investigation is essential to the discovery of truth, bo=

 It is entirely responsible for the rapid progress of our western civilizat=
ion in modern times. It was not only adopted by Swedenborg, but was highly =
commended by him in his scientific and philosophical works. It would be a g=
reat mistake, therefore, to condemn the scientific method, rightly understo=
od, simply because a misapplication of it has proved so injurious to the ca=
use of spiritual religion. We believe, indeed, that it is the foundation up=
on which all spiritual and rational faith must be built. The immanent prese=
nce of the Lord, and the immediate operation of His providence in all thing=
s of life, are now to be seen in and by means of the laws of nature. This i=
s the Divine Natural which the Lord assumed at His second coming, and which=
 is revealed in the Writings. The Heavenly Doctrine is a rational revelatio=
n because it makes known the interrelation between God and man, between the=
 spiritual world and the natural world, between the truth of religion and t=
he facts of natural science. We believe, therefore, that men have been led-=
-Divinely, although quite unconsciously--to develop the natural sciences as=
 ultimates for the sake of their imperative need as a means for the preserv=
ation and perpetuation of spiritual faith and life. </p><p></p><div align=

 In a rational age, when men insist upon the investigation and discovery of=
 natures inmost secrets, their paramount need is a religion that explains t=
his new-found knowledge in its relation to God and to the laws of spiritual=
 life. Nothing less than this can long preserve the innocent faith of child=
hood, and make it effective in moulding human character in accord with the =
Divine will. We must therefore examine this scientific attitude of mind jud=
icially that we may distinguish between what is right and what is wrong wit=
h it, as it is understood and practiced in our day.</p><p>Expressed in simp=
lest terms, the scientific attitude is nothing but a profound conviction th=
at human imagination and human reason are both unreliable, and are constant=
ly subject to error. In any search for truth, both of these human faculties=
 may offer invaluable suggestions without which progress would be impossibl=
e. Without them we could discover nothing. But they are so readily influenc=
ed by individual emotions, by personal ambitions, by traditional ideas, and=
 by group feelings that we cannot depend upon them as a sure guide to truth=
. While therefore we may, and indeed must, adopt some opinion as a working =
hypothesis, we are forbidden to make up our mind irrevocably that such an o=
pinion is true until after we have carefully and systematically examined th=
e facts relative to it. </p><p></p><div align=3D"Right">69</div><hr><p>

 For this reason our primary assumptions must be checked again and a in by =
the testimony of experience, by a long series of tests, and by controlled e=
xperiments whereby they may be either proved or disproved. In this process =
we must avoid the natural human tendency to confirm a preconceived idea by =
gathering together the evidence which appears to support it, while ignoring=
 or explaining away the evidence that tends to contradict it. The temptatio=
n to do this arises from the pride of our own intelligence, and the desire =
to claim the truth as our personal discovery. We can overcome it only by an=
 attitude of intellectual humility, by the recognition that truth lies not =
in our own minds but in nature herself, the product of Divine creation. Our=
 supreme objective must be, not to establish our personal opinion, but to d=
iscover the truth. The great men of science are those who have been inspire=
d with a love of truth for its own sake; that is, for the sake of use, and =
who have subjected their minds, without reservation, to its guidance. There=
 have been many such men, and their self-effacing labors have brought untol=
d natural benefits to mankind.</p><p>Thus far the scientific attitude of mi=
nd is right. It is the indispensable mode of approach to natural truth, and=
 it is this attitude that Swedenborg commends. But in our modern age anothe=
r element--an element that is altogether wrong--has been introduced into th=
is concept of the scientific method. </p><p></p><div align=3D"Right">70</di=

 This subversive principle which has turned modern science against religion=
 is the unwarranted scientific assumption that the only kind of truth to wh=
ich we can attain, or of which we can have any positive knowledge, is that =
which can be subjected to sensual proof. This itself is a preconceived idea=
 which ignores the testimony of history and of all human experience to the =
effect that there is a higher truth. The abstract idea of cause and effect,=
 without which the facts of nature could never be understood or turned to u=
seful purposes; the faculty of generalization, which leads to the concept o=
f law whereby alone knowledge can be organized and ordered for use; the ide=
a of use itself, without which mere knowledge has no meaning or significanc=
e--these are not tangible things capable of analysis by the bodily senses, =
yet they underlie all scientific truth. The human mind is created to grasp =
these intangible things. The very human--that which distinguishes man from =
animal--is the ability to understand and utilize abstract concepts. The ide=
a of cause leads inevitably to the idea of a First Cause. The idea of law i=
mplies the existence of a universal law. The idea of use requires that ther=
e should he an all-embracing use, a unifying and harmonizing Divine end and=
 purpose, which alone can give meaning to all the rest. </p><p></p><div ali=

 This being true, it follows that there must be an omnipresent and all-wise=
 government directing the entire universe. For this reason, the mind of man=
, in accepting the reality of cause, of law, and of use is thereby committe=
d to the acknowledgment of the real existence of a God and of all the truth=
 of religion that ensues therefrom.</p><p>It is essential to realize, howev=
er, that man cannot attain to a sure knowledge of this higher spiritual tru=
th by means of his imagination or by means of his unaided reason, any more =
than he can attain by the same means to a sure knowledge of scientific trut=
h. His ideas concerning spiritual things cannot be checked nor proved by an=
y evidence of the bodily senses because these things are invisible and inta=
ngible. Yet if we are to be assured that our idea of them is correct it mus=
t be checked against something fixed, something independent of the human mi=
nd. The very first step toward a true religion upon which we can rely with =
confidence is to realize and acknowledge that there is such a fixed ultimat=
e. This is what is lacking in the modern scientific attitude of mind. It is=
 universally recognized that nature is the fixed ultimate whereby ideas of =
natural things may be tested and confirmed: this because in nature we see G=
od, the Divine Creator, manifestly working, doing wonders openly before our=
 very eyes. </p><p></p><div align=3D"Right">72</div><hr><p>

 But there are millions of things being done secretly that are beyond the r=
ange of the physical senses--things that nevertheless are essential to any =
real understanding of natural phenomena. Of these things we cannot learn by=
 experiment or by sensual examination. We can know of them, not by what God=
 does, but only by what He says. The Word of the Lord, Divine revelation, i=
s given to explain to our finite minds those spiritual verities of which we=
 can otherwise have no knowledge whatever. It is a fixed ultimate against w=
hich our human ideas of religion may be checked, just as our ideas of natur=
al truth may be checked by reference to nature. But this being the case, we=
 must adopt the same attitude of intellectual humility toward the Word that=
 we find it necessary to adopt toward the testimony of nature. We must perm=
it our minds to be led by a love of spiritual truth, just as the true scien=

<p>Starting from the assumption that nature is the only fixed ultimate agai=

 Based upon this assumption is the accepted principle of modern scientific =
thought, that we must leave these questionable, unproved ideas out of consi=

</p><p>Swedenborg lived at the dawn of our modern era, when the scientific =
approach to truth, now so universally accepted, was in process of being for=
mulated. It had already roused the violent opposition of the church. Those =
who sponsored it had been subjected to persecution and martyrdom: this beca=
use it was supposed that in casting doubt upon the established dogmas of th=
eology they were seeking the overthrow of all religion. Swedenborg recogniz=
ed at once that the scientific method of inquiry was right, and indeed was =
the only way by which men might attain to an understanding of natural truth=
. Yet he started with the assumption that there is a God who created the un=
iverse, who sustains it perpetually, and who governs all things. He believe=
d that God, in creating the universe, acted with definite purpose, and that=
 His wisdom orders all things for the achievement of that purpose. He belie=
ved that the inmost end of the Divine creation was to provide for the trues=
t happiness and well-being of mankind and that everything in nature was int=
ended to promote this supreme objective. As an undeniable consequence of th=
ese premises, he believed that the laws of nature and the laws of human lif=
e, which are the same as the laws of religion, so far from contradicting on=
e another, must be in perfect harmony, each complementing the other, and bo=
th working together for the attainment of a single goal. </p><p></p><div al=

 In assuming these postulates, Swedenborg was no less scientific than were =
those who assumed their opposites. In fact, Swedenborg foresaw that if scie=
nce is regarded--as some thinkers already began to regard it--as the avowed=
 enemy of religion, it could not fail in time to destroy all spiritual fait=
h. His whole effort, therefore, as a scientific philosopher, was to demonst=
rate that there was no such antagonism between the two. From the very begin=
ning of his studies he set out, not merely to amass facts, but to search ou=
t causes, and to trace an unbroken chain of causes all the way back from th=
e ultimates of nature to God as the First Cause and origin of all things. W=
ith this end in view he focused his attention not upon the facts themselves=
 but upon a rational explanation of them seeking to discover the use in all=
 things, the Divine purpose in all creation.</p><p>Inspired by the desire t=
o establish the faith of mankind in God, not by a blind allegiance to the f=
ormulas of theology, but by rational conviction supported by factual eviden=
ce, Swedenborg traversed the whole gamut of human learning as far as it was=
 available in his day. </p><p></p><div align=3D"Right">76</div><hr><p>

 He studied systematically, critically, and with complete devotion to the f=
acts, the practical arts and sciences, but always from the standpoint of th=
eir use. Metallurgy, geology, mathematics, physics, chemistry, cosmogony, a=
natomy, physiology and psychology--all these came under his scrutiny. To ea=
ch he brought a fresh point of view, a new insight, both practical and theo=
retical. These studies, directed by a supreme love of use, yielded marvelou=
s results. They led to the discovery of many facts far in advance of the kn=
owledge of his day-facts that were substantiated only later by investigator=
s armed with more powerful microscopes and with more exact methods of exper=
imentation. Yet he was not satisfied. The final answer to his questioning m=
ind continued to elude him. At last he turned from the contemplation of nat=
ure to the study of the Word, convinced that the deeper secrets of life cou=
ld be revealed only by the Lord Himself. It was only then, after a long per=
iod of preparation, after acquiring a background of scientific knowledge an=
d philosophic thought, that the internal sense of the Word could be imparte=
d to him, the spiritual truth that alone can give meaning and rational unde=
rstanding to all the rest. This truth alone can complete the chain of cause=

 This truth alone can demonstrate the immanent presence of God in nature, t=

</p><p>CHAPTER VI</p><p>THE SOCIAL GOSPEL</p><p>As a direct result of the s=
cientific attitude of mind the Christian Church has been accepting ever mor=
e widely what has come to be known as the "Social Gospel." This gospel aros=
e as a revolt against the other-worldly attitude of medieval religious thou=
ght. The early Christians looked forward with immediate expectation to the =
life after death. They had but a vague and indefinite idea as to the nature=
 of that life, but it was very real to them. It was associated in their min=
ds with the second advent of Jesus Christ; and this they anticipated in the=
 immediate future. They interpreted literally the Lord's words: "Then shall=
 they see the Son of Man coming in the clouds with great power and glory. A=
nd then shall He send His angels, and shall gather together His elect from =
the four winds, from the uttermost Part of the earth to the uttermost part =
of heaven. Verily, I say unto you, that this generation shall not pass, til=
l all these things be done."20 And further, in John: "In My Father's house =
are many mansions: if it were not so I would have told you. </p><p></p><div=

e confident belief of these early Christians in an imminent resurrection to=
 new life, enabled them to meet martyrdom with gladness and singing, to the=
 great astonishment of their persecutors. At that time they did not think o=
f a material resurrection, but of new life in a spiritual world, and in a s=
piritual body, as Paul had taught them, saying: "There are also celestial b=
odies and bodies terrestrial.... So also is the resurrection of the dead ..=
. it is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body. There is a natu=
ral body, and there is a spiritual body."22 And in the same epistle: "Behol=
d I show you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed=
.... For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must pu=
t on immortality ... then shall be brought to pass the saying that is writt=
en, Death is swallowed up in victory."23 They did not know what the spiritu=
al world was like. They pictured it as a perfect natural world. </p><p></p>=

 Yet they believed that it was in some strange way different from this worl=
d in that it was incorruptible, and thus that life there would be eternal. =
So strong was their faith in this future life, and so sure were they that i=
t was near at hand, that they lived solely for the sake of that life, regar=
ding the things of earth with something of contempt, as being of small impo=
rtance in comparison. As time passed the expected coming of Jesus Christ wa=
s unaccountably delayed. Yet they continued to look for it in the near futu=
re, and all through the dark ages the eyes of simple Christians were kept f=
ixed upon the life after death. Man's sojourn on earth was viewed merely as=
 a necessary preparation, a period of probation, an introduction to the lif=
e everlasting. Trials and sufferings endured on earth were regarded as Divi=
ne punishment for sin. They could be removed only as sin was overcome. Unti=
l mankind was fully redeemed, therefore, physical ills must be accepted wit=
h patience as the inescapable lot of a fallen race. There was little or no =
thought of removing them or of alleviating them by natural means.</p><p>22.=

the Reformation, emphasized the idea that nothing but a true faith could br=

 Since, according to this idea, no one could be saved who had not a true fa=
ith, both the Gentiles who were ignorant of the truth, and heretics who ope=
nly denied the truth, were doomed to spiritual death. This made it a matter=
 of the highest importance to carry the Gospel to the Gentiles, who had to =
be conquered and converted to Christianity, even if, in the process they ha=
d to be cruelly enslaved and exploited. Their sufferings were excused as be=
ing of small consequence when compared to the eternal blessings imparted to=
 them by their Christian faith. Also, the need to combat heresy within the =
church led to internecine strife, to personal animosities against those who=
 held conflicting views of religion. This led to schism, and to deep sectar=
ian bitterness, by which Christianity was torn to pieces.</p><p>So long as =
such an other-worldly attitude prevailed, men gave little heed to earthly t=
hings. Scientific knowledge, to be acquired only by a careful investigation=
 of nature, was largely neglected. The active pursuit of a trade or busines=
s was held in low esteem. Only the military profession, whereby the heathen=
 might be conquered and converted, was regarded as honorable and worthy of =
intelligent laymen. Those, however, who devoted their lives to the contempl=
ation of spiritual things, who were learned in theology, who studied the Sa=
cred Scriptures and subjected their teachings to deep reflection and analys=
is--these were the ones who received the greatest reverence and acclaim. </=

 But when men began to probe the secrets of nature their discoveries wrough=
t a tremendous change in man's whole outlook upon life. It was found that m=
echanical forces could he utilized to ease man's burdens, to relieve his su=
fferings, and to improve greatly the conditions of human society here on ea=
rth. It found that hardships, trials, inconveniences, were not, as had been=
 supposed, unavoidable ills to be borne with cheerful patience for the eter=
nal good of the soul. It was discovered that they could be alleviated, or e=
ven removed entirely by persistent application to the study of their natura=
l causes and their practical remedies. Suddenly it was realized that while =
men had been idly sitting by, speculating upon the future life, thousands w=
ere suffering from diseases that could be cured; thousands were dying of fa=
mine that was preventable; thousands were held in bondage, doomed to life-l=
ong poverty and misery from which they could be liberated by a little knowl=
edge. Surely to discover scientific truth, whereby he might gain the power =
to conquer these natural ills that constantly plague human society--surely =
this is mans paramount duty. </p><p></p><div align=3D"Right">85</div><hr><p=

</p><p>Of course scientific research is a secular responsibility and the pr=
actical application of its findings is the immediate concern of those who a=
re engaged in business, in all branches of industry, and in the professions=
. But in the measure that men came to regard scientific truth as the real s=
avior of mankind, and in consequence focused their attention upon earthly r=
ather than upon heavenly things, the appeal of the church to consider the i=
mportance of preparing for a life after death became less and less effectiv=
e. It sounded more and more like a call to ignore the ills we have while wo=
rrying needlessly about how to avoid future ills we know not of. It came to=
 be regarded very largely as a foolish demand that society return to those =
conditions of natural ignorance and consequent misery from which it was jus=
t learning how to escape. Under the increasing pressure of public opinion, =
therefore, the Christian Church, ever since the middle of the last century,=
 has found it necessary to concentrate its teaching and its energies more a=
nd more upon the solution of social problems, placing less and less emphasi=
s upon doctrinal ideas, or upon any attempt to Interpret the Scripture spir=
itually. The leaders of the church have joined with the leaders of scientif=
ic thought in seeking to promote an earthly kingdom of human well-being and=
 happiness here and now, rather than a spiritual kingdom of heaven after de=
ath. </p><p></p><div align=3D"Right">86</div><hr><p>

 The spirit of religion, they say, should lead to peace and harmony, and br=
otherhood among men. It should express itself in an attitude of charity, of=
 tolerance, of mercy and generosity, of justice and fair dealing, of concer=
n for the freedom and the equality of opportunity for all men. To encourage=
 the exercise of these virtues is the real field of religious activity, rat=
her than to haggle over the philosophic abstractions of theology. Here is t=
he vital work of the church, a work that looks to immediate and tangible re=
sults--a work that promises eventually to overcome the dread evils of socie=
ty that lead to war, to enslavement, to injustice, to unbearable conditions=
 of labor. As these economic and social conditions that drive men to desper=
ate measures are removed, it is believed that the minds of men will be set =
free, untold opportunities will open before them for spiritual progress, an=
d mankind will reap a rich harvest of happiness and peace.</p><p>This is th=
e essence of the "Social Gospel" which has profoundly influenced religious =
thought, and has turned the course of Christian development in modern times=
 in an entirely new direction. The change is not a local one, but it affect=
s Christianity as a whole. </p><p></p><div align=3D"Right">87</div><hr><p>

 As John Herman Randall, Jr. writes in The Annals Of The American Academy O=
f Political And Social Science for March 1948: "During the progressive deca=
de (1903-1913) this social Christianity received official recognition in al=
l the major churches."24 He proceeds to recite chapter and verse. The idea =
that Christianity is a religion of social reform has become well nigh unive=
rsal in our day, and the reason is forcefully stated by the Rev. Dr. Harry =
Emerson Fosdick, as follows: "The late war violated everything Jesus ever t=
aught, and pouring the whole world into almost irremediable confusion, has =
brought widespread impatience with purely theological speculations about Ch=
rist. The Jesus who challenges thoughtful men today is crying, "Why call ye=
 Me Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I say?' Many people therefore, =
growing impatient with the church's worship of the theological Christ, have=
 been saying: 'Give us Jesus the teacher of righteousness, brotherhood, and=
 peace, the proclaimer of principles on which alone civilization can endure=
.' For nearly twenty centuries you have been praising your theological Chri=
st, and yet child labor takes our little ones and grinds them like grist in=
 our mills, while the real Christ says, 'It is not the will of your Father =
that one of these little ones should perish.' </p><p></p><div align=3D"Righ=

 For nearly twenty centuries you have been explaining your theological Chri=
st, yet racial hatreds still well up bitterly in men, while the real Christ=
 said, 'One is your Teacher, and all ye are brethren.' For nearly twenty ce=
nturies you have been forming creeds about your theological Christ, yet ind=
ustrial despotism still grinds its victims with a hard heel, while the real=

evil train all the abominations that man is heir to, while the real Christ =

.' Have done with your theological Christ, and give us back Jesus the ethic=
al teacher.'" "I do not see," the writer continues, "how any one who knows =

</p><p>We can indeed sympathize with a shift from a religion of faith alone=
 to a religion of life. That there should be a revival of emphasis upon the=
 actual practice of moral virtues at a time when this last outpost of liber=
ty and social order is in imminent danger of destruction by the apostles of=
 brute force--this is surely a matter of Divine Providence. We can be profo=
undly grateful that, although the light of spiritual truth has flickered an=
d died, there remains in the Christian world an ideal of natural freedom, a=
 goal of tolerance, of civil justice, and of mutual co-operation and good w=
ill among men for which to strive. Because spiritual insight is lacking, me=
n often seek to achieve these goals in ways that are misguided and unwise. =
In consequence the results are largely disappointing. What is apparently ac=
hieved in times of great national danger, the spirit of self-sacrifice, of =
co-operation, singleness of purpose, and united devotion to a common cause-=
-all this seems to evaporate as soon as the pressure of impending peril is =
lifted. Yet it is a great thing for the future of the race that in times of=
 crisis so many people spontaneously rally to the defense of these moral id=
eals. Motives are always mixed, and there is much that savors of self-inter=
est and of self-merit concealed within both the profession and the actual d=

 But the cynic who would condemn it all as hypocritical forgets that there =
is a substratum of simple sincerity in the hearts of many, however spiritua=
lly unenlightened they may be. It is this foundation of a simple faith in j=
ustice, honor, honesty and uprightness that sustains the whole structure of=
 civilized society. Where this is undermined and destroyed, nothing remains=
 except cruel tyranny on the one hand, or utter chaos on the other. Therefo=
re the Lord protects and preserves this simple faith in morality even where=
 there is no understanding of spiritual truth; and by it He maintains the c=
onditions of natural order and civil freedom in which alone, as the nourish=
ing soil, the seeds of a new spiritual faith and life may take root and gro=
w. Unless this were done it would indeed be all over with the human race; f=
or as the Scripture says: "Except the Lord of Hosts had left unto us a very=
 small remnant, we should have been as Sodom, and we should have been like =
unto Gomorrah."26</p><p>26. Isaiah 1:9.</p><p>However, although we sympathi=
ze with the struggle to maintain moral ideals, seeing in this the Protectiv=
e providence of the Lord guarding and nurturing the New Church in its tende=
r beginnings, yet we cannot regard this struggle as modern Christian thinke=
rs do, as the all-sufficient means for the redemption of mankind. </p><p></=

 Natural charity without spiritual truth cannot save any more than faith al=
one apart from deeds of charity can save. In spiritual things truth is just=
 as important, just as necessary, as in earthly things. Men do not succeed =
in conquering disease by good will and kindliness apart from medical knowle=
dge and skill. Nor can they expect to cure spiritual diseases by spiritual =
ignorance, however inspired they may be by charity. Natural charity that is=
 spiritually blind may remove evils temporarily from the outer life of men,=
 but not from their inmost heart and love. Only the spiritual truth of the =
Word can penetrate the inner recesses of the human heart to combat and over=
come the evil affections that lurk there unseen. As long as these remain th=
ey will repeatedly break through every barrier that is erected by men to ho=
ld them in check. Nothing will suffice except the Lord's own teaching to sh=
ow man how these evils may permanently be driven out. Wherefore it is writt=
en, "Except the Lord keep the city, the watchman waketh but in vain."27</p>=
<p>27. Psalm 127:1.</p><p>The fault we have to find with the modern attitud=
e of Christianity is not that it is a religion of life, or that it is devot=
ed to the actual performance of those deeds of charity which constitute mor=
ality. </p><p></p><div align=3D"Right">92</div><hr><p>

 Our objection is that it is a religion of external life divorced from all =
concern for spiritual truth, and thus cut off from the guidance of the Lord=
 and His Word. It is a morality founded on human intelligence alone, lookin=
g only to this world, ignoring the issues of eternal life. Man is a living =
spirit as well as a body; and if the spirit be separated from the body, onl=
y a corpse remains. By the same token, a man lives in a dual world--a spiri=
tual as well as a material world. A religion based on the health of the mat=
erial body and the well-being of natural society alone, to the total neglec=
t of spiritual things, is a body of religion without its soul. We hold no b=
rief for an other-worldly attitude that ignores the practical duties and re=
sponsibilities that confront us here on earth; but neither can we agree wit=
h a this-worldly attitude that ignores the deeper responsibilities placed u=
pon us as spiritual beings, destined for life in a spiritual world after de=
ath. The medieval Christians were right in regarding the spirit of man--his=
 duty to the Lord and his allegiance to the Divine truth of the Word--as pa=
ramount. Their error lay not in this, but in the failure to realize that me=

 If men today loved spiritual truth as they have learned to love the truth =
of nature; if they sought it out from the pages of revelation with the same=
 care and devotion as that which they expend on the discovery of scientific=
 truth; if they applied it to the removal of evil loves and false ideas in =
their own minds, as well as to the removal of the outward effects of these =
things in human society, and this with the same persistent endeavor as that=
 wherewith they apply natural truth to the cure of physical diseases, to th=
e lightening of human labor, and to the satisfaction of man's worldly desir=
es; then would we see real progress toward the establishment of the Lord's =
kingdom on the earth. For then they would be acting, not from self, but fro=
m the Lord, and under His Divine instruction and guidance. To bring this ab=
out is the real purpose for which Divine revelation is given. It is the rea=
l work of the church--a work which is completely disregarded by those who s=
o enthusiastically profess the "Social Gospel" of modern Christianity. </p>=

</p><p>CHAPTER VII</p><p>SECTARIANISM AND RELIGIOUS TOLERANCE</p><p>Since t=
he leaders of Christian thought have placed increasing emphasis upon the "S=
ocial Gospel" we note in the modern world a rapidly growing spirit of impat=
ience with sectarian strife. In the degree that the doctrine of salvation b=
y faith alone is relinquished in favor of the idea that the prime essential=
 of religion is a moral life, theological belief loses much of its traditio=
nal importance. Because those of widely differing faiths proclaim the same =
ideals of moral conduct there seems no reason why they should not work toge=
ther to promote the moral uplift of society. For this task widespread co-op=
eration is necessary, and to all who regard social uplift as the real missi=
on of the church, it appears to be nothing short of criminal that mere doct=
rinal differences should be allowed to prevent it. For this reason the advo=
cates of liberal Christianity have stressed the supreme importance of unive=
rsal fellowship, and the spirit of tolerance toward all religious faiths, b=
oth Christian and non-Christian. </p><p></p><div align=3D"Right">95</div><h=

</p><p>Under the impulse of this new attitude there has been a growing tend=
ency toward unity and co-operation among churches that was quite unheard of=
 a century ago. Sects that had long maintained separate and rival organizat=
ions, have in a number of instances reunited. As early as 1908 the Presbyte=
rian Church in the United States was formed from a merger of the parent bod=
y with an offshoot known as the Cumberland Presbyterian Church. Complete un=
ity was not attained, however, because several congregations refused to joi=
n the new organization. Later the Evangelical Synod of North America, and t=
he Reformed Church in the United States, united to establish the Evangelica=
l and Reformed Church. In Canada, the Methodist, the Presbyterian and the C=
ongregational churches united in 1935 to form the United Church of Canada. =
There have since been numerous other examples of similar mergers. Yet, in m=
any quarters, loyalty to established beliefs and practices is so strong, an=
d long-felt antagonisms are so deep that the effort to achieve unity has me=
t with almost impassable barriers, and the ultimate goal of a single Christ=
ian brotherhood still lies in the distant future.</p><p>On the other hand, =
the movement toward co-operation for the purpose of promoting a common soci=
al program, without disturbing the faith or the independent status of any p=
articipating body, has proved far easier. </p><p></p><div align=3D"Right">9=

 Out of this has come the World Council of Churches, organized just before =
the outbreak of World War II, with head-quarters ill Geneva, Switzerland. C=
onnected with this we now have the Federal Council of Churches of Christ in=
 America, which includes twenty-five different sects and denominations, and=
 brings together in mutual co-operation an estimated number of 27,749,000 m=
embers. This represents, of course, a strictly Protestant movement from whi=
ch the Catholic Church holds aloof. But quite recently, under the leadershi=
p of the late Pope John XXIII, there appears to be a serious effort to brin=
g the two great divisions of the Christian Church into closer co-operation.=
 Such co-operative action greatly increases the influence of the church upo=
n world affairs. It is the only means of implementing the "Social Gospel" o=
n a world-wide scale. It has undoubtedly helped to mobilize the forces of m=
orality against the threat of communism.</p><p>The spirit of religious tole=
ration that springs from a regard for spiritual freedom, and from charity t=
oward the neighbor, is something devoutly to be desired. The sectarian anta=
gonisms that have torn the Christian Church to shreds, and have led to hatr=
eds, cruelties, injustices and wars among those who profess to be brethren,=
 the children of one Heavenly Father--these certainly are to be deplored. <=

 They are a complete negation of the spirit of the Gospels. We cannot but s=
ympathize with those who are struggling to overcome these obvious evils, an=
d to win men back to a spirit of fellowship and good will. Because we profo=
undly believe that all men should be free to think, and above all to worshi=
p, each according to his own conscience, we have more sympathy with the ide=
a of co-operation among those of different faiths than we have for the urge=
 toward organic unity. External unity that does not represent internal harm=
ony of thought and affection inevitably becomes oppressive and destroys fre=
edom. It is true, and by the more candid thinkers it is admitted, that the =
differences which divide the Christian sects are for the most part non-esse=
ntial. All are united in acknowledging the basic creeds. Their doctrinal di=
fferences are largely matters of emphasis. In many cases these sects are se=
parated chiefly in regard to forms of government, modes of organization and=
 ritualistic practices. That these need not interfere with co-operation in =
a common endeavor to promote moral ideals which all hold in common is obvio=
us. That they need not lead to personal bitterness and mutual recrimination=
 is equally clear.</p><p>The Writings plainly teach that in matters of reli=
gion there will always be varieties of interpretation, and that this is not=
 only right but necessary to the perfection of the Lord's kingdom both on e=
arth and in the heavens. </p><p></p><div align=3D"Right">98</div><hr><p>

 In God, infinite things are distinctly one, but in creation innumerable th=
ings are necessarily various because each is finite and thus limited. Among=
 finite things the Infinite can be represented only by harmony in variety, =
and while truths are various, they are reduced into order and thus are brou=
ght into harmony by charity. In regard to this we read:</p><p>"As regards t=
he Lord's kingdom on earth, that is, His church, the case is, that inasmuch=
 as it has its doctrinal things from the literal sense of the Word, it cann=
ot but be various and diverse in respect to these doctrinal things; that is=
 to say, one society will profess one thing to be a truth of faith because =
it is so said in the Word, and another society will profess another thing, =
also because it is so said; and so on. Consequently, as the Lord's church h=
as its doctrinal things from the literal sense of the Word, it will everywh=
ere differ, and this not only as to societies, but sometimes as to the indi=
viduals in a society. Nevertheless a difference in the doctrinal things of =
faith does not prevent the church from being one, provided there is unanimi=
ty as to willing well and doing well."28</p><p>28. AC 3451. </p><p></p><div=

</p><p>Here we note that the harmony among varieties of faith arises from t=
he fact that all differences of faith are drawn from the Word as a common s=
ource that is universally recognized. Also that it is the spirit of charity=
, the endeavor to live according to the truth from good-will toward the nei=
ghbor that conjoins into one those who would otherwise be divided, and cons=
titutes of them all one church. Many differences of faith existed in the An=
cient Church, even in its prime, which nevertheless did not lead to mutual =
antagonisms, for we read:</p><p>"The doctrine of charity was the doctrine i=
n the ancient churches, and ... this doctrine conjoined all the churches, a=
nd so made one out of many; for they acknowledged as men of the church all =
who lived in the good of charity, and called them brethren, however greatly=
 they might be at variance in the truths which at this day are called the t=
ruths of faith. In these, one instructed another, and this was among their =
works of charity; nor were they indignant if one did not accede to the opin=
ion of another, knowing that everyone receives truth in proportion as he is=
 in good."29</p><p>29. AC 6628.</p><p>This should be the case also in the C=
hristian Church, as is taught in the following number: "In the Christian wo=
rld it is doctrinal matters that distinguish churches, and from them men ca=
ll themselves Roman Catholics, Lutherans, and Calvinists, or the Reformed a=

 It is from what is doctrinal alone that they are so called, which would ne=
ver be if they would make love to the Lord and charity toward the neighbor =
the principal of faith. Doctrinal matters would then be only varieties of o=
pinion concerning the mysteries of faith, which truly Christian men would l=
eave to every one to hold in accordance with his conscience, and would say =
in their hearts that a man is truly a Christian when he lives as a Christia=
n, that is, as the Lord teaches. Thus from all the differing churches there=
 would be made one church; and all the dissensions that come forth from doc=
trine alone would vanish; yea, all hatreds of one against another would be =
dissipated in a moment, and the Lord's kingdom would come upon the earth."3=
0</p><p>30. AC 1799.</p><p>The same applies to those who are not Christians=
, as is evident from the following: "Those who are outside the church and y=
et acknowledge one God, and live according to their religion in a kind of c=
harity toward the neighbor, are in communion with those who are of the chur=
ch, because no one is condemned who believes in God and lives well. From th=
is it is evident that the Lord's church is everywhere in the whole world, a=
lthough specifically it is where the Lord is acknowledged, and where the Wo=

</p><p>From all this it might appear that the modern movement toward inters=
ectarian co-operation is entirely in accord with the teaching of the Writin=
gs, and that it foreshadows a genuine revival of true Christianity. But a v=
ital element is lacking, namely, a knowledge of what true charity is--that =
kind of charity which alone has power to bring varieties of faith into inte=
rnal unity. Men suppose that charity consists in works looking toward the e=
xternal welfare of society. They identify it with what is done from friends=
hip, amiability, kindness; from politeness and civility; from pity and comp=
assion toward those who are in need, or who are suffering. Yet we are taugh=
t that all these may exist where there is no charity, but only the thought =
of self, of merit, of reward, often so subtly concealed as to be quite unre=
cognized, even by one's self. Such natural charity may be entirely sincere =
with those who mistake it for charity itself, as is the case with children =
and with many of the simple good in the Christian world. But it has not the=
 power to bring men into internal harmony, or to establish permanent peace =
among them; and this because, however sincere, it lacks the knowledge and t=
hus the wisdom necessary to achieve its purpose? </p><p></p><div align=3D"R=

 We read concerning it that "friendship is not charity, and still less is p=
oliteness charity--these are degrees below charity; and the more they deriv=
e from charity the more sincere they are."32 Even naturally it is evident t=
hat we must know how to be of real benefit to the neighbor. One who does no=
t know this may, even from the deepest and the most sincere friendship, act=
 so ill-advisedly as to do injury to the neighbor instead of the good which=
 he intended. Real good can be accomplished only by one who is well informe=
d, and who acts intelligently at the same time as he exercises mercy. This =
is equally true if we have in view the permanent benefit of society. Whatev=
er is permanent has to do with the spirit, the inner life of man, and not m=
erely with his physical or material well-being. It is not only possible, bu=
t altogether probable, that a social uplift of society, having regard to th=
e natural world alone, so far from ministering to the permanent welfare of =
mankind, may do it injury. This is true even on the moral plane, for materi=
al benefits which discourage initiative, deprive men of responsibility, ren=
der them dependent and satisfied to receive without giving adequate return-=
-such benefits weaken man's moral fiber, even while they improve his physic=
al welfare.</p><p>32. AC 1158. </p><p></p><div align=3D"Right">103</div><hr=

</p><p>The spiritual truth of the Word alone teaches men what genuine chari=
ty is. It teaches us that true charity is not from man, but solely from the=
 Lord. It is nothing but the Lord's love received in human hearts--the Lord=
's love for the eternal salvation of all men. Thus it is love of the neighb=
or that looks first of all to his spiritual welfare, and to his natural wel=
fare not as an end in itself, but merely as a means to his eternal salvatio=
n. It is therefore other-worldly, having spiritual ends in view. And since =
we can have no knowledge of spiritual things except from Divine revelation =
spiritually understood, it is a spirit of charity that looks to the Lord fo=
r guidance, to the Word for instruction, and especially to the internal, th=
e spiritual meaning of the Word, wherein alone can be found the laws of spi=
ritual life. Without a knowledge of these laws our efforts to promote the r=
eal welfare of society, however sincere, are sure to be misguided, and ther=
efore to fall short of their mark. For this reason, the very essence of tru=
e charity is a love of spiritual truth. That is why we are taught that ther=
e are three essentials of the church, namely, "an acknowledgment of the Div=
inity of the Lord, the acknowledgment of the holiness of the Word, and the =
life which is called charity. </p><p></p><div align=3D"Right">104</div><hr>=

 According to the life which is charity, every one has faith; from the Word=
 is the knowledge of what the life should be; and from the Lord are reforma=
tion and salvation. If these three had been held as essentials of the churc=
h, intellectual dissensions would not have divided but only varied it, as l=
ight varies colors in beautiful objects, and as various gems give beauty in=
 the crown of a king."33 Here the three essentials of the church are given =
in the order of their importance. First comes an acknowledgment of the Divi=
nity of the Lord. From this arises the acknowledgment of the holiness of th=
e Word; and from these two together comes that kind of charity which brings=
 internal unity, internal harmony, among varieties of faith.</p><p>33. DP 2=
59.</p><p>Now we have seen that in the modern Christian world the Divinity =
of the Lord is increasingly questioned or denied. The holiness of the Word,=
 and thence the Divine authority of the Word, are increasingly called into =
question. There is little or no interest in spiritual truth, the truth, tha=
t is, concerning God, and heaven, and eternal life. The charity that is sou=
ght is a charity that looks to the external world alone, that seeks to impr=
ove the social and economic conditions of earthly society, and this by the =
exercise of human intelligence apart from Divine guidance or instruction. <=

 It is a charity, therefore, that is based, not on a common love of spiritu=
al truth; not on a mutual desire to learn, to understand, and to live accor=
ding to spiritual laws; but rather on a common attitude of indifference to =
the inner meaning of the Sacred Scripture, and upon a general agreement to =
disregard any consideration of the spiritual world and the life after death=
. For this reason, while we have religious conscience in every variety of s=
incere faith and worship; while we heartily approve of mutual co-operation =
and fellowship among the sects of Christendom which have been so long and s=
o bitterly divided; while indeed we see in this movement the hand of provid=
ence, preserving external freedom and protecting the foundations of justice=
, of order, and of morality on which alone a new spiritual religion can be =
built; still we see in it only a temporary palliative and not a permanent c=
ure of the deep-seated ills that afflict our fallen race. More than this is=

 Men must come to see that the first duty of the church is not to promote t=
he economic, or even the moral welfare of mankind. Social uplift is not its=
 real mission. The function of the church is to open for men the spiritual =
meaning of the Word; to teach them the spiritual laws of life; to turn thei=
r eyes toward heaven, and toward the Lord, that they may learn how to serve=
 Him, how to keep His law and do His will. The Lord alone can teach men how=
 to love one another, and thus how to exercise genuine charity toward one a=
nother. He alone can form the hearts of men together in unity, and guide th=
eir steps in the way of peace. Therefore charity must be inspired by a love=
 of spiritual truth, and unity must be based on a common endeavor to unders=
tand that truth, and to live according to it. This is the ideal given us in=
 the Writings. It is the goal toward which the New Church must strive. For =
only out of this love and this endeavor can the Lord raise up a new spirit =
of charity in the hearts of men, a spirit of charity that looks to what is =
eternal, that is intelligent from the Word, that has power to bring varieti=
es of faith and of religious life into real internal harmony, and thus that=
 makes the church in every land and with every people spiritually one. </p>=

</p><p>CHAPTER VIII</p><p>TOLERANCE IN THE NEW CHURCH</p><p>The Writings ev=
erywhere point to unity in the New Church as an ideal for which we should s=
trive unceasingly. The teaching is that wherever genuine charity exists it =
brings unity with it, and this spontaneously, without fail, inevitable cons=
equence? Conversely, if there be not unity it is a sure sign and indication=
 that charity is lacking. Since the very essential of the church is charity=
; since the church is spiritually alive only as far as the spirit of charit=
y is active in it, it follows that to strive for unity, to labor for its at=
tainment and for its preservation is the same thing as to strive and labor =
for the establishment of the church itself. It should be clearly understood=
, however, that the unity here meant, the unity to which genuine charity le=
ads, is not external organic unity in one world-wide organization. It is no=
t unity under a single ecclesiastical government? It is a unity of the spir=
it, of internal affection that is based on a universal acknowledgment of th=
e Lord as He is revealed in the Heavenly Doctrine. It is one that springs f=
rom the acknowledgment that the Lord alone has power to build the church, t=
hat He alone can teach men and lead them by means of His Word. </p><p></p><=

 The Heavenly Doctrine itself is the very essential church, and wherever me=
n receive this doctrine in love and faith, wherever they sincerely strive t=
o live according to their best understanding of its teachings, there the Ne=
w Church exists.</p><p>Among those who are at one in regard to this acknowl=
edgment there may be wide variety of doctrinal interpretation, of ritual ob=
servance and of religious custom. There may be many independent organizatio=
ns, each performing a distinct use. But if charity prevails, all these toge=
ther can still make one church, united by internal bonds. There can be amon=
g them mutual sympathy, co-operation in common uses, and an interchange of =
benefits, all contributing to the universal end of establishing, spreading =
and perfecting the kingdom of the Lord on earth. The ideal of the General C=
hurch from ifs inception has been that, in every country, and with every ra=
ce and nationality, the church should have complete freedom to develop from=
 the Writings themselves in accord with the form of mind, the native custom=
s and modes of life that are characteristic of each locality, with no shado=
w of coercion from any alien source, nor from any central organization. </p=

 The government of the General Church today extends to many distant parts o=
f the world, but only because the beginnings of the church in those parts a=
re not yet ready or able to sustain their own ecclesiastical organizations.=
 We look forward to the time when there will be completely independent bodi=
es of the New Church in every land, all nevertheless being united by a comm=
on acknowledgment of the Heavenly Doctrine as the Divine law of life. The f=
act that our body is at present so widespread emphasizes the need for a bro=
ad tolerance toward differences of view, toward varieties of doctrinal inte=
rpretation and application to life. Such differences actually exist, due to=
 national and racial characteristics, and also to various degrees of instru=
ction in the Heavenly Doctrine. But in so far as these modes of thought and=
 life are adopted with sincere conviction that they are supported by the Wr=
itings, they give no occasion for concern, and still less for separation. W=
e are impressed most of all, not by the minor and superficial differences w=
e find, but by the remarkable unity that exists among all our General Churc=
h societies--a unity of purpose and of fundamental loyalty to the plain tea=
ching of the Writings that makes them internally one in deep spiritual affe=
ction and mutual sympathy. </p><p></p><div align=3D"Right">111</div><hr><p>

</p><p>As we are aware, there are differences of doctrinal opinion among us=
 in our own country, and in the Bryn Athyn Society. Yet because there is a =
spirit of charity arising from a common love of the Writings, and of loyalt=
y to their teaching, these differences do not divide us. On the contrary, s=
uch differences all contribute to the broader and more perfect understandin=
g of the Writings with each one of us. This is because they stimulate indiv=
idual thought, study and reflection. They stress the importance of rational=
 judgment and critical analysis on the part of each member of the church. T=
hey help us to avoid falling into a persuasive faith that rests upon what w=
e are told, rather than upon what we clearly see for ourselves, directly fr=
om the Writings. This will continue to be the case as long as we recognize =
the freedom of others to think and will according to their own conscience, =
in order that each one may be led and taught immediately by the Lord. It wi=
ll continue as long as there is a spirit of internal humility that makes us=
 willing to listen with patience to opposing views, and to give them calm c=
onsideration, while at the same time it restrains us from any attempt to fo=
rce our personal opinions upon others. Where there is real freedom of thoug=
ht, of speech and of life, charity will order these varieties of view into =
harmonious co-operation for the furtherance of those uses which we all love=
 in common, and for the promotion of which we continually need one another'=
s help. </p><p></p><div align=3D"Right">112</div><hr><p>

 Furthermore, if all of those holding various views are constantly going ba=
ck to the Writings to examine and correct their opinions, differences are b=
ound to grow less as knowledge, understanding and insight increase. All thi=
s is generally recognized among us, and the history of our body of the chur=
ch bears testimony to an earnest endeavor to make this spirit a reality, in=
 spite of the severe temptations to which, from time to time, the church ha=
s been subjected. Indeed, it is not in times of peace, so much as in times =
of stress, that charity is put to the test. This is one reason why, in prov=
idence, the church is called upon to pass through trials and conflicts by w=
hich alone its hidden weaknesses may come into view, and its spirit be rous=
ed to overcome them.</p><p>So far we have been considering unity among thos=
e of the church who fully recognize the Divinity and the supreme authority =
of the Heavenly Doctrine. Where this common acknowledgment exists it consti=
tutes a deep uniting bond. But there are other bodies of the church with wh=
om this bond is lacking. All do not see in the same light the intrinsic nat=
ure and status of the Writings. </p><p></p><div align=3D"Right">113</div><h=

 This is not surprising because in them the Lord speaks to men in such an u=
tterly new and unaccustomed way. He gives His Word in a different form, and=
 one that could not possibly have been foreseen or anticipated before the e=
vent. Men have long-established ideas concerning the Word, how it must be g=
iven, and what it must be like, and these ideas cannot easily be dislodged.=
 This fact places very real difficulties in the way of a complete recogniti=
on of the Writings as the Word of God. In consequence we find many shades o=
f opinion concerning them. Some have regarded them as no more than a remark=
ably enlightened commentary on the Bible, a commentary that is limited in a=
uthority to the knowledge and the insight of which Emanuel Swedenborg was c=
apable. Others have acknowledged them to be Divinely inspired and authorita=
tive in part, but in part human and fallible. Others again have held that t=
hey are a Divine revelation while at the same time denying that they are th=
e Word, or that they are in ally way equal in authority to the Old and New =
Testaments. And still others, while proclaiming them to be the Word, conten=
d that their authority resides, not in their plain and literal statements, =
but in these together with an "internal sense," perceived and infallibly un=
derstood by regenerating men. </p><p></p><div align=3D"Right">114</div><hr>=

</p><p>The Academy, and its successor the General Church, were founded on t=
he belief that the Writings are the Word of the Lord to the New Church, and=
 that their plain teachings are the only final authority in all matters of =
doctrine and of religious life. To us this has meant that the Writings them=
selves are the church in its very essence, and in its Divine perfection; th=
e church as the Lord sees it in potency, and as He wills it to become in ac=
tuality with men and angels. It has meant that the church comes into existe=
nce in the minds and hearts of men as far as the teaching of the Writings i=
s received in faith and life. The church in its widest aspect, composed of =
many organizations among which there is internal unity, consists of all who=
 are in the sincere desire, and thus in the constant endeavor, to learn the=
 Heavenly Doctrine, and to receive it as the Divine law of their life. We h=
ave believed that every phase, every activity of human life, should be unde=
r this Divine law. So believing, we have sought for principles in the Writi=
ngs to guide us in the development of church government and organization, o=
f worship and ritual, of education and social life, of marriage and the hom=
e, of civil and business relationships, as well as in the development of in=
dividual character and in personal regeneration. In fact, we have believed =
that regeneration cannot be effected apart from these more external respons=
ibilities, but solely by meeting them in the way that the Lord Himself dire=
cts, from love to Him, from charity toward the neighbor, and from a desire =
to obey the precepts of His Word. </p><p></p><div align=3D"Right">115</div>=

</p><p>This attitude toward the Writings has been the distinguishing charac=
teristic of the Academy, and later of the General church. It has opened bef=
ore us a vision of uses to be performed uses that have appeared to us as im=
mediate, pressing, and essential to the permanent establishment of the New =
Church on the earth. We have seen the performance of these uses as our plai=
n duty, Divinely enjoined upon us. To perform them then becomes a matter of=
 conscience which we can neither evade nor ignore. The pursuit of these use=
s has, in consequence, determined in large policies of our church.</p><p>Ha=
d freedom been granted to follow these policies, and to perform these uses,=
 there need have been no separation, in spite of the wide differences of op=
inion that existed in the church in regard to the nature of the Writings. B=
ut unfortunately (although quite naturally), those who hold fundamentally d=
ifferent views of the Writings have widely divergent ideas as to what will =
best promote the growth of the church. Each seeks, therefore, to lead the c=
hurch in a different direction. </p><p></p><div align=3D"Right">116</div><h=

 Where leadership of an organization is divided, disorder and confusion ine=
vitably result, and freedom is inhibited or destroyed in order that each ma=
y be free to follow the path his own conscience dictates, independent organ=
izations become necessary?</p><p>When this situation arises, separation, gr=
ievous as it is, and causing as it does suffering from deep wounds that tak=
e long to heal, still cannot be avoided. It is, then, right and of order th=
at separation should take place, because freedom of thought, of will and of=
 action, in all matters of religion is of paramount importance. Without it =
the church cannot grow. Nor can there be freedom without order. These two t=
hings must he preserved at all cost, even if, in order to do so we are comp=
elled to relinquish our treasured unity. Organic unity is desirable, but mo=
re precious still is an internal unity based on a common acceptance of the =
Writings as our only source of Divine instruction and guidance. But most es=
sential of all is spiritual freedom. And let us be clear in recognizing tha=
t even among bodies of the church that differ basically as to their concept=
 of the Writings, there may still be internal unity if genuine charity prev=
ails. It cannot produce as close or as intimate a relationship as that whic=
h exists with those of the same fundamental faith, because divergent belief=
s look in different directions and strive for different objectives. </p><p>=

vergent bodies of the New Church is not such as to condone what is false. I=
t is not one that should ignore differences and indiscriminately mingle opp=
osites that cannot be reconciled. It is a charity that clearly recognizes d=
istinctions, and that, without malice or recrimination, provides for freedo=
m, and this from a deep regard for the freedom of others as well as for our=
 own. It is a charity that springs from internal humility, from an acknowle=
dgment of our own weakness, our own proneness to error, and from an acknowl=
edgment that the Lord in His providence alone can build His church, and tha=
t He does so often in ways far beyond our human understanding. He must buil=
d it in accord with the free choice of men, and in adaptation to their stat=
es. He has power to build it in spite of their errors, by a gentle and merc=

 If it were not so we also would be without hope of salvation, and our labo=
rs for the establishment of the church would he in vain. None of us can avo=
id errors. None of us can attain to a perfect understanding of the Writings=
. None of us is immune from the blindness that is induced by ignorance, by =
proprial affections, or by the pressure of the world about us? True charity=
, therefore, withholds us from making internal judgments concerning either =
the individuals or the bodies of the church that differ from us in matters =
of doctrine. Men may honestly come to opposite conclusions, even with regar=
d to the nature of the Writings, and still sincerely believe that in doing =
so they are loyally following the teachings of the Lord given therein. I kn=
ow people who find it unthinkable to call the Writings the Word, because ti=
le books of the Word are listed in the Writings themselves with no mention =
of that which the Lord has revealed in His second coming. I have no doubt t=
hat many accept the authority of derived doctrine as final because they bel=
ieve, quite sincerely, that the Writings can and must be authoritatively in=
terpreted by regenerating men. Charity demands that we attribute sincerity =
of purpose to those who disagree with us, and we must take such sincerity f=
or granted unless overt acts and open declarations prove it to be otherwise=

</p><p>CHAPTER IX</p><p>THE NEW CHURCH IN THE CHRISTIAN WORLD</p><p>To reca=
pitulate briefly what has thus far been established to show that the faith =
of modern Christianity is directly opposite at every vital point to the tru=
th now revealed in the Writings of the New Church:</p><p>The three essentia=
ls of a true Christian faith, as stated in the Writings are: the acknowledg=
ment of the Divinity of Jesus Christ; the acknowledgment of the Divinity, t=
he holiness, and consequently the authority of the Word; and a life of char=
ity that springs from these two, and that looks in all things to man s spir=
itual and eternal welfare.</p><p>In contrast to this, the prevailing view o=
f the modern Christian world is that Jesus Christ was a man, similar in all=
 respects to other men except for the fact that He was blessed with an inco=
mparable insight into moral truth. The Sacred Scripture is regarded as a bo=
ok of moral precepts which, however, possess no moral authority, but rather=
 reflect the superstitions and primitive ideas of the times in which they w=
ere written. And charity is thought of as a moral life that is entirely ind=
ependent of theological belief, and one that looks to the external welfare =
of human society without any concern for the life after death. </p><p></p><=

</p><p>This direct opposition to the three essentials of the New Church is,=
 as we have noted, the professed belief of liberal Protestantism; but it is=
 so widely accepted in the present day Christian world that it is taken for=
 granted, and is unconsciously implied in religious literature and in the p=
ublic pronouncements of many popular leaders of Christian thought, regardle=
ss of their sectarian affiliation. It is manifested in the growing movement=
 toward inter-denominational co-operation, and in the welcome acceptance of=
 the "Social Gospel." No one can doubt, therefore, that it represents the p=
revailing temper of our times in regard to the faith and life of the Christ=
ian religion. What then, we may ask, should be the attitude of the New Chur=
ch toward this Christian world? Is there some basis for internal unity betw=
een them? If so, what kind of charity is required to bring them into harmon=
ious co-operation and mutual sympathy?</p><p>The Writings lead us to the de=
finite conclusion that there is such a basis, and that a bond of charity sh=
ould exist, not between opposite tenets of faith, but between the members o=
f the New Church and all in the Christian world who are sincere and earnest=
 in their endeavor to lead a good life to the best of their knowledge and b=
elief. </p><p></p><div align=3D"Right">124</div><hr><p>

 If the teaching of the Writings is true concerning the Divinity of Jesus C=
hrist, the holiness of the Word, and the life of charity, then the doctrine=
 of the modern Christian Church in regard to these vital questions of theol=
ogy is not true. If a life according to what the Writings teach is truly go=
od in that it leads to the permanent spiritual welfare of mankind, then a l=
ife according to the opposite teaching cannot be truly good. It cannot lead=
 to that same objective, even though it may appear outwardly to promote the=
 well-being of earthly society. It must be obvious to everyone that even th=
e infinite mercy of the Lord cannot bring two such opposites into harmoniou=
s agreement. No one can love them both, or serve them both at the same time=
 in equal degree. No one can serve two such masters because to do so is to =
go at the same time in opposite directions. Choice between such opposing mo=
des of thought and life is imperative. In the spiritual world, those who fr=
eely choose falsity instead of truth, and the life of falsity instead of th=
e life of truth, are separated from those who make the opposite choice. Thi=
s separation is spontaneous and unavoidable because such opposites negate e=
ach other. </p><p></p><div align=3D"Right">125</div><hr><p>

 Wherever they come together they fight until one has conquered the other a=
nd driven it out, or has reduced it to complete subservience. That is why t=
here is an impassable chasm, between heaven and hell, as Abraham, in the pa=
rable, said to the rich man in he11: "Between us and you there is a great g=
ulf fixed: so that they who would pass from hence to you cannot; neither ca=
n they pass to us that would come from thence."34</p><p>34. Luke 16:26.</p>=
<p>With men, however, as long as they live on earth, and for some time afte=
r death, there is no such separation. These two opposites exist together in=
 every human mind, locked in a struggle for ascendancy, the outcome of whic=
h has not yet been determined. This inner conflict ceases only after men ha=
ve passed through the world of spirits, and have been prepared for their fi=
nal place in heaven or in hell. It can be settled only by the free choice o=
f the man himself. Inmostly the choice is not between truth and falsity, bu=
t rather between love to the Lord, in whatever form He map appear to a man,=
 and the love of self, which is subtly exalted by falsity and made to appea=
r supreme.</p><p>In the natural world the issue is often obscured because f=
alsity is mistaken for truth, and in its light evil appears as good. </p><p=

 For this reason men on earth cannot be judged as to their interior quality=
 by the truth or the falsity of the faith they profess. The Lord, in His pr=
ovidence, assures that a right choice may be possible to those of every rel=
igion wherein there is some acknowledgment of a God, and a life from consci=
ence according to whatever is believed to be the law of God. He provides th=
at men may freely choose what they believe to be true, as against what they=
 think is false; and doing so they choose what they regard as good in prefe=
rence to "hat they consider to be evil. In the sight of the Lord every man =
is interiorly good who makes such a choice, no matter how mistaken his reli=
gious faith may be. Since some men make this choice, and others do not, it =
follows that in every religion there are both those who are interiorly good=
, and those who interiorly evil. Because this choice is made in secret it i=
s not obvious to others; nor is it known to the man himself since no one ca=
n perceive with certainty, his deepest motives. The Lord alone knows the he=
arts of all the children of men.</p><p>Since the Lord judges men, not accor=
ding to what they believe, but according to their intentions and ends, ther=
efore, where the intention is to keep the commandments of God, there in His=
 sight is the church. This church is universal, interpenetrating all religi=
ons, irrespective of their creeds. </p><p></p><div align=3D"Right">127</div=

 It includes every one in the whole world who, according to his best lights=
, is sincere, and faithful to what he believes to be true and right. All su=
ch taken together constitute the Church Universal spoken of in the Writings=
. This however is a church, not in actuality, but only in potency. The true=
 church can exist in actuality only where the Lord is known and loved, wher=
e the Word is spiritually understood, at least to some extent, and where me=
n are striving to live according to its spiritual laws. But the church exis=
ts in potency wherever there is innocence, wherever men are willing to be t=

reception of Divine truth.</p><p>All who belong to this potential church, a=
lthough they are scattered like sheep having no shepherd, are nevertheless =
under the constant, though secret guidance of the Lord, who, with all the p=
ower of His providence, watches over them, and protects their spiritual lif=
e with infinite care and tenderness. As He Himself said in His prayer at th=
e Last Supper; "Those that Thou gavest Me I have kept, and none of them is =
lost but the son of perdition."35 By this He meant that all men have been r=
edeemed, and no one is condemned who is willing to be saved. </p><p></p><di=

 Falsities of doctrine innocently believed, and evils of life springing fro=

trines that we know to be false, nor for a mode of life that is contrary to=
 what we know from the Word to be good, still we can hope and believe that =
in the midst of the spiritual darkness which envelopes the modern Christian=
 world, there still are many who are sincere in heart. We cannot know with =
certainty who they are, but, without making internal judgments of any indiv=
idual, we can cultivate a spirit of charity toward the qualities of innocen=
ce and sincerity in all who manifest them openly in speech and act. With th=
ese we can have a bond of mutual sympathy, of friendship, and of wholeheart=

 the Lord in His Divine Human and rejoice in the light of spiritual truth n=

 No genuine faith can be imposed upon any one against his will. That is why=
 the Lord, with such infinite patience, protects the tender remains of reli=
gion in which innocence abides. He has primary concern for the freedom by w=
hich alone men can be led to see the truth interiorly, to acknowledge it fr=
om the heart, and to love it; wherefore it is said of Him, "A bruised reed =
shall He not break, and the smoking flax shall He not quench: He shall brin=
g forth judgment unto truth."36</p><p>36. Isaiah 42:3.</p><p>In this respec=
t we should co-operate with the Lord by the exercise of patience and forbea=
rance. Nor should there be in our spirit of charity the slightest shadow of=
 condescension, for after all, we are not very far removed from the state o=
f those in the Christian world who, in the midst of darkness, are strugglin=
g toward the light. We ourselves are only beginning to understand the truth=
 of the Writings. We have the Christian world within us, as well as around =
us. The light of the truth that shines from the pages of the Heavenly Doctr=
ine is largely obscured in our minds by clouds of fallacies and appearances=
 and mistaken ideas that lie deeply imbedded in our thought, as well as by =
proprial affections that continue in possession of our hearts. </p><p></p><=

 The truth of the Writings is not ours, even if we understand it, except to=
 the degree that it actually governs our lives and lifts our love above the=
 things of self and the world to the things of heaven, and supremely to the=
 Lord. In our vacillating endeavor to make real the ideals of life which th=
e Writings set before us, we are closely akin to those in the Church Univer=
sal who, without any knowledge of the Writings, are still striving to make =
their life acceptable to God and obedient to His law.</p><p>Nevertheless, t=
he charity that constitutes a bond of internal unity between the Church Spe=
cific and the Church Universal must derive its soul from a supreme devotion=
 to the Lord, and to His truth as revealed in the Heavenly Doctrine. The Ch=
urch Universal, in the merciful providence of the Lord, can provide for the=
 salvation of every individual who, either here or in the life to come, is =
willing to be taught and led by the Lord; but it cannot provide for the est=
ablishment of the Lord's kingdom on the earth. Natural good, even if innoce=
nce be in it, has no power to overcome the interior evils that plague the h=
uman race. It has no power of judgment that can with assurance distinguish =
truth from falsity, or genuine good from its counterfeit. Concerning this t=

 They are like feathers in the wind."37 The real quality of good is accordi=

 We cannot conceal this truth, nor compromise it, nor ignore it, in order t=
o conform to the ideas of charity that are prevalent in the Christian world=

understanding of the Divine truth, and to increase our ability to apply it =
intelligently to the reformation of our own lives. This comes first because=
 we cannot see to remove the mote from our brother's eye until we have remo=
ved the beam that is in our own eye. We cannot be of real service in spread=
ing the faith of the New Church to others unless we are deeply concerned wi=
th the true establishment of that faith in our own hearts and lives. Spirit=
ual charity, like natural charity, begins at home, and radiates thence to t=
hose around. Wherefore the church as an organization must grow as the churc=
h grows within each one. Indeed, the church itself is always within man, an=
d the church as an organization, rightly considered, consists of those who =
have the church within them. Because of this, internal evangelization comes=
 first, and external evangelization follows. By internal evangelization we =
mean the constant feeding and upbuilding of the understanding and life of t=
he truth with those who are already members of the church, to the end that =
the church may be constantly growing in spirit, and from this, may grow in =

 our care. We must see that these children are protected from the influence=
s which so distort the minds of the young as to make it difficult, or even =
impossible for them on reaching adult age to accept the teaching of the Wri=
tings. All little children delight in the stories of the Word, and respond =
affirmatively to teaching about the Lord and heaven. But modern education s=
o emphasizes the imperative need for material things, so concentrates upon =
the acquisition of scientific knowledge, and upon the struggle for physical=
 and mechanical skills, that religion is given but scant consideration. Tha=
t kind of education insinuates such reliance upon natural truth to solve al=
l the problems of human life, and casts such doubt upon the reliability of =
any spiritual teaching, that an unbiased approach to the Writings as a Divi=
ne revelation is made extremely difficult when adult age is reached. It is =
our duty to see that our children, by their education, are led to the Lord,=
 that their minds are kept open to His truth, and that their will is render=
ed pliable to His leading. To fulfill this responsibility we have to act co=
ntrary to the popular trend of modern education, which is to make citizensh=
