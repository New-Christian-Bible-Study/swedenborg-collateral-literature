This volume by Rev. Dr. Bayley presents a series of sermons interpreting the Book of Revelation through the lens of New Church doctrine, focusing on the symbolic and spiritual meanings behind its vivid imagery. Bayley explains that the magnificent scenes described by John are not literal prophecies but spiritual representations of the states of the church, the workings of Divine Providence, and the nearness of the spiritual world to our own. The sermons emphasize the Lord's glorified humanity as the center of all spiritual blessings, the role of the church as a bearer of divine light, and the ultimate victory of good over evil. Throughout, Bayley encourages readers to look beyond surface interpretations and find personal and collective spiritual lessons in the apocalyptic visions of Revelation.
