This comprehensive work by Hugo Lj. Odhner presents a detailed exploration of the spiritual world as revealed in the Writings of Emanuel Swedenborg, covering topics from the transition from earthly life to the afterlife, the structure and nature of heaven and hell, and the events of the Last Judgment. The book examines the historical development of beliefs about the afterlife across different religions and cultures, contrasting these with the rational and systematic revelation provided by Swedenborg's spiritual experiences and teachings. Odhner emphasizes that the spiritual world is a real, organized realm with its own laws and structure, where angels and spirits live in societies and perform specific uses, and where the human spirit continues to develop and grow after death. The work serves as both a doctrinal study and a practical guide for understanding the nature of eternal life, the importance of spiritual preparation, and the reality of the spiritual dimension that surrounds and influences our natural existence.
