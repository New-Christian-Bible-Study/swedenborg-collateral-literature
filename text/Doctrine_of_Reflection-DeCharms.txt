This series of lectures by George de Charms explores the doctrine of reflection as revealed in the Writings of Emanuel Swedenborg, emphasizing its foundational role in consciousness, spiritual growth, and human freedom. The work explains that reflection is the process by which we become aware of sensations, thoughts, and spiritual realities, and that it underlies all mental activity, distinguishing humans from animals. De Charms discusses how reflection enables moral and spiritual choice, shapes our experience of both the natural and spiritual worlds, and is essential for regeneration and the establishment of the Lord's kingdom on earth. The lectures highlight the unique contribution of the New Church in revealing the laws of reflection, offering practical insights for personal development and spiritual life.
