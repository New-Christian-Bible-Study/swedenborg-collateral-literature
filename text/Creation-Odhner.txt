This book, "Creation" by Hugo Lj. Odhner, is a collection of doctrinal essays that explore the New Church understanding of creation, drawing heavily from the theological writings of Emanuel Swedenborg. The work presents a comprehensive view of creation, not as a singular event, but as a continuous process involving both the spiritual and natural worlds, with the ultimate purpose of forming a heaven from the human race.

The book is divided into several essays, each focusing on a specific aspect of the doctrine of creation:

*   **God and Creation:** This introductory essay establishes the foundational principle that God is the Creator of the universe. It contrasts the New Church view with other philosophical and religious ideas, such as the eternity of matter or creation from nothing. The author emphasizes that a true understanding of creation requires moving beyond natural ideas of space and time and embracing a spiritual concept of God as Divine Love and Wisdom, or God-Man.

*   **The Spiritual Sun:** This essay explains the role of the spiritual Sun as the first and universal substance of creation, a proceeding from the Lord's Divine Love and Wisdom. It distinguishes between the "living" spiritual Sun and the "dead" natural sun, and clarifies that the spiritual Sun is not God Himself but the medium through which the Divine proceeds into creation. The essay also touches upon the complex process of "finition," by which the infinite Divine creates the finite without becoming finite itself.

*   **Successive Spheres of the Spiritual Sun:** This section elaborates on the creation of the spiritual world through the formation of successive spiritual atmospheres from the spiritual Sun. These atmospheres, which are substantial and discrete, serve as the media for the transmission of Divine life, love, and wisdom, and form the basis for the three heavens. The essay explains that these spiritual atmospheres are the causes of all things in the natural world.

*   **The Sequence of Creation:** This essay discusses the relationship and order between the spiritual and natural creations. It explains that the natural world was created as a world of effects to serve as a fixed and permanent basis for the spiritual world of causes. The creation of the natural world, with its own sun and atmospheres, is presented as a process corresponding to the spiritual creation. The essay also touches upon Swedenborg's scientific theories of cosmology as a way to understand the principles of natural creation.

*   **The Creation of Organic Forms:** This section focuses on the origin of life on earth, explaining that both the vegetable and animal kingdoms have a spiritual origin. Life is not inherent in matter but flows in from the spiritual world. The essay distinguishes between the "natural form" of plants and the "spiritual form" of animals, both of which are ultimately derived from the Divine. It emphasizes that the purpose of all organic creation is to serve uses that ultimately look to man.

*   **Human Beings - The End of Creation:** This concluding essay presents humanity as the ultimate end and purpose of creation. It explains that humans are created in the image and likeness of God, with a soul that contains all the degrees of both the spiritual and natural worlds. The essay distinguishes the human soul from the souls of animals, highlighting the human capacity for rationality, spiritual freedom, and eternal life. The creation of the human body is described as a process guided by the soul and the influx from the "Greatest Human" (heaven). The essay concludes by explaining that the spiritual world itself, with all its creations, is a representative image of the affections and thoughts of its angelic inhabitants, and that the ultimate purpose of all creation is the eternal conjunction of the Creator with the created.

In essence, "Creation" by Hugo Lj. Odhner is a profound and detailed exploration of the New Church cosmology, providing a spiritual and philosophical framework for understanding the origin, nature, and purpose of the universe and humanity's place within it. It is a work that seeks to reconcile faith and reason by presenting a rational and coherent doctrine of creation based on divine revelation.
