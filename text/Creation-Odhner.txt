This doctrinal essay explores the New Church understanding of creation, emphasizing that God created the universe out of His own substance, which is Love itself, and that all things in the natural world are effects produced by spiritual causes. The work distinguishes between the literal and spiritual meanings of the Genesis creation story, explaining that the six days of creation symbolize the stages of human regeneration as well as the establishment of the Most Ancient Church. It discusses the philosophical and theological challenges of conceiving how the Infinite could produce the finite, ultimately concluding that creation involves a discrete step from the Divine to the created, mediated by the spiritual world and the spiritual Sun. Throughout, the author stresses that true wisdom comes from understanding creation in spiritual rather than merely natural terms, and that the purpose of creation is for the Divine Love to create beings who can freely reciprocate that love.
