This document, "Application of Doctrine" by George De Charms, is a series of theological discourses that explore the practical application of the doctrines of the New Church, as revealed in the writings of Emanuel Swedenborg. The central theme is that true religion is not merely a matter of belief or ritual, but of life, and that the doctrines of the New Church are meant to be applied to the inner life of the spirit to effect a fundamental change in a person's loves and character.

The work is divided into several sections, each addressing a key aspect of New Church theology and its application:

*   **Introduction:** This section establishes the foundational belief of the New Church: that the theological writings of Emanuel Swedenborg constitute the Second Coming of the Lord. It emphasizes that the purpose of this new revelation is to establish a new, distinct Christian Church based on a radically different understanding of God, redemption, and the religious life. The author argues that the most crucial aspect of this new faith is the application of its doctrines to life, which goes beyond external observances to a transformation of the inner self.

*   **The Spirit of Humility:** This section contrasts the New Church understanding of humility with that of the Jewish, medieval Christian, and modern secular perspectives. It argues that genuine humility is not about self-abasement or the denial of one's worth, but a heartfelt acknowledgment of one's dependence on the Lord for all good and truth. This humility is essential for opening the mind to Divine guidance and is balanced by a profound confidence in the Lord's power and mercy, thus avoiding the pitfalls of fear and self-conceit.

*   **Confidence in the Lord:** This discourse distinguishes between a "blind faith" in an unknown or imaginary God and a "seeing faith" based on a rational understanding of the Divine as revealed in the Writings. It posits that the New Church offers a seeing faith because it reveals the Lord Jesus Christ in His Divine Human, making God visible and knowable. This confidence is not in a future event but in the present reality of the Lord's Second Advent through the Writings, which provide a clear and rational understanding of spiritual truths.

*   **The Love of Spiritual Truth:** This section argues that the distinguishing characteristic of the New Church is a love for spiritual truth for its own sake, not merely a loyalty to a particular creed or institution. This love is not for abstract theology but for the practical, life-guiding principles revealed in the Writings. It is a love that seeks to understand the spiritual laws of life in order to apply them to the challenges of regeneration and the removal of evil.

*   **The Removal of Evil (Parts 1 & 2):** These sections address the nature of evil and the means of its removal, contrasting the New Church perspective with other religious and secular views. Evil, in its essence, is defined as that which opposes the Divine will and the eternal purpose of creating a heaven from the human race. The removal of evil is not achieved through ritual, penance, or vicarious atonement, but through a process of genuine repentance, which involves shunning evils as sins against God. This requires a conscious effort on the part of the individual, guided by the spiritual truths of the Word, to resist evil impulses. The Lord alone can remove the love of evil from the heart, but He can only do so as man cooperates by actively fighting against evils in his life.

In summary, "Application of Doctrine" is a call for a deep, internal, and practical engagement with the teachings of the New Church. It emphasizes that the goal of this new revelation is not to create another sect with its own set of beliefs and rituals, but to bring about a profound spiritual transformation in individuals and, ultimately, in the world, by providing the spiritual truths necessary to overcome evil and build a life of genuine love and wisdom.
