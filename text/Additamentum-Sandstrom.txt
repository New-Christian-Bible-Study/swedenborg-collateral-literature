This document, "Additamentum" by Rev. Erik Sandstrom, Sr., is a theological exploration of the concept of the "Additamentum," which is identified as the Divine Natural that the Lord assumed in the world. The author argues that this Divine Natural, while "born" in time, is also infinite and uncreate, an extension of the Lord's eternal Divine Essence rather than a change within it.

The text is structured around a series of propositions, each of which is discussed in detail with references to the Writings of Emanuel Swedenborg. The key arguments are:

*   The "Divine Celestial," "Divine Spiritual," and "Divine Natural" are understood in relation to their reception by angels and humans.
*   The New Church is unique in its worship of a visible God, made possible by the Lord's assumption of the Divine Natural.
*   The "Divine Human" is the Lord as He is visible to humanity.
*   The Lord's Divine Human was not only conceived but also born of Jehovah, with no material element from Mary remaining after the glorification.
*   The Lord's coming into the world did not change the Divine Substance but rather the mode of Divine presence and operation.
*   The ultimate purpose of the Lord's glorification was for conjunction with the human race, which is the essence of salvation.
*   Salvation requires freedom, which in turn requires the ability to see and understand God.
*   The timing and nature of the Lord's advents were accommodations to the states and needs of humanity.
*   The relationship between the Old and New Testaments and the Writings is analogous to the relationship between the Divine Celestial, Spiritual, and Natural.
*   The entire Trinity is now visible in the Lord Jesus Christ.
*   The process of salvation follows a sequence of Glorification, Revelation, and Salvation.

The author concludes that the "Additamentum" was a necessary and profound act of Divine love, making God visible and salvation possible for a fallen human race, without which humanity would have perished. It was not an addition to the Divine Substance but a new mode of Divine presence and operation in the world.
