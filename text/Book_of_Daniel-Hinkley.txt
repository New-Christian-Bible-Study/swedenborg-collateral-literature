This book, "The Book of Daniel: Its Prophetic Character and Spiritual Meaning" by Willard H. Hinkley, offers a spiritual interpretation of the Book of Daniel from a New Church perspective, drawing heavily on the theological writings of Emanuel Swedenborg. Hinkley argues that the book is not merely a historical or political prophecy but a divine allegory that describes the spiritual states of the church and the individual soul, particularly concerning the consummation of the church, the coming of the Lord, and the establishment of a New Church.

The book is structured as a chapter-by-chapter commentary on the Book of Daniel, with each section providing a spiritual exegesis of the text. The key themes and interpretations are as follows:

*   **General Character of the Book:** Hinkley establishes that the Book of Daniel is an inspired part of the Word of God, despite historical and linguistic complexities. He emphasizes that its primary purpose is to convey spiritual truths, not to be a literal historical record. The book's main subjects are the end of the church, the Lord's coming, and the New Church.

*   **Daniel the Prophet:** Daniel is presented as a representative figure, symbolizing the Lord as the Divine Prophet and Teacher. His life and experiences in Babylon are seen as types of the Lord's temptations and the state of the church when it is held captive by the love of dominion.

*   **Chapter I: Daniel in Babylon:** The captivity of the Jews in Babylon represents the church's subjection to the love of dominion (Babylon). Daniel and his companions represent the remnant of truth and innocence that is preserved by the Lord even in a fallen church. Their refusal to eat the king's meat symbolizes spiritual abstinence from evil delights.

*   **Chapter II: Nebuchadnezzar's First Dream:** The great image seen by Nebuchadnezzar represents the successive states of the church, from its golden age of love (head of gold) to its final consummation where truth and good are mixed with falsity and evil (feet of iron and clay). The stone cut without hands that destroys the image symbolizes the Divine Truth of the Lord's Second Coming, which establishes a new and everlasting kingdom.

*   **Chapter III: The Image of Gold and the Fiery Furnace:** The golden image set up by Nebuchadnezzar represents the deification of self-love and the demand for worship. The refusal of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego to worship the image symbolizes the resistance of those who are faithful to the Lord against the dominion of self-love. Their deliverance from the fiery furnace represents the Lord's protection of the faithful from the consuming passions of evil.

*   **Chapter IV: Nebuchadnezzar's Second Dream:** The great tree that is hewn down represents the pride of the love of dominion, which leads to spiritual insanity. Nebuchadnezzar's madness and subsequent restoration symbolize the vastation of the church and the potential for repentance and acknowledgment of the Lord's sovereignty.

*   **Chapter V: Belshazzar's Feast:** This chapter depicts a deeper state of profanation, where the holy things of the church (the temple vessels) are used for selfish and sensual pleasures. The handwriting on the wall is a divine judgment upon this state of profanation, signifying the end of the church and the transfer of its knowledges to others.

*   **Chapter VI: Daniel in the Lions' Den:** This story represents the persecution of Divine Truth (Daniel) by those who are in falsities from evil (the presidents and satraps). The lions' den symbolizes the power of falsity to destroy truth. Daniel's deliverance by an angel represents the Lord's power to protect the truth and those who are in it from the assaults of hell.

*   **Chapter VII: The Vision of the Four Beasts:** The four beasts rising from the sea represent the successive states of the church's decline, from an intellectual faith (lion with eagle's wings) to a faith of falsified truths (leopard) and finally to a state of faith alone that destroys all good and truth (the dreadful fourth beast). The vision of the "Ancient of days" and the "Son of man" represents the Lord's coming to judgment and the establishment of His eternal kingdom.

*   **Chapter VIII: The Ram and the He-Goat:** This vision portrays the conflict between a true faith united with charity (the ram) and a faith separate from charity (the he-goat). The he-goat's victory over the ram symbolizes the ascendancy of the doctrine of faith alone in the Christian Church, which leads to the desolation of the sanctuary.

*   **Chapter IX: Daniel's Prayer and the Answer:** Daniel's prayer of confession represents the repentance of the remnant of the church at its end. The prophecy of the seventy weeks is interpreted spiritually, referring to the states of the church leading up to the Lord's first and second comings, and the establishment of a new covenant.

*   **Chapter X: The Vision by the River Hiddekel:** This vision of a glorious man clothed in linen is a representation of the Lord in His Divine Humanity as the Word. The spiritual conflict described between the princes of Persia and Michael represents the opposition of falsity to the truth of the New Church.

*   **Chapter XI: The King of the North and the King of the South:** This chapter is interpreted as a prophecy of the spiritual conflicts between the "king of the north" (those who are in falsities) and the "king of the south" (those who are in truths) within the church, leading up to its final consummation.

In essence, Hinkley's work is a detailed application of New Church hermeneutics to the Book of Daniel, aiming to unlock its spiritual meaning and reveal its relevance to the spiritual life of the individual and the church throughout its various dispensations.
