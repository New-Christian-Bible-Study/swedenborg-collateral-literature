This work provides a comprehensive interpretation of the Book of Daniel according to the spiritual sense revealed in the Writings of the New Church, treating the book as both historical and prophetic with its primary purpose being to reveal spiritual truths rather than record natural events. The author explains that Daniel represents the Lord as the Divine Prophet, especially in His role as revealer of Divine truths that liberate human souls from the bondage of evil, and that the book's three main subjects are the consummation of the church, the coming of the Lord, and the establishment of the New Church. The work emphasizes that Babylon symbolizes the love of dominion springing from self-love, and that the captivity of the Jews represents the church's fall under this evil influence, while Daniel and his companions represent the remains of good from which a new church can be formed. Throughout the commentary, the author stresses that the book's apocalyptic visions, similar to those in Revelation, treat of the last state of the church, the Last Judgment, and the establishment of the New Jerusalem, and that these visions can only be properly understood through the law of correspondence and representation.
