This comprehensive series of twelve sermons by Bishop W. F. Pendleton provides an in-depth exploration of the Ten Blessings (Beatitudes) from Matthew 5, examining each blessing through the lens of New Church doctrine and the spiritual sense of Scripture. Pendleton explains that these blessings represent progressive stages in the establishment of the church and the regeneration of the individual, beginning with the reception of Divine doctrine by those who are "poor in spirit" and continuing through various states of spiritual development. The sermons emphasize that the kingdom of heaven is present with those who acknowledge their need for Divine truth, that mourning over spiritual evils leads to comfort, and that meekness involves submission to Divine Providence rather than mere natural gentleness. Throughout, Pendleton stresses that these blessings describe present spiritual states rather than future rewards, and that the Lord's presence and help are most active when we maintain humility of understanding and will, acknowledging that all truth and good come from the Lord alone.
