This work explores the spiritual significance of the peoples and lands described in the Bible, presenting them as part of a Divine allegory whose deeper meaning is revealed through the science of correspondences as taught by Emanuel Swedenborg. The author argues that the literal history and geography of Scripture serve as a symbolic framework for spiritual teachings about the regeneration of the human soul and the relationship between God and humanity. The book emphasizes the importance of understanding the natural context of biblical stories to access their internal sense, and discusses how ancient perspectives, traditions, and even archaeological discoveries can illuminate the spiritual message within the Word. Throughout, the work encourages readers to study both the letter and the spiritual sense of Scripture, highlighting the unique role of the New Church in making the internal sense of the Bible accessible and meaningful for spiritual growth.
