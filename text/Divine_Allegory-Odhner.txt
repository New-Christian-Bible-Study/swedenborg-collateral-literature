This book, "The Divine Allegory" by Hugo Lj. Odhner, is a comprehensive study of the spiritual significance of the peoples and lands of the Bible, as revealed in the theological writings of Emanuel Swedenborg. The central thesis of the work is that the Bible, particularly its historical narratives, is a Divine allegory that uses the stories of nations and geographical locations to represent the spiritual states of the church and the process of human regeneration.

The book is structured into several sections, each exploring a different aspect of this divine allegory:

*   **Introduction:** Odhner begins by establishing the premise that the Bible is the Word of God and that its holiness lies in its internal, spiritual sense. He argues that the stories of the Bible are not mere history but a continuous thread of spiritual teachings concealed within the language of symbols and correspondences. The purpose of studying the literal sense of the Word is to access this deeper spiritual meaning.

*   **Beyond History:** This section delves into the Hebrew perspective of the world and creation, explaining that the biblical writers used a symbolic and representational style. It discusses the concept of "pre-adamites" and the spiritual significance of the creation story in Genesis, which is interpreted as an allegory for the spiritual development of the earliest human beings and the formation of the Most Ancient Church. The essay also touches upon the racial migrations of early man and the extent of the "Golden Age."

*   **Nations of the Ancient Church:** This part focuses on the Ancient Church, which succeeded the Most Ancient Church. It explains that the "sons of Noah" (Shem, Ham, and Japheth) represent the different spiritual qualities and doctrines that characterized this widespread religious dispensation. The decline of the Ancient Church is described through the allegory of the Tower of Babel, and the origins of the Hebrew Church are traced back to this period.

*   **The Patriarchal Period:** This section examines the lives of the patriarchs, particularly Abraham, as representatives of the Lord and the process of glorification. It discusses the spiritual significance of the covenant with Abram, the promise of the land of Canaan, and the importance of conjunction with heaven through correspondences. The essay also addresses the chronological challenges of the biblical narrative and the spiritual meaning of the Exodus from Egypt.

*   **Canaan and Egypt:** This part provides a detailed analysis of the spiritual correspondences of Canaan and Egypt. Canaan represents the internal man and the church, while Egypt signifies the natural man and the scientifics (knowledges) that can either serve or oppose spiritual life. The history of Israel's relationship with Egypt, from Joseph's time to the Exodus, is interpreted as an allegory for the spiritual development and struggles of the church and the individual.

*   **The Conquest of Canaan:** This section interprets the Israelite conquest of Canaan as a representation of the Lord's redemptive work and the process of human regeneration, where evils and falsities (represented by the Canaanite nations) are overcome. The inheritances of the twelve tribes are explained according to their spiritual significations, with each tribe representing a specific aspect of the church or a stage in the regenerative process. The essay provides detailed correspondences for the tribes of Reuben, Gad, Manasseh, Simeon, Judah, Dan, Naphtali, Asher, Issachar, Zebulon, Joseph, and Benjamin, and the lands they inhabited.

*   **Israel Among the Nations:** This final section discusses the division of the kingdom of Israel and the subsequent captivities as representations of the decline and consummation of the church. The northern kingdom of Israel is shown to represent a faith separated from charity, while the southern kingdom of Judah represents a perverted celestial principle. The essay also touches upon the representative character of other nations mentioned in the Bible, such as Persia, Greece, and Rome, and their roles in the divine drama of the Word. The book concludes by showing how the entire biblical narrative, from the creation to the establishment of the Israelite kingdom, is a grand allegory of the Lord's work of redemption and the regeneration of the human spirit.

In essence, "The Divine Allegory" is a guide to understanding the Bible from a New Church perspective, demonstrating how the historical and geographical details of the Scriptures are imbued with a profound spiritual meaning that reveals the timeless truths of God's relationship with humanity.
