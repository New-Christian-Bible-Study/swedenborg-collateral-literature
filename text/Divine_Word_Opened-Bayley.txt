This book, "The Divine Word Opened," is a collection of sermons by the Rev. Jonathan Bayley, a prominent minister of the New Church. The sermons were originally preached at Argyle Square and were intended to illustrate the spiritual laws according to which the Divine Word is written. The book is a memorial edition, published after Dr. Bayley's death in 1886, and includes a memoir of his life and work by the Rev. John Presland.

The sermons cover a wide range of topics from the Old and New Testaments, interpreting them according to the principles of the New Church, as revealed in the writings of Emanuel Swedenborg. The central theme of the book is the unfolding of the spiritual sense of the Word, showing that the Bible is not merely a collection of historical narratives and laws, but a divine allegory that reveals profound truths about the Lord, the human soul, and the process of regeneration.

The book is divided into forty sermons, each focusing on a specific passage of Scripture. Here is a summary of the key themes and interpretations presented in the sermons:

*   **The Nature of the Word:** Bayley consistently emphasizes that the Word of God has a spiritual sense within its literal sense. He argues that the historical accounts, laws, and prophecies of the Bible are all correspondences that represent spiritual realities. The literal sense is the basis and container of the spiritual sense, and true understanding comes from seeing the spiritual meaning within the letter.

*   **The Days of Creation and the Garden of Eden:** The creation story in Genesis is interpreted not as a literal account of natural creation but as a symbolic description of man's spiritual creation or regeneration. The Garden of Eden represents a state of celestial love and wisdom in the primeval man.

*   **The Fall of Man and the Tower of Babel:** The fall is explained as a spiritual decline from a state of innocence and love to a state of self-love and sensual indulgence. The Tower of Babel symbolizes the pride of self-intelligence and the attempt to build a religion based on human contrivances rather than divine truth.

*   **The Israelitish Journey:** The history of the Israelites, from their bondage in Egypt to their settlement in Canaan, is presented as a detailed allegory of the Christian's spiritual journey. Egypt represents the natural mind and its bondage to worldly loves, while Canaan represents the heavenly state of the regenerated mind. The manna from heaven, the laws given at Sinai, and the wars against the Canaanites are all interpreted as symbols of spiritual nourishment, divine commandments, and the combats against evil and falsity in the soul.

*   **The Sacrifices and Rituals:** The sacrificial laws of the Old Testament are explained not as punishments for sin but as representations of the dedication of all the principles of the heart and mind to the Lord. The different animals and offerings correspond to various good affections and true thoughts.

*   **The Prophets and Kings:** The lives and actions of the prophets and kings of Israel, such as Gideon, Samson, Saul, and David, are interpreted as types of the Lord and His work of redemption, as well as representations of the different states of the church and the individual in the process of regeneration.

*   **The New Testament:** The teachings and parables of the Lord in the Gospels are unfolded to reveal their deeper spiritual meaning. The life, death, and resurrection of the Lord are presented as the ultimate fulfillment of all the prophecies and types of the Old Testament, and as the means by which humanity is redeemed and saved.

*   **The Book of Revelation:** The visions of the Apocalypse are explained as prophecies concerning the end of the first Christian Church, the Last Judgment, and the establishment of the New Church, signified by the New Jerusalem.

Throughout the sermons, Dr. Bayley's approach is both devotional and instructional. He seeks to inspire his readers with a love for the Word and to provide them with a rational and spiritual understanding of its teachings. The sermons are characterized by their clarity, their use of copious scriptural quotations, and their practical application of spiritual principles to the Christian life. The memoir by Rev. John Presland provides a detailed account of Dr. Bayley's life, his ministry, his character, and his significant contributions to the New Church in Great Britain. It portrays him as a dynamic and beloved pastor, a powerful preacher and debater, and a tireless worker for the cause of the New Jerusalem.
