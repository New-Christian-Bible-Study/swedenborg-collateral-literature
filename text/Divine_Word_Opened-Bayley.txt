This volume is a collection of sermons by Rev. Jonathan Bayley, aiming to illustrate the spiritual laws and deeper meanings within the Divine Word as revealed in Scripture. The sermons explore key biblical narratives, such as creation, the flood, and the parables, interpreting them through the lens of New Church doctrine and the science of correspondences. Bayley emphasizes the harmony between scientific discoveries and spiritual truths, encouraging readers to seek the internal sense of the Word for personal regeneration and a deeper relationship with the Lord. The work also highlights the importance of education, charity, and practical application of doctrine in daily life, reflecting Bayley's lifelong commitment to ministry and public service.
