This work by Rev. Dr. Jonathan Bayley addresses apparent contradictions in Scripture by examining twelve paradoxes that seem to present conflicting teachings, such as the earth both perishing and enduring forever, God's apparent anger versus His real love, and the predestination of all men to heaven versus individual responsibility. Bayley explains that these paradoxes are resolved when Scripture is interpreted spiritually rather than literally, showing how the language of the Bible uses natural objects and events as symbols for spiritual realities and states of the church. The book demonstrates that apparent contradictions in the Word serve to encourage deeper study and spiritual growth, leading readers to discover the internal sense that reveals the true harmony of Divine teachings. Throughout, Bayley emphasizes that the purpose of Scripture is to lead men to justice, charity, and spiritual regeneration rather than mere intellectual understanding.
