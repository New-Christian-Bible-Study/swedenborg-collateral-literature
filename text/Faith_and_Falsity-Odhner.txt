This comprehensive series of doctrinal classes by Hugo Lj. Odhner examines the nature of true faith versus falsity, arguing that there can be only one true faith - faith in the Lord Jesus Christ as the Divine Human - and that all other religions contain falsities that lead away from salvation. The work explores the origins of falsity, explaining how it arises from both man's evil loves and fallacies of the senses, and discusses why there are many religions despite the existence of only one true faith. Odhner emphasizes that while all men can be saved regardless of their religion if they live according to their conscience, true salvation requires acknowledgment of the Lord as the Divine Human, which is implicit in all genuine good. The classes provide a thorough analysis of how falsities develop, their relationship to evil, and the importance of maintaining doctrinal integrity in the New Church."
