This volume by Alfred Acton presents a series of sermons on the Ten Commandments, written specifically for New Church soldiers during the Great War (1914-1918), focusing on the spiritual interpretation and practical application of the Decalogue in daily life. The sermons begin with an examination of the two great commandments - love to the Lord and love to the neighbor - and then systematically explore each of the Ten Commandments, emphasizing their role in regeneration and spiritual growth. Acton explains that the commandments are not merely civil laws but Divine truths that create and form the human mind when received as the Word of God, and that true obedience involves acknowledging the Lord Jesus Christ as the one God who delivers us from spiritual bondage. Throughout, the work encourages readers to understand the neighbor as the good that comes from the Lord, to shun evils as sins against God, and to recognize that the commandments are the foundation of both individual salvation and the establishment of the New Church.
