This work by Hugo Lj. Odhner presents a spiritual interpretation of the biblical story of the three kings of United Israel - Saul, David, and Solomon - as a parable illustrating the progressive states of spiritual development and the Lord's glorification. The book explains how Saul represents the Divine truth in the literal sense of the Word, David represents spiritual Divine truth that comes from the Lord's second advent, and Solomon represents the wisdom that results from the conjunction of truth and good. Odhner demonstrates how these three kings symbolize the stages of spiritual growth from obedience to tradition (Samuel), through the authority of literal truth (Saul), to the power of spiritual truth (David), and finally to the wisdom of charity (Solomon). The work emphasizes that this progression reflects both the historical development of the church and the individual's spiritual journey toward regeneration and conjunction with the Lord.
