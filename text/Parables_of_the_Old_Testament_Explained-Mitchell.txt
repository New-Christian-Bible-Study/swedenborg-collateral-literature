This comprehensive work by Edward Craig Mitchell provides detailed explanations of Old Testament parables, fables, and visions using the science of correspondences as revealed by Emanuel Swedenborg, treating each narrative as having three levels of meaning: literal, figurative, and spiritual. The book examines stories such as the trees choosing a king, Samson's riddle, and many other biblical narratives, showing how they illustrate spiritual principles operating in the human mind and the process of regeneration. Mitchell demonstrates how these ancient stories contain profound spiritual truths about the relationship between God and humanity, the nature of evil and temptation, and the path to spiritual growth and salvation. The work serves as both a devotional resource and a doctrinal study, helping readers understand the deeper spiritual meanings hidden within the letter of Scripture and apply these truths to their own spiritual development.
