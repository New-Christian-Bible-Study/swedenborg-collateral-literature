This book, "Crown of Revelations: A Doctrinal Study" by Alfred Acton, is a theological work that argues for the divine authority and status of the theological writings of Emanuel Swedenborg as "the Word" for the New Church. The book systematically addresses objections to this view and builds a case for the Writings being a new and final Divine Revelation, the crown of all previous revelations.

The book is structured into four main parts:

*   **I. The History of the Doctrine Concerning the Writings:** Acton begins by tracing the historical development of the doctrine concerning the status of Swedenborg's Writings within the New Church. He notes that from the earliest days, there were differing views, with some, like Rev. Sven Schmidt, proclaiming them as a new Gospel, while others, particularly the Manchester School, saw them as divinely inspired but not on par with the Old and New Testaments. Acton highlights the ongoing debate within the New Church, from the early days of the General Conference and the General Convention to the establishment of the Academy and the General Church, which has more consistently taught that the Writings are the Word. He also touches upon more recent developments and interpretations.

*   **II. The Writings are the Word for the New Church:** In this section, Acton directly addresses the main objections to calling the Writings "the Word."
    *   **Do the Writings refer to themselves as the Word?** He acknowledges that the Writings do not explicitly and frequently call themselves "the Word" in the same way the New Testament refers to the Old Testament as "Scripture." However, he argues that this is a matter of divine accommodation, designed to foster a rational and free acceptance of their authority, rather than a compelled belief.
    *   **The Writings and Correspondences:** Acton refutes the idea that the Writings are not the Word because they are not written in the same kind of correspondential language as the Old and New Testaments. He explains that all Divine Revelation is clothed in correspondences, but the nature of these correspondences differs. The Writings use a rational and philosophical language as their "letter," which is a more direct and clear correspondential clothing for spiritual truths than the historical narratives and rituals of the former Testaments.
    *   **Conjunction with Heaven by the Writings:** He argues against the notion that the Writings do not effect conjunction with heaven in the same way as the Old and New Testaments. He asserts that conjunction is effected by the "sense of the letter" when read holily, and that the Writings, being a clearer revelation of Divine Truth, provide a more intimate and intelligent conjunction with the Lord and the angelic heavens.
    *   **Holiness to be Predicated also of the Writings:** Acton contends that the holiness of the Word resides not in the obscurity of its letter but in the presence of the Lord within it. Since the Lord is more fully and clearly revealed in the Writings, they possess a holiness that is, in a sense, more accessible and powerful for the New Church.

*   **III. The Application to the Writings of the Teachings Concerning the Word:** This is the core of the book, where Acton systematically applies the doctrines about "the Word" (as taught in Swedenborg's "Doctrine of the Sacred Scripture") to the Writings themselves. He argues that if the Writings are the Word, then what they teach about the Word must also apply to them, with rational discrimination. He covers several key points:
    *   The Word is Divine Truth itself.
    *   The sense of the letter is the basis, containant, and firmament of the interior senses.
    *   Divine Truth is in its fullness, holiness, and power in the sense of the letter.
    *   The doctrine of the church is to be drawn from the sense of the letter.
    *   Genuine truth does not appear in the sense of the letter except to those in enlightenment.
    *   The Word effects conjunction with the Lord and consociation with the angels.
    *   The Word is in the heavens, and the church is from the Word.
    *   In everything of the Word is the marriage of the Lord and the Church.
    *   Heresies may be taken from the sense of the letter.
    *   The Lord fulfilled the Word, and there was a Word that is lost.
    *   Without the Word, there would be no knowledge of God, heaven, or hell.

    Through this analysis, Acton demonstrates that the Writings fulfill all the essential criteria of "the Word" and that the doctrines of the New Church must be drawn from the sense of the letter of the Writings.

*   **IV. Conclusion:** Acton concludes by reiterating that the Writings are the "Crown of Revelations," a final and more excellent revelation than any that have preceded it. He advocates for the use of the term "the Writings" to distinguish this final revelation from former ones, while still affirming their status as the Word. He calls for a genuine reverence for the Writings, based not on tradition but on a rational and heartfelt acknowledgment of the Lord's presence and teaching within them.

In essence, "Crown of Revelations" is a scholarly and deeply theological argument for the unique and supreme authority of the theological writings of Emanuel Swedenborg, presenting them as the very Word of the Lord for the New Church and the foundation for its doctrine, life, and worship.
