This book by William L. Worcester introduces the Swedenborgian concept of correspondences, explaining how the symbolic language of parable unlocks the inner, spiritual meaning of the Bible. Using clear, nontechnical language and practical examples, Worcester shows how natural objects, phenomena, and stories in Scripture correspond to spiritual realities, making the Bible a living guide for personal regeneration and spiritual growth. The work emphasizes that understanding correspondences is essential for grasping the true message of the Word, and provides numerous illustrations from both daily life and biblical passages. Throughout, the book encourages readers to move beyond literal interpretation and discover the deeper wisdom and relevance of Scripture for their own lives.
