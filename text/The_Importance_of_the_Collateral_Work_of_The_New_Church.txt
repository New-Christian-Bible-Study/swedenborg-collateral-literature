This document explores the spiritual marriage between natural good and spiritual truth, emphasizing that the doctrine of the spiritual church is formed from acknowledged truths rather than direct perception of Divine truth. It explains that doctrinal things from the Word are not automatically Divine truths, as false doctrines can be derived from the letter, but true doctrine comes from the internal sense discerned by those enlightened by the Lord. The document stresses that the intellectual cannot be enlightened unless love to the Lord and charity toward the neighbor are acknowledged as the principal things of the church, and that those who proceed from this acknowledgment can see innumerable truths and secrets disclosed to them from interior acknowledgment according to their degree of enlightenment from the Lord.
