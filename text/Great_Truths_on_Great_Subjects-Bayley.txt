This collection of six lectures by Rev. Dr. Jonathan Bayley presents fundamental New Church doctrines in a clear and accessible manner, addressing key theological topics such as the Divine Unity and Trinity, the Atonement, the Christian life, death and resurrection, judgment, and the Second Coming of the Lord. Bayley emphasizes that the Trinity is not three separate persons but three essential constituents within the one God - the Father as Divine Love, the Son as Divine Truth, and the Holy Spirit as Divine Proceeding - all united in the Lord Jesus Christ as the Divine Human. The work explains that the Lord's incarnation and glorification established a new relationship between God and man, enabling direct communication and salvation through acknowledgment of the Lord as the one true God. Throughout the lectures, Bayley stresses the importance of understanding these doctrines rationally rather than accepting them as mysteries, showing how they provide a foundation for spiritual life and regeneration."
