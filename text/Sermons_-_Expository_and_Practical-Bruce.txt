This collection by Rev. W. Bruce presents a series of expository and practical sermons that explore key Christian doctrines and spiritual principles through the lens of New Church theology. The sermons emphasize the importance of following the Lord Jesus Christ as the perfect example of love, humility, and service, and discuss the process of regeneration as a journey from innocence through spiritual struggle to ultimate peace. Bruce addresses topics such as the harmony of Divine attributes, the role of practice in establishing spiritual principles, and the transformation of human nature through the Lord's glorification. Throughout, the work encourages readers to apply spiritual truths in daily life, cultivate humility and charity, and strive for personal and collective regeneration in accordance with Divine order.
