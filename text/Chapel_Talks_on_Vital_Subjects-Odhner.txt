This book, "Chapel Talks on Vital Subjects" by Reverend Ormond de Charms Odhner, is a collection of fifty-one short talks originally delivered to the secondary school students of the Academy of the New Church. The talks are designed for family worship and are notable for their brevity, clarity, and virility. The book is edited by Rev. Karl R. Alden.

The talks are organized into several chapters, each focusing on a specific theme:

*   **Chapter I: Prayer:** This chapter explores the nature and purpose of prayer from a New Church perspective. It defines prayer as "talk with God together with some internal view of the subject," emphasizing its seriousness and the importance of the heart's intention. The talks address questions such as why we pray if God is unchangeable, what it is right to pray for, and the efficacy of praying for others. It concludes with a discussion on the significance of the Lord's Prayer and the different ways it can be experienced.

*   **Chapter II: Selected Subjects:** This chapter covers a range of vital topics, including:
    *   **Worship:** The meaning and importance of worship, with a focus on the symbolism of the New Church chancel, the open Word, and the significance of the ritual.
    *   **With or Against:** A discussion on the two seemingly contradictory sayings of the Lord: "He that is not against us is on our part" and "He that is not with Me is against Me." The talks explain that salvation is possible for the good in all religions, but rejection of the truth when it is known leads to condemnation.
    *   **The Greatness of Service:** An exploration of the true meaning of greatness as a life of use and service to others, distinguishing it from selfish ambition.
