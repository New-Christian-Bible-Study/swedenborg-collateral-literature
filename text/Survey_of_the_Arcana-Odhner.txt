This comprehensive work by Hugo Lj. Odhner provides a detailed survey of Swedenborg's "Arcana Coelestia," the most extensive theological work that reveals the internal or spiritual sense of the books of Genesis and Exodus. The book traces the spiritual meaning behind the biblical narrative, showing how the stories of creation, the Garden of Eden, the flood, and the patriarchs represent the progressive states of human regeneration and the Lord's glorification process. Odhner explains that the Arcana reveals how the literal sense of Scripture contains profound heavenly secrets about the Lord, heaven, the church, and religion that can only be understood through the internal sense revealed by Swedenborg. The work serves as both an introduction for those new to the Arcana and a helpful overview for those already studying it, emphasizing that understanding the spiritual sense of the Word is essential for true spiritual growth and the establishment of the New Church.
