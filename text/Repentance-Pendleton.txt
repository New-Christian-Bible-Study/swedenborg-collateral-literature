This series of six doctrinal classes by Bishop Nathaniel Dandridge Pendleton explores the concept of repentance from a New Church perspective, emphasizing its necessity as the foundation for spiritual reformation and regeneration. Pendleton explains that true repentance involves a conscious turning away from self-love and evil, motivated by faith in the Lord and a desire to "sin no more," and that this process is only possible through the freedom and rationality granted by God. The lectures discuss the structure of the human mind, the interplay between inherited tendencies and spiritual development, and the role of Divine Providence in preparing individuals for repentance throughout their lives. The work encourages readers to engage in continual self-examination and spiritual struggle, highlighting repentance as the essential means by which the mind is re-created and the individual is conjoined with the Lord.
