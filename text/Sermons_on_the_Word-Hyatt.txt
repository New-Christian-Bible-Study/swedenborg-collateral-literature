This collection by Edward S. Hyatt presents two series of sermons on the Word, focusing on the internal sense of Scripture as revealed in the Writings of Emanuel Swedenborg. Hyatt emphasizes that the literal sense of the Word is not the true Light, but testifies concerning the Light, and that genuine doctrine and spiritual life arise from understanding the internal, spiritual meaning. The sermons explore the necessity of Divine Revelation being accommodated to human grasp, the role of correspondences, and the importance of both internal and external forms in worship and church life. Throughout, Hyatt encourages readers to move beyond external rituals and literal interpretations, seeking the Lord's presence and guidance in the internal sense of the Word for true regeneration and conjunction with heaven.
