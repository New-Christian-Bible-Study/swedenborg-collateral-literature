This second volume by Alfred Acton continues the series of sermons on the Ten Commandments, written for New Church soldiers during the Great War, focusing on the deeper spiritual applications of the commandments beyond their literal meaning. The sermons examine the fourth commandment (honoring father and mother) as an intermediate commandment that unites love to God with love to the neighbor, explaining that it encompasses honoring natural parents, teachers, country, and the Church as spiritual parents who provide for our natural and spiritual needs. Acton explores the fifth commandment (thou shalt not kill) in detail, emphasizing that it primarily addresses the spirit of hatred and anger rather than the literal taking of life, and discusses how self-love can be either a servant to Divine love or a master that seeks only its own gratification. Throughout, the work stresses that true obedience to the commandments involves shunning evils as sins against God, loving the neighbor for the sake of the Lord, and recognizing that the commandments are spiritual laws that form the foundation for both individual regeneration and the establishment of the New Church.
