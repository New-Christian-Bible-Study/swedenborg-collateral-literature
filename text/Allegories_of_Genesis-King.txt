This book, "Allegories of Genesis" by Thomas A. King, provides a spiritual interpretation of the early chapters of the Book of Genesis, drawing heavily on the theological framework of the New Church, as articulated in the writings of Emanuel Swedenborg. The author treats the Genesis narratives not as literal history but as a series of divine allegories that describe the spiritual creation, development, fall, and regeneration of the human soul and the church.

The book is structured as a chapter-by-chapter commentary on Genesis, with each section dedicated to a specific passage. The key themes and interpretations are as follows:

*   **The Creation Story (Genesis 1-2):** The six days of creation are interpreted as the six stages of man's regeneration, from a state of spiritual emptiness to the formation of a spiritual man in the image and likeness of God. The creation of "heaven and earth" symbolizes the formation of the spiritual and natural minds. The sun, moon, and stars represent love, faith, and spiritual knowledge, respectively. The creation of Adam is not about a single individual but the formation of the Most Ancient Church, a celestial community of people.

*   **The Garden of Eden (Genesis 2):** Eden is not a geographical location but a state of heavenly love. The garden planted eastward in Eden represents the intelligence of the celestial man, and the trees in the garden symbolize perceptions of truth and good. The river of Eden and its four heads represent the flow of Divine wisdom into the different faculties of the mind.

*   **The Fall of Man (Genesis 3):** The fall is depicted as a gradual decline of the Most Ancient Church, beginning with the desire for self-governance (Adam's sleep) and culminating in the exaltation of the sensual nature (the serpent) over spiritual principles. Eating the forbidden fruit symbolizes the appropriation of spiritual knowledge as self-derived, leading to the loss of innocence and expulsion from the state of heavenly love (Eden).

*   **Cain and Abel (Genesis 4):** This story represents the division within the Adamic Church into two sects: the Cainites, who prioritized faith alone, and the Abelites, who emphasized charity. Cain's murder of Abel symbolizes the destruction of charity by a faith-only doctrine.

*   **The Descendants of Cain and Seth (Genesis 4-5):** The genealogies are interpreted as the development and decline of different religious doctrines and sects within the Adamic and reformed (Sethite) churches. The long lifespans of the patriarchs represent the duration and quality of these religious systems, not the ages of individuals.

*   **The Flood and Noah's Ark (Genesis 6-9):** The flood is a spiritual catastrophe, representing the inundation of the Most Ancient Church by false persuasions and evils. The ark symbolizes the remnant of the church (represented by Noah) who were saved and formed into a new, spiritual church (the Ancient Church). The clean and unclean animals represent good and evil affections and thoughts. The bow in the cloud is a token of the covenant between God and the new church, symbolizing the spiritual sense of the Word.

*   **The Sons of Noah and the Tower of Babel (Genesis 9-11):** The sons of Noah (Shem, Ham, and Japheth) represent the three main branches of the Ancient Church, each with its own doctrinal emphasis. The story of the Tower of Babel describes the decline of the Ancient Church as it turned from internal spirituality to external worship and self-intelligence, leading to a confusion of doctrines (confusion of tongues) and the end of that dispensation.

In essence, "Allegories of Genesis" presents a symbolic reading of the biblical text, aiming to reveal the deeper spiritual truths about human regeneration and the history of the church, as understood within the New Church tradition. It is a work of theological exegesis rather than historical or scientific analysis.
