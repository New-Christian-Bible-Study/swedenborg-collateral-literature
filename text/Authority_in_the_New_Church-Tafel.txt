This book, "Authority in the New Church" by Rev. R. L. Tafel, is a theological work that argues for the divine authority of the theological writings of Emanuel Swedenborg as the foundational law for the New Church. Written in 1877, the book addresses various objections to this position and systematically builds a case for the infallibility and divine origin of Swedenborg's works.

The book is structured into several chapters, each tackling a specific aspect of the authority of the New Church doctrines:

*   **Chapter I: On Authority in General:** Tafel begins by establishing the necessity of authority as a principle of order in both the natural and spiritual worlds. He argues that just as any society needs laws and governors, the New Church requires a final, ultimate authority to which all its members must submit. This authority, he asserts, is not a person but a body of divine law.

*   **Chapter II: The Doctrines of the New Church Not Human but Divine:** This chapter directly addresses the objection that claiming divine authority for Swedenborg's writings equates them with the Word of God. Tafel affirms this, arguing that these writings are the very means by which the Lord effected His Second Coming. He presents evidence from Swedenborg's own statements to show that the doctrines were revealed to him by the Lord and are not of human origin.

*   **Chapter III: The Doctrines of the New Church in Their Relation to the Word:** Tafel refutes the idea that the authority of the New Church writings supersedes the Bible. He explains that the Writings are the spiritual sense of the Word, and the letter of the Word is its body. The two are inseparable, and the spiritual sense gives life to the literal sense. Acknowledging the authority of the spiritual sense does not diminish the importance of the letter but rather confirms and strengthens it.

*   **Chapter IV: The Doctrines of the New Church in Their Relation to Human Reason:** This chapter deals with the objection that Swedenborg's writings are a mixture of divine truth and human ideas, and that reason must be used to distinguish between them. Tafel argues against this, stating that human reason, being finite and prone to fallacies, cannot be the ultimate arbiter of divine truth. Instead, reason should be used to confirm the truths revealed in the Writings, which should be accepted affirmatively.

*   **Chapter V: The Doctrines of the New Church in Their Relation to Natural Science:** Tafel addresses the concern that the scientific statements in Swedenborg's writings may conflict with modern science. He argues that the natural truths in the Writings serve as a basis for the spiritual truths and are therefore also of divine origin. He advises that any apparent discrepancies should not be used to undermine the authority of the Writings as a whole.

*   **Chapter VI: Nature of Swedenborg's Inspiration:** This chapter distinguishes Swedenborg's inspiration from that of the biblical prophets. Tafel explains that Swedenborg's was an "internal inspiration" or "revelation from perception," which he received while in a state of full rationality and freedom. This was a unique state, granted to him for the purpose of the Second Coming, and it allowed him to understand and communicate divine truths in a rational form.

*   **Chapter VII: Swedenborg Considered as a Translator of Scripture:** Tafel argues for the superiority of Swedenborg's Latin translation of the Bible over other versions, such as the King James Version. He contends that a true translation requires knowledge of the internal sense of the Word, which Swedenborg possessed. He criticizes the practice of substituting other translations for Swedenborg's in the publication of his works.

*   **Chapter VIII: The Doctrines of the New Church in Their Relation to Human Freedom:** This chapter refutes the charge that accepting the divine authority of the Writings leads to dogmatism and restricts intellectual freedom. Tafel clarifies that while the Writings are the ultimate authority, they are not to be accepted blindly. Reason and rational thought are essential for understanding and confirming the doctrines, but they must be guided by the doctrines themselves, not placed above them.

*   **Chapter IX: Doctrine Twofold, of God and of Men:** Tafel distinguishes between doctrine revealed by God (found in the Writings) and doctrine formulated by men. He asserts that only the former is infallible and of divine authority. While individuals can and should "make doctrine" for themselves from the Word, this must be done in the light of the revealed doctrines of the New Church.

*   **Chapter X: The Genuine Use of Reason in Matters of the Church:** This final chapter summarizes the proper role of reason in the New Church. Reason is not to be used to question the divine truths of the Writings but to confirm them and to discern the truth or falsity of human interpretations of those truths. The chapter also outlines an orderly structure for church governance, based on Swedenborg's teachings, where the doctrines of the Church are the supreme law.

In essence, "Authority in the New Church" is a robust defense of the divine authority of Swedenborg's theological writings, presenting them as the revealed truth of the Lord's Second Coming and the ultimate foundation for the faith and life of the New Church. The book concludes with an appendix detailing the discovery of a copy of one of Swedenborg's works with the inscription "Hic Liber est Adventus Domini" (This Book is the Lord's Advent), which Tafel presents as definitive proof of his thesis.
