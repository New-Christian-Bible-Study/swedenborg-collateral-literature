This document, "As from Self and the Two Essentials of the Church" by Erik Sandstrom, is a theological treatise that delves into the New Church concepts of the "as-from-self," the nature of God, and the process of regeneration. The author draws extensively from the writings of Emanuel Swedenborg to explain these complex ideas.

The main points of the document can be summarized as follows:

*   **The As-from-Self and the Visible God:** The author explains that the "as-from-self" is the human experience of acting and thinking freely, as if from one's own power, while acknowledging that the power to do so comes from the Lord. This is made possible by the Lord's Second Advent, through which the entire Trinity has become visible and understandable in the Word, particularly in the Writings. The Lord operates *in* and *into* man, not *through* him, preserving human freedom.

*   **Image and Likeness:** Man is created in the "image" and "likeness" of God. The "likeness" is the ability to receive and reproduce the Divine qualities of loving others, desiring unity with them, and making them happy. The "image" is the ability to act and think in spiritual matters as if from oneself, while acknowledging that the love and wisdom to do so are from God.

*   **Proprium, Love, and Freedom:** The document distinguishes between the hereditary, evil "proprium" and the new, heavenly "proprium" that is formed during regeneration. This new proprium, which is a new will and love, is the source of true freedom. The as-from-self, the new proprium, and genuine freedom are presented as interconnected aspects of the regenerate life.

*   **Perception and Acknowledgment of the Lord's Life:** While man does not directly feel the influx of the Lord's life, he can perceive its effects through a sense of peace, joy, and delight in doing good. This awareness is a form of "sensating" the Lord's presence. The author emphasizes the importance of acknowledging that all good and truth are from the Lord, even though they are experienced as one's own.

*   **Origin and Essence:** A distinction is made between Divine origin and Divine essence. While all creation has a Divine origin, it does not possess a Divine essence. Man's essence is created and finite, not Divine.

*   **Conscience and the As-from-Self:** Conscience, formed from the truths and goods of the Word, is the medium through which the Lord operates in man. A person with a true conscience can know and do the Lord's will as if from themselves, because the Divine law is written on their heart.

*   **The Lord's Own with Man:** The "Lord's own" with man can refer to both the Divine truths that proceed from Him and the created forms (like the will and understanding) that are produced from Him. The former are Divine, while the latter are not.

*   **The Tree of Life and the Tree of Knowledge:** These two trees symbolize the reality that man lives from the Lord (Tree of Life) and the appearance that he lives from himself (Tree of Knowledge). The fall occurs when man confirms the appearance as reality, believing that life and wisdom are self-derived.

The document concludes by reiterating the central theme of abiding in the Lord, using the metaphor of the vine and the branches from the Gospel of John to illustrate the complete dependence of man on the Lord for all spiritual life and fruitfulness. It is a deep and nuanced exploration of the relationship between the Divine and the human, as understood in New Church theology.
