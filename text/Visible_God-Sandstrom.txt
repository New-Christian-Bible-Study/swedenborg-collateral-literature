This work by Erik Sandstrom provides an introduction to the doctrine of the Lord Jesus Christ as the one visible God of heaven and earth, focusing on the teachings found in the first three chapters of Swedenborg's "True Christian Religion." The book explains that the Lord is a Trine consisting of the Infinite Divine Itself (Father), the Divine Human (Son), and the creative power that goes forth (Holy Spirit), and that through His two advents into the world He has made Himself visible in all aspects of this Trine. Sandstrom emphasizes that the Lord's glorification and redemption were the same act, accomplished visibly before men to restore human freedom and provide choice between the way of the Prince of Peace and the Prince of the world, and that the Holy Spirit is the Lord's operation through the Word, continuing His presence with men after His resurrection. Throughout, the work stresses that the New Church is distinguished by its worship of one visible God in whom is the invisible God, as the soul is in the body, making it the crown of all churches.
