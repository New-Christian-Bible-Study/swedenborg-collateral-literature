This work by Rev. Michael Gladish presents a two-part sermon series on the Ten Blessings (Beatitudes) from Matthew 5, exploring the deeper spiritual meaning behind these seemingly paradoxical teachings that appear to bless poverty, mourning, and persecution. Gladish explains that these blessings are not about delayed gratification or future rewards, but describe present spiritual states where acknowledging our needs, limitations, and struggles actually opens us to receive the Lord's help and experience true happiness. The sermons examine how being "poor in spirit" means recognizing our need to learn, "mourning" involves acknowledging our evils and receiving Divine comfort, and "meekness" represents gentleness and kindness in fighting against our own evils rather than weakness. Throughout, Gladish emphasizes that the kingdom of heaven is present within us when we maintain these spiritual attitudes, and that the Lord's presence and help are most active when we acknowledge our needs and strive to live according to His truth.
