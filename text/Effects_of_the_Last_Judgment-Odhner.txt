This series of doctrinal classes by Hugo Odhner examines the spiritual and ecclesiastical consequences of the Last Judgment as revealed in the Writings of Emanuel Swedenborg. The work explains that the Last Judgment has already occurred in the spiritual world, resulting in the formation of a new heaven and the establishment of the New Church, restoring the connection between heaven and humanity. Odhner discusses the historical sequence of churches, the decline and renewal of spiritual communities, and the unique role of the New Church in receiving new revelation and doctrine. The classes emphasize the importance of understanding these spiritual events for the identity, mission, and responsibilities of New Church members.
