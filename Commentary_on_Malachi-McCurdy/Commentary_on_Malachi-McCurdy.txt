How to Use This Study Guide

1. A careful, unhurried reading of Malachi is essential. Reading the chapter 

before looking at the notes, while working with the notes, and after finishing 
with the notes will give each researcher a powerful sense of the series of 
meanings within each chapter. It is important to be comfortable with all the 
names and places in the prophecy and to understand the announcements the 
prophet makes on behalf of the Lord. When possible, historical information 
will be included in the notes to increase reading comprehension and enhance
application.

2. 2.Our study of each chapter of Malachi will begin with quotes from a work of 
the Writings called Summary Exposition of the Prophets and Psalms (P&P). 
This work includes a verse-by-verse overview of all four chapters of Malachi 
that provides general information about the internal sense. Our research will 
help move us from the generals to the particulars of the internal sense.
3. Another important reference tool is Searle’s General Index to Swedenborg’s 
Scripture Quotations. This reference is used to find passages in the Writings 
where a verse(s) from the Word is either explained specifically or used to 
illustrate a doctrinal point that we can use in our study. There is also another 
use of this work. As we study, each researcher will be led by the Lord’s 
Providence in myriad ways, according to specific needs or states. Knowing 
how to use this book will help each of us to explore relevant topics and look 
up related passages to increase our knowledge of the three-fold Word.
4. You will soon discover that not every verse, word, name, etc. is directly 
quoted in the Writings. But there are often other references to the same 
name, place, or thing in the explanation of a different verse of the Word. The 
hope is that reflection on these other doctrinal explanations will help us see 
possible applications to our study of Malachi. We will need to use “derived 
doctrine” often. Please don’t run away from this maligned term. If we use it 
properly and admit openly that it is derived doctrine, we bring no harm to the
internal sense.

5. Keep some kind of notebook handy during your study times. Write out 

insights, questions, and any summaries you find helpful in organizing your 
thoughts about each chapter. The goal of this study guide is not to give a 
detailed summary of the internal sense but to start each researcher’s quest 
for deeper insight.

6. At the end of each chapter in the study guide, you will find a study review. 
The review includes a summary of each section to help you reinforce and 
build on your understanding of several of the key points.

7. Begin each study unit with a devotional prayer asking the Lord to guide and 
direct your thoughts. Certainly, beginning in this sphere has the power to 
inspire and open our minds with a higher spiritual priority that will keep us 
in the company of the Lord’s angels. As the Writings teach, we must seek to 
love truth for truth’s sake. Such an approach will free each reader from 

4

preconceived ideas that might limit his or her ability to “see” the intent and 
message of the Lord’s Word.

Introduction

Welcome to the study of Malachi. Malachi is the last book of the twelve Minor 
Prophets and the last book in the Old Testament. Malachi’s prophecy was followed 
by a period of four to five hundred years of prophetic silence before the Lord’s 
advent occurred.

This introduction will focus on the examination of the following points:

1. Malachi’s background.

2. The approximate dates of his life and prophecy.

3. The message of Malachi, the “Lord’s Messenger.”

4. The unique style of Malachi’s prophecy.

MALACHI'S BACKGROUND

" No one knows who the author of the book was; the name “Malachi” is simply a 
transliteration of the Hebrew word meaning ‘My Messenger.’ Nor can anyone be 
certain as to when the author lived, although modern scholarship tends to give much
credence to the ancient tradition to the effect that he lived sometime about 400 or 
350. (There are still authorities…who would date Malachi much later than this; and 
there are others who would date him as early as the eighth century.)” Pre-Advent 
Churches, by Ormond Odhner, page 308.

I cite this statement because there has been considerable scholarly debate as to 
whether or not “Malachi” is a proper name or a common noun. If it is a noun, then 
this book is by an anonymous writer who refers to himself as “My messenger” or the
“Messenger of Jehovah.”

The following background information about Malachi and his prophecy is derived 
from a series of online essays on “The Minor Prophets” authored by Al Maxey. The 
essay on Malachi is available at http://www.zianet.com/maxey/Proph13.htm.

The LXX (Septuagint) treats the word “Malachi” as a noun rather than as a proper 
name. The Targum of Jonathan ben Uzziel (an Aramaic paraphrase of the prophetic 
books dating from the 4th or 5th century AD) includes this phrase: “ My messenger 
who is Ezra the scribe.” Josephus, when describing the major characters of the 
period, fails to mention Malachi among them. Even where Malachi is quoted in the 

5

New Testament (Matthew 11:10; Mark 1:2; Luke 7:27 ), his name is not mentioned in 
the citations. Is the omission of Malachi’s name of spiritual significance?

Some scholars think Ezra was the author of Malachi. Others believe Malachi 
originally was part of the prophetic book of Zechariah but was made into a separate 
book to make the Minor Prophets amount to the sacred number 12. So much more 
could be pulled into this quest to know about Malachi’s background but to what 
end?

APPROXIMATE DATES

If “Malachi” is a name and not a noun, it is possible to identify a general date when 
this work was written by noting the history of Israel’s exile and the rebuilding of the 
temple. The Babylonian captivity of the Jews ended in 536 BC when Cyrus allowed 
the Israelites to return to their homeland. With the leadership of Haggai and 
Zechariah, the people rebuilt the temple. The dates of this happening are between 
520 and 516 BC. Malachi, Ezra, and Nehemiah wrote about the same sad and 
deteriorating spiritual conditions within the temple and among its priests. Was 
Malachi a contemporary of Ezra and Nehemiah? If so, the book of Malachi might 
have been written in the period of 445 to 425 BC.

But eventually, we probably will agree with Ormond Odhner: “No one knows who 
the author of the book was…nor can anyone be certain as to when the author lived…”
So if we don’t know who the author was, how can we pinpoint a date? This is 
something we have had to face with many of the Minor Prophets. Our New Church 
perspective teaches us that we are not to focus on the person who wrote the 
prophetic book. Instead, we are to concentrate on the contents of the spiritual sense 
of the Word. Given the choice, what would we consider most profitable in the study 
of this book of the Word: knowing about the man who wrote it or knowing the 
spiritual sense of this prophecy in the Word?

THE MESSAGE OF MALACHI, THE “LORD’S MESSENGER”

The message of Malachi calls the hearer to consider the Lord’s providential care in 
bringing about the great release from Babylonian captivity. He reminds his listeners 
that the temple had been rebuilt, the walls of the city fortified again, and the 
sacrificial system reinstituted. They had a degree of security from foreign 
aggression. But their enthusiasm for worship had been replaced by mechanical, 
ritualistic practice that was far from spiritual. Other gods slipped into the services 
within the temple. The worshippers’ hearts were not with the Lord but with 
themselves. Relationships with the Lord and with one another were falling apart.

Malachi sought to turn the people’s enthusiasm to doing what was pleasing to the 
Lord. To do this, he had to speak hard words about the lapses within the priesthood 

6

and the temple. Malachi called for the priests and the people to hear and behold the 
error of their ways:

 The priests were not providing moral and spiritual leadership. They were 

contemptuous in discharging their duties. Their gifts to the Lord were lame, 
blind, and sick. Instead of giving their best to the Lord, they were offering 
Him their worst.

 The uses of supporting the work of the temple were neglected; tithing had 
ceased. The people neglected to make financial gifts or donate their time.
 Divorce and intermarriage with pagan wives were tolerated and sanctioned.
 The people had become disillusioned and doubtful of the Lord’s love for 

them. They saw little use in serving the Lord. Cynicism and rebellion thrived 
within the heart of the nation.

 Editorializing, one might say the people were neither interested nor 

impressed with what the Lord had done for them in the past. It mattered 
more to them what they felt He was doing in the here-and-now of their lives.

THE UNIQUE STYLE OF MALACHI’S PROPHECY

The Book of Malachi uses the method of “disputation.” An assertion or charge is 
made against the church and people, a fancied (haughty) objection is raised by the 
hearers, and then a refutation of the objection is presented by the speaker on behalf
of the Lord.

 The text of Malachi is a debate with those who call into question the Lord’s 
goodness and justice. Let’s get a quick overview of where this style is used:
Malachi 1:2 “‘I have loved you,’ says the Lord…‘In what way have You loved 
us?’ ‘Yet Jacob I have loved...’”

 Malachi 1:6 “…To you priests who despise My name. Yet you say, ‘In what way 

have we despised Your name?’”

 Malachi 1:7 “You offer defiled food on My altar. But you say, ‘In what way have
we defiled You?’ By saying, ‘The table of the Lord is contemptible.’ And when 
you offer the blind…lame and sick, is it not evil?”

 Malachi 1:11 “…For My name shall be great among the nations…But you 

profane it, in that you say, ‘The table of the Lord is defiled…You also say, ‘Oh, 
what a weariness!’ And you sneer at it…”

 Malachi 2:11-16 “…He has married the daughter of a foreign god…You cover 
the altar of the Lord with tears, with weeping and crying…Yet you say, ‘For 
what reason?’...For the Lord God…hates divorce…”

 Malachi 2:17 “You have wearied the Lord with your words; yet you say, ‘In 

what way have we wearied Him?...Where is the God of justice?’”

 Malachi 3:7 “Return to Me…but you said, ‘In what way shall we return?’”
 Malachi 3:8 “Yet you have robbed Me! But you say, ‘In what way have we 

robbed You?’ In tithes and offerings.”

7

 Malachi 3:13-14 “Your words have been harsh against Me…yet you say, ‘What 

have we spoken against You?’ You have said, ‘It is vain to serve God.’”

We would do well in our study of Malachi to reflect for a moment, at some point, on 
how we might turn all of the negative “disputations” into positive responses.



 You have loved Me, Lord, and here are the ways I see that Love in my life.


I will seek to offer the best sacrifices of my life to celebrate Your name and 
divine qualities.
I will work toward the preservation of Your conjugial principles. I will at 
all times seek to wed my will and understanding into a marriage that honors 
the Lord.

I will not arrogantly (haughtily) question your judgment and justice.
 My time, my tithes will be given in a daily thought and reflection period 

for You.

 The work I do for the Lord is not a vain thing. The work of the New Church
is vital work. It is a church that needs me to seek for the best understanding 
of the Lord’s truth in His Word.

Malachi 3:10-12 makes this promise to those who seek the ways of the Lord:

“‘Bring all the tithes into the storehouse, that there may be food in My house. And try
Me now in this,’ says the Lord of hosts, ‘if I will not open for you the windows of 
heaven and pour out for you such blessing that there will not be room enough to 
receive it. And I will rebuke the devourer for your sakes, so that he will not destroy 
the fruit of your ground, nor shall the vine fail to bear fruit for you in the field,’ says 
the Lord of hosts; ‘and all nations will call you blessed, for you will be a delightful 
land,’ says the Lord of hosts.”

This passage is packed with correspondences. It deals with remains being brought 
into the memory. It is a divine invitation to try the Lord and see that He is good. 
Notice the word “if.” If we try the Lord, if we allow the remains of good to feed us, 
the windows of heaven will open and in will be poured blessings we would never 
have dreamed possible. Our “cup” will “run over.” The Lord promises to rebuke the 
devourers of hell. He will increase our understanding and will. Others will call us 
blessed (happy) and will find us to be a delightful land.

Notice also the repetition of phrases in this verse. Repetition is not for effect. 
Repetition is not for poetical beauty. Repetition is for spiritual purposes. The phrase 
“says the Lord of hosts” occurs three times. One is for the will, one is for the 
understanding, and one is for uses. What does the phrase “says the Lord of hosts” 
represent? Apocalypse Explained (AE) 453 [6] gives us this insight: “‘Jehovah of 
Hosts’…signifies the arrangement of truths from good by the Lord against the 
falsities from evil…” Hence we have a promise from the Lord that He will fight for His
church to save it and for all of the people within His church. The Lord’s zeal will win 

8

over the forces of hell. He will rescue and preserve the remnant so that a New 
Church will be born that will last for ever and ever.

The word “if” is a conditional word. The Lord awaits an answer from us. If we try 
Him, if we open the door (or window), He will come in and give us infinite blessings. 
What a great invitation the “Messenger of the Lord” brings to the church in The Book
of Malachi.

“Behold, I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears My voice and opens the door, 
I will come in to him and dine with him, and he with Me.” (Revelation 3:20, emphasis 
added)

Chapter One

MALACHI 1:1-2

“The burden [oracle] of the word of the Lord to Israel by Malachi.

‘I have loved you,’ says the Lord. Yet you say, ‘In what way have you loved us?’ ‘Was not 
Esau Jacob’s brother?’ says the Lord. ‘Yet Jacob I have loved…’”

Passages From The Writings

P&P



“The Lord has instituted a church with those who could be in external truth, 
but who were not in external good.”

Arcana Coelestia (AC) 3322 [11]



“In Malachi…1:1-3…‘Esau’ denotes the evil of the natural that does not admit 
spiritual truth which is ‘Israel’…and what is doctrinal of truth which is 
‘Jacob’…and on this account he is vastated, which is being ‘hated’ (that ‘hating’
is nothing else, is manifest from what was adduced above from the Word 
concerning Esau and Edom in a good sense); but when truth does not suffer 
itself to be adjoined to good, then evil is on the other hand predicated of 
Jacob…”

Derived Doctrine

“The burden [oracle] of the word of the Lord to Israel by Malachi.”

 A “burden” signifies infestations from falsities and consequent combats (AC 

7109).

 What is meant by “oracle” is at first somewhat vague, but with some thought 
and reflection, a meaning begins to take shape. In AE 277, we read that an 
oracle signifies the inmosts. The inmost of the church? The inmost of the 
individual? The inmost of the Lord?

 According to AE 638 [8], an “oracle” signifies where the Lord is.
 AC 1574 [3] states that an oracle signifies a Divine response. 


In II Samuel 16:23, we read about “the oracle of God.” Coronis 25 teaches that 
this signifies love and wisdom. 
So it seems that this reference to the “burden” or “oracle” of the Word of the 
Lord simply means that the inmost of the Lord, His love and wisdom, was 



10



about to make a divine response to the infestations from falsities that had 
entered Israel and the church.
“Israel” signifies the church (AC 3654), the spiritual person (AC 4402), and 
goods and truths (AC 4502). Israel signifies that people who are of the church 
should hear the Lord, that is, hear Him in the Word (AC 6340). Israel signifies 
spiritual good(AC 5595), and it also signifies the quality of the church (AC 
6636).

 Malachi’s name means “My messenger” or “My angel.” AC 4239, when 

explaining Jacob sending messengers to Esau, gives this representation: “…
the subject here treated of is the conjunction of truth Divine of the natural 
(which is ‘Jacob’) with the good Divine therein (which is ‘Esau’) and therefore
the enlightenment of the natural from the Divine…”

 AC 1925 has a wonderful explanation of “messenger angels.” “They were 

angels who were sent to men, and who spoke through the prophets; yet 
what they spoke was not from the angels, but through them, for the state of 
the latter was then such that they knew not but that they were Jehovah, that 
is, the Lord; but as soon as they had done speaking, they returned into their 
former state, and spoke as from themselves.” (emphasis added)

“‘I have loved you,’ says the Lord.”

 What is the essence of the Lord’s Love? True Christian Religion (TCR) 43 [5] 

teaches us that His essence is:

1. To love others outside of Himself. 
2. To desire to be one with others.
3. To render others blessed from Himself.

 Other teachings, too many to quote, state that the Lord’s love is for the 
salvation of the whole human race and that this love is ardent. See, for 
example, AC 1820. The Lord’s love is mercy (AC 1870). The Lord’s love toward 
the universal human race is such that He wills that “not one of them may 
perish” (AC 2023). “The Lord’s love surpasses all human understanding.” (AC 
2077) “The Lord’s love, that is His mercy, is constant and eternal.” (AC 2177)

“Yet you say, ‘In what way have You loved us?’”

 We have here a debate between human beings and the Lord. It’s not the Lord 
debating. When a negative debate comes from a person, the internals shut 
down and little or nothing can be seen. Please read in its entirety a passage in
AC 3428. Here is the shortened version: “so long as men remain in debate as 
to whether a thing is, and whether it is so, they can never advance into 
anything of wisdom.” There are innumerable things they can never see; they 
are like people who stand outside of the magnificent palace of wisdom and 
merely knock at the door but never enter. They remain “in complete 
ignorance of what charity is.”  

11

 Can we safely assume this “debating nature” is what kept the children of 

Israel from seeing or being aware of the manifold ways the Lord loved them?

“‘Was not Esau Jacob’s brother?’ says the Lord. ‘Yet Jacob I have loved…’”

 The story of Esau and Jacob struggling together as brothers, as told in Genesis
25:24-25, is about primacy. It centers on the debate “as to whether good or 
truth is prior, or what is the same, whether charity which is of good, or truth 
which is of faith, is prior. From the earliest times there has been much 
contention in the spiritual church concerning this question…” (AC 3289, 
emphasis added)

 Esau and Jacob signify, respectively, the truth of good from which is truth in 

the natural and the good of truth in the natural (AC 3677).

 Esau, later in our study called the nation of Edom, signifies the (love) good of 
the natural to which the doctrinal things of truth have been conjoined. In the 
opposite sense, Esau signifies the evil of self-love adding itself to the (love) 
good of the natural (AC 3322). In AC 3322 [8], we read further that Esau in the
opposite sense signifies the evils of the natural person from the love of self, 
which despises and rejects all truth.

 Why does this verse say that the Lord loved Jacob and hated Esau? Esau, 

representative of the external love of the church, would not allow or permit 
truth (Jacob) to enter the church and be adjoined to good. When love 
becomes corrupted, it is a more serious offense than when truth becomes 
corrupted. Truth is more correctable because it is in the external realm of our
being. A corrupted love has many more pathways connected to internal 
deceits. Therefore, when the Lord’s zeal seeks to bring together a corrective 
love and wisdom, the corrupted love perceives the Lord’s actions as “angry” 
when, in fact, they are acts of deep divine love seeking to lift the soul.

Putting It All Together

Our ability to pull these verses together hinges on our understanding of the 
information found in P&P: “The Lord has instituted a church with those who could 
be in external truth, but who were not in external good.”

The external church became embroiled in infestations from falsities. Their mental 
and spiritual combats were not conducive to regeneration; instead, they prevented 
the people from progressing toward a love of truth. Can you picture great debates 
occurring within the church about the meaning and application of the Word? The 
“tradition of the elders,” the rabbinical exposition of the Law of Moses, was hardened
and without an openness to find and live a life based on a charitable love for the 
Lord and neighbor. The Lord noted this tendency in the church when He stated: 
“Thus you have made the commandment of God of no effect by your tradition.” 
(Matthew 15:6) Tradition supplanted the Word of the Lord. The external church was 

12

filled with intellectual pride and self-love, which prevented the Lord from 
illustrating truths so as to show the way and warmth of His love.

When the Word of the Lord says “I have loved you…” and the reply from the church is
“In what way have You loved us?”, we can sense how far the hardness of their hearts 
had moved the children of Israel from the Lord. They couldn’t name one loving act 
from the Lord. They felt that the Lord’s presence was gone from their lives. To Israel, 
He was invisible, untouchable, and they did not appreciate Him. It would appear that
they believed all of the benefactions of life were self-derived, with nothing 
attributable to the Lord’s constant Love. Can we say the words of Israel again 
without feeling a sense of sadness? “In what way have You Loved us?” Do we not 
hear the spirit of negative debate keeping them outside the door of the temple of 
wisdom?

When the church argues about the primacy of good and truth, it errs greatly. 
The Lord directs the orderly progress and timing, or primacy, of good and truth in 
our lives. The story of Esau and Jacob illustrates this well. We need to visit this 
lesson when we hear such arguments in the church. The Writings teach that truth is 
first in time, but love is first in end. Truth must lead for a time, but love is to reign in 
the end. Both have a use. One is not more important than the other. However, in our 
text, self-love blocked the way of truth coming into the church. The blockage of truth 
was not by accident or from a state of ignorance. It was a hindrance of choice, a 
choice of serious spiritual consequences. So the Lord’s Word illustrated this mistake 
with words that appear, or sound, like Divine favoritism: “Yet Jacob, I have loved…”

Why would the Lord love Jacob and hate Esau? Let’s answer this question by 
reflecting on the example Jeremiah was given at the potter’s house. When clay, the 
good of love in the mind, is hardened, when clay bakes in the oven of self-love, it 
cannot be reshaped by the Potter. In contrast, the clay of truth, unbaked, can be 
reshaped. The imperfections can be removed by the Potter and the clay made into 
new vessels.

The Love of Jacob and the Hate of Esau are not the lesson to be learned. Being 
grateful, amiable, malleable, in the hands of the Lord is what is prized. This then is 
the opening message of Malachi’s “burden” or oracle to Israel. Good is to welcome 
and draw in the truths of the Word. The heart of the external church is to seek 
ardently the truths of the Lord. This is what makes for a healthy, growing church. 
This is what the Lord wants for His church.

Questions to Stimulate Reflection

 Have you ever participated in a discussion about the primacy of love or truth?
What side would you favor in such a debate? If you argued this point, was 
there any satisfaction about the outcome?
Israel’s debate with the Lord is sad. Do you recall talking with people who 
were bitter about the way the Lord was not doing anything favorable for their
life? Did they express an anger that seemed to keep them from being 
interested in hearing about the love of the Lord?



 How well do you feel you could explain why the Lord said He loved Jacob? Do 
you have any examples that would clarify the meaning of this love in the 
spiritual sense?

 How well do you understand the meaning of Malachi’s “burden” or “oracle”?
 Malachi’s name means “My messenger.” It also could mean “My angel.” Does 

AC 1925, in the Derived Doctrine section, help picture the duties of a 
messenger of the Lord?

MALACHI 1:3-4 (A)

“…But Esau I have hated, and laid waste his mountains and his heritage for the jackals 
of the wilderness. Even though Edom has said, ‘We have been impoverished, but we will
return and build the desolate places…’”

Passages From The Writings

P&P



“All external good has been destroyed and hence also external truth.”

AC 7293 [5]



“In these passages ‘serpents’ denote falsities from which are reasonings. The 
same are also signified by ‘dragons;’ but ‘dragons’ denote reasonings from the
loves of self and of the world, thus from the cupidities of evil, which pervert 
not only truths, but also goods. These reasonings come forth from those who 
in heart deny the truths and goods of faith, but in mouth confess them for the 
sake of the lust of exercising command and of making profit…” Malachi 1:3 is 
cited.

Apocalypse Revealed (AR) 537



“…falsities devastate the church, since they take away its truths and goods, 
therefore they were represented by ‘a dragon.’ The reason is, because by ‘a 

14

dragon,’ in the Word, is signified the devastation of the church, as may appear 
from the following passages…Malachi 1:3…”

AR 546



“That by ‘a wilderness’ is signified the church devastated, or in which all 
truths of the Word are falsified…” Malachi 1:3 is cited.

AE 714 [25]



“In Malachi…1:3…‘Esau’ means such as are in good in respect to the natural 
man, here such as are in evil…therefore it is said, ‘Esau I hated;’ that the 
goods of love of the natural man will be destroyed is signified by ‘I made his 
mountains a waste;’ and that the truths of that good will be destroyed by the 
falsities of the sensual man is signified by ‘I gave his heritage to the dragons 
of the wilderness.’”

AE 730 [21]



“In Malachi…1:3…‘Esau’ signifies the love of the natural man; ‘his mountains’ 
signify the evils from that love, and ‘his heritage’ signifies the falsities from 
those evils, and ‘the dragons of the desert’ signify mere falsifications from 
which these come.” 

Derived Doctrine

“…But Esau I have hated, and laid waste his mountains and his heritage for the jackals 
of the wilderness.”



 The meaning of hating Esau was covered in the previous section. In essence, 
this statement refers to the signification of Esau being a spoiled or falsified 
love of the natural person.
“Mountains” signify the extension of worship within the heart. In the positive 
sense, a mountain represents where love to the Lord and the worship of Him 
prevails in the church (AE 734 [2]). In the negative sense, a mountain signifies
the height or magnitude of evils that spring from the love of self and of the 
world (AE 411).

 A mountain being “laid waste” signifies the work of the Lord vastating the evil
and falsities of the heart so that good and truth may return to the church. AC 
6141defines being “laid waste” as being without truth that is visible.

 Note: the King James translation of the Word uses the wording “dragons of 
the wilderness” and the New King James translation “the jackals of the 
wilderness.” Is there a conflict of meaning here in the spiritual sense? In the 
Writings, Swedenborg uses “IIM,” “IJIM,” “OCHIM,” and “ZIIM,” which are the 
Latin transliterations of the Hebrew words meaning wild beasts of the desert,

15

howling creatures, hyenas, jackals, and dragons. Essentially, all of these 
animals signify adulterated and profaned truths and goods.

“Even though Edom has said, ‘We have been impoverished, but we will return and build
the desolate places…’”



“But in the opposite sense by ‘Esau’ and ‘Edom’ are represented those who 
turn aside from good through the fact that they altogether despise truth, and 
are unwilling that anything of the truth of faith should be adjoined, which is 
chiefly owing to the love of self…This evil of the love of self, which is of such a 
nature as not to admit the truths of faith, thus neither the doctrinal things of 
truth, is described in various passages of the Word by ‘Esau’ and ‘Edom’…” 
(AC 3322 [7])



 AC 775 explains the meaning of “impoverished” by showing “how almost non-
existent human wisdom is, in that it hardly knows of the existence of spiritual
good and truth, let alone what these may be.”
Is Edom’s promise to return and build the desolate places a boast that it will 
restore the dwellings of self-love, or is it a promise to restore order to the 
Lord’s external church? If it means the positive restoration of order, then 
Edom must change and allow the truths of faith and the doctrinal things to 
enter the heart and mind of the church. But if it is a selfish boast, then Edom 
intends to rebuild a life of pretense and sham. Malachi 1:5 leaves no doubt as 
to what the answer is to our question.

Putting It All Together

The Writings help to explain what kind of spiritual disorder Israel had within its 
heart and mind when Malachi prophesied on behalf of the Lord. The problem 
exposed by the Lord was something only He could know with certainty. There were 
those in the church who spoke with what appeared to be sound “reasonings.” What 
kind of reasoning did they use? The reasonings “come forth from those who in heart 
deny the truths and goods of faith…” “They confess them for the sake of the lust of 
exercising command and of making profit…” (AC 7293 [5]) We also have a quote from
AC 3322 [7] that tells us they (Edom) “turn aside from good through the fact that 
they altogether despise truth, and are unwilling that anything of the truth of faith 
should be adjoined…owing to the love of self…” We now can see why P&P sums up 
the church’s problems with these words: “All external good has been destroyed and 
hence also external truth.”

The impoverishment Edom admits to is interesting in that, unwittingly, Edom was 
revealing what kind of spiritual state it was in. For “impoverishment” signifies “how 
almost non-existent human wisdom is, in that it hardly knows of the existence of 
spiritual good and truth, let alone what these may be.” And yet, in spite of this 
impoverishment, Edom foolishly believes that it can return and build once again, by 
its own power, in desolate places. The illusions of spiritual insanity are grandiose 

16

and without substance to fulfill their unrealistic promises. How sad and empty Edom
is as portrayed in this prophetical lesson.

Questions to Stimulate Reflection

 Looking back at the first verse of Malachi, can we now see why the people of 
Israel felt the Lord didn’t love them? Their choices rebuffed all the love the 
Lord wanted to give them. Their rejection of the Lord blocked the entrance of 
His benefactions.

 The “serpent” or “jackals of the wilderness” are not from the Lord. Instead, 
they represent the devastation of the church brought about by the false 
reasonings of self-love within the people.

 Did you get a clear picture of what “impoverishment” represents? Isn’t that 

quote from the Arcana Coelestia a great one to illustrate how human 
prudence fails to get the full picture of the Divine plan?

 What examples can we think of that show self-love boasting of its ability to 

build in desolate places?

 What kind of mountains have we built in our lifetime? Mountains of self-love 
or mountains of exalted love and worship for the Lord? Or can we see some of
both kinds? 

MALACHI 1: 4 (B) -6

“Thus says the Lord of hosts: ‘They may build, but I will throw down; they shall be 
called the territory of wickedness, and the people against whom the Lord will have 
indignation forever. Your eyes shall see, and you shall say, “The Lord is magnified 
beyond the border of Israel.” A son honors his father and a servant his master. If then I 
am the Father, where is My honor? And if I am a Master, where is My reverence? Says 
the Lord of hosts to you priests who despise My name. Yet you say, “In what way have 
we despised Your name?”’”

from these passages…Malachi 1:5…”



“In Malachi…1:6…The terms ‘honor’ and ‘fear’ are used because ‘honor’ is 
predicated of the worship from good, and ‘fear’ of the worship by means of 
truths…therefore, ‘honor’ is also predicated of Father, and ‘fear’ of Lord, for 
Jehovah is called ‘Father’ from Divine good, and ‘Lord’ here from Divine 
truth.”

Derived Doctrine

“They may build, but I will throw down…”

 To “build” signifies to form doctrinal things (AC 1187, 1302). Where will 
Edom rebuild in the future? On the rock or on the sand? In a place of 
abundance or a place of desolation?

 To “throw” or cast signifies to be among falsities (AC 4728).
 The “downfall” of any nation signifies what occurs to those who do good for 

the sake of personal profit or reward in heaven (AC 8002 [5]).

“…they shall be called the territory of wickedness...”

“Call” signifies to have a given quality (AC 3421).


 The “territory of wickedness” signifies the realm or residence of all the 

falsities of evil, a place where there is a unified wish for the destruction of the
Lord’s good and truth. Here are a few passages to consider when thinking 
about the “territory of wickedness.” AC 374: Hatred is the source of all 

18

wickedness. AC 1076: Those without a conscience rush into all wickedness. 
AC 1080: Hatred lurks in every word spoken by the wicked. AC 1182: 
Wickedness residing in hatred and deceit makes worship unholy.

“…and the people against whom the Lord will have indignation forever.”

 Does the Lord really have “indignation” toward anyone? No! To the wicked, it 
appears so. They project the indignation they feel toward the Lord as the 
indignation they imagine the Lord has for them. They totally miss the quality 
of His love. Read AC 963 for a description of the indignation of the evil.
 AC 3839 has this explanation for the Lord’s “indignation”: “It is not of anger, 
but of zeal, in which there is nothing of evil, and which is far removed from 
hatred and revenge…indignation springs from good…”

 AC 3909 defines the “indignation” of the Lord toward evil as a “certain 
sadness that is attended with a prayerful wish that it be not so…”

 Thus, we may conclude that the Lord’s love or “indignation” toward evil will 

be “forever.” He is not happy over the loss of one sheep.

“Your eyes shall see, and you shall say, ‘The Lord is magnified beyond the border of 
Israel.’”



“Eyes,” in the positive sense, signify the perception of the understanding and 
the intelligence given (AC 2701).

 To “see,” in the positive sense, signifies to perceive the truths that are in the 
Word from the Lord and, through them, to know and acknowledge Him (AR 
938).

 To “say” sometimes signifies to perceive and sometimes to think because 

“saying” involves both perception and thought (AC 2619).

 Webster’s New College Dictionary (1956 edition) defines “magnify” as “to 

exalt; to enlarge; to make something stand high; to call something great; to 
declare something as being all glorious.”

 When anyone seeks to “magnify” the Lord, they must do so from a state of 



humility from the affection of good. To “magnify” the Lord is to acknowledge 
His omnipotence (AC 8280).
“Beyond the border of Israel” offers an interesting lesson for us to reflect on. 
The words “beyond the border (boundaries)” teach us that the things of the 
Lord are beyond, or exceed, the external forms of worship. External worship 
is dead in comparison to the things of the Lord and His celestial and spiritual 
truths. The Lord is Infinite. External worship is finite. The Lord is “beyond the
border,” or boundaries, of our finite comprehension. See AC 1212, 1866, and 
2973.

19

“A son honors his father…”

 AC 5515 tells us that “sons of our father” signifies truths that are derived from
good and so from one origin, “moreover, all truths are from one good.” A son, 
in the positive sense, represents truths that have their origin in genuine 
truths.

 To “honor” signifies to worship the Lord’s Divine Good (AR 373).


“Father” signifies divine good from the Lord “…by whom is everywhere meant
Jehovah, from Whom He was, and Who was in Him, and never any Divine 
separate from Him…” (AR 170)

“…and a servant his master.”

 A “servant” signifies external memory-knowledges serving the internal 

person (AC 1486). “Servants” signify things in the external that must render 
obedience to the interior person (AC 1713). Interestingly, AC 3975 states that 
“serving” signifies “labor and study.” “Servants” signify being kept constantly 
in truths from the Lord(AR 380).
“Master” signifies the internal person whom the external person is to serve 
(AE 409 [8]). A reference in AC 2921 notes that the “name ‘Lord’” is used as to 
good and the “name ‘Master’” as to truth.



“If then I am the Father, where is My honor? And if I am a Master, where is My 
reverence?”

 To understand the fuller meaning of the Lord’s questions, we need to draw 
from what was learned above to make a summary for ourselves of what is 
being asked in the spiritual sense. To accommodate the eye, the spiritual 
sense is in the darker print.
If I am the Father – If I am the one origin of good


 Where is My honor? – Where is the holy worship of My Divine Good?

 Where is My reverence? – Where is the worship from holy fear? Where is 
the worship from charity? Where is the shunning of evils as sins against 
God? Where have you refrained from committing them?
Information about the meaning of “reverence” may be found in AC 355, 5459, 
and Divine Providence (DP) 20.

If I am a Master – If the external is to serve the internal



“Says the Lord of hosts to you priests who despise My name.”



“Lord of hosts” signifies the Lord as to all goods and truths fighting against 
falsities and evils (AE 453 [6]). “Jehovah of hosts” signifies the church in its 
whole complex by which the Lord removes the hells in general and with 
everyone in particular (AE 734 [8]).

20



“Priests,” in the positive sense, represent the Lord as to the Divine Good as to 
the work of salvation (AC 9809). “Priests” are to teach the goods and truths of 
life (AE 235 [7], 624 [17]). But the priests the Lord mentions in this text did 
not do these things. They cared little for the feeding of souls within the 
church.

 To “despise” signifies to look with contempt on the things of the Lord and to 
lightly esteem the conjunction of truth and good (AC 1911). “Despise” also 
signifies to consider the good of life, as a priority, to be of no account (AC 
3336).

“Yet you say, ‘In what way have we despised Your name?’”





Is there a degree of softness in their question? Is there a spirit of willing self-
reflection? Are the priests open to hearing a Divine “review” of their work on 
His behalf? Or do we hear a spirit of rebellion and debate? Are these priests 
talking back as if the Lord was a “peer” of theirs?
It would seem self-love wants no review from the Lord. With a casual wave of 
the hand, the questioners make light or little of the Lord’s words.

 The Lord, in His infinite Love, will now take time to answer them. Will they 
listen, or will they once again answer with a question laden with rejection? 
Read AC 963 to learn about evil’s indignation with the Lord’s truth.

Putting It All Together

“Although the church is there, yet they do not acknowledge the Lord.” (P&P)

The church was there. The services were being held as usual. There were priests, 
and there were people. Buildings were going up, nice-looking facades, too. Wasn’t 
that a good sign that the job of the church was being done?

Not in the eyes of the Lord. The Lord had important things to say regarding the 
spiritual quality of the church. The Lord said that He would throw down the edifice 
of respectability self-love had constructed. He promised to expose the falsities of the 
external church. The Lord likened the church to a “territory of wickedness.” Why did 
the Lord use such strong terms to describe the church? He wanted to point out the 
source of their wickedness. Lies and hatred lurked in every word they uttered. The 
church harbored indignation toward the Lord. The church didn’t have as its 
propriety a wholesome mission of uniting love and wisdom in the hearts and minds 
of the congregation. Instead, the people of the church went out of their way to block 
such a union.

In a usual way of defeating an opponent, the church accused the Lord of having 
indignation toward them. The Lord harbored no such indignation toward the church.
Instead, He had a “certain sadness that is attended with a prayerful wish that it [evil 
in the church] be not so…”

21

To awaken in the church a degree of self-examination, the Lord asks them a series of 
questions. The heart of the questions is His intent to help them to focus on the 
source of their faith. Am I your Father?, He asks. Where is My honor? If I am Your 
Master, where is My reverence? As we outlined above, these questions were 
intended to get the people to see the Lord as the one and only source of good. The 
Lord wanted His church to worship that good. He wanted to help them bring their 
externals into order so as to strengthen their internals. The Lord wanted them to 
shun evils as sins against Him. The Lord wanted a committed and dedicated 
priesthood to care for the souls of the people and to teach and preach the goods and 
truths of the Word, so that lives might be amended in the process of regeneration.

Would the people listen? Would they change from a territory of wickedness to a 
territory of goodness? No; instead, they asked the question, “In what way have we 
despised Your name?” They issued a challenge to the Lord’s perception and 
assessment of the quality of spirituality within the external church. With such an 
arrogant attitude, is it not logical for the Lord to say of them, “Although the church is 
there, yet they do not acknowledge the Lord”?

Questions to Stimulate Reflection

 Can you think of a way to illustrate the external signs of growth exhibited by 
something that lacks a solid and moral foundation for spiritual growth?
 Were you able to follow the series of questions the Lord asked regarding a 

father and son, a master and servant, and reverence? What did you take from 
this teaching?

 What is it about our proprium that thinks it can treat the Lord as a peer? Why

is it unwilling to listen to the Lord’s call for change?

 The quote from AC 3909 regarding the Lord’s “indignation” shows that He is 
soft, loving, and quite helpful. Doesn’t this description remove from our 
minds the feeling that the Lord is a stern taskmaster? Doesn’t it convey the 
message that He is sorry for our mistakes and that He wishes that it be not so
with us?

MALACHI 1:7-8

“You offer defiled food on My altar. But you say, In what way have we defiled You? By 
saying, The table of the Lord is contemptible. And when you offer the blind as a 
sacrifice, is it not evil? And when you offer the lame and sick, is it not evil? Offer it then 
to your governor! Would he be pleased with you? Would he accept you favorably? says 
the Lord of hosts.”

Passages From The Writings

P&P



“They worship the Lord from evil and not from good.”

AC 2165 [2]



“Now as ‘bread’ means all kinds of food in general, it therefore signifies in the 
internal sense all those things which are called celestial foods, as may be still 
more evident from the burnt offerings and sacrifices that were made of 
lambs, sheep, she-goats, kids, he-goats, heifers, and oxen, which were called 
in one word the ‘bread of the offering’…In Malachi…1:7…the hallowed things 
of the sacrifices, which they ate, were called ‘bread’…”

The New Jerusalem and Its Heavenly Doctrine 221



“That the burnt-offerings and sacrifices, which consisted of lambs, she-goats, 
sheep, kids, he-goats, and bullocks, were in one word called ‘Bread,’ is evident
from the following passages…Malachi 1:7…”

TCR 707



“To eat of the holy things was to eat of the flesh of the sacrifices, which is here
called ‘bread,’ as well as in Malachi 1:7…”



“As what is blind signified what is false, therefore in the representative Jewish
Church it was forbidden to sacrifice anything that was blind (Lev. 22:22; Deut.
15:21; Malachi 1:8). It was also forbidden that any one of the priests who was
blind should draw near to offer upon the altar…”

“By ‘eye’…is not meant the eye, but the understanding of truth. Since by ‘eye’ 
is signified the understanding of truth, therefore it was among the statutes of

“Because the ‘eye’ signified the understanding it was among the statues 
pertaining to the sons of Israel…” Malachi 1:8 is cited.

“By the ‘lame’ in the Word are…signified those who are in no good, and 
thence in no truth…And because such are signified by the ‘lame,’ it was 
forbidden to sacrifice anything that was lame…Malachi 1:8…”

Derived Doctrine

“You offer defiled food on My altar.”





In the positive sense, Abel’s “offering” signifies worship grounded in charity 
(AC 350). In the negative sense, Cain’s “offering” represented the works of 
faith without charity (AC 346). “That by ‘offerings’ in general is meant 
worship, is evident in the Prophets throughout, as in Malachi…” (AC 349)
“Defiled” signifies a conjunction that is not legitimate (AC 4439). “Defile” 
signifies the profanation of spiritual good in the natural. When faith is 
separated from the good of charity, it is either dissipated or initiated into and 
conjoined with what is evil and false (AC 6348).

 The construction of an “altar,” “My altar,” was quite specific. Its dimensions, 

namely “the height, breadth, and length, signified in general good, truth, and 
the holy thence derived…the stones…signified lower truths…the brass…
signified natural good…the horns signified the power of truth from good…the
fire upon the altar signified love…the sacrifices and burnt offerings signified 
celestial and spiritual things according to their various species…Hence it is 
evident that internal things were contained within these external ones…” (AC 
4489)  
It appears that the priests became careless with the specifics of the offerings 
and their representations.



“By saying, ‘The table of the Lord is contemptible.’”

 AC 9527 tells us that a “table” signifies “a receptacle for celestial things, thus 
heaven in respect to the reception of such things as are from the Lord.” This 

24

passage describes the things on the Lord’s Table as the source of “consequent
blessedness and happiness.” 

 To understand the meaning of “contemptible,” let’s look at what it means to 
despise something. To despise signifies those who turn aside from good by 
utterly despising truth (AC 3322 [7]).

“And when you offer the blind as a sacrifice, is it not evil? And when you offer the lame 
and sick, is it not evil?”

 We read above that the “blind” signified what was false and thus meant a 
blind understanding. “Lame” signifies one who is not in genuine good 
because of not having been taught what is good and true (AE 518 [4]). “Lame”
signifies, in the opposite sense, those who are in natural good into which 
spiritual truths cannot flow because the fallacies of the senses will not admit 
truths (AC 4302 [8]).

 The Lord asks the people whether offering these flawed things is an evil act. 
Didn’t they know the code of sacrificing? Did they do these things in spite of 
the spiritual directives?

“‘Offer it then to your governor! Would he be pleased with you? Would he accept you 
favorably?’ says the Lord of hosts.”





“Governors” signify “generals in which and under which are particulars.” (AC 
5290) The Lord asked the people if they would be satisfied if “general gifts” 
were given to them. He knew that because of their care for themselves, they 
would have wanted the very best “particular gifts.” What a great question by 
the Lord. He got to the core of their ruling love and what quality it was. Love 
of self was of greater importance than love of the Lord.
“The Lord of hosts” is used again to signify His zeal to remove the hells from 
every person and from the church to clean up its worship of His good and 
truth.

Putting It All Together

“They [the church] worship the Lord from evil and not from good.” (P&P)

Offerings to the Lord that should have been the very best were compromised. 
Flawed sacrifices were routinely being put on the altar, or table, of the Lord. Careless
attitudes were employed in the temple. Ritual, tradition, required the people to offer 
sacrifices, but theirs were vain oblations and were not sacrifices of willing hearts.

Those who acted in the priestly role cared more for themselves than for the Lord. 
They worried more about what others thought of them than about what the Lord 
thought of them. Worship was so empty that, within their hearts, they found the 
Lord’s Table “contemptible.” The Lord instituted the sacrifice of “breads” so that the 

25

people might find it a “source of consequent blessedness and happiness” (AC 9527). 
The Lord told the people that the table and altar were a source of empty and sad 
worship. The ruling love of the people drove them to take the best for themselves 
and leave the rejects for the Lord.

What did Joseph tell his brothers when he revealed himself to them? “…you meant 
evil against me; but God meant it for good…” (Genesis 50:20) The Lord meant for the 
church to find goodness, blessedness, and happiness, but they meant to perform acts
of evil against Him.

How do the people once again flaunt their contempt for the Lord? “In what way have
we defiled you?” “The table of the Lord is contemptible.” How sad this is, and how 
needy they are of the Lord’s benefactions. Will they come to see the folly of their 
worship?

Questions to Stimulate Reflection

In the face of Israel’s persistent defiance, are you impressed with how patient
the Lord is with them? If the comments made to the Lord were made to us by 
our children, would we be able to remain as calm?

 How about the custom of giving the Lord second best? Do we do the same 

thing today?

 Do we still worry more about what other people think of us than we worry 

about what the Lord thinks of us?

 How about the table of the Lord? We come to the table of Holy Supper 

periodically. Is our heart in the service? Do we leave the table with a sense of 
wonderment? Do we think, “What have I just partaken of? What was I 
supposed to get out of it spiritually?” Has the Holy Supper been a source of 
“consequent blessedness and happiness”?
I couldn’t bring myself to say the words “the Lord’s Table is contemptible.” 
Would you imagine there are some today who might say this about the Lord’s 
Table? What brings a person to this attitude?
I yearn that this might not be said, but I do have a feeling there are some who 
would say that the things of the Lord have no worth for them. Do you hear 
anything that would lead you to concur with my fear?

“But now entreat God’s favor, that He may be gracious to us. While this is being done 
by your hands, will He accept you favorably? says the Lord of hosts. Who is there even 
among you who would shut the doors, so that you would not kindle fire on My altar in 
vain? I have no pleasure in you, says the Lord of hosts, nor will I accept an offering 
from your hands.”



“Therefore their worship is not accepted.”

AR 939



“That by ‘seeing the face of the Lord’ is not meant to see His face, but to know 
and acknowledge Him as He is as to His Divine attributes, which are many; 
and that they who are conjoined with Him by love know Him, and thus see 
His face, may be evident from the following passages…Malachi 1:9…”

AE 412 [11]



“‘In Malachi…1:9...‘faces of Jehovah,’ ‘of God,’ or ‘of the Lord,’ mean in the 
interiors of the church, of the Word, and of worship, because Divine good and 
Divine truth, thus the Lord Himself, are in these interiors, and from them in 
externals; but are not in externals, namely, of the church, of the Word, and of 
worship apart from these.”

AC 8989 [4]



“In Malachi…1:9, 10…‘to shut the doors’ denotes not to communicate with 
holy or Divine things.”

Derived Doctrine

“But now entreat God’s favor, that He may be gracious to us.”

 AC 7391 tells us that to “entreat” or to “supplicate” signifies humiliation, and 
to pray signifies entering a state of humiliation and seeking intercession. The 
reason supplication involves humiliation is that the angels do not attend to 
the supplication but to humiliation.
“Favor” or “grace” signifies to seek comfort and relieve with hope in states of 
temptations (AC 5043).



27

 To be “gracious to us” is a petition to find the Lord’s unfailing care. Those who
“are in humiliation of thought beseech His grace: ‘grace’ relates to spiritual 
things, which are of faith, or the understanding…and ‘mercy’ relates to 
celestial things which are of love or of the will…” (AC 598 [3])

“‘While this is being done by your hands, will He accept you favorably?’ says the Lord of
hosts.”



In the positive sense, “hands” signify ability and power and the confidence 
that attends them (AC 878). But in this verse, it appears that this power, 
ability, and confidence are mostly from self. Otherwise, why would there be a 
question about the Lord accepting the work favorably?

 What leads me to view this from the negative perspective is the added phrase
“the Lord of hosts.” This phrase signifies the Lord’s goods and truths fighting 
against falsities and evils to remove the hells from everyone.

“Who is there even among you who would shut the doors, so that you would not kindle 
fire on My altar in vain?”



 To “shut the doors” is to not communicate with holy or Divine things. “Doors” 
signify what introduces either to good or to truth or to the Lord (AC 2356). 
“Doors” signify admission to the arcana (secrets) of heaven (AE 260 [1/2]).
“Kindle” in the positive sense signifies that nothing of self-love ought to 
appear in the things in a person from the Lord (AC 10732). In the negative 
sense, “kindle” signifies indignation on the part of natural good (AC 3909). So 
which is it? Is it a positive kindling or a negative kindling? The answer seems 
clear from the statement about closing the door and kindling “in vain.” If the 
door is closed and communication with holy things is cut off, how can anyone
kindle a genuine holy fire on the Lord’s altar?

“‘I have no pleasure in you,’ says the Lord of hosts, ‘nor will I accept an offering from 
your hands.’”



“Pleasure,” in the positive sense, signifies the acceptance of love. It also means
to allow love to enrich with Divine truth the life of all who receive life from 
Him. See AE 295 [4] regarding what is meant by the Lord’s “good pleasure.” In
the negative sense, we can see that the Lord wants no part of their evil and 
false hearts. The presence of these evil loves will not permit the Lord to 
enrich them with truth and life. “I have no pleasure in you” sounds hard and 
so final.

 The offering of their hands is unworthy and unacceptable. The ability, power, 
and confidence of their hands are tarnished, unacceptable gifts of self-love. If 
you heard the Lord say these things to you, wouldn’t you be in tears or in a 
state of fright and be anxious to change?

Putting It All Together

“Therefore their worship is not accepted.” (P&P)

What brought the church to the point of not being accepted? The people closed the 
doors. They didn’t let good and truth flow in, so the heavenly secrets of the Lord 
were not present in their worship. The fire on the altar was a vain thing. The work of
their hands was to serve themselves and not to perform acts of charity. Thus, the 
pleasures of the Lord were not able to come to them. He couldn’t accept their love, 
nor could He enrich their lives. This is the short summary. It is a sad commentary. It 
is not one that the Lord’s New Church will ever have to listen to because the Word 
says the walls of the holy city have no gates. The doors are wide open, and they face 
the four quarters so that everyone who approaches the Lord may enter through His 
open gates with praise and thanksgiving.

Questions to Stimulate Reflection





In the text above, I asked a question: If the Lord spoke these things to us, 
would we be in tears or in a state of fear? The judgment of the Lord comes 
from a true picture of what our motives are like. He sees through the shams 
of pretense. So if He declares that doors are shut and our fires are in vain, it 
must be so. This realization must be accompanied by some sense of urgency. 
But Israel doesn’t react that way at all. Why?
I still shudder when I read the words “I have no pleasure in you...nor will I 
accept an offering from your hands.” The answer to this dilemma is not far 
from Israel’s reach. Do you recall the opening? “Now entreat God’s favor” that
“He may be gracious to us.” Without sounding like a born-again preacher, can 
we accept the urgency of getting straight with the Lord? Can we redouble our 
efforts to find ways to open doors?

 Prayer, humiliation, and supplicating the Lord are ways to find what? Grace 

and mercy. Grace for the understanding and mercy for the will.

MALACHI 1:11

“‘For from the rising of the sun, even to its going down, My name shall be great among 
the Gentiles; in every place incense shall be offered to My name, and a pure offering; 
for My name shall be great among the nations,’ says the Lord of hosts.”

said, ‘from the rising of the sun to its going down the name of Jehovah shall

name shall be great among the nations’ signifies that the church and worship 
of the Lord shall be everywhere with those who are in good; ‘from the rising 
of the sun to its going down’ signifying every place where there is good; ‘My 
name shall be great’ signifying the acknowledgment and worship of the Lord; 
and ‘nations’ signifying those who are in good; ‘incense shall be offered unto 
My name, and a clean meal-offering,’ signifies the worship of the Lord from 
spiritual good, which is the good of charity towards the neighbor, and from 
celestial good, which is the good of love to the Lord; worship from spiritual 
good is signified by ‘incense-offering,’ and from celestial good by ‘meal-
offering.’”

AE 401 [28]



“In Malachi…1:11…‘From the rising of the sun unto its going down’ signifies 
all, from the first to the last, who are in the good of love to the Lord, because 
all in heaven dwell according to quarters. Those who are in the good of love 
to the Lord dwell from the east to the west; those who dwell in the east are 
those who are in a clear good of love, and those who dwell in the west are 
those who are in obscure good of love. This is why ‘from the rising of the sun 
unto its going down’ signifies all, from the first to the last, who are in the 
good of love.”

AE 422 [6]



“In many passages the words ‘from east to west,’…are mentioned…these 
quarters involve the two others, because all who are in good are also in 
truths, for good and truth everywhere act as one…the same is true of the 
following passages. In Malachi…1:11…”



“‘Burnt-offering’ also signifies worship from the good of celestial love, and 
‘sacrifice’ worship from the good of spiritual love; these two goods are 
signified also by ‘meal-offering and frankincense.’ The like is true of ‘meal-
offering and incense-offering,’ for the incense-offering was chiefly of 
frankincense. In Malachi…1:11…”

AR 81



“…by His ‘name’ is meant the all of doctrine, and, in the universal sense, the all
of religion. The reason why these things are meant by ‘the name’ of Jehovah is
because in heaven no other names are given but what involve the quality of 
any one, and the quality of God is all that by which He is worshiped…He that 
keeps in mind, therefore, this signification of the ‘name of Jehovah,’ wherever 
it occurs in the Word, will understand…what is signified by it in the following 
places…Malachi 1:11-13…”

TCR 298



“In the spiritual sense, the name of God means everything which the church 
teaches from the Word, and by which the Lord is invoked and worshiped…
That the Word and whatever the church has from it, and thus all worship, is 
the name of God, can be seen from the following passages…Malachi 1:11-
13…”

Derived Doctrine

“For from the rising of the sun, even to its going down, My name shall be great among 
the Gentiles...”

 Consider this teaching in AC 9031 about the rising and setting of the sun: “…

the Sun of heaven, which is the Lord, concerning which it is said that it ‘rises,’ 
but in hearts, when man is being regenerated; and also when he is in the good
of love and faith; and that it ‘sets’ when man is in evil and in the consequent 
falsity. And yet the Lord is continually in His rising, from which also He is 
called the ‘Sunrise,’ or ‘East,’ and He is never in any setting; nor does He 
turn Himself away from man, but man turns himself away from Him. From 
this arises the appearance that the Lord turns away His face and also brings 
evil…”
“My name shall be great” is not a bragging statement from the Lord. Egotism 
is not part of His Divine character. Instead, what is being communicated in 
the spiritual sense is the following: “great” signifies glory (AC 1415); “great” 
signifies a semblance of humiliation from the affection of good (AC 2421 and 
2423); “great” signifies successive increase or abundance (AC 3403); “great” 



32

signifies infinity (AC 4645); “great” signifies that truth from good shall 
increase (AC 6286); and “great” signifies that truths and goods are joined (AC 
6521). The Lord is talking about the growth of His new church and the 
wholeness and strength of its spiritual foundations.

 Why would the Lord establish His new church among the “Gentiles”? AE 

447gives us a valuable clue: “‘Gentiles’ signify the establishment of the church
with those who are in the good of life and receive the truths and are thus in 
the conjunction thereof, and in combat against evil and falsity.”

“…in every place incense shall be offered to My name, and a pure offering…”



“Incense” signifies “a representative of the grateful hearing and reception by 
the Lord of all things of worship which are from love and charity.” (AC 
10176)“…‘incense’ signifies confession, adorations, and prayers which 
proceed through the mouth from thought.” (AC 10295) “‘Incense’ signifies the 
uplifting of worship through prayers.” (AC 10198)

 A “pure” (clean) meat “offering” signifies “the worship of the Lord from 

spiritual good, which is the good of charity towards the neighbor, and from 
celestial good, which is the good of love to the Lord.” (AE 324)

“‘…for My name shall be great among the nations’, says the Lord of hosts.”

 We looked at the signification of “My name” as being a promise of the 

increase of good and truth. His name has reference to His infinity. The use of 
the word “nations” has significance when we read AC 409: “The church rarely, 
if ever, remains with those who when vastated have truths among them…but 
is transferred to those who know nothing at all of truths, for these embrace 
the faith much more easily than the former.”

 The “Lord of hosts” signifies the Lord’s zeal to remove the hells from 

everyone and the church to clean up the worship of His good and truth (AE 
734 [8]).

Putting It All Together

How hard must it have been for the people of Israel to hear the words of Malachi 
telling them that the Lord was going to establish His church outside of their nation? 
Would the Lord transfer His care to the Gentiles? What about Israel being the chosen
people?

In all likelihood, the children of Israel scoffed at this prophecy. Gentiles were hated 
and shunned by Israel. Didn’t Israel have scripture that told them to not take unto 
themselves strange wives from the Gentile nations? The tradition of Israel regarding 
the Gentiles was well formed. Gentiles were not to have the things of Israel’s religion.
The people must have reasoned among themselves that the Lord couldn’t and 
wouldn’t go against the long-standing dictates of their spiritual heritage. Israel, in 

33

effect, tried to put the Lord in a finite box, to limit Him. Israel believed they were 
chosen. The Lord’s favoring them was guaranteed. He wouldn’t abandon them for a 
bunch of Gentile nations. However, this was a wrong move on the part of the 
children of Israel.

Let’s bring the internal sense into this discussion. P&P sums up this verse with these
words: “Those who are outside of the church worship the Lord.”

What substantial reasons are we given that support this statement?

1. The Lord is continually “rising” in the minds and hearts of those who love 
Him. Israel let the Lord’s Sun “set.” The Lord never turns Himself from a 
person, but people turn themselves away from the Lord. This turning is called
the “setting of the sun.”

2. The Lord wanted to make His name great in the church. His love and wisdom 

were not, in the church of Israel, being kept in a state of conjunction. 
Wholeness of doctrine was compromised. Genuine worship and the 
inquisitive need to know and discover the truths of the Lord were gone.

3. So the Lord called unto Him the “Gentile” nations where the hearing and 

reception of His Word would begin anew. In the Gentile nations, the “incense”
of confession, adoration, and prayers had the potential to be an acceptable 
gift in the sight of the Lord. The gentile newness would bring clean or pure 
meal-offerings. 

4. AE 324 teaches that the Gentiles had within them the “good of charity 

towards the neighbor…and the good of love toward the Lord.” AE 447 teaches 
that the Gentiles had a desire to receive the good of life and truths so as to 
enter into “combat against evil and falsities.” The Gentile nations would have 
a spiritual inquisitiveness and a desire to fight evil and falsity.

Israel’s days of wanting to fulfill the goals of the Lord were over. This church was 
being vastated, and the work of the Lord was moving on to people and nations that 
would allow His name to be great. The Gentiles were being readied to accept the 
“Lord of hosts.” Their hearts were ready to receive His zeal to remove the hells from 
everyone and the church. Good and truth needed to be conjoined in life so that love 
to the neighbor and love to the Lord would once again thrive in His church.

Questions to Stimulate Reflection



 Can you think of personal examples of your experiences with the rising and 
setting of the sun of the Lord? The Lord never “sets.” He is always “rising.” 
Moments of disappointment or tragedy cause people to allow the setting of 
the Lord’s sun in their lives. In such moments, the light seems to be going 
down or out. What does it take to have a new dawn after this personal 
darkness?
Israel’s obstinacy is remarkable in some ways. Their traditional teachings 
were firm about their “favored nation” status. Can you identify with them? 
How would you feel if it ever came to us that the Lord was going to bring the 
New Church to Gentiles? To make it a little more personal, would we be ready,
and open, to hear this message?
Since coming into the organized New Church, I have heard people say, “We 
need to allow ‘Gentiles’ to find us.” We are somewhat cautious about 
“outsiders” and with some justification. We need to be slow with our 
evangelism so that a genuine sense of spiritual discovery comes with the 
newcomer. We don’t want lip service or a joining for the wrong reasons. 
There have been those who say they are interested in the church but really 
wanted the benefits of school and its tuition breaks.





 Please consider the meaning of a pure (clean) offering and incense. The lack 
of these brought the Jewish church down. Do we have our acts of worship in 
better shape?
I’m still feeling somewhat sorry for the church of Israel. I’m sorry that they 
didn’t listen. I’m sorry that they didn’t want to change. And I am sorry they 
drifted away from the Lord. But why do I feel sorry for them? I guess the 
sorrow has its base in the worry that I too get into patterns where I tend to 
become careless with matters of faith. Are there any ways we can inspire 
each other to offer the incense of prayer, confession, and adoration that will 
stay fresh and sincere?



 Again, I offer a personal feeling: Does a study of the Lord’s Word, such as this 
one, give us a means to keep the “sun rising” and to make the name of the 
Lord great? 
Study is hard. There will be times when we find the application of the Word 
escaping our grasp. But experience shows that a steady plodding will pay 
dividends. Our study will give Spiritual IRAs that pay eternal dividends. What 
are Spiritual IRA’s? Instruction, Reflection, and Application of the Word to the
good of life.  
If you find this kind of study guide useful, will you encourage others to use it 
as well?

MALACHI 1:12-14

“‘But you profane it, in that you say, “The table of the Lord is defiled; and its fruit, its 
food, is contemptible.” You also say, “Oh, what a weariness!” And you sneer at it,’ says 
the Lord of hosts. ‘And you bring the stolen, the lame, and the sick; thus you bring an 
offering! Should I accept this from your hand?’ says the Lord. ‘But cursed be the 
deceiver who has in his flock a male, and makes a vow, but sacrifices to the Lord what 
is blemished—for I am a great King,’ says the Lord of hosts, ‘and My name is to be 
feared among the nations.’”

Passages From The Writings

P&P



“…those who are within the church profane worship, and do not worship the 
Lord.”

AE 725 [11]



“In Malachi…1:14…‘A male in the flock’ signifies the genuine truth of doctrine 
from the Word; ‘a corrupted thing’ signifies what is falsified; and ‘to vow and 
sacrifice’ signifies to worship, thus from things falsified when truth is known; 
that this worship being fraudulent is infernal is signified by ‘cursed be the 
defrauder.’”

Derived Doctrine

“But you profane it [My name] in that you say, ‘The table of the Lord is defiled…’”

 To “profane” “signifies to be led by one’s self and one’s own loves and not by 

the Lord.” (AC 10362) To “profane” signifies to defile holy truths (AC 5044 [7]).

 A “table” of the Lord signifies a receptacle. A table signifies “the reception of 
such things as are from the Lord, which are the good of love and the good of 
faith, and the consequent blessedness and happiness” (AC 9527).
“Defile” signifies the effect of impure worship (AC 1292 [3]).



“…and its fruit, its food, is contemptible.”





“Fruit” signifies good. Essentially, it signifies the good of life (AE 48).
“Food” signifies things of use to a person’s soul (AC 5293).
“Contemptible,” or contempt, signifies those who turn from good by utterly 
despising truth (AC 3322 [7]).

36

“‘Oh, what a weariness!’ And you sneer at [the fruit and food on the Lord’s Table]…”





“Weary,” in the positive sense, signifies to be in distress because there are no 
truths (AC 8568 [9]). The negative sense would be to be in distress because of 
the presence of truth.
“Sneering” has an interesting description in DP 318 [7]. This number draws 
attention to the fact that there is nothing that cannot be confirmed and that 
“falsity is confirmed more readily than the truth.” Those who confirm 
themselves in falsity “sneer” at those who allow the “inflowing light of day” to
dispel falsity. Is this not what is going on in this verse? Sneering at the fruit 
and food on the Lord’s Table is profane, but the people who are sneering 
won’t listen to the Lord’s warning.

“And you bring the stolen, the lame, and the sick…Should I accept this from your 
hand?”








“Stolen” signifies to attribute to oneself what belongs only to the Lord, 
namely good and truth (AC 4002 [2]).
“Lame” signifies those not in good, and so not in truth (AC 4302 [8]).
“Sick” signifies those who are distressed by evils and falsities but don’t want 
to be healed by the Lord. See Conjugial Love (CL) 4586 for the positive 
meaning.
Should the Lord accept these inferior offerings? We know the answer from 
the literal sense. He will not. Nor will He acknowledge the self-power (hand) 
that brought them.

“But cursed be the deceiver who has in his flock a male, and takes a vow, but sacrifices 
to the Lord what is blemished…”



 Please note that most of this verse is explained in AE 725 [11], as quoted 
above. We need just a few points to round out the correspondences.
“Cursed” signifies the sensuous nature that averted “itself from that which is 
heavenly, turned itself to that of the body, and thus cursed itself…” (AC 245)
 A “deceiver” is someone who denies the presence of the Lord for the purpose 

of claiming self-merit (AC 4077 [3]).

 A “vow” in the positive sense signifies a willingness to acknowledge the 

Lord’s providence and allow Him to provide essentials. This is not the case 
with the deceiver. Deceivers give lip-service that is nothing but a sham.
 How do we know this? The Lord refuses to accept a deceiver’s “blemished” 
sacrifices. The Writings use the term “fraudulent” worship (AE 725 [11]).
“Flock” signifies the church and those who are in the truths of simple good 
(AC 6828). “Flock” signifies an interior natural good (AC 4244).
“Male” signifies, in the positive sense, the genuine doctrine of the Word (AC 
7829 and AE 710 [33]). Therefore, we can see why the Lord exposed this 
deceiver among the flock. The deceiver put on the face of genuine doctrine 





37

but wanted to offer fraudulent, blemished sacrifices that were not acceptable 
to the Lord.

“…for I am a great King…and My name is to be feared among the nations.”

 A “king” signifies one who is in truth from affection for what is good (AR 440).
Our verse uses the capital K for “King,” signifying the Lord who is Divine 
Truth and Divine Love.

 As for His name being feared among the nations, we know from doctrine that 
the word “fear” signifies having adoration, a deep humility, a holy love of the 
Lord (AR 56). 

Putting It All Together

The Lord, preparing the disciples for the day when they would have to go out and 
preach and teach without Him, warned them that they would be like sheep in the 
midst of wolves. He warned them to beware of wolves that put on sheep’s clothing. 
He illustrated what their role should be in their ministry. They were to remember 
that a disciple is not above his teacher, nor is a servant above his master. And where 
would they find the enemy? “A man’s enemies will be those of his own household.” 
(Matthew 10:36)

What has this to do with our summation? The cursed, the deceiver, the one with a 
“male in the flock” taking a vow, had little interest in the care of the flock. He put on 
the clothing of sheep. He came looking like he was making a sacrifice to the Lord, but
instead, he brought defective goods to the altar. Love wasn’t there. He made a 
sacrifice to the Lord for show and not for the furtherance of genuine doctrine. The 
“male” averted himself from that which was heavenly. Instead, his real interest was 
to turn all things to the body. The “male” deceiver, in his heart, denied the presence 
of the Lord for the purpose of claiming self-merit. Such profane worship wearied the
Lord. He noted the inward sneer in the deceiver’s heart. Yes, the enemy was really in 
the household of the external church. And so the summation in P&P makes sense:

“…those who are within the church profane worship, and do not worship the 
Lord.”

The cursed, the deceiver, the pretenders would not prevail. The Lord announced that
He was a great King and His name would elicit a holy fear based on adoration, deep 
humility, and a genuine love of His great Kingship. Can you hear Isaiah 9:6 being 
sung in the “Messiah” chorus? “And His name will be called Wonderful, Counselor, 
Mighty God, Everlasting Father, and Prince of Peace. Of the increase of His 
government and peace there will be no end.”

And the people shall say “Amen.”

Questions to Stimulate Reflection

1. At what point of pulling together the doctrine and derived doctrine did the 

spiritual sense of this passage begin to unfold for you?

2. Did you experience a kind of inner light?
3. Could you picture the cursed, the deceiver, and his profane offering of a 

blemished gift instead of the good gift that he could have given; are these 
images illustrating things for you in tangible ways?

4. What stands out in your memory that helps you get the feeling that the Lord 
is a great King? Is it looking back over your life to see how His providence has
guided us over the years? Is it reading the Word to see how He wins out over 
evil? Does it occur with an act of kindness or the gentle sphere of innocence?

5. What does it mean to you that the Lord said He was wearied with the 

sacrifices of the evil?

6. Do you think your moment of reflection would be helped if you played a 

portion of the “Messiah” chorus? Music stirs the soul to feel the majesty and 
glory of our Lord. If you don’t have the music, read Isaiah 9 with the tune in 
your mind.

MALACHI 2:1-4

“‘And now, O priests, this commandment is for you. If you will not hear, and if you will 
not take it to heart, to give glory to My name,’ says the Lord of hosts, ‘I will send a curse
upon you, and I will curse your blessings. Yes, I have cursed them already, because you 
do not take it to heart. Behold, I will rebuke your descendants and spread refuse on 
your faces, the refuse of your solemn feasts; and one will take you away with it. Then 
you shall know that I have sent this commandment to you, that My covenant with Levi 
may continue,’ says the Lord of hosts.”

40

Derived Doctrine

“And now, O priests, this commandment is for you.”

 The word “commandment” needs our attention. Is the Lord referring to the 

Decalogue, or does He mean “listen to this command I am about to give you”?
 The Decalogue is “in a brief summary a complex of all those things of religion 
by means of which there is conjunction of the Lord with man and of man with
the Lord.” (Doctrine of Life 54)

 To “command” signifies to prepare and do, or to act according to the word of 
the Lord (AC 783). To “go and do” signifies to obey Truth Divine and to do so 
from the will (AC 7944-7945).
“Priests” of Aaron and of the Levites represent the work of salvation in 
successive order. The priesthood of Aaron represents the work of salvation of 
those in the Lord’s celestial kingdom, and the priests represented by the 
Levites are the work of salvation proceeding from the former. See AC 10017.



“If you will not hear and if you will not take it to heart…”



“Hear,” in the positive sense, signifies that one who understands should obey 
what the Word teaches. To “hear” is to perceive and to obey (AR 87). From 
this, we can see that to “not hear” represents an unwillingness to perceive 
and obey.

 To take to “heart” signifies doing the will of the Lord from love and freedom 

(AC 9460). Having a stony or stubborn heart signifies the presence of 
impurity and the presence of things that would impede the influx of good and
truth (AC 7225 [2]).

“…to give glory to My name…”

 To “give glory” to the Lord signifies that the Lord desires the surrender of a 
person’s heart and worship of Him from those who love Him (AE 175 [6-7]).
 His “name” signifies the sum of all His qualities, love and faith, by which He is 

to be worshiped (AC 2724).

“…says the Lord of hosts.”

 Have you noticed how many times this phrase is used in the prophecy of 

Malachi? Please make note of this phrase because it signifies the church in its 
whole complex by which the Lord removes the hells in general and with 
everyone in particular (AE 734 [8]).

41

“I will send a curse upon you and I will curse your blessings. Yes, I have cursed them 
already, because you do not take it to heart.”

 The word “curse” appears three times in this verse. The number three 
signifies what is holy, and it signifies the state of repentance, which is 
essential (AC 900 and 901).

 Would it be appropriate for us to consider the trine of love, wisdom, and use 
in this context? Could the “curse” occurring here represent a statement of 
judgment by the Lord about their love, wisdom, and use?
“Curse” signifies that the sensuous has “averted itself from that which is 
heavenly, turned itself to that which is of the body, and thus cursed itself” (AC
245).



“Behold, I will rebuke your descendants…”



“Behold” signifies thought, reflection, acknowledgment, and confession. 
“Behold” what? The Lord and His presence. See AC 2329 and 3711.

 The Lord, in Revelation 3:19, said, “As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten.” 
These words, “rebuke” and “chasten,” signify that those who are being 
regenerated must face temptations “because without them, negations and 
confirmations against Divine truth could not be extirpated.” (AR 215) In AE 
342, we are taught that “rebuke” signifies the desolation of all truth.

 We can understand more of the meaning of “rebuke your descendants” when 
we read a passage in TCR 103 [2]. “Since the soul of man is the man himself, 
and is spiritual in its origin, it is evident why the mind, disposition, nature, 
inclination, and affection of the father’s love dwell in offspring after offspring 
and return and display themselves from generation to generation…And it is 
only by means of the spiritual things of the church that this likeness is 
changed.” (emphasis added) With this teaching in mind, can we see why the 
Lord needed to rebuke the descendants? Only the Lord, His Word, and His 
church can change the tendencies of hereditary evils that are passed on from 
generation to generation.

“…and spread refuse on your faces, the refuse of your solemn feasts; and one will take 
you away with it.”

 A “face” signifies the interiors of the mind (HH 457 and AE 381).


“Dung” (refuse) signifies what is unclean, “consequently evil and falsity, for in
the spiritual sense these are unclean because all that is useless and worn out 
of the food goes into dung.” (AC 10037) In AE 617, we read that “dung” 
signifies the adulteration of Divine truth.

 Putting these teachings together, we can see that the Lord was telling the 

people that all of the useless and wasted things of the interior of their minds 
would become plainly seen by all as if they were written on their faces. Their 
adulteration of truth would be exposed by the Lord.

42



“Feasts,” in the positive sense, have various representations. Let’s look at two 
passages that seem to sum up the representation of feasts. AC 2341 teaches 
that feasts represent nothing else than the Lord’s dwelling with people in the 
holy things of love. AC 5161 teaches that feasts were held to signify the 
initiation into mutual love and thus conjunction with the Lord. Considering 
these teachings, can we then see the negative aspect of our passage? Their 
solemn feasts were not for the purpose of giving the Lord a dwelling place 
within their heart, nor were they interested in His holy things of love. They 
did not wish to be initiated into mutual love or conjunction. It was all a show 
and, therefore, the “refuse” of a solemn feast in the eyes of the Lord.

“…and one will take you away with it.”

 Who is the one who will take them away? Is it the Lord, or is it hell? “One” is 
almost always ascribed to the Lord. “One” is that which is perfect. To “take 
away” signifies to remove every good and truth of the church, leaving no 
power to resist falsities (AE 727 [12]). To “take away” signifies to destroy 
defending truths (AC 10540).

“Then you shall know that I have sent this commandment to you…”

 When it is revealed to the children of Israel that they have no power or 

defending truths left, will their feeling that they are acting from themselves 
change to awareness that without the Lord they are nothing?
Is this verse a “wake-up call” for the church?



“…that My covenant with Levi may continue…”

 A historical note must be appended here before we look at correspondences. 
“My covenant with Levi” goes back to a time at Mt. Sinai when Levi was 
faithful to the Lord in spite of the sin of Israel and the golden calf. For Levi’s 
fidelity, the Lord made a covenant with him and his descendants. The Lord 
promised him life and peace and a name that would be feared. “The Lord set 
apart the tribe of Levi to carry the ark of the covenant of the Lord, to stand 
before the Lord to minister to Him and to bless His name, to this day. 
Therefore Levi has no portion or inheritance with his brothers; the Lord is 
his inheritance…” (Deuteronomy 10:8-9)
So, in the historical sense, the Lord was making a spiritual contrast for Israel 
to reflect upon. What is the state of the fidelity of the priesthood? How far 
have you come from the pristine order of the priesthood as established by the
Lord? Is the Lord still your only inheritance, or have you made profit and 
prestige your desired inheritance?



 We also have Exodus 32:25-29, Numbers 3:45, Numbers 18:21-24, and 
Deuteronomy 33:8-11 as references to the Lord’s covenant with Levi. 

43



“That ‘covenant’ signifies nothing else than regeneration and the things 
pertaining to regeneration, is evident from various passages in the Word 
where the Lord Himself is called the ‘Covenant,’ because it is He alone who 
regenerates, and who is looked to by the regenerate man, and is the all in all 
of love and faith.” (AC 665 and 666)

 The phrase “That My covenant…may continue” speaks for itself. The Lord 

wanted the priesthood to serve Him and to make it a high priority to feed the 
people with the truths of the Word so that the Lord might be the “all in all” of 
their love and faith.

“…says the Lord of hosts.”

 This portion of the text is highlighted again. Why are these words used so 

often in Malachi’s prophecy? To remind us that the Lord has a zeal to remove 
the hells from everyone and the church. He wants purity to return to the 
forms of worship offered up by His children. He wants good and truth to 
inspire and lift all in their daily uses of life.

Putting It All Together

To pull things together, let’s pay close attention to the orders of the Lord as outlined 
in the literal sense. We will first look at the orders from the positive sense:

1. Priests, listen to My commandments.

2. Hear and take heart.

3. Rebuke your descendants.

4. Know My commandment.

5. Return to My covenant.

6. The covenant of the Lord is the “all in all” of love and faith.

Listening to and obeying the command of the Lord is essential for the priestly acts of
worship within us. The Lord desires us to perceive the things of the Word with a 
willing heart. “All that the Lord has spoken, we will do and hear” is a song we have 
learned from childhood. We still sing it today. The words and meaning of that song 
preserve the simplicity of what the Lord wishes for us. He wants us to trust and obey
Him.

The command to rebuke our descendants refers to the inherited tendencies toward 
evil that we all carry with us. The doctrines teach us that “only by means of spiritual 

44

things of the church” can these tendencies be changed by “inherited tendencies 
toward good.”

How are we changed?

“Know My commandments.” Return to “My covenant.” Let “My covenant” continue.

To have less then this spirit brings the negative aspects into focus. The Word offers 
this order of what happens to those who are obstinately negative:

1.

If you will not listen and take heart, a curse will come upon you and your 
blessings.

2. Your descendants will be rebuked.

3. Refuse will be spread on faces.

4. Refuse will be spread on the solemn feasts.

5. Those with a stony heart and unwilling spirit will be carried away.

If we refuse the order of the Lord, the curse of the sensual takes over our priorities. 
The “curse” of the sensual person will “avert” us from the heavenly spheres of the 
Lord. The refuse or dung on the face signifies the defiling of the interiors of life with 
the falsities of evil, and the refuse or dung on the solemn feasts represents the 
defiling of the holy things of worship.

This then brings us to the understanding of what is meant by being “carried away.” 
The unwilling and obstinate spirit will not choose the Lord. That kind of spirit flees 
from the presence of the Lord. Away, away, away from the Lord is what the cold heart
desires.

P&P calls us to consider the meaning of these passages: “Unless they worship the 
Lord, all worship will be perverted and profaned.”

Questions to Stimulate Reflection



Is the priest within our earthly temple listening to the commandments of the 
Lord? Is the perpetual fire of worship burning? Have only holy embers kept 
the fire going, or have “strange” coals been added?

 Do we see the rebuking of our descendants going on as we regenerate? 



Resisting the tendency toward inherited evils is the battle of a lifetime. One 
by one, the Lord introduces them when we are ready to face them. “As many 
as I love, I rebuke and chasten” seems like a necessary part of regeneration. 
But, it is not something we look forward to. How do you see the meaning of 
“rebuke and chasten”?
“Command” is a loaded word. It has been noted by researchers that we have a
built-in “command resistance” tendency. What they mean by this is that if 
authority comes on too strong, we zig when it tells us to zag. Do you 
remember a parable of the Lord about two sons? The father asked each son 
to go work in the field. The first son said, “No.” Later, he reflected on his 
negative reaction and went and did the work. The second son said, “Yes,” but 
then he never went. I’m sure we all see the implications of this parable. Do we
not only see it but live it as well?

 The image of dung on the face and solemn feasts is quite graphic. Without the
internal sense, it might offend our senses. Is the Lord trying to awaken us 
with these references?

 How do you understand the references to “curses”? It sounds as if the Lord is 
doing the cursing. In fact, it is the people who bring the curse on themselves. 
It seems the hells want us to put blame on the Lord for everything. What is 
your understanding of these “curses”?

 By now, have you gotten the message of the meaning of “says the Lord of 

hosts”? It is a phrase we are not finished hearing, so we need to put a “book 
mark” on it as we read on with Malachi’s prophecy.

 The Lord’s covenant is to be the “all in all” of our love and faith. How can we 
do this? Worship, study, and application to life seem like the ways to do this. 
There are obstacles that block or interfere with good intentions to study—
schedules, fear of our ignorance, looking for easier tasks, wanting others to 
explain it for us. Do these obstacles attempt to block you from doing a daily 
study?

MALACHI 2:5-7

“My covenant was with him, one of life and peace, and I gave them to him that he 
might fear Me; so he feared Me and was reverent before My name. The law of truth 
was in his mouth, and injustice was not found on his lips. He walked with Me in peace 
and equity, and turned many away from iniquity. For the lips of a priest should keep 
knowledge, and people should seek the law from his mouth; for he is the messenger of 
the Lord of hosts.”

P&P



“Through the Word it is granted them to have conjunction with the Lord, who 
is here meant by ‘Levi.’”

AC 3875 [4]



“…in the supreme sense ‘Levi’ signifies the Lord’s Divine love or mercy, and in 
the internal sense spiritual love, therefore the tribe of Levi was made the 
priesthood; for in the internal sense of the Word the ‘priesthood’ is nothing 
else than the holy of love…” Malachi 2:4, 5, 8, 9 are cited.

AE 701 [9]



“‘The covenant of Jehovah with Levi’ signifies in the highest sense the union 
of the Divine with the Human in the Lord, and in a relative sense, the Lord’s 
conjunction with the church; for by ‘Levi’ as by ‘David’ the Lord is meant, but 
‘Levi’ means the Lord in relation to Divine good, which is the priesthood of 
the Lord, and ‘David’ in relation to Divine truth, which is the royalty of the 
Lord…‘A covenant of life and of peace’ signifies that union and that 
conjunction…from which the Lord Himself became life and peace, from which
man has eternal life, and peace from the infestation by evils and falsities, thus
by hell. What is signified by ‘His fear’ may be seen above (n. 696). Those who 
live contrary to Divine truth are meant by ‘ye have turned aside out of the 
way, ye have caused many to stumble in the law, ye have corrupted the 
covenant of Levi;’ ‘to turn aside out of the way and to stumble in the law’ 
signifies to live contrary to Divine truth, and ‘to corrupt the covenant of Levi’ 
signifies to corrupt conjunction with the Lord.” Malachi 2:7 is cited.



“…when man is in the Lord, he is in peace with his neighbor, which is charity; 
in protection against the hells, which is spiritual security; and when he is in 
peace with his neighbor, and in protection against the hells, he is in internal 
rest from evils and falsities.” Malachi 2:4-5 is cited.

AE 365 [26]



“In Malachi…2:4-6…‘Levi’ signifies all who are in the good of charity towards 
the neighbor; and in the highest sense, the Lord Himself, because that good is 
from Him…‘The covenant of life and peace’ signifies the union of His Divine 
with His Divine Human, from which union is all life and peace…”

47

AE 444 [12]



“…that ‘Levi’ in the highest sense signifies the Lord in relation to love and 
mercy, is evident in Malachi…2:4-8…Here ‘Levi’ in the highest sense means 
the Lord in respect to His Divine Human, for it is said of Levi, that ‘the law of 
truth was in his mouth, and perversity was not found in his lips,’ and that ‘the 
priest’s lips they shall seek the law from his mouth, for he is the messenger of
Jehovah of Hosts;’ therefore ‘the covenant of Levi’ means conjunction with 
the Lord through love and charity; ‘the covenant of life and peace’ signifies 
that conjunction; ‘fear,’ which is also predicated of Him signifies love. ‘The 
priest’s lips they shall seek the law from his mouth’ signifies that all truth of 
doctrine is from the Lord, and is with such as are in love to Him. He is called 
‘the messenger of Jehovah’ because of the Divine truth that the Lord teaches 
in the Word and through the Word; ‘they turned aside out of the way and 
caused many to stumble in the law, they corrupted the covenant of Levi,’ 
signifies that the church that was among the Israelites perverted the truths of
the Word and the goods of life therefrom, and thus destroyed conjunction 
with the Lord; ‘way’ signifying the truths of doctrine, ‘law’ its goods, and the 
‘covenant of Levi’ conjunction with the Lord.”

AC 3623 [2]



“The reason why here and in other passages lives are spoken of in the plural, 
is that there are two faculties of life in man; one of which is called the 
understanding, and is of truth; and the other of which is called the will, and is
of good; these two lives or faculties of life make a one when the 
understanding is of the will, or what is the same, when truth is of good…” 
Malachi 2:5 is cited.

AR 527



“…every one who loves also fears to do evil to him whom he loves. Genuine 
love is not given without that fear. Therefore he who loves the Lord fears to 
do evils, because evils are contrary to Him…That ‘to fear God’ signifies to love 
the things which are of God, by doing them, and by not willing to do those 
which are against Him…” Malachi 2:5 is cited as an example.

AE 696 [16]



“In Malachi…2:5…‘Levi’ means here the Lord in relation to the Divine Human, 
and ‘the covenant of life and peace’ signifies the union of His Divine with 
Himself, and ‘fear’ and ‘to fear’ signifies holy truth, with which there is union.”

AC 2826 [7]



“In Malachi…2:5, 6…where the Lord is treated of, who here in the internal 
sense is ‘Levi;’ ‘Levi’ signifies the priesthood, and signifies love; ‘fear’ here 
denotes the good of Divine love; the ‘law of truth,’ truth; and ‘peace and 
uprightness,’ both.”

AE 97



“That in the Word ‘ways’ signify truths or falsities, and ‘walking’ signifies 
living, may be seen from many passages…” Malachi 2:6 is cited.

“In Malachi…2:6, 7…This is said of Levi, by whom the Lord is represented; 
‘lips’ denote doctrine from charity.”

AE 130 [8]



“…in Malachi…2:7…He is said to be the ‘angel of Jehovah,’ because he teaches 
Divine truth; not that he is the angel of Jehovah, but the Divine truth that he 
teaches is. Moreover, it is known in the church that no one has Divine truth 
from himself. ‘Lips’ also here signify the doctrine of truth, and ‘law’ Divine 
truth itself.” 

AE 701 [9]

 Malachi 2:4-6, 8 is cited, followed by this explanation. “‘A covenant of life and 

peace’ signifies that union and that conjunction…from which the Lord 
Himself becomes life and peace, from which man has eternal life, and peace 
from the infestation by evils and falsities, thus by hell…Those who live 
contrary to Divine truth are meant by ‘ye have turned aside out of the way, ye 
have caused many to stumble in the law, ye have corrupted the covenant of 
Levi;’ ‘to turn aside out of the way and to stumble in the law signifies to live 
contrary to Divine truth, and ‘to corrupt the covenant of Levi’ signifies to 
corrupt conjunction with the Lord.”

Derived Doctrine

Almost all that we need to understand in the spiritual sense of these verses was 
given to us. There was just one short sentence needing our attention:

49

“…he…was reverent before My name.”

 There are no passages we can use for the signification of “reverent.” However,
we know the qualities inherent in reverence. Reverence involves respect, 
honesty, humility, a sense of awe, and a spirit of willingness to obey the Lord. 
“Before My name” represents having reverence for the sum of all things that 
signify the Lord’s qualities (AC 2724). Reverence doesn’t include a 
competitive or combative attitude. Instead, there is a willingness to accede to 
the holiness of His Infinite qualities.

Putting It All Together

When you look over chapter two of Malachi, verses 5 to 7 of Malachi, note the use of 
pronouns—him, he, his, his mouth, his lips—and of “priest” and “messenger.” The 
Writings clearly teach us that all of these pronouns have reference to the Lord. By 
“Levi,” the Lord is meant.

As I read these verses, my mind turned to the wording of John 1:1: “In the beginning 
was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.” Notice the use of
the pronouns in that passage. Don’t we have somewhat the same style of message in 
Malachi, too? Try putting the Lord’s name in place of all of the pronouns of our 
verses from Malachi. Think of love and wisdom expressing to us how they are 
conjoined and ready to help us find life and peace through the Word.

My (Love) covenant was with the Lord (Wisdom) from His advent.
I (Love) gave it to the Lord (Wisdom) from His advent. 
My Wisdom will Love Me.
The law was in the Lord’s mouth.
Injustice was not found on the lips of the Lord.
The Lord walked in peace and equity
The Lord turned many away from iniquity.
People should seek the law from the mouth of the Lord.
The Lord is the messenger—He is the Lord of hosts.

AR 306 sums up the meaning of the prophecy of Malachi in this way: “When a person
is in the Lord, he is at peace with his neighbor, which is charity, in protection against 
the hells, which is spiritual security; and when he is in peace with his neighbor, and 
in protection against the hells, he is in internal rest from evils and falsities.”

P&P sums up these verses with these words: “Through the Word it is granted them 
to have conjunction with the Lord, who is meant by ‘Levi.’” 

This part of the Lord’s prophecy is an invitation to be conjoined with Him through 
the Word. Those who desire such a conjunction will have life and peace.

Questions to Stimulate Reflection

 Were you able to put the Lord in the place of Levi and the various pronouns? 



Did it help you see more of the spiritual sense?
I found this exercise to be a wonderful opening of the Word. It helped me see 
the Glorification process being explained to the church.

 Did you find AR 306 a passage worth keeping handy to quote? Peace, security,
protection, and rest from evils and falsities: these are words of comfort when 
we feel overwhelmed with temptation.

 The Lord is inviting us to have conjunction with Him through the Word. I 

believe that what we are doing in this study guide is so important. How about
you?

MALACHI 2:8-10

“‘But you have departed from the way; you have caused many to stumble at the law. 
You have corrupted the covenant of Levi,’ says the Lord of hosts. ‘Therefore I also have 
made you contemptible and base before all the people, because you have not kept My 
ways but have shown partiality in the law.’ Have we not all one Father? Has not one 
God created us? Why do we deal treacherously with one another by profaning the 
covenant of the fathers?”

Passages From The Writings

P&P



“They have departed from the Word, and have thereby dissolved the 
conjunction.”

AE 412 [25]



Showing partiality signifies “In Malachi…2:9…to have the mind better 
disposed towards, and to show more favor to superiors, the rich, and friends, 
than to inferiors, the poor, and enemies.”

AC 2005



“In Malachi…2:10…To ‘create’ denotes to regenerate…”

51

AC 3704 [3]



“In Malachi…2:10…where in the internal sense ‘to create’ signifies to 
regenerate…and as the Lord is the only Regenerator and Redeemer, it is He 
who is here called ‘Father’ and ‘God.’”

AE 294 [11]



“In Malachi…2:10…‘hath created us’ signifies hath reformed that they might 
be a church; therefore it is said, ‘wherefore do we act perfidiously?’”

AC 8999

 Acting treacherously is acting “contrary to truth Divine, or what is the same, 
contrary to the laws of Divine order…In heaven the laws of Divine order are 
truths, for Divine order…proceeds from the Lord.” Malachi 2:10, 11, 14, and 
15are cited as examples.

Derived Doctrine

“But you have departed from the way; you have caused many to stumble at the law.”

 When anyone “departs from the way,” a spiritual change occurs within that 

person. Consider this teaching from AE 406 [2]: “…all cognitions of truth and 
good and the confirming knowledges (scientifica) that man from infancy has 
imbibed from the Word and from teachers, will change their places and 
their state in the natural man and perish out of sight when falsities enter.” 
(emphasis added)
“Way,” in the positive sense, signifies following doctrine by which one is 
instructed, or led, into a deeper understanding of truth (AC 2231).
In AE 444 [12], we have an explanation of the passage from Malachi 2:4-8 that
contains almost the same words as our present text: “‘they turned aside out 
of the way and caused many to stumble in the law, they corrupted the 
covenant of Levi,’ signifies that the church that was among the Israelites 
perverted the truths of the Word and the goods of life therefrom, and those 
destroyed conjunction with the Lord; ‘way’ signifying the truths of doctrine, 
‘laws’ its goods, and the ‘covenant of Levi’ conjunction with the Lord.”
“Stumble” signifies to change truth into falsities and to fall thereby. “Stumble” 
also refers to those who should teach truths from the Word, but teach 
falsities. See AE 624.







52

“You have corrupted the covenant of Levi…”

 Let’s pause long enough to notice where the responsibility for the corruption 
of the covenant rests. The Lord isn’t at fault. “You” represents priests. “You” 
represents Israel.

 The “covenant of Levi” was “the way” the Lord laid out for their regeneration. 
The priests changed the way. They stumbled by teaching falsities as truths 
and truths as falsities and, thus, broke the covenant.

“…says the Lord of hosts.”

 Here is that oft-stated phrase to call our attention to the zeal and intention of 

the Lord to remove hell from everyone and the church (AE 734 [8]).

“Therefore I also have made you contemptible and base before all the people...”





“Contempt” signifies a state of mind. “Contempt” represents a spiteful mind 
that takes delight in turning from good and utterly despises the Lord’s truth 
(AC 3322 [7]).
“Base” or “vile” signifies that the Lord was going to show the inward evil that 
had been covered in an external pretense of a good life. See the basket of figs 
example in AE 403 [19].

The remaining portions of these verses were covered above in the direct quotes 
from the Writings.

Putting It All Together

What point should we start with to pull things together? The bottom line is that the 
priesthood and the church picked another “way” to follow and turned their backs on 
the Lord’s way. They chose a road of favoritism because they felt it was more 
advantageous to them. Their choices over the years changed what they had learned 
from childhood. What the Word taught, what their teachers had shared with them 
perished. Falsities had changed places with these truths in their priorities. The 
priesthood and the church were on a way that had but one end. They were going to 
perish if they didn’t return to the Lord’s Word and the Lord’s way.

As it was, the minds of the priests and the people of the church were growing hostile
toward the way of the Lord. How could they do anything else but “stumble” with the 
contemptible perceptions they had? Meanwhile, they “wore” clothes of 
righteousness, but within, there were hideous and ugly forms of self-love and hatred.

In His zeal, the Lord wanted to show these people the folly of their way, so He posed 
a question to them through Malachi. “Have we not all one Father? Has not one God 
created us?” The spiritual sense of these words poses the question this way: Doesn’t 

53

the Lord know the one way for regeneration for all of His children? He doesn’t show 
favoritism. No one can buy or think their way into heaven and its order. We all have 
one Father. His way is the one way to walk. “But you have departed from the way.” As 
P&P states: “They have departed from the Word, and have thereby dissolved the 
conjunction.”

Questions to Stimulate Reflection

 Can you reflect for a moment on your journey through life? Can you see any 

roads where you departed from the Lord? Did you stay on that other road for 
long? At some point, do you remember coming to the conclusion that you 
needed to return to the Lord’s way?

 The idea of the one way of the Lord might be misunderstood, so let’s look at 

that point for a moment. There is one way, but that one way is individually set
for each person. The Lord knows our individuality. He is fair and impartial. 
He doesn’t show favoritism. So He is willing to work with us toward our 
regeneration. We need to walk with Him. His Word is the means for our 
conjunction. So the remains of our youth and the teachers of the Word have 
done much for us. What we need to take care to ensure is that we have not 
“changed” the spiritual structure within us, with falsity taking center place 
and truth pushed out.

 Can we handle the news that “You” have dissolved the covenant? The Lord is 
revealing to us that He has made our regeneration possible. If things fail, it 
will not be due to His inattentiveness. This is the case from the Lord. He asks 
only that we try to trust His covenant path.

 As I look back over the spiritual correspondences, I wonder what effect it 

might have had if He plainly spoke the inner sense to the priests? Might they 
have done greater harm to themselves by rejecting the “plain truths” of the 
Lord?

“Judah,” in the supreme sense, “signifies the Lord and the Divine of love; in 
the internal sense, the Word and also the Lord’s celestial kingdom; and in the 
exterior sense, the doctrine from the Word which is of the celestial church.”



“Israel,” in the highest sense, “means the Lord in relation to the internal of the
church…‘Israel’ means the church with those who are interiorly natural, and 
have truths therein from a spiritual origin…‘Israel’ signifies the church that is 
spiritual-natural.” (AE 768 [15])
“Jerusalem” means the church and not the city, “…for about the time of the 
Lord’s coming Jerusalem was not so great…for the church of the Lord is 
internal and external; in the internal church are those who are in intelligence 
and wisdom, and thus in the higher heavens, but in the external church are 
those who are in knowledges and cognitions of truth and good from the 
Word, and in no interior intelligence and wisdom, and who are therefore in 
the lower heavens; the former are called spiritual, the latter spiritual-natural, 
and the spiritual are meant by those who are ‘in the midst of Jerusalem,’ and 
the spiritual-natural by those who are ‘in the suburbs.’” (AE 629 [6])

“…for Judah has profaned the Lord’s holy institution which He loves…”

 What is the Lord’s holy institution which He loves? Is it marriage? Is it the 
Sabbath day? In AC 4171, marriage is thought by human beings to be a 
heavenly institution. In AC 8495, the Sabbath is taught to be the holiest 
institution of the Lord. Let’s read AC 8495 (in the Elliot translation): “Anyone 
who does not know what the Sabbath represented, and what it was 
consequently a sign of, also cannot know why it was held to be the holiest 
institution of all. It was held to be the holiest because in the highest sense it 
represented the union of the Divine and the Divine Human within the Lord, 
and in the relative sense the pining together of the Lord’s Divine Human and 
the human race. This is why the Sabbath was the holiest. And since it 
represented those realities it also represented heaven in respect of the pining
together of goodness and truth, that is, the joining together called the 
heavenly marriage…since the joining together of goodness and truth is 
accomplished by the Lord alone and nothing at all by man, and since it is 
accomplished in a state of peace, people were strictly forbidden to do work 
on that day.” (emphasis added)

Putting It All Together

The “messenger” announces to the church that the Lord’s holy institution, which He 
loves, was profaned by Judah in the land of Israel and in Jerusalem. Was the 
profanation an accident or oversight on the part of the finite church? The 
messenger’s use of the words “treacherously” and “abomination” answers our 
question. We are told that treachery, or guile, is the act of malice; it springs from the 
premeditation of the will.

What did the people do to profane the Lord’s holy institution? They chose to break 
their conjunction with the Lord, and they turned to idolatry. They married the 

56

daughter of a foreign god. The ordinance of the Lord was clear that they should not 
marry good and falsity nor evil and truth.

What makes idolatry so appealing to people that they would choose idols over the 
Lord? Let’s look at some numbers in the Arcana for an answer to this question; AC 
1094, 1205,1357, and 1363 provide the following information.

Idolatry consists in a worship of externals.


 The externals—corporeal things—are what the idolater desires most.
 The idolater is unwilling to know internal things and eternal life.
 There are three universal kinds of idolatry:

o Love of self
o Love of the world
o Love of pleasures.

 All idolatry has one or more of these three loves for its end.
 There are internal forms of idolatry.
 There are external forms of idolatry.

Internal idolaters are capable of profaning holy things.
 External idolaters are not able to profane holy things.

On the basis of AC 1363, we can make a pretty good assumption that Israel had 
entered into an internal form of idolatry. They profaned the holy institution the Lord 
loved. “They have worshipped another god, whence came profanation…” (P&P)

Questions to Stimulate Reflection

 Do you get a sense of what made idolatry more attractive than following the 
Lord? Can we imagine why loving self, the world, and pleasures would seem 
more valuable than following the Lord?

 Why is external idolatry permitted? How does internal idolatry have the 

potential to destroy holy things?

 Are we in any danger of committing these idolatries?


If you are studying this section in a class setting, what other points about 
idolatry that were mentioned in the discussion have added to your 
understanding of the spiritual meaning?

 Do those seeking their “fifteen minutes of fame and fortune” seem like 
idolaters? What kind would they be? Internal or external idolaters?

MALACHI 2:12 

“May the Lord cut off from the tents of Jacob the man who does this, being awake and 
aware, yet who brings an offering to the Lord of hosts!”

Passages From The Writings

P&P



“…wherefore they will perish.”

AE 573 [7]



“…the truths and goods of heaven and the church are meant in the Word by 
‘hosts;’ which makes clear why it is that Jehovah is called in the Word…‘of 
hosts’…” Malachi 2:12 is cited among many references.

Derived Doctrine

“May the Lord cut off from the tents of Jacob the man who does this, being awake and 
aware…”

 A “tent” signifies the external person conjoined with the internal (AC1616). 



“May the Lord cut off” signifies taking away the Divine truth from the church 
but with knowledge that it will live again in a new church (AE 315 [23]).
“Awake” and “aware” reinforce the point that those who chose idolatry did so 
with their eyes open and with full knowledge of the consequences of their 
actions. Therefore, they needed to be “cut off” from the tents of Jacob.

 AC 9594 [6], AC 10545 [8], and AE 724 [17] are consistent in their explanation 
of the meaning of “the tents of Jacob” signifying the goods of the church and 
of worship. In the opposite sense, “the tents of Jacob” signify the evils of 
worship and the church. “Bringing back the captivity of the tents of 
Jacob...stands for restoring the external Church's forms of goods which had 
been destroyed...” (AC 9594 [6])

“…yet who brings an offering to the Lord of hosts!”



In the positive sense, an “offering” signifies internal worship by those who 
are holy (AC 349). A negative sense of an “offering” signifies worship from 
faith that is without charity (AC 346). Which kind of offering is the Word 
talking about?

 The “Lord of hosts” signifies the truths and goods of heaven. Are we being 
given a contrast between the idolater and the Divine? Picture the profaner 
marching in to offer vain and empty gifts lacking any charity, and the Divine 

58

not needing his gifts because He already has all the goods and truths of 
heaven.

Putting It All Together

Do we really need to do much pulling together? It seems quite clear that those who 
want idolatry are going to be cut off from the tents of Jacob. There is little pity for 
these idolaters. They chose this. They did so with a clear understanding of what they
loved. They wanted the idolatry of self, the world, and their pleasures. The life and 
pleasures the Lord offered them were firmly rejected. They were awake and aware 
when the decision was made.

Once they made that choice, the Lord sought to protect the idolators from more 
grievous acts of profanation. He took away from them their ability to see ways of 
conjoining themselves with Him. He turned away from the pompous empty acts of 
their offerings. What the Lord took away from them was not to be lost or forgotten. 
His covenant with a new church will restore the perception of how to conjoin the 
Divine Human with the church in that holy institution the Lord loves.

But as for the church of Israel, “wherefore they will perish” (P&P).

Questions to Stimulate Reflection

 Do you feel any sympathy for those who were “cut off” from the tents of 

Jacob?

 Can you picture the idolaters being quite happy with their choice?
 Did the contrast of the empty offering and the bountiful Lord stand out in 

your mind in the closing portion of our text?

 Why do you think the idolaters continued the ritual of offerings? Did it fulfill 

their need for self love, fame, and merit?

 Hold on to this question (number 4) for Malachi 2:13. In this next verse, we 
will look at the extremes the idolaters went to in order to appear righteous 
before others.

MALACHI 2:13

“And this is the second thing you do: you cover the altar of the Lord with tears, with 
weeping and crying; so He does not regard the offering anymore, nor receive it with 
goodwill from your hands.”

Passages From The Writings

P&P



“…therefore their external worship is not accepted.”

AE 484 [3 & 4]



“In both weeping and in shedding of tears water comes forth which is bitter 
and astringent, and this occurs through an influx into man’s grief from the 
spiritual world, where bitter water corresponds to the lack of truth because 
of falsities, and to consequent grief; therefore those who are in truths grieve 
on account of falsities. From this it can be seen why it is that in the Word, 
where ‘tears’ are mentioned ‘weeping’ also is mentioned, namely, that it is on 
account of the marriage of good and truth in every particular of the Word. I 
will only adduce the following passages in evidence of this…Malachi…2:13…”

Derived Doctrine

“And this is the second thing you do…”

 The first offense against the Lord was their marriage of “the daughter of a 
foreign god.” Their attempt to work a marriage of evil and falsity was an 
abomination before the Lord. Divorce among the priesthood, both literally 
and spiritually, was destroying their uses.

 What then was the second offense? A long dissertation could be written 

about the laws of the Lord regarding cleanliness and holiness. Suffice it to say
the principles laid out by the Lord could best be described this way: Israel 
should reflect in her community and worship what she ascribes to the Lord. If
the Lord acts in justice, the nation should be marked by justice. If the Lord’s 
nature is steadfast love, then His people’s love should be steadfast. If the 
Lord is clean and holy, then Israel should be clean and holy. Cleanliness 
is a hallmark of Israel’s faith. Laws about what the priesthood should do 
regarding their own preparation for offering sacrifices are precise. 
Completion of the ritual of self-examination prior to entering the “holy of 
holies” was a must. The book of Leviticus (chapters 11, 13, and 15) details 
what priests had to do for the treatment of sores and leprosy. The priesthood 
was to be without blemish. Again, let’s restate the principle of the law of 

60

correspondences. If God is pure, holy, and clean, Israel must reflect these 
qualities in her life and in the acts of worship.

The point of this brief summary is to illustrate the care and preparation that was 
expected prior to offering sacrifices to the Lord. The priesthood became careless. 
They put on a pious front with their clothing. But within their hearts, there was little
to match their externals. Notice now how they acted in front of the people when 
offering gifts of oblation to the Lord:

“…you cover the altar of the Lord with tears, with weeping and crying…”

 AE 484 gives us the positive meaning of “weeping” and shedding tears. These 
honest forms of grief were to represent the sadness one feels from the lack of 
truth when dealing with falsity. Weeping and shedding tears were part of the 
process to bring about the marriage of good and truth.

 But the weeping described in this verse was not part of an attempt to bring 
about this marriage. It was a sham. It was an act, and the Lord was not 
pleased with the shoddy performance of His priests and people.
So, the first grievance was their marriage to idolaters and the divorce of their 
wives, and the second grievance was with their lack of concern for true 
repentance. Both offenses were violations of the principles of the Lord that 
should have been reflected in their life and worship.



Putting It All Together

I feel quite sure you have the summary of this section in your mind. P&P states the 
case: “…therefore their external worship was not accepted.” Clearly, Israel was not 
participating in the worship of the Lord for the right reasons. They were not looking 
for repentance and reformation. It was all about self and not about the Lord. They 
truly wanted to marry idolatry and divorce themselves from the Lord.

MALACHI 2:14-16

“Yet you say, ‘For what reason?’ Because the Lord has been witness between you and 
the wife of your youth, with whom you have dealt treacherously; yet she is your 
companion and your wife by covenant. But did He not make them one, having a 
remnant of the Spirit? And why one? He seeks godly offspring. Therefore take heed to 
your spirit, and let none deal treacherously with the wife of his youth. ‘For the Lord 
God of Israel says that He hates divorce, for it covers one’s garment with violence,’ says 
the Lord of hosts. ‘Therefore take heed to your spirit, that you do not deal 
treacherously.’”

“They have severed themselves from the church…”



“In Malachi faith is called the ‘seed of God’…2:14, 15…In this passage the ‘wife
of youth’ is the Ancient and Most Ancient Churches, of whose ‘seed’ (or faith) 
the prophet speaks.”

AC 9818 [8]

 Malachi 2:15 is cited regarding the meaning of “spirit.” “It is very evident that 
in these passages by ‘spirit’ is meant the very life of man; that it denotes the 
intellectual life, or the life of truth, can be seen from the fact that by ‘spirit’ in 
the natural sense is meant the life of man’s respiration; and that the 
respiration of the lungs corresponds to the life of truth, which is the life of 
faith and from this of the understanding.”

AE 768 [4]



“In Malachi…2:15…‘Is there one that seeketh the seed of God?’ signifies that 
no one seeks Divine truth; evidently ‘the seed of God’ here signifies Divine 
truth; so ‘the born of God’ mean those who are regenerated by the Lord by 
means of Divine truth, and a life according thereto.”

Doctrine of the Lord 48 [5]

“As man’s life varies according to his state, by ‘spirit’ is meant the varying 
affection of life in man. As…5. A life of various evil affections…Malachi 2:16…”

AC 6353 [8]

 Malachi 2:16-17 is cited when the significance of violence covering one’s 

garment is explained. “…‘a man of violence’ denotes those who destroy the 
truths of faith and the goods of charity…”

Derived Doctrine

“Yet you say, ‘For what reason?’”

 This question carries with it a challenge. The people question the Lord’s 

reasoning for refusing their offerings. Their question suggests that they are 
being hurt or misunderstood by the Lord. Their question seems to carry a 
pretended acknowledgment and worship of the Lord. They maintain a 
pretense of obedience to Him while playing for the support and affection of 
the people.

“Because the Lord has been witness between you and the wife of your youth, with 
whom you have dealt treacherously…”

 The Lord is a true and faithful “witness” regarding testimony and evidence. 
As a witness, He sought to join them by love (AC 4192). As a witness, He 
sought to bring confirmation to their marriages. But now, the Lord bears 
witness or “certifies” that they have dealt treacherously with the holiness of 
innocence that was a gift from the Divine.

63

 A “wife,” in the positive sense, signifies the goods of truth. When she is dealt 

with treacherously, ravished, turned away, or divorced, it represents a 
perversion of goods and truths (AC 8902 [5]).

 AC 255 explains the meaning of “wife of youth.” It refers to the remnant of the 
Ancient Church against which the Jewish Church acted treacherously (AE 701
[29]). In other words, Israel severed the conjunction and holiness of good and
truth passed down to them from the days of the Most Ancient and Ancient 
Churches.

“…yet she is your companion and your wife by covenant.”



She (affection) is your companion. “Companion” signifies, in the positive 
sense, the truth of love and charity toward the Lord and the neighbor. In the 
negative sense, it means the destruction of these acts of charity. See AC 10490.
“Companion,” in our times, indicates someone we feel close to and with 
whom we are willing to share certain aspects of our inner world.

 A “wife by covenant” signifies a conjunction of the church and heaven with 

the Lord through His Divine Proceeding (Holy Spirit). This “covenant” plan of 
the Lord’s is an irrevocable marriage of good and truth. The ideas for the 
interpretation of the above are drawn from AE 701 [10] and AC 10249.

“But did He not make them one…”



“One” signifies what is perfect, authentic, or genuine. “One” signifies the truth
of faith, and “One” signifies doctrine. See AC 1316 and AE 374 [2].

 The Lord’s question draws us to a truth about what He offers us. He gives the 
best, the perfect, the genuine, and the complete doctrine of the truth of faith. 
His “One” plan or covenant is to save and lead us to the eternal life of heaven.

“…having a remnant of the Spirit? And why one?”





“Remnant” or “remains” signify the truths stored up by the Lord in our 
interiors(AC 5113 [8]). AE 724 [29] adds that remains signify the truths and 
goods stored up with us by the Lord from infancy.
“Spirit” has many important representations. We cannot cite all of them, but 
here are a few. “Spirit” signifies the mercy of the Lord (AC 19). “Spirit” 
signifies the Divine truth (AC 24). “Spirit” signifies the Divine Proceeding 
(Divine Love and Wisdom 100). “Spirit” signifies an internal dictate or influx of
good and truth (AC 573).

 The point is that the “One” goal of our remains is to lead, inspire, and 

enlighten us in the ways of the Lord.

 Why the “One”? It is a complete plan of the Lord’s. The plan is not flawed, nor 

does it fall short in Divine effort.

64

“He seeks godly offspring. Therefore take heed to your spirit, and let none deal 
treacherously with the wife of his youth.”



“Offspring” signify that which has birth from the marriage of good and truth 
and the marriage of the Lord with His church (CL 121). Therefore, the Lord is 
asking for spiritual accountability. He wants “godly” results. He wants unity of
thought, genuine effort, a purity of doctrinal understanding, and a 
willingness to obey.

 Take heed. Be serious; be alert and ready to hear the Lord speak within your 

hearts.

 The command to remove treachery from our spirit is a reminder from the 

Lord for us to remove things that would hurt our spirit.

 Our caring for the wife of our youth may occur with the truths of the Lord’s 
Second Coming. For they carry on, and enlarge, the marriage of good and 
truth that was started from the very beginning of creation (infancy).

“For the Lord God of Israel says that He hates divorce...”





“Divorce” signifies good being rejected by truth. “Divorce” involves the 
acceptance of a discordant good. See AE 768 [19]. “Divorce” signifies the 
falsification of the Word whence the church separates from the Lord (TCR 
314).

“Hate” is not part of the Lord’s nature. It is a term projected onto the Lord 
when He opposes the evil. The true nature of the Lord’s “hatred” is captured 
in AC 3605 [3]. “…good does not even know what hatred is…In the internal 
sense [hatred attributed to Jehovah is actually] mercy, for the Divine is mercy;
but when this flows in with a man who is in evil, and he runs into the penalty 
of evil, it then appears as hatred and because it so appears, in the sense of the
letter it is likewise so called.”

“…for it [divorce] covers one’s garment with violence…”

 A “garment” (raiment) signifies truth clothing good (AE 543 [14]). A 



“garment” signifies the truths in the ultimate form (AC 9372 [8]). “Garments” 
signify truths “wherein is good.” (AC 5954 [7])
Spiritual divorce “covers” what was supposed to be useful and protective 
with a tainted garment of violence. The literal sense is twisted and used to 
prove anything the proprium wishes to justify. 

“Therefore take heed to your spirit, that you do not deal treacherously.”

 This is a repetition of what was said in verse 15. Please note that repetition is 
not for poetical effect. AC 707 reminds us that repetition is used in the Word 
when both the will and understanding are involved in a prophecy.

65

“…says the Lord of hosts…”



I call your attention to the repetition of this phrase throughout Malachi’s 
prophecy.

Putting It All Together

Clever arguments have been contrived over the centuries against the ways of the 
Lord. His Word has been used to justify absurd things. Adultery is toned down with 
the “evidence” of David’s shameful affair. Polygamy had its roots in the many wives 
of the Patriarchs. Slavery had its justification in the curse placed upon Ham that he 
would be in a lifetime of servitude to his brothers. I suppose there is nothing that 
can’t be justified with the abuse of the literal sense of the Word.

So the Lord reviews and certifies the history of the “divorce” of the church from Him.
He refuses to ignore the spirit of treachery and violence that covers the garment of 
the church. He reviews it all and declares “I hate divorce.” In His mercy, He wants us 
to cease and desist from this practice of spiritual divorce. Why? Is it for His benefit? 
Obviously, that is not the case. His mercy wants us to stop hurting ourselves. He does
not want one soul to choose Hell. He sounds the Divine alarm. “Take heed” are His 
words of care and concern.

He urges us to return to the remains from our youth. Remains are a wonderful 
collection of goods and truths that span our lifetime from birth to death. He has 
organized them into a “One.” They are carefully stored up from our infancy. Hell 
knows not where they are. Hell can’t violate them. So, with a prayerful attitude, we 
need to ask the Lord to touch our remains and to give us a right “Spirit” within our 
heart and mind. 

Accountability follows a proper marriage of our youth. There must be godly 
offspring. Barrenness is not an acceptable goal of regeneration. Spiritual “fruits” 
must come before the Lord as a sign and token of our regeneration and gratitude for 
all the benefactions of our lives. These offerings will be accepted from our hands. 
The offerings of the “divorced” are not gifts of the hands that He accepts at the altar 
of worship. Nor is He impressed with the fakery of weeping and tears streaming 
from moroseness, self-pity, and self-love. He will welcome the “bitter” tears and 
weeping offered up by those who have a genuine concern over any deficiency sensed
in the desired marriage of good and truth.

What of the “divorced”? “They have severed themselves from the church.” (P&P)

Questions to Stimulate Reflection



In the Putting It All Together section, several examples were given to 
illustrate how the literal sense can prove whatever the mind desires to justify.
What examples might you cite to illustrate this truth? Can you recall a time 
you used this method?

 Did you understand what the Writings said about the Lord not being capable 
of hating? Those being punished accuse the Lord of hatred and fail to see His 
mercy. As a parent, do you recall your children thinking you hated them when
discipline was called for?

 Were you struck with the call to remember the bride of youth? Remains are 
often talked about in the church, but do you remember any class or article 
that helped you tap into this spiritual resource?

 The command to “Take heed to your spirit” is repeated. Did you sense that 

the repetition was there to instruct us about the work we need to do with our
will and understanding?

 Have you ever thought about the “godly offspring” you can offer to the Lord? 

What offspring come to mind?

MALACHI 2:17

“You have wearied the Lord with your words; yet you say, ‘In what way have we 
wearied Him?’ In that you say, ‘Everyone who does evil is good in the sight of the Lord, 
and He delights in them,’ or, ‘Where is the God of justice?’”

Passages From The Writings

P&P



“…even by their calling evil good.”

Derived Doctrine

“You have wearied the Lord with your words…”



“Weary” (labored) signifies to not see the door or access to truths that would 
lead to good (AC 2385). Also check the meaning of “weary” in AC 3318.

67



“Words” refers to acting according to the word of the Lord (AC 7406). “Words”
signify the primary truths that are to be remembered and done that 
representative worship may be instituted (AC 10682).

 What we get from this passage is that the priests and people “talked” about 
good and truth; they “talked” about the good of life; they “talked” about 
remembering and doing the things of the Lord. But their speeches were only 
words; they did not lead to action. Words in the understanding but not in the 
will “weary” the Lord.

“…yet you say, ‘In what way have we wearied Him?’”



Is this question asked from a genuine sense of concern and inquiry, or is it a 
form of defiant rebellion and denial? Our answer comes in the next portion of
this verse.

“In that you say, ‘Everyone who does evil is good in the sight of the Lord, and He 
delights in them…’”

 How far from the truth is this reply? The Lord will not call evil good in His 



sight. The Lord will not delight in the ways of the evil.
So why are the people saying these things to the Lord? Isn’t it the nature of 
the evil to call evil good and good evil? Therefore, we must come to the 
conclusion that they are projecting on to the Lord the thoughts which are in 
their hearts and minds.

“Where is the God of justice?”





“Justice” signifies being endowed with the good of charity by which one can 
know what is true (AC 615).
So were the priests challenging the good of charity from the Lord? Were they, 
in effect, telling Him that He didn’t know right from wrong? If this is reflective
of their attitude, how sadly lost and misguided they were at this point. Is this 
a powerful example of how arrogance blinds one’s judgment and heart even 
against the Lord?

Hearing someone drone on and on, ad infinitum, about some technical point can be 
tiring or wearisome. We tire quickly if we can’t see some positive application coming
out of the conversation. Our patience is limited because we are finite, time-and-
space beings. The Lord is beyond time and space, and He has infinite patience. Why 
would the Word indicate to us that the Lord was wearied with the words of Israel?

The Writings give us a hint what “weary” signifies. The Lord saw the absence of 
basic and fundamental truths that would lead to good. “Weary,” in this context, 

68

represents a loving concern that progress in spiritual growth had little chance of 
coming to fruition. He wanted less talk and more sincerity in finding truth in His 
Word.

Not only were the truths that lead to good absent, but the people’s attitude was 
argumentative and combative. They picked away at the Lord. They challenged His 
motives. They accused Him and projected on Him things that were not true. Imagine 
announcing to the church that the Lord’s judgment was faulty in that He did not 
know right from wrong. They accused Him of countenancing the evil and calling 
them good. Preaching that the Lord delights in evil must have been a wearisome 
thing to listen to. Who wants to hear these words? And yet, if we reflect for a 
moment, we still hear such things being said about the Lord. He is blamed for 
calamities and absence in moments of physical need. The charge is that the Lord did 
not intervene appropriately to relieve the plight of His people. “Where is the God of 
Justice?” rings out like endless words from those whose hearts are convinced the 
Lord doesn’t care. Why didn’t He care and provide for those caught in horrific 
conditions such as the tsunami in Asia that caught many in a rushing tide of death? 
He cares. He doesn’t forget. But the arrogant rail on and use words that contain little 
truth that leads to good. Such people will never see or believe that the Lord brought 
the horrific events to a positive end. They will never see the welcoming angels taking
the hands of the newcomers to the spiritual world.

What did the Lord say to the church of accusation and denial? “They have severed 
themselves from the church, even by their calling evil good.” (P&P)

Questions to Stimulate Reflection

 We have the expression “talk is cheap.” What do we mean when we say this? 
Are we not pointing to empty words with little value to them? Some talkers 
we describe as having “running mouths.” What does that expression convey? 
They have an unending flow of words that seem to overwhelm us with their 
content. They talk constantly with few breaks and keep us out of the 
discussion. Does any of this seem to fit in with our text?

 What is your response to the charges leveled at the Lord about His lack of 

Justice? Have you ever kept your tongue quiet listening to someone accusing 
the Lord of indifference to the tragedies of the world?

 Projection is a human tendency. What we have within our hearts can come 

out when we deal with emotional situations. Should we do more examination 

69

of our projections onto the Lord and the neighbor? Are we always right when 
we put onto someone else what our feelings tell us about them?

Chapter Three

MALACHI 3:1-3

“‘Behold, I will send My messenger, and he will prepare the way before Me. And the 
Lord, whom you seek, will suddenly come to His temple, even the Messenger of the 
covenant, in whom you delight. Behold, He is coming,’ says the Lord of hosts. ‘But who 
can endure the day of His coming? And who can stand when He appears? For He is like 
a refiner’s fire and like launders’ soap. He will sit as a refiner and a purifier of silver; 
He will purify the sons of Levi, and purge them as gold and silver, that they may offer 
to the Lord an offering in righteousness.’”

‘Angel,’ since He is called ‘the Angel of the covenant’ on account of His advent.”

AC 3142 [2]



“In Malachi…3:1…to ‘sweep the way’ signifies to make themselves ready and 
prepare to receive truth. The subject treated therein is the advent of the Lord,
for which they were to prepare themselves for receiving the truth of faith, 
and thereby the good of charity, and by this eternal salvation.”

AC 4973 [5]



“The Divine truth, which the Lord was when in the world, and which



“In Malachi…3:1…speaking of the coming of the Lord, and He is called ‘Lord’ 
from Divine good and ‘Angel’ from Divine truth…”

AC 10528



“…that here ‘angel’ denotes the Divine of the Lord with him is plain in 
Malachi…3:1…that the Divine of the Lord is here meant by ‘angel’ is because 
John the Baptist represented the Lord in respect to the Word, even as Elijah 
did, and the Word is Divine truth which is from the Lord…And whereas in the 
supreme sense the Lord as to the Divine Human is the ‘Angel,’ therefore it is 
said, ‘the Lord shall come to His temple, even the Angel of the covenant;’ ‘the 
temple’ denotes His Divine Human…The reason why He is called both ‘Lord’ 
and ‘Angel,’ is that He is called ‘Lord’ from Divine good, and ‘Angel’ from 
Divine truth. As ‘Jehovah’ in the Word denotes the Lord Himself, therefore it is
said, ‘I send Mine Angel, who shall prepare the way before Me.’ This is said by 
Jehovah.”

Doctrine of Life 60



“The reason why the Law was called the ‘covenant,’ is that ‘covenant’ signifies
conjunction; and it is therefore said of the Lord that…He is called…‘The 
messenger of the covenant’ (Malachi 3:1)…”

AR 191



“By ‘temple,’ in the supreme sense, the Lord is signified as to the Divine 
Human, in particular as to Divine truth; but, in the representative sense, by 
‘temple’ is signified the Lord’s church in heaven, and likewise the Lord’s 
church in the world. That ‘temple,’ in the supreme sense signifies the Lord as 
to the Divine Human, and in particular as to Divine truth, is evident from 
these passages…Malachi 3:1…”

AR 344



“That the Lord’s Divine Human is meant by ‘an angel,’ in the highest sense, is 
manifest from these passages…Malachi 3:1…”

AR 529



“By that law called ‘a covenant,’ conjunction is signified; the reason is, 
because covenants were entered into for the sake of love, of friendship, of 
consociation, and conjunction. Therefore…He is called…‘The angel of the 
covenant’ (Malachi 3:1).”

72

AR 882



“The reason why the tabernacle, in the highest sense, means the Lord’s Divine
Human, is because this is signified by ‘the temple,’ as may appear from…
Malachi 3:1…and elsewhere; the same is meant by ‘the tabernacle.’ With this 
difference, that by ‘the temple’ is meant the Lord’s Divine Human as to the 
Divine truth or the Divine wisdom, and by ‘the tabernacle’ is meant the Lord’s
Divine Human as to the Divine good or the Divine love. Hence it follows, that 
by ‘behold the tabernacle of God is with men,’ is meant that the Lord will now
be present with men in His Divine Human.”

TCR 92



“The Lord also called Himself ‘one sent by the Father,’ for the reason that sent 
and angel have the same meaning, angel meaning in the original one sent. For
it is said…in Malachi 3:1…‘And the Lord whom ye seek shall suddenly come to 
His temple, even the Messenger of the covenant, whom ye delight in.’”

AE 220 [3]



“In Malachi…3:1…Here also ‘temple’ means the Lord’s Divine Human; for the 
Lord’s coming is here treated of, therefore ‘coming to His temple’ signifies to 
His Human.”

AE 701 [3]



“In Malachi…3:1…the Lord’s coming is proclaimed. The Lord is called ‘Lord’ 
from Divine good, and ‘the angel of the covenant’ from Divine truth…From 
this it can be seen that ‘covenant,’ in reference to the Lord, means either 
Himself or the union of His Divine with the Human in Him, and in reference to
those who are in heaven and in the church it means conjunction with Him 
through the Divine that proceeds from Him.”

AC 666



“That a ‘covenant’ signifies nothing else than regeneration and the things 
pertaining to regeneration, is evident from various passages in the Word 
where the Lord Himself is called the ‘Covenant,’ because it is He alone who 
regenerates, and who is looked to by the regenerate man, and is the all in all 
of love and faith…” “In Malachi…3:1, 2…where the Lord is called the ‘Angel of 
the Covenant…The Sabbath is called a ‘perpetual covenant’…because it 
signifies the Lord Himself, and the celestial man regenerated by Him.”

AC 9303

“…in the original tongue ‘angel’ means one who is sent, which is the 
derivation of the word; and by ‘sent’ is signified proceeding, as can be seen 
from the…following passages…Malachi 3:1…”



“…‘covenant’ signifies conjunction…Malachi 3:1…”

TCR 688



“It is written in Malachi…3:1, 2…‘he shall prepare the way before Me’…it is 
clear that John was the prophet sent to make ready the way of Jehovah God, 
who should descend into the world and accomplish redemption; and that he 
made ready that way by baptism, and by announcing the coming of the Lord; 
and that without such preparation all on earth would have been smitten with 
a curse and would have perished.”

AE 242 [9]



“In Malachi…3:1-3…these things are said of the Lord’s coming. It is said that 
Jehovah is to send a messenger (an angel) who will prepare the way before 
Him; and the messenger (angel) meant is John the Baptist, as is known. 
‘Before Me,’ or before Jehovah, means before the Lord’s Divine Itself; ‘the 
temple to which He is to come’ means His Divine Human; that is also called 
‘the messenger (angel) of the covenant,’ because through it there is a 
conjunction of men and angels with the Divine Itself, for covenant means 
conjunction. ‘The silver that He shall sit refining and purifying’ means truth 
from good; ‘the sons of Levi’ mean all those who are in the good of charity 
and in the truths of faith therefrom; it is therefore said, ‘He shall purge them 
as gold and silver.’ This is because ‘gold’ signifies good, and ‘silver’ the truth 
therefrom. ‘Bringing to Jehovah an offering in righteousness’ means worship 
of the Lord from the good of charity…Therefore ‘to bring an offering in 
righteousness’ signifies worship from the good of love.”

AC 8159 [2]



“The temptations of those who were of the spiritual church, which they were 
to undergo after the Lord came into the world, and could then from the 
Divine Human fight for them against the hells, are meant by these words in 
Malachi…3:1-4…clearly speaking of the Lord’s coming; ‘the sons of Levi’ here 
denote those who are of the spiritual church, for by ‘Levi’ is signified charity 
or spiritual good…‘the refiner’s fire’ is temptation, whereby is effected 

74

purification, which is here meant by ‘purifying and refining them as gold and 
silver;’…”

AR 357



“That the tribe of Levi signifies the love of truth, which is the essential love 
from which the church is a church, and thence intelligence, may appear from 
these passages…Malachi 3:1, 3…”

AE 414



“‘And who is able to stand?’ signifies, who shall sustain and live?…the evil…
come not only into tremors from fear, but also into torments from interior 
conflict, consequently unless they flee away and cast themselves down they 
cannot live, for from fear and torment death as it were befalls them, for the 
presence of the Divine brings death to the evil as it brings life to the good. 
From this their state it is then said, ‘Who is able to stand?’ As…in Malachi…
3:2...”

AE 444 [8]



“In Malachi…3:1-4…‘the sons of Levi’ here mean all who are in the good of 
charity, and thence in the good of faith. This treats of the Lord who was to 
come; his Divine Human is what is meant by ‘His temple’ to which Jehovah 
the Lord was to come; that He will purify those who are in the good of charity,
and thence in the good of faith, is meant by ‘He shall purify and purge the 
sons of Levi.’ Evidently the sons of Levi are not meant, for it is said that ‘He 
shall then purify and purge them’…”

AC 3875 [4]



“They who are in spiritual love are…called the ‘sons of Levi,’ as in Malachi…
3:2, 3…”

Derived Doctrine

With more than twenty-five direct quotes, you would imagine that there would be no
need for derived doctrine. This is true. We have a wonderful array of passages 
explaining the spiritual sense of Malachi 3:1-3. As I look over all of the passages, I 
find only one correspondence that needs to be expanded in our resources. That is 
the correspondence of “soap.”



“Soap” is described in AE 475 [11]: “…if one attempts to purify himself by his 
own efforts, although by means of truths and goods that are or that appear to 
be genuine, he will yet lead himself into falsities; ‘to wash oneself’ means to 

75



purify oneself; ‘waters of snow’ mean truths that are or that appear to be 
genuine; ‘soap’ means the good from which they come…”
Jeremiah 2:22 also refers to soap: “‘For though you wash yourself with lye, 
and use much soap, yet your iniquity is marked before Me,’ says the Lord 
God.”

 From these sources, we note that “soap” signifies spiritual washing that uses 
good from truth to remove falsities. But it is not a thorough washing process 
because it is done apart from the Lord.

Putting It All Together

Just imagine for the moment that you are living during the time of Malachi’s 
prophecy. You have survived a period of brutal captivity, and you are now trying to 
make a new life for yourself and your family in Israel. Your love for the Lord is 
sincere. You attend services regularly. But you feel weighted down with what is 
going on in the temple. The priests and elders have overlaid the Word of the Lord 
with so many traditions it’s hard to feel uplifted. It’s hard to comply with the 
confusing rituals, rites, and regulations of the priesthood. In fact, your feeling is that 
worship is more for the priests and their comfort than it is to preach the good and 
truth of the Lord. Things are going on in the temple that look and sound like idolatry.
Divorce and marriage to foreign wives is occurring all around you, and few seem 
worried. You wonder, “What happened to the days when we were unified in our 
opposition to certain disorders?”

A messenger named Malachi appears and points to things you sensed and worried 
about. He talks of the demise of the church and its priesthood. He sounds a warning 
to change and foster a spirit of obedience. Then, half-way through his oracle, he 
mentions the coming of the Messiah. Oh, how you have longed for that day!

Certain of his words just burn within your heart. “I am sending My messenger to 
prepare the way. He will suddenly appear in the temple.” The messenger announces 
that there will be delight and joy at His arrival. He is coming. “Who will endure the 
day of His coming and who can stand when He appears?”

The messenger tells all that the Messiah will come and correct the errors of the 
temple. He will educate all in the truths of the Law. This will mean being washed. It 
will mean purification of the gold and silver and the sons of Levi. All of this will 
happen, he says, so that an offering of righteousness may be made to the Lord.

Now let’s bring ourselves to the present again. We, as members of the New Church, 
need to hold and celebrate our sense of joy at the Lord’s second coming. He has 
promised us a new conjunction. That conjunction is called a holy “perpetual 
covenant” of the Lord. The opening of the Word with its spiritual sense is a joy and a 
hope for our church. Evil will not be able to endure what is opened by the Lord. Hell 
trembles and quakes and falls down at the mention of the Lord’s name. “Who can 

76

endure the day of His coming and stand when He appears?” Not the evil. But His 
promise is that the good will be uplifted and encouraged. Why will the Lord enter 
into a covenant with His New Church? He does so for the sake of love, of friendship, 
of consolation and conjunction (AR 529).

Traditions have value. Habits have value. But if either of these overlay the Word of 
the Lord and make His Word of no importance, then we need to wash with the soap 
of good from truth. If issues of disorder are so blurred that we feel alone and out of 
step with the popular opinions of the world, we need to side with the truth of the 
Lord. Searching His Word is essential. Giving the Lord our obedience is a must. 
Nothing in this world will impede the coming of the Lord’s New Church. Can we be 
inspired with the words of the Messenger? Can we make the worship of our heart 
“an offering in righteousness”?

Questions to Stimulate Reflection

 Did the “Pulling It all Together” section “pump you up”? It did it for me. We 
often carry around with us a feeling of smallness. What impact can we have 
on the world? When will the New Church really come to fruition? On and on 
we go with a sense of our frailty. It’s time to think positively. Where are you in
this message? To be small in the hands of the Lord is good. Look at some of 
the most momentous moments in the Word. The Lord selected a few to win 
over the larger evil. With God, all things are possible. He can save by many or 
by few.

 Did you catch the “who can stand” message? Hell can’t stand. Those who 
follow the Lord will stand before Him with a loyalty and hope for eternity.
Spiritual washing is important. Our lesson reminds us that if we try to do it 
alone, we can use lye and lots of scrubbing, but it will be of no use unless the 
Lord is involved.



 There are so many points to be discussed in this section. I will trust that you 
will have lots to talk about and discuss. Let your reflection carry you into the 
realm of the spiritual world where angels behold the face of our Father and 
where they love to share the spiritual sense of the Word.

Derived Doctrine

There is no need for us to use derived doctrine. Our lessons from the Writings are 
quite full and clear.

Putting It All Together

Have you noticed we are no longer involved in a dialogue between the Lord and the 
priests? There is instead a positive message about the Lord’s advent and what 
positive spiritual things will come to His church. The Lord is speaking words of truth
and certainty. Debate and insolence have no part in this discourse. Isn’t it much 
more fulfilling to listen to what the Lord’s advent will do for the church?

There will be a return to worship services filled with love and wisdom. They will be 
the culmination of the love and wisdom that filled the Most Ancient Church and the 
Ancient Church. What does that mean? The Most Ancient Church worshiped the 
Lord in the Divine Human. He walked among them, giving them inspiration drawn 
from His Celestial Love. He walked and talked with them. If they had any questions, 
He spoke to them directly. They saw the Lord in some angelic form. He was not 
invisible to them.

The Ancient Church saw the Lord in the Divine Representatives of the world. The 
trees, the mountains, the brooks, the streams, and the oceans—all of nature—
opened their minds to see the wisdom of the Lord. And the Ancient Church loved 
that wisdom. The Lord was not invisible to them. He was visible through Divine 
Representatives.

80

The Ancient Churches, in their prime, did not have their worship of the Lord overlaid
with self-serving rules. Profit and self-love were not a hindrance to worship. The 
offerings were meal-offerings of righteousness. Both churches saw the Lord. He was 
not invisible. The promise of the New Church carries with it the message that what 
was “invisible” will be made “visible” again. Like the Ancients, we will see the Lord 
as the Divine Human, and there will be an everlasting conjunction of life and peace 
with Him.

Can you feel the uplifting words of the messenger sent by the Lord? Probably, those 
who heard it in the days of Malachi were anxious. “When, O Lord, will this happen? 
We have waited many, many years. Why do You tarry? Come quickly with cleansing 
of the temple and our souls!”

The answer as given in the Word is: “Wait patiently for the Lord.” “Be thou strong 
and courageous.” It will happen in the fullness of times. We need to trust and rely on 
the Lord as to the fulfillment of the promise. In the meantime, we can read His Word 
and trust in the providential leading of His wisdom. Why? Because the words and 
promises, like those of Malachi and the Writings, tell us:

“The church, doctrine and worship will then be as they had been among the 
ancients.”(P&P)

Questions to Stimulate Reflection

 Does it feel good to be away from the negative debate between the people 

and the Lord?

 There is a comfort when the Lord is in charge. He steadies the course. He 

gives a view from eternity. But for some reason, we, at times, resist giving in 
to His providence. Why? Is it just our proprium, or is it a fear of letting go? We
do get comfortable with our ways. Change is not easy for us.

 Have you ever had a celestial experience? What is meant by that is: have you 
ever “sensed” that something was right or wrong? You couldn’t speak words 
to explain why you felt this or that. It just was a powerful feeling. Not all of 
these experiences are celestial, but when we look back and see that one of 
these feelings was correct, we rejoice in the fact that we listened.

 Have you ever looked at the magnificent sunset or a view from the mountain 
and felt the presence of the Lord? Do you, in the quietness of a walk through 
nature, think about the correspondence of things? If you do, what insights did
you get? If you don’t, what keeps you from trying to do so?

81

 Do you ask the Lord to hurry with His New Church? Do you find your heart 



aching for its arrival?
In the fullness of times, the Lord says, it will happen. Maybe we need to 
concentrate on the job of preparing the way of the Lord.

 The passage from Malachi has a message we might reflect on: “Then the 
offering…will be pleasant to the Lord…” I like the wording. It doesn’t 
emphasize the offering being pleasant for us, or for other people. It will be 
“pleasant to the Lord.”

MALACHI 3:5-6

“‘And I will come near you for judgment; I will be a swift witness against sorcerers, 
against adulterers, against perjurers, against those who exploit wage earners and

things sanctified because they represented those that are natural and not 
spiritual, and the spiritual are of the church, but not so the natural…
Nevertheless, as those signified by ‘hired servants’ still do good, although not 
from a spiritual affection but from a natural affection, which is obedience, and
then think of heaven as a reward, they are mentioned with the ‘poor,’ the 
‘needy,’ the ‘sojourners,’ ‘the fatherless,’ and ‘the widows,’ because they are in 
spiritual poverty; for genuine truths are obscure to them, because light from 
heaven does not flow in through their spiritual man into the natural…”

Derived Doctrine

“And I will come near you for judgment…”

 To come “near” signifies the perpetual conjunction” of love (AC 5911). Why 

would the Lord draw “near us” with His love when judgment takes place? AC 
8159 [3] gives us a powerful answer: “the hells fight against man, and the 
Lord [fights] for man; to every falsity the hells inject, there is an answer from 
the Divine.” So judgment requires that the Lord be perpetually “near us” to 
keep all things balanced. The good and the evil will get a fair hearing in the 
time of judgment because love brings a fair resolution to each judgment.
 AC 2335 describes “judgment” as twofold. “The faithful are judged from good, 
but the unfaithful from truth.” “The Lord never judges any one except from 
good…Mercy itself and good itself can never condemn any one; but it is the 
man who condemns himself, because he rejects good.”

“…I will be a swift witness against sorcerers, against adulterers, against perjurers…”





“Swiftness” in the Word has reference “to intelligence, signifying the affection 
of truth.” (AE 281 [7])
“Swiftness,” in the negative sense, refers to “their avidity for reasoning 
against truths and destroying them, and pleasure in it…‘swiftness’ and ‘haste’ 
in the Word signify being stirred by affection and lust…” (AE 281 [10])

83



“Sorcerers” signify the abuse of divine order. They represent the perversion 
of law by practicing cunning and deceit (AC 7296).
“Adulterers” signify those who deny the Lord and profane the Word (Doctrine
of Sacred Scriptures 67).
“Perjurers” (liars) signify those who “scrutinize those things which are called 
goods and truths…which nevertheless are evils and falsities.” (AR 79) In other
words, liars give the impression that they seek good and truth, but their lives 
are otherwise—they love falsity and evil.

“Against those who exploit wage earners…”

 We have no direct teaching on the meaning of these words. But a story in the 
Word comes to mind that might illustrate the issue. Was Laban’s deceit of 
Jacob an example of the misuse of a wage earner? Laban used Jacob’s love for 
Rachel to trick him into marrying Leah before winning the hand of Rachel. Do
the hells trick people into believing they can win, or merit, heaven through 
“good works” apart from repentance and regeneration? What would you call 
using the “good intentions” of others for personal gain? Isn’t this a form of 
exploiting “wage earners”?

 This now brings us to our consideration of the Lord as the swift “witness.” 
The Lord, in the Word, is called “the faithful and true witness.” “Witness” 
signifies the Lord in respect to the Divine truth and the church (AE 228). The 
Lord will not twist or misuse truth. He is able to see clearly intentions, 
motives, and affections. What might appear to us to be a paradox, an 
oxymoron, a black hole, an unexplainable mystery, is to the Lord clear, lucid, 
and knowable. He is the light of heaven. There is no darkness in His presence.
He views the totality of the universe. Nothing escapes His notice. This true 
and faithful witness of heaven will show us, from beginning to end, the 
motives, intentions, and desires of our hearts. There is no misreading or 
projection in the Lord’s report to us of the core of our feelings and choices. 
Our “ruling loves” will unfold before Him with accuracy and impartiality. Is 
this a scary thought? Or is it a truth that brings a sense of comfort? Maybe we 
feel a sense of both fear and comfort.  

“…widows and orphans, and against those who turn away an alien—because they do 
not fear Me…”



“Widows and orphans” signify those who are in good and not truth and 
desire to be instructed in the truths of faith. What then is the meaning of 
turning away an alien, foreigner, or stranger? AC 10287 has sixteen sub-
sections dedicated to explaining why the Lord warned Israel to keep 
strangers out of the church, their homes, their lives and marriages. Strangers 
(foreigners) signified the evils of falsity and profanations of all kinds. Why 
then would the Lord come swiftly in judgment against Israel for turning 
aliens away? Weren’t they doing what He had told them to do?

84

 As a representative church of the Lord, what was to be Israel’s use in the 
world? Isolationism? Jonah believed he was not to preach repentance to 
Nineveh. What happened to him? When he finally did go to those strangers of 
Nineveh, what happened to them upon hearing the Word of the Lord? 
Repentance occurred in spite of Jonah’s dislike of his mission. The point here 
is that we need a goal of protection and profession to all who desire 
instruction. We need to protect against and shun the falsities of profanation 
from aliens, and we need to spread the Word of the Lord to areas of alien 
falsity and profanation. Israel wanted exclusivity of the Word. They had a 
nationalistic pride that they were the favored people of the Lord. Aliens, 
strangers, and foreigners were anathema to them. Love (fear) of the Lord 
goes beyond a favored nation. The New Church will be inclusive. It is to 
become the crown of all churches.

“…says the Lord of hosts.”

 Please note the repetition of this phrase. Why? Because it signifies the Lord’s 

zeal to save all and to redeem His church.

“For I am the Lord, I do not change…”



Is there any question about the spiritual meaning of these words? The Lord is
the same today as He was in the past and as He will be in the future. He does 
not have alternating states. His nature is not capricious. He doesn’t say one 
thing but mean another thing. As finite beings, this is hard for us to grasp in 
its totality because of our fickle nature. But here are the words of the Lord: “I 
am the Lord, I do not change…”

“…therefore you are not consumed, O sons of Jacob.”







“Consumed” signifies the last time of the church when there is no longer any 
good left (AC 1857).
“Sons” signify truths as they were in the Ancient Church, which had genuine 
truths (AE 724 [11]).
“Jacob” signifies various things. In the beginning, Jacob represented the 
Lord’s natural as to truth, in the progress, the Lord’ natural as to the good of 
truth, and in the end the Lord as to good (AC 4538). Jacob represents the 
doctrine of the church(AR 137). In essence, the Lord is announcing that in 
spite of what had been done to the church by evil and falsity, the “remnant” of
good and truth was still alive and present because of Him.

Putting It All Together

The Lord’s prophecy informed Israel of a coming judgment. What issues were 
significant enough to have the Lord send Malachi as His angel messenger?

85

Our text focuses the reader’s attention on sorcerers, adulterers, perjurers, exploiters,
those who ignored widows and orphans and extended harsh treatment to aliens 
(strangers). In reality, the Lord was exposing the lack of respect for His Word and the
spiritual effects it was having on the minds and hearts of the people. Israel just 
wasn’t giving the Word serious attention. They were not zealously studying the 
Word and were not feeding the hungry souls with eternal truths.

How vital is the Word for us? Let’s look at two passages that answer the question 
with simplicity and directness:

 AC 1361 states that the Word “was established…that heaven might be joined 

in some measure to the earth.”

 AC 1775 states that “it has been necessary that of the Lord’s Divine 

Providence some revelation should come into existence, for a revelation or 
Word is the general recipient vessel of spiritual and celestial things, thus 
conjoining heaven and earth; and that without it they would have been 
disjoined, and the human race would have perished. And besides it is 
necessary that there should be heavenly truths somewhere, by which man 
may be instructed, because he was born for heavenly things, and, after 
the life of the body, ought to come among those who are heavenly; for 
the truths of faith are the laws of order in the kingdom in which he is to 
live forever.” (emphasis added)

How much of an idea do we have regarding the amazing power of the Word and 
what our lives would be like without the Word? The connection of heaven and earth, 
through the Word, is essential. Without the Word, “disjunction” would occur. Our 
spiritual life is vitally tied to the Word. We were born for heavenly things. That being
a truth from the Lord is quite a powerful point. We must have the Word to survive 
spiritually.

So let’s look at and reflect on the examples given by Malachi and question the ways 
we need to heed the words of the Lord and amend our lives. Here is the list:

Sorcery: the clever art of presenting falsities so they appear as truths.


 Adultery: unfaithfulness to the good and truth of the Word. 
 Perjury: giving lip service to the Word with the mouth but denying, within the

heart, that the Word reigns.

 Exploiting: using the Word for one’s own ends to justify falsity.
 Widows: the affection longs to be instructed in the truths of faith. The 

affection of the widow lacks its helpmate—truth.

 Orphans: innocence is unable to be cared for by father (truths) and mother 



(affections).
Strangers or aliens: carrying the Word to the external church (outsiders) for 
those who lack a spiritual conjunction but long for it.

86

 Lack of fear of the Lord: Fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom. Loving 
the Lord and not wishing to do anything that would harm Him is essential.

We need to reverently hold the Word in great esteem; searching it for the 
connections between heaven and earth; studying it because we know that this is 
what we will read to eternity; the Word has the laws of order that will make up our 
eternity. Ignoring the Word is serious. The rippled effect of spiritual ignorance is 
incalculable.

The love the Lord has for us will press to touch us. The Word is for the amendment 
of our mind and heart. The Word is for the building up of His Church. If we remain 
aloof and violate good and truth, these words indicate what will happen to those of a
hard heart:

“The Lord will then execute judgment upon all who have adulterated and destroyed 
the truths of the church.” (P&P)

Questions to Stimulate Reflection

 Can you evaluate what your loyalty is to the Word?
 Next, can you estimate how well you are dealing with sorcery?
 How about the adulteration of the Word?
 Have you experienced events in which perjury of the Word might have 

occurred?

 Are you able to identify with the widow or orphan state?
 Can you think of a time when you exploited the “wage earner” of the mind?
 What is your view or feeling about the stranger in the external church?
 The Word teaches that fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom. Fear 
means love, in this context. Do you have a healthy fear of the Lord? An 
unhealthy fear is not what the Lord seeks. He wants us loving Him so much 
that we don’t want to do anything that would do harm to Him and His Word. 
Is your love healthy or unhealthy?

 Use your imagination; what kind of reception do you think Malachi got from 
the people when he spoke these words of judgment? He was the last of the 12
Minor Prophets. The people had heard things like this from other prophets. 
Do you think they might have built up a feeling of immunity to the judgment 
warnings?

87

 The feeling of spiritual immunity is a kind of “numbing out” state. We hear 

the words, we sing the words, we speak the words, but not much is going on 
in our affections. What is the best way to break out of the immunity state?

MALACHI 3:7

“‘Yet from the days of your fathers you have gone away from My ordinances and have 
not kept them. Return to Me, and I will return to you,’ says the Lord of hosts. But you 
said, ‘In what way shall we return?’”



“They have done this from the beginning, and do not desist from it…”

Derived Doctrine

“Yet from the days of your fathers you have gone away from My ordinances and have 
not kept them.”

 Before we look at derived doctrine, let’s review some of the ways Israel went 

away from the Lord’s ordinances:

o The worship of the golden calf.
o Israel’s bitter complaining about the lack of water.
o Their complaints about the manna and quail.
o Their wish to go back to Egypt.
o The rebellious nature of their hearts, as reflected by the Lord calling 

Israel a stiff-necked people.

o The desire to have a king like all other nations, a desire that showed 

they had rejected the Lord as their King.

o Every man doing that which was right in his own eyes.
o The mistakes of Saul and David.






“Days” signify the successive state of regeneration (AC 6).
“Fathers” in this instance seem to reflect that which is negative. Therefore, it 
appears that the spiritual sense is drawing our attention to the rebellious 
nature of inherited tendencies toward evils and falsities.
“Ordinances” are all things of the Word in general such as precepts, statutes, 
and laws that provide a framework for order (AC 3382). Any departure from 
the commands and “ordinances” of the Word “turns the Word into a 
wilderness.” (AC 3900) 

88

“Return to Me, and I will return to you…”

 Let’s consider the meaning of this verse in the context of an important 

universal law: There is a “universal law that influx adjusts itself according to
efflux, and if efflux is checked influx is checked. Through the internal man 
there is an influx of good and truth from the Lord, and through the external 
there must be efflux, namely into the life…in the exercise of charity. When 
there is this efflux then there is continual influx from heaven…through 
heaven from the Lord; whereas if there is no efflux, but resistance in the 
external or natural man…it follows from the universal law…that the influx 
adjusts itself to the efflux, consequently [if] the influx of good draws back…
influx is closed.” (AC 5828, emphasis added)

“…says the Lord of hosts.”



Is there a need to restate the meaning of this phrase? We have given the 
meaning often. Check your memory regarding the intent of the Lord.

“But you said, ‘In what way shall we return?’”

 We are back to the rebuttals of the people of Israel. Do the questions signal 
a return to the negative doubt state? What part of “Return to Me” do they not 
understand? It is almost as if they felt put off by the Lord’s audacity to 
question their loyalty to Him and their worship of Him.
Spiritual affirmativeness (sanity) would have inspired a different attitude; the
people would have asked the Lord to show them how they needed to change.



Putting It All Together

The long tradition of being rebellious and stiff-necked had not worked well for 
Israel. Their ignoring of the Lord’s ordinances carried the Word into a wilderness 
state. Now it was time to change their ways. Israel needed to give up on their 
“traditions” and focus on the ways of the Lord.

To help Israel find a new direction, the Lord offered a “universal law” as the 
framework for spiritual reformation. “Return to Me and I will return to you.” AC 
5828 gives us the words “influx” and “efflux.” Essentially, we are taught that influx is 
proportional to efflux. If the heart gives little to the Lord, then little comes into the 
heart. The Lord doesn’t limit our influx—we set the adjusting controls. “Return to 
Me and I will return to you” is an important spiritual “ordinance” to know and to 
love. Forget all of the other traditions we have followed from our “fathers.” 
Rebellious ways lead the Word into a wilderness state. Now it is time for new 
beginnings. Isaiah 35:1 offers a picture of what the Lord’s influx can do for our 
wilderness states:
“The wilderness and the wasteland shall be glad for them,

89

and the desert shall rejoice and blossom as the rose;
It shall blossom abundantly and rejoice, even with joy and singing.”

Questions to Stimulate Reflection

 When we discuss “inherited tendencies toward evil,” we must also be ready to
talk about “inherited tendencies toward good.” Both are passed on to us by 
our fathers. The presence of the good tendencies helps us pull out of 
rebellious states. Do we spend enough time thinking of both, or do you think 
we spend too much time focusing on the negative tendencies?
It seems prudent to have as a rule of thumb that we will not discuss the evil 
tendencies without also discussing the good tendencies. Do you think this 
might be a guideline the church could follow more often?



 Did you notice the return of the negative questions from Israel? Any reaction 
to the presumptuous arrogance of the people? How might they have asked 
positive questions?



 Please read AC 5828 again. How many insights are you able to pull forth from 
this number? There are many. This is a great universal law to commit to 
memory.
“Return to Me and I will return to you” is a positive message. We need to keep
it positive because the hells will surely try to paint a negative picture of the 
process.
Israel didn’t listen to the invitation of the Lord, as we will see in the next 
verses. How can we learn from their resistance and adjust and change our 
directions?



 P&P records for us a sad summary: “They have done this from the beginning, 
and do not desist from it…” We need to commit ourselves to the rewriting of 
this spiritual legacy: “They did this from the beginning, and now desist from
it…”

MALACHI 3:8-9

“Will a man rob God? Yet you have robbed Me! But you say, ‘In what way have we 
robbed You?’ In tithes and offerings. You are cursed with a curse, for you have robbed 
Me, even this whole nation.”

P&P



“…nor do they desist from adulteration, therefore this will bring about their 
ruin.”

Derived Doctrine

“Will a man rob God? Yet you have robbed Me!”

 When we consider the meaning of the word “rob,” we must carry with our 






thoughts the words “plunder,” “steal,” and “theft.”
“Rob” signifies priests who teach but do not lead to the life of good (AC 
10794). “Rob” signifies the profanation of the church and of worship (AE 325 
[10]). “Rob” signifies the evil of life validated by the twisting of doctrine in the
church (AE 410 [8]).
Is it right that “man” robs the Divine? We know the answer to this question.
“Yet you have robbed Me!” The priesthood and the church taught for doctrine 
the commandments of people and made the Word of no importance. This was
a serious theft of spiritual goods. The blind were leading the blind, and both 
were falling into the pits of ignorance.

“But you say, ‘In what way have we robbed You?’”



Isaiah 55:8-9 reminds us of our limitations: “‘For My thoughts are not your 
thoughts, nor are your ways My ways,’ says the Lord. ‘For as the heavens are 
higher than the earth, so are My ways higher than your ways, and My 
thoughts higher than your thoughts.’”

 Given this as a truth, why couldn’t Israel humble itself to ask for forgiveness 
and the leadership to correct their failings? Apparently, their robberies were 
not a concern to them and they intended to follow their own prudence.

“In tithes and offerings.”





“Tithes” signify “the goods and truths which are stored up by the Lord in 
man’s interiors, and which goods are called ‘remains’…” (AC 3740)
“Offerings” signify worship grounded in charity (AC 350).

“You are cursed with a curse, for you have robbed Me, even this whole nation.”

 The Lord is not the one putting a curse on Israel. The curse occurs when the 
sensuous yearnings of this world avert themselves from the celestial (AC 
245). To be “cursed with a curse” seems to signify what is presented in AC 
378, where a curse is defined as referring to schisms. Being cursed with a 

91

curse seems to speak of a schism within a schism working to turn away from 
the order of the Lord.
“Even this whole nation” denotes the enormity of the spiritual problem. 



Putting It All Together

The meaning of this passage is clear. The church and its priesthood were not 
concerned about the good and truth of the Word. Nor were they concerned about the
souls of the people. Status and man-made rules were of greater importance to them. 
The New Testament shows us that the Lord saw the same condition in the Scribes 
and Pharisees. He remarked how they loved to been seen. He noticed how they 
sought to take the higher seats in church and at public events. They made every 
effort to distance themselves from the laity. Learned in the laws, they used their 
knowledge to court and favor their own riches. They feigned piety with mourning, 
sackcloth, and ashes. But their hearts were not on repentance and obedience. 
Robbery, fraud, stealing, and plunder came from their ministrations in the sanctuary 
of the Lord.

When the Lord called these things to the attention of Israel, the people acted as if 
they did not know what He was referring to. The schisms of disunity brought curse 
upon curse to the people and the church. Is it any wonder that the collective 
conscience of the people saw no wrong in what they were doing? The words “How 
have we robbed You?” are symptomatic of the deeper problems within.  

The answer from the Lord was couched in the words of “tithes and offerings.” Tithes 
signify remains. These forms of innocence, guarded and protected by the Lord, were 
not being appreciated nor encouraged to come into worship and charity. Deceit and 
hatred abounded, filling the minds of the people so that there was no “room for the 
Lord” in the goods and truths of the offerings.

P&P sums up the results of their opposition with these words: They did not “desist 
from adulteration; therefore this will bring about their ruin.”

If you are thinking of the church as a building, try expanding your idea to that

any examples of real-life situations to mind?

“‘Bring all the tithes into the storehouse, that there may be food in My house, and try

And I will rebuke the devourer for your sakes, so that he will not destroy the fruit of

Derived Doctrine

“Bring all the tithes into the storehouse that there may be food in My house…”



“Bring” signifies to be conjoined (AC 5543). “Bring” indicates some kind of 
introduction or offering (AC 5645).

 A “storehouse” signifies “the first state of the man who is being regenerated, 
or in whom truth is being conjoined with good…and in its storehouse called 
the memory, there are amassed the doctrinal things…” (AC 3316 [2]) A 
storehouse signifies things stored up in the memory (AE 427 [4]). AE 790 [5] 
relates that the spiritual mind has a storehouse from which it draws supplies.
“Food” signifies spiritual and celestial nourishment, which is faith in the Lord 
(AC 680 [4]).
“My house” signifies the Lord’s house (kingdom) in the ultimate of order (AC 
3739).





“‘…and try Me now in this,’ says the Lord of hosts…”

 To “try” means to test or to make a trial. “Try” means to settle by a test so as 
to come to some conclusion. “Try Me now” seems to indicate that the Lord 
saw that the state of humanity was such that “now” (and not later) was the 
moment to take action.
“…says the Lord of hosts” signifies the zeal of the Lord to save all people and 
the church.



“…If I will not open for you the windows of heaven…”



“Windows” signifies the thorough investigation of truth (AE 282 [5]). AE 675 
[19] teaches that “to open the windows of heaven” signifies the Divine 
inflowing from which comes intelligence and eternal life.

95

“…and pour out for you such blessing that there will not be room enough to receive it.”





So that we may understand what “pour out” represents, we need to note the 
various kinds of “pouring out” mentioned in the literal sense. The Lord says 
He will “pour out” His Spirit; He promised to “pour out” water upon the dry 
desert; He promised to “pour out” broth for the hungry; He said He would 
“pour out” indignation on the evil; He said that He would “pour out” the 
anger of His people; He promised to “pour out” whoredom; for those who 
lived the life of evil, He promised to “pour out” His wrath. Now our text says 
that the Lord will “pour out” “such blessing.” 
“Blessing” signifies a wish for happiness and success (AC 3185). A “blessing” 
signifies to enrich with spiritual and celestial good (AC 981). A “blessing” 
signifies fructification and multiplication (AC 43 and 273).

 How much will the Lord “pour out” in His “blessing”? The literal sense gives 
us the answer: “There will not be room enough to receive it.” This same idea 
is present in the Twenty-Third Psalm, in the words “my cup runneth over…” 
The Lord’s wish for our happiness and success knows no limit.

“And I will rebuke the devourer for your sakes, so that he will not destroy the fruit of 
your ground…”

 The word “rebuke” carries with its meaning a sense of making right or 

vindicating wrongs.

 A “devourer” signifies one who wants to destroy goods and truths (AC 9348 
[4]). A “devourer” signifies the destruction of doctrine at its inception 
(Revelation 12:4; AR 542).

 The Lord promises to do this “for [our] sakes.”


“…so that [the devourer] will not destroy the fruit of your ground…” “Fruit” 
signifies everything that has life from the Lord (AC 43). “Fruitful” signifies the 
increase of goods in the interior man (AC 1018). “Fruit of the ground” 
signifies the mind of each individual of the church—each one in the church is 
a church (AC 872).

“…nor shall the vine fail to bear fruit for you in the field…”

 A “vine” signifies the Lord. A “vine” signifies the spiritual church in charity in 
which the Lord is present, and the branches are the people of the church (AC 
1069 [5]). The “harvest of fruit” signifies the church bringing forth truth and 
good (AE 374 [4]).

 A “field” signifies the church as to good, for the church receives the seeds of 
good and truth (AC 3766). The “harvest of the field” signifies the church 
related to the reception and bringing forth of truth and good (AE 374 [4]).

“…says the Lord of hosts…”

 This phrase occurs three times in the section under study. Question: is the 

occurrence of this phrase correspondential? The number three corresponds 
to love, wisdom, and use. Is the Lord calling our attention to His zeal to save 
all and especially the church?

“‘…all nations will call you blessed, for you will be a delightful land,’ says the Lord of 
hosts.”



“Blessed” represents the state of being happy, peaceful, and enriched with 
celestial and spiritual good. “Delightful” represents the consequent joys that 
come to an orderly church. Thus, the Lord is indicating to the people that 
others shall see their works and how the fruit of the Lord is in all that they 
do.

 Who says this? The Lord of hosts. He is the one who has the zeal to save the 

church and all who are within it.

Putting It All Together

The summary from P&P starts out with the word “If.” If Israel had lived according to 
the statutes of the Lord, they would have been in the good of the church. What good 
things would they enjoy “if” they complied with the Lord’s words?

 The windows of heaven would open.
 There would be a pouring out of blessings.


So many blessings would come to them there would be no room capable of 
holding them all.

 The devourer, hell, would be rebuked. The church would be vindicated.
 The fruit of the ground would not be destroyed.
 The fruit of the vine in the field would yield a great crop. All nations would 
look at them as a blessed (happy) land. Other nations would notice their 
blessedness and delightfulness.

The Lord said to them, “Try Me. Give Me the opportunity to bless you. Let me show 
you the results of making a commitment to follow Me.” How would they get started 
on this blessing? By “bringing” all of their remains to the storehouse of the mind. 
They were to let the remains, or tithes, be food for the Lord’s House out of which the 
spiritual mind could draw its supplies (sustenance).

“If”: A conditional word that indicates Israel had a big decision to make. Would it be 
their way or the Lord’s way? Their way led to spiritual death. The Lord’s way led to 
eternal bliss.

97

We can’t leave this summary without applying the same “if” condition to our internal
church. If we “try” the Lord “now,” the Lord will make us a blessing the likes of which
no room can contain. Every day, in millions of ways, the Lord blesses us with 
manifold gifts. How can we know this is so? Because thus “says the Lord of hosts.” 
These oft-stated words serve as a reminder that the Lord has a Divine zeal to save 
His church and all who are in the church.

Questions to Stimulate Reflection

 The opening portion of verse 10 starts out with the command to bring tithes 
into the storehouse. How do we bring “remains” into the mind? Isn’t this 
what the Lord does for us? He alone knows where remains are. Do we need to
help Him bring them to mind?
“Try Me now” has a sense of urgency to it. Do we let the Lord show us His 
power? Or do we allow the hells to minimize His awesome power? Give Me a 
test trial and I will show you, says the Lord.



 Opening the windows has wonderful correspondences. What thoughts or 

images come to mind with opening windows?

 The “pouring out of blessings” is a Divine promise. Looking back over our 
lives, can we see any of these blessings? How about the “there will not be 
room enough to receive them” statement? Anything come to mind that 
testifies to this point?

 How have you fought against the “devourer” of fruit of the ground?
 Are you able to identify with the meaning of the vine and fruit 

correspondences?

MALACHI 3:13-15

“‘Your words have been harsh against Me,’ says the Lord, ‘Yet you say, “What have we 
spoken against You?” You have said, “It is useless to serve God; what profit is it that we 
have kept His ordinance, and that we have walked as mourners before the Lord of 
hosts? So now we call the proud blessed, for those who do wickedness are raised up; 
they even tempt God and go free.”’”

Passages from the Writings

P&P



“They have confirmed themselves in this, that good is of no profit and that 
evil does no harm, because the good and the wicked are alike prosperous.”

AE 372 [6 & 7]



“Since in the churches before the Lord’s coming, which were representative 
churches, mourning represented spiritual grief of mind on account of the 
absence of truth and good, for they mourned when oppressed by an enemy, 
on the death of a father or mother, and for like things, and oppression by an 
enemy signified oppression by evils from hell, and father and mother 
signified the church in respect to good and in respect to truth, because with 
them these things were represented by mourning, they at such times went in 
black. As in…Malachi…3:14…That ‘to be made black’ signifies spiritual grief of
mind…”

Derived Doctrine

“‘Your words have been harsh against Me,’ says the Lord…”



“In its origin…the good of love and of charity is most gentle, consequently it is
so in its advance into heaven; but when it sinks down to the hells, it becomes 
harsh and severe, because it is turned into this by those who are there…” 
(AC 7679, emphasis added)

 Falsities “…if applied to good…become mild, but if to evil, they become hard 

[harsh]…” (AC 8311, emphasis added)

 These numbers are cited so that we can picture the gentleness of the Lord’s 
providence being turned into harshness by hearts that are opposed to Him. 
The “harshness” is not representative of the Lord but of the people speaking 
offensively about the Lord.

“Yet you say, what have we spoken against You?”

 One would think that if the Lord, who knows all and sees all, said these things
to anyone who had a sense of humility, the person would feel remorse for the 
misspoken words. You would think the people would want to put on a cloak 
of “black” to mourn the loss, or lack, of good and truth. Instead, the people of 
Israel took on a confrontational attitude. They questioned the Lord and 
doubted His assessment of their intentions. Their question “What have we 
spoken against You?” carries with it a sphere of hardness and disrespectful 
pride.

99

“You have said, ‘It is useless to serve God; what profit is it that we have kept His 
ordinance and that we have walked as mourners…”

 What constitutes a life of usefulness? Let’s consider this quote from AC 503: 
“The life of love…is life while in the performance of use…in the good and 
truth of use: from use, by use, and according to use, is life given by the Lord; 
there can be no life in what is useless, for whatever is useless is cast 
away.” (emphasis added)

 Consider also this teaching from AC 1100: “It is utterly useless for a man to 
know many things if he does not live according to what he knows. For 
knowing has no other end than that the man may thereby become good. 
When he has become good, he has much more than one who knows 
innumerable things and yet is not good; for what the latter seeks by much 
knowledge, the former already has.”

 What then are we to glean from the above quoted passages? The people of 

Israel, because of their cold hearts, felt it was useless to serve God. They saw 
no end. They saw no rewards. Keeping the ordinances of the Lord was 
meaningless to them. Therefore, what had no meaning to them in life was 
being cast way as superfluous.

 The question “What profit is it that we have kept His ordinances?” seems to 
indicate they felt no gain or enrichment coming to them from the Lord. 
“Profit” or gain has a signification of a love of the world that destroys a 
person’s soul (AE 750 [5]). Gain, in a negative sense, signifies falsity from evil 
perverting judgment (AC 8711).

 To “walk” signifies to meditate on doctrine (AR 137). To “walk” signifies to 
live by enlightenment from the Lord (AR 75). Apparently, these things were 
not happening with Israel. The people walked in their own prudence and 
failed to seek the Lord, so their hearts grieved with the requirements of 
repentance and regeneration. Spiritual work wearied and stressed them to 
the point of “mourning” because the Lord did not validate their desire for 
power, ease, and profitability.

“So now we call the proud blessed, for those who do wickedness are raised up; they 
even tempt God and go free.”  

 Their flimsy charges against the Lord are listed: the proud are happy 

(blessed); the wicked are heroes among the people; the wicked “try” the Lord
and get away with it. Can’t we hear a “poor me” attitude? The people saw 
themselves wearing sackcloth with their faces darkened by ashes, and what 
did they get for their efforts? Nothing. So they asked, what’s the point of 
serving the Lord? They thought, He doesn’t care, nor does He punish the 
proud, the wicked, and their derision of His ordinances. Psalm 73 carries the 
same theme, except that in this Psalm, a resolution occurs in the case of 
arrogance: “It was too painful for me—until I went into the sanctuary of 
God; then I understood their end.”(emphasis added)

100



Israel was into complaining but not going into the sanctuary, so they never 
saw “the end” of the proud, the wicked, and those who tempted the Lord.

Putting It All Together

We have an expression, “Try to convince a man against his will, and he will be of the 
same opinion still.” Israel’s will wanted to confirm the belief that being good was not
advantageous. To Israel, good and evil seemed no different in terms of profitability. 
They believed the evil were not being checked or punished by the Lord. They saw 
arrogance flaunt itself before the Lord and get away with it. So, they asked, what 
benefits do we get for being “faithful” to the Lord? We follow the rules and mourn 
before the Lord, and we see no advantages coming out of our adherence to God’s 
laws. “It is useless to serve the Lord.”

Don’t we hear some of this in our day? When tragedy strikes, it plays no favorites. 
The Lord causes his sun and rain to fall equally upon the just and the unjust. A 
church will burn down just as easily as a den of iniquity. No special Divine 
intervention for the faithful. Why isn’t it different? Couldn’t the Lord spare the good 
and punish the wicked? That certainly would restore some order and get world-
wide respect for the Lord. With the Lord’s Divine power, He could easily bring the 
arrogant and evil under His control. But He doesn’t move toward such ends for a 
good reason: Spiritual Freedom.

Harsh words are still spoken against the Lord. False perceptions get formed in the 
mind and heart of those who doubt His providence. The rigidity of falsity perverts 
judgment. What this lesson illustrates for us is the need to put aside extreme cases 
and poor examples and to read about the love of the Lord and how He seeks to 
protect our freedom. Forced belief, forced protection, and favoritism to the faithful 
would not preserve freedom. A forced love removes spontaneity from us. How many 
times have we melted when a child, on their own, told us they loved us? The thrill of 
their words comes from the open response that is free and genuine. This is also what
pleases the Lord the most.

Let’s be done with the harsh words. Let’s be done with the thoughts of profit (what’s
in it for me?). Instead, let’s be committed to walking in the way of the Lord, taking on
whatever life brings our way. We need to overcome the “poor me” syndrome. We 
need to believe that whatever happens to us, the Lord will bring good out of it. Life 
needs less comparing of who gets the most or least. The Lord’s providence 
specifically has us in mind in all the incidents of life. Hell sends evil to us. It is not a 
gift from the Lord, but He can turn the experience of evil into a joy. How can we think
about this happening?

Can you recall the words of Joseph to his brothers? “…you meant evil against me; but 
God meant it for good...” (Genesis 50:20) These words of truth are like one of David’s 

101

smooth stones that can slay the mocking giant of falsity that seeks to pervert and 
make our judgments harsh.

Questions to Stimulate Reflection

 A stubborn will can be hard to change. If our will wants to remain unchanged,

how can we learn to soften its harsh stance?

 The “poor me” attitude seems to hit us the hardest when we are tired and 

irritable. Do you have a policy of not making important decisions when tired?

 Have you ever watched or noticed if others get more, or are blessed more, 

than you?

 Does it seem that the evil get away with much, and do you wish the Lord 





would put them in their place?
Is the profit motive (what’s in it for me?) present in your spiritual value 
system?
If health, wealth, and happiness were granted to only the faithful, would that 
be a good thing for us? Might health, wealth, and happiness become a means 
to brag and finger point at the “evil” people? If so, then a danger would exist 
when a proud state took over within. Our health, wealth, and happiness 
would immediately be taken away. Would that be a good system?

 The words “It is useless to serve the Lord” are harsh and devoid of any 

spiritual hope. Do we hear these words being expressed in our times? Is the 
assumption that the Lord is not there, not caring, and not responsive?

MALACHI 3:16-18

“Then those who feared the Lord spoke to one another, and the Lord listened and 
heard them; so a book of remembrance was written before Him for those who fear the 
Lord and who meditate on His name. ‘They shall be Mine,’ says the Lord of hosts, ‘on 
the day that I make them My jewels. And I will spare them as a man spares his own son
who serves him.’ Then you shall again discern between the righteous and the wicked, 
between one who serves God and one who does not serve Him.”

Passages From The Writings

P&P



“It is otherwise with those who trust in the Lord: they will be blessed of the 
Lord when He comes. Then the difference will be seen.”

Derived Doctrine

“Then those who feared the Lord spoke to one another…”

 The fear mentioned is a positive “fear.” It is a holy fear that good people 
experience because of longing for the Lord and also because they have a 
desire not to offend the Lord (AC 3718).
“Speaking” signifies influx and compliance from faith and love, or living as the
Lord taught in the Word (AC 9312). Note, too, that their compliance was 
shared. They did not hide or hoard their faith and love.



“…the Lord listened and heard them…”

 Listening and hearing when spoken of the Lord signify the Divine Providence 
bringing help. He brings help to the will of faith that inspires perception and 
obedience in the things of the Word. See AC 2691, 3869, and AR 87.

“…so a book of remembrance was written before Him for those who fear the Lord and 
who meditate on His name.”

 The words “book of remembrance” are not explained in the Writings. 

However, we can use references to the “book of life” or “the little book” that 
was to be opened and eaten as a reference point. AE 306 explains that the 
“‘book’ signifies all things with man, spirit, and angel, or all the states of their 
life in respect to love and faith; therefore ‘to open the book’ signifies to know 
these things; ‘to read the book’ signifies to recognize them, and ‘to look upon 
the book’ signifies to explore them.”

 To “meditate” means to think, to recall, and to reflect. The “name” of the Lord 
signifies the essence or qualities of the Lord. In other words, those who love 
the Lord will think, recall, and reflect on the sum of all by which the Lord is to
be worshiped. See AC 2724.

“‘They shall be Mine,’ says the Lord of hosts…”

 Do we need to search for the signification of these words? The Lord will draw



near to Him those who love (fear) His name.
“…the Lord of Hosts” signifies the zeal the Lord has to save His church and the
people within the church.

103

“…on the day that I make them My jewels. And I will spare them…”



“The day of Jehovah” signifies the Lord’s vastation in the last time and state of
the church (AC 488 [3] and 1839 [5]).

 The meaning of “My jewels” might be best understood by reading TCR 618: 
“There are three means whereby man is regenerated, the Lord, faith, and 
charity. These three [are] like the most costly jewels…” 
“Sparing them” signifies the Lord’s intercession from love (AC 2253). 
“Sparing” signifies salvation (AC 2262). “Sparing signifies the destruction of 
falsities before they are confirmed (AE 573 [11]).



“…and I will spare them as a man spares his own son who serves him.”

 To “serve” signifies an intention to subjugate (AC 6650 and 8169). What 
seems to be at issue in these passages is the difficulty that exists with a 
corrupted church in serving the Lord. The corrupted church seeks to 
obliterate the truth. But our verse talks about a remnant of “sons” who 
wanted to and intended to subjugate themselves to the (father) Lord. The 
Lord knew of and accepted their intentions and therefore was able to spare, 
and correct, the actions of their ignorance.

“Then you shall again discern between the righteous and the wicked, between one who
serves God and one who does not serve Him.”



Is there any doubt as to the spiritual sense here? AC 3428 notes the difference
between those who debate with the Lord and the “simple people.” Anyone 
who is devoid of good is unable to have an intelligent discernment of truth 
and doesn’t even wish to know. Whereas simple people in whom good is 
present have a common-sense discernment of truth.

 Discernment shows up the righteous and the wicked, the one who serves the 
Lord and the one who serves not. This discernment is a gift from the Lord.

Putting It All Together

Out of a long series of negative attitudes toward the Lord there comes a bright note 
of optimism for the church and the future. There are people who fear the Lord. 
They communicate their love for the Lord to each other. The Lord makes note of it, 
and He is going to make them His jewels. Even though it has been hard to meditate 
on the things of the Lord, this group has an intention to serve the Lord with 
gladness. To encourage them, the “messenger” of the Lord tells them that the Lord is 
going to spare them. In the day of the vastation of the church, the Lord will help this 
remnant. He is going to enhance their discernment. They will know the difference 
between the righteous and the wicked. They will know who wants to serve the Lord 
and who doesn’t want to serve the Lord.

104

We need this message, too. We live in a time where discernment of right and wrong 
is called narrow-mindedness. Speaking to a disorder is viewed as not being 
“charitable.” One writer described our times with the word “whatever.” Users of this 
word seem to mean that it is preferable to let everything pass by without any 
concern. “Whatever,” they say, and with that, they go on about their own agenda.

The “simple,” who trust in the Lord and fear breaking His laws, have the gift of 
discernment. Providence will lift them up and spare them from ignorance. Those 
who follow the good and truth of the Lord will become “His jewels, precious jewels.” 
The prophecy of the Lord announces the coming of the sparkling rays of hope for the
New Church. The son that serves his father will be spared from the mistakes of 
ignorance. The book of remembrance will have all the names of the faithful, and they
will meditate on the name of the Lord.

Questions to Stimulate Reflection

 Those who trust in the Lord will be blessed when He comes. How does 

trusting in the Lord carry more commitment then the “whatever” attitude?
 Discernment is a necessary tool when doing battle against evil. Fearing the 
Lord is the beginning of a discerning influx. What kind of fear exists within 
your heart and mind? Is it a fear that freezes you up, or does it free you from 
the tyranny of hell?
Jewels are part of the prophecy of the New Church. How do you understand 
the meaning of their correspondence?



 The Lord’s zeal is to save the church and all who are within the church. Can 

you share some of the ways you see this happening?

 Being “spared” is a gift from the Lord’s Providence. Do we have a feeling of 

protection and specialness when we read these words?

 How about the book of remembrance? Do you see it in a positive light? Is it an
aid to reflection? It contains all of the good and truths we have loved in our 
life. If we intend to do the will of the Lord, will we be remembered by the 
Lord?

Chapter Four

MALACHI 4:1-3

“‘For behold, the day is coming, burning like an oven, and all the proud, yes, all who do 
wickedly will be stubble. And the day which is coming shall burn them up,’ says the 
Lord of hosts, ‘that will leave them neither root nor branch. But to you who fear My 
name the Sun of Righteousness shall arise with healing in His wings; and you shall go 
out and grow fat like stall-fed calves. You shall trample the wicked, for they shall be 
ashes under the soles of your feet on the day that I do this,’ says the Lord of hosts.”

Passages From The Writings



“…and the good will be saved, and then the evil will be cast into hell, because 
they have annulled the Word.”

AC 1861 [5]



“In Malachi…4:1…A ‘burning furnace’ here denotes [burning cupidities]…the 
‘root’ denotes charity; the ‘branch’ truth, which shall not be left.”

AC 7519 [5 & 6]



“…the evils of cupidities are signified by ‘fire,’ they are also signified by a 
‘furnace,’ which is the containant, and this frequently involves the same…
Malachi 4:1…‘burning as a furnace’ denotes the cupidities of evil, ‘setting 
them on fire,’ a kindling with cupidities.”

AC 9141 [5]



“…in Malachi…4:1…‘the day that cometh’ denotes the last time of the church, 
when the loves of self and of the world shall reign, and shall consume all the 
truths and goods of the church, until nothing survives in the man’s internal 
and external, which is signified by ‘shall leave them neither root nor branch.’ 
The ‘root’ of good and truth is in man’s internal, and the ‘branch’ is in his 
external. From this then it is evident that ‘to desolate’ signifies to consume 
through cupidities, as is the case elsewhere in the Word.”

106

HH 570



“Infernal fire [and love of self], therefore, is the lust and delight that spring 
from these two loves…The evils flowing from these loves are contempt of 
others, enmity, and hostility against those who do not favor them, envy, 
hatred, and revenge, and from these fierceness and cruelty; and in respect to 
the Divine they are denial and consequent contempt, derision, and detraction
of the holy things of the church…Such is the meaning of ‘fire’ in the Word…
some passages from which I will here quote in the way of proof…Malachi 
4:1…”

AE 540 [3]



“In Malachi…4:1…This, too, was said of the last time of the church, and the 
Last Judgment at that time; both these are signified by ‘the day that cometh.’ 
The ‘oven’ means the hell where those are who confirm themselves in 
falsities by doctrine, and confirm themselves in evils from earthly and 
corporeal loves by their life; that such on account of their own loves will 
perish is meant by ‘all who sin presumptuously, and every worker of 
wickedness shall be stubble, and the oven shall set them on fire,’ ‘all who sin 
presumptuously’ meaning those who by doctrine confirm themselves in 
falsities, and ‘the worker of wickedness’ those who by life confirm themselves
in evil.”

AC 9263 [5]

 The righteous are they who “are in the good of love from the Lord; for the 
Lord is the sun in the other life, and that which is from the Lord as the sun 
there is the good of love …Hence the Lord is called ‘the Sun of Righteousness’ 
(Malachi 4:2).”

AC 9391 [5]



“…in the prophetic Word, it is usual to treat of truth wherever good is treated 
of, on account of the heavenly marriage…and also to speak of external things 
where internal things are spoken of. Moreover the ‘stall’ [used for fattening] 
and ‘fat’ signify the good of interior love…Malachi 4:2…”

AR 242



“In Malachi…4:2…They are compared to ‘fatted calves’ because by them are 
signified those who are filled with the knowledges of truth and good from the
affection of knowing them.”

AE 279 [5]



“In Malachi…4:2…The ‘Sun of righteousness that shall arise to them that fear 
the name of Jehovah’ signifies the good of love; and ‘healing in His wings’ 
signifies the truth of faith; therefore ‘to go forth, and grow up as fatted calves,’
signifies the increase of all good, ‘fatted’ and ‘fat’ also signifying good.”

AE 283 [9]



“In Malachi…4:2…‘The sun of righteousness’ signifies the good of love, which 
is the celestial Divine; and the ‘wings of Jehovah, in which there is healing,’ 
signify truth from that good, which is the spiritual Divine; ‘healing’ is 
reformation thereby.”

AE 401 [28]



“Because ‘the sun’ signifies the Lord in relation to Divine love, He is called ‘the
Sun of righteousness’ (in Malachi 4:2)…”

AE 632 [10]



“In Malachi…4:3…‘To trample down’…signifies to destroy, which is done by 
those who are corporeal-sensual, for those who are such ‘trample down’ all 
things of heaven and the church, for they are in what is lowest, and their 
thoughts cannot be elevated by the Lord, for they themselves let them down 
to the earth, and there they lick the dust. Such are all those that deny the 
Divine…unless he suffers himself to be elevated out of them [corporeal-
sensual things] by the Lord, which is effected by Divine means…he tramples 
down the celestial and spiritual things belonging to heaven and the church.” 

Derived Doctrine

“…and all the proud, yes, all who do wickedly will be stubble.”

 Who are the proud? Are they the people who seek the power of dominating 
over the things of the church? See AC 8678. Are they those who glory in their 
learning? See AE 376 [31]. Are they the people who love to confirm falsities 
that favor self-love? See AE 518 [34].

108

 Wickedness is far more than evil. “Wickedness” signifies a desire to have 
complete destruction of good and truth within a person (AE 257 [7]). 
“Wickedness” signifies a deep malice with those who infest (AC 7590).
“Stubble” denotes such truth as is accommodated to memory knowledges (AC
7131). “Stubble” being devoured signifies the consequent devastation and 
damnation the wicked bring upon themselves (AC 8280).



“‘…for they shall be ashes under the soles of your feet on the day that I do this,’ says the 
Lord of hosts.”



“Ashes” signify something condemned because the fire from which the ashes 
came signifies infernal love (AE 441). “Ashes” signify lustful falsities excited 
by the presence of infesting spirits (AC 7519 and AE 962 [8]).

 The meaning of the words “Under the soles of your feet” presents us with a 
challenge. AE 632 [2] teaches that “the soles of the feet” correspond to the 
external sensual of a person which is what tramples down. AC 4943 teaches 
that “The soles of the feet are also those who have placed merit in good deeds
and in works.” AC 4944 teaches that “they…who have led a good moral life, 
and have had something of charity toward the neighbor, but have had little 
concern about spiritual things, are for the most part sent into the places 
under the feet and the soles of the feet.” Question: Is the Lord telling us how 
simple it will be to overcome the burning lusts of the hells? Is all of their 
intense desire to destroy the Lord not a real threat if the lower external 
sensual of a person is able to trample them down? The comparison seems to 
be there for us to see the message of hope and redemption in the day of the 
Lord.

 Please note “says the Lord of hosts.” What does it mean, and why is this 
phrase used so often in Malachi? It states the zeal of the Lord to save His 
church and all who are in the church.

“…that will leave them neither root nor branch.”



“Roots” signify the proprium as the source of infernal falsity (AR 410). The 
Doctrine of the Lord 93 teaches “this Own [proprium] of man constitutes the 
first root of his life…And this root is not removed and a new one set in its 
place unless the man regards the evils that constitute the root as injurious to 
his soul…” This “root” needs to be plucked up.

 A reference to the “root and branch” teaches about the internal and external 
person. The “root” signifies good and truth in the internal person, whereas 
the “branch” represents good and truth in the external person (AC 1861 [5] 
and AC 9141).

Putting It All Together

AC 8214 describes a series of laws that are important to the understanding of the 
verses we are now studying: the law of retaliation, the law of order, and the “Law 
and the Prophets.”

The law of retaliation: “…the evil who by means of injections of falsity and evil desire
to inflict violence on the good cast themselves into the penalty of retaliation, which 
is, that the falsities and evils which they endeavor to inflict, fall back on themselves.”

The law of order: This law is stated in Matthew 7:12. “All things whatsoever ye would
that men should do to you, do ye even so to them…”

“This is the Law and the Prophets”: The laws of retaliation and of order are 
complementary. Those who are in order do to others what they wish to have done to
themselves; those who break the law of order still experience the results of what 
they intended for others. The verse from Matthew is followed by the words “This is 
the Law and the Prophets.” This suggests that we need to apply these laws to our 
understanding of Malachi’s prophetic message as to why the evil will be “burning 
like an oven, and all the proud, yes, all who do wickedly will be stubble.” Their self-
love desired to totally violate the good and faithful things of the Lord’s church. Every
negative wish they had returned to them. “Stubble” is the left-over useless part of a 
plant. A contributing use of life is gone, and the remaining stub of the stem is a 
symbol of uselessness. As a dried-up stalk, what is useless is vulnerable to the heat 
and fire of self-love.

We need to be reminded that the above laws have a positive side as well. The good 
we wish to the Lord and the neighbor will also return to us. Doesn’t this also apply to
the passage in the Word that teaches us we will reap what we sow?

Following the way of the Lord will bring us to the “stall,” and we will be “fattened” 
with the good of interior love. There will be “healing” in the wings of the Lord, and 
the “Sun of righteousness” will warm the very depths of our souls.

The power of self-love is not as strong as it would have us believe. Our daily external 
walk through life, the moral deeds and charity toward our neighbor can trample 
down evil. Like ashes under “the soles of our feet,” the wicked will be overcome with 
the Lord’s help.

Questions to Stimulate Reflection

 What do you think about the Law of Retaliation? Is it a fair law? Does that law

put any pressure on us in our daily interaction with others?

 Remember the positive side of the law, too. If we have love for the Lord and 
the neighbor and wish well toward them, we have nothing to fear. The good 
we intended returns and blesses us. How do we do these things without a 
sense of earning “merit”?

 The “oven” of self-love sounds intense. Like a fever burning within, it must 
put a tremendous strain on the soul. The soul wants to serve the Lord and 
delight itself in the fatness of the Lord’s truths. But the fire rages out of 
control, consuming all that stands in its way. Have you ever experienced this 
fire in some way? Didn’t it want to have free reign? If anyone sought to speak 
words of warning, did it seem to add fuel to the fire?

 Did the words of the Lord about His healing and lifting us up in His wings 

offer encouragement to renew our efforts of reformation?

 Being led to the stall and becoming fatted calves—did that correspondential 

imagery catch hold in your mind?

 What did you draw from the teaching about the “soles of your feet” tramping 

down the ashes and stubble of the evil?

MALACHI 4:4

“Remember the Law of Moses, My servant, which I commanded him in Hereby for all 
Israel, with the statutes and judgments.”

Passages From The Writings

P&P



“…because they have annulled the Word.”

AR 3



“By servants, in the spiritual sense, are meant those who are in truths; and 
because truths are from good, by servants are meant those who are in truths 
from good…Now as truths are serviceable to good by teaching it, therefore, in
general, and properly, by servant, in the Word, is meant what is serviceable…
in this sense not only the prophets are called the servants of God, but also the
Lord as to His Human…[this] is evident from the following passages…Malachi
4:4…”

111

AR 662

 Malachi 4:4 is cited, among other examples. “It may be evident from these 
passages, that by ‘Moses’ in the wide sense is meant the Word that was 
written by him, which is called the Law. It follows from this that the Law 
which is the Decalogue is meant by ‘Moses’; and the more so, because Moses 
hewed out the tables after he had broken the former ones…”

AE 409 [6]



“Since the Lord in respect to Divine truth is called in the Word ‘a servant’ 
from serving, so those who are in Divine truth from the Lord and thereby 
serve others are there called ‘servants,’ as the prophets are in these 
passages…Malachi 4:4…”

Derived Doctrine

“Remember the Law of Moses, My servant, which I commanded him in Horeb for all 
Israel with the statutes and judgments.”





“Remember” has reference to recalling, reflection, a reminder and 
reassessment. To what end? A renewal of the covenant between the Lord and 
His people. This was a command to assess their commitment to the laws of 
the Lord. Was there a need to fix any breaches? Did they need to clear away 
blockages to facilitate conjunction in every way possible? Did they have a 
desire for the preservation of the church? And, lastly, were they looking for 
those things of infinite and eternal value?
“‘Horeb’ signifies the Lord as to the truths of faith.” (AC 8572) “…Horeb 
signifies the external things of worship, of the church, and of the Word.” (AC 
10534)

“…for all Israel with the statutes and judgments.”



 We need to note the word “all.” The Laws were for the Northern and Southern
kingdoms. The Laws of the Lord know no boundaries. They are universal 
laws for “all” people of the church.
“Statutes” signify externals of the Word, the rites of the church enjoined by 
the Lord. “Statutes” signify continual revelations from the Lord (AC 3382). 
“Statutes” signify the external goods and truths of the church while laws 
signify the internal goods and truths (AC 8706).
“Judgment” relates to the doctrine of truth, whereas justice relates to the 
doctrine of good (AC 2231).

Putting It All Together

P&P points the way to understanding the Lord’s call to “remember the Laws” given 
to Moses. The dead church had “annulled the Word.” The faithful remnant was being 
called back to the essentials of the Commandments. Because the Decalogue is “in a 
brief summary a complex of all things of religion by means of which there is 
conjunction of the Lord with man and of man with the Lord, they were so holy that 
nothing is more so.” (Doctrine of Life 54, emphasis added) The two tablets teach the 
proper way to love the Lord and love the neighbor.

The call to remembrance was a Divine injunction to review and repair the 
conjunction between the Lord and the church. Disjunction was evident, and the 
quality of spiritual life in the church was dead. The remnant, all of Israel, must 
renew its commitment to the essentials of faith. Out with dead and uninspiring ritual
and in with vivified and inspiring forms of worship.

The Lord, as the Servant, promises to renew the truths of faith, first in the external 
things of worship, then the church, and then the Word. His statutes and judgment, 
the doctrine of truth and good, will be brought to their rightful place in the center of 
the church.

Questions to Stimulate Reflection

 What ways would be effective for us to “remember the Laws” of the Lord? We 

teach the commandments in the church’s elementary schools. They are 
studied briefly in high school. There is the course of study called “Rise Above 
It,” but not all adults have a course of study to review the inner meaning of 
the Decalogue. So what incentive might get us to read either Apocalypse 
Explained or Doctrine of Life wherein the spiritual meanings of the 
Commandments are taught?

 The Lord’s Word makes it clear that His Law is for all of His people. His 

commandments are the epitome of all things of religion. There is nothing 
more holy. So what keeps us from the study of them? Do we believe we know 
everything about the Decalogue? Is there a subconscious feeling that keeping 
all of the commandments is impossible? Do we shy away from them because 
we feel like a failure in keeping most of them?

 Our study of doctrine and derived doctrine makes it clear that annulment of 

the Word brings disjunction and death to the spiritual church.

113

 The New Church has more to offer regarding the Decalogue than other 
religions have provided. Do you think the Commandments suffer in the 
churches outside the New Church?

 We have had a recent legal case in several states to remove replicas of the Ten
Commandments from display in public places. The physical removal of them 
brought reaction from Christians. Does it seem to you that the initial concern 
has died down and the order to remove them has achieved tacit acceptance? 
What will be the consequences of this?

MALACHI 4:5-6

announcing the coming of the Lord; and that without such preparation all on 
earth would have been smitten with a curse and would have perished.”

AE 624 [22]



“That Elijah represented the Lord as to the Word is evident from the miracles 
done by Him, all of which signified such things as belong to Divine truth or

the Word he was called ‘Elijah,’ as can be seen in Malachi…4:5, 6…”

AE 724 [7]



“…in Malachi…4:5, 6…John the Baptist was sent before to prepare for the 
reception of the Lord by baptism, because baptism represented and signified 
purification from evils and falsities, and also regeneration by the Lord by 
means of the Word. Unless this representation had preceded, the Lord could 
not have manifested Himself and have taught and lived in Judea and in 
Jerusalem, since the Lord was the God of heaven and earth under a human 
form, and He could not have been present with a nation that was in mere 
falsities in respect to doctrine and in mere evils in respect to life; 
consequently unless that nation had been prepared for the reception of the 
Lord by a representation of purification from falsities and evils by baptism, it 
would have been destroyed by disease of every kind by the presence of the 
Divine Itself; therefore this is what is signified by ‘lest I come and smite the 
earth with a curse.’”

AC 6752 [10]



“And as both Moses and Elias together represented the whole Word, therefore
where it is said of Elias that he should be ‘sent before the Lord,’ mention is 
made of both…Malachi 4:4, 5…these words involve that one would go before 
to announce the advent according to the Word.”

AE 937 [6]



“Because Moses and Elijah taken together represented the Word, where 
Elijah is spoken of as the one sent before the Lord, both are mentioned, as in

Derived Doctrine

“Behold…”

 This word is defined in the dictionary as “to have or keep in sight; look at;

watch; to view or survey; to discern.”
In the Writings, “behold” is used when there is a call to reflect on “an interior 
acknowledgment and confession of the Lord’s Divine Human…” (AC 2329)

“…I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of 
the Lord.”

 The Lord sending angels, prophets, or disciples signifies a revelation from the

Lord to “those who are in the good of love…” (AE 8 [2])
 Elijah “represented the Lord as to the Word.” (AC 2762)


“The prophets represented those who teach, and hence the teaching of good 
and truth from the Word.” (AC 3540)
“The great and dreadful day of the Lord” is a message for those who are not in
good. “The ‘dread’ is mentioned because the Divine truth is meant, for the 
Divine truth carries with it fear, dread, and terror to those who are not in 
good; but not so the Divine good, which terrifies no one.” (AC 4180)



“And he [Elijah] will turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the hearts of the 
children to their fathers…”

 AC 10490 explains a teaching of the Lord regarding hating father, mother, 

wife, and children. It cites a passage in Matthew stating that unless people 
hate these members of their family, and their own soul, they cannot be a 
disciple of the Lord. The Lord was not teaching hatred for people, AC 10490 
[6] tells us; He was referring to “…things belonging to man” and the origin of 
evils and falsities and the lusts that arise from the beginnings of one’s own 
(proprium).

 Turning the hearts of the fathers to the children and the hearts of the 

children to the fathers represents the plucking out of the first root of the 
proprium and the implanting by the Lord of a new root, or His Proprium. The 
coming of the Word is a spiritual day of the Lord when all things will be put 
into a loving family of order.

“…lest I come and strike the earth with a curse.”



In Exodus 3:20, the Lord said that He would “strike [smite] Egypt with all My 
wonders…” which “signified that they would be overcome by power from the 
Divine, and by the means of this power.” (AC 6908)

 The “earth” signifies “the external man.” (AC 89)

116



“To be a fugitive and a wanderer in the earth signifies not to know what is 
good and true.” (AC 380, emphasis added)

 The “earth” signifies “the love of self and whatever is contrary to the celestial 

church.” (AC 636)

 The word “curse” has a negative and positive correspondence. In the negative
sense, it means “to turn one’s self away…” (AC 927) This same number uses 
“curse” in the positive sense to mean that the Lord will provide “for man’s 
upbuilding…that he might be reformed and regenerated in respect to the 
second or intellectual part of the mind, in which there might be implanted a 
new will which is conscience, and through which the Lord might work the 
good of love…and the truth of faith. Thus of the Lord’s Divine mercy has man 
been restored.”

Putting It All Together

Why was it necessary for the Lord to send Elijah (and John the Baptist) prior to the 
coming of the day of the Lord? AE 724 [7] states that “unless this representation had 
preceded, the Lord could not have manifested Himself…unless that nation had been 
prepared for the reception of the Lord…” The Lord’s baptism signified the work of 
purification He would win for us over evils and falsities. If the Lord had not prepared
the way for His advent, humanity’s spiritual life would have been destroyed with 
diseases of every kind.

So we need to “behold,” to have or keep in sight, to view and discern what the Lord 
does for us every day. How much does the Lord’s infinite preparation do for us? 
Consider this teaching in AC 3854: “…how greatly the man errs who believes that the 
Lord has not foreseen, and does not see, the veriest singulars appertaining to man, 
and that in these He does not foresee and lead; when the truth is that the Lord’s 
foresight and providence are in the very minutest of these veriest singulars 
connected with man, in things so very minute that it is impossible by any thought to 
comprehend as much as one out of a hundred millions of them….” (emphasis 
added)

We do well to reflect on the Lord’s great love for each of us. This is especially so 
when the hells work on us to feel hopeless and beyond the Lord’s power to save and 
redeem us. The Lord comes to pluck up the first root of life. He wants to remove our 
selfish, unregenerate proprium. In its place will be a new and magnificent Proprium 
from the Lord.

For the unregenerate proprium, it is a “great and dreadful day of the coming of the 
Lord.” It is a day to be feared. For the soul, it is a day of great joy and liberation. It is a
day of release and spiritual cleansing from evils and falsities. It is a day of new 
beginnings.

117

Our view of the Lord’s care and attention to the details of our life is limited. We see 
maybe “one out of a hundred millions.” Is there a way we can come to see more of 
the Lord’s ways of purifying our hearts? Can we believe that His power is in the very 
minutest things of our life? The pursuit of seeing more of the millions of spiritual 
benefactions from the Lord could be time well spent. Let’s begin the process of 
discovery with a heart filled with a sense of how great and merciful the Lord is in the
ways of His salvation. No detail escapes His cleansing work. No hidden connection of
evil and falsity escapes the “disconnecting” work of His hands. Thorough and 
meticulous are the redemptive ways of the Lord. The coming of the Lord’s New 
Church is a certainty. Let the people hear the “messenger” of the Lord say “Behold.”

Questions to Stimulate Reflection

 Our verse begins with the word “Behold.” The Lord calls us to take notice of 

His message. About how long do you think we will do the work of beholding? 
This is not a criticism. It is a call to begin expanding our period of reflective 
beholding.

 Did you notice that for the evil people, the day of the Lord is a day of great 

dread? But it is not so for the good and faithful. The removal of the “first root 
of life” may appear to be an unpleasant occurrence, but it is not as traumatic 
as imagined. The Lord has a “painless” procedure that is thorough and 
effective. What do you think about this preparation of root removal in the day
of the Lord? 

 Have you ever done any counting of your blessings from the Lord? Did the 
“one out of millions” teaching come as a surprise to you? Could we even be 
missing much within the one that we see?

Epilogue: A Summary of the Book of Malachi

The following summary draws and expands on the outline given in the Summary 
Exposition of the Prophets and Psalms .

CHAPTER ONE

After the destruction of Solomon’s Temple and the return of the exiled people, 
another temple was built. Was it as beautiful as Solomon’s temple? Probably not. But
Israel once again had a temple to worship in. There it stood before the children of 
Israel as a symbol of their religious heritage.

Did the years of Babylonian captivity and depravation strengthen Israel’s resolve to 
be a faithful people of the Lord? Had they learned important lessons of what 
happens when a proud heart strays from the ways of the Lord? Were the worship of 
the Lord and the rejoicing of freedom central in the services at the temple? Were the 
ministrations of the priests and people for the Lord and to the Lord?

The external ceremonies, sacrifices, and rituals abounded with great detailed pomp 
and circumstance. The Lord, looking within the hearts of the people, saw evil and 
falsity thriving under the cloak of tradition. He sent Malachi the “messenger” to 
expose the sham and spiritually dangerous things going on in His temple. What did 
Malachi report to them was the Lord’s assessment of worship? From the Summary 
Exposition of the Prophets and Psalms, we have the following summation of chapter 
one: It is the Lord who institutes a church. The Lord said that although the church 
was there, the people in it did not acknowledge the Lord. He told them they 
worshiped from evil and not from good; therefore, their worship was not accepted. 
Those outside the church worshiped the Lord, but those within the church profaned 
worship. External good had been destroyed, and therefore, their external truth was 
destroyed as well.

CHAPTER TWO

Things within the church had to change. If the people of Israel didn’t listen to the 
Lord and change their ways, all worship would be perverted and profaned. The 
Word was given to them that they might have conjunction with the Lord. They 
departed from the Word and, therefore, dissolved the conjunction. They were 
worshipping another god, whence came the profanations. Following other gods 
would not lead to life but death. Therefore, their external worship was not accepted, 
and they were severing themselves from the church by calling evil good.

119

CHAPTER THREE

The destructive choices of the people would not go unchecked by the Lord. The 
Lord’s advent into the world would be to teach the Word in its purity. The church, 
doctrine, and worship would be like they were among the ancients. The Lord would 
execute a judgment upon all who adulterated and destroyed the truths of the church.
Those who had done this from the beginning, and who would not desist from it, nor 
would they desist from adulteration, now would bring about their own ruin. If they 
had lived according to the Lord’s statutes, they would have been in the good of the 
church. Instead, they confirmed themselves in the belief that good is of no profit and 
that evil does no harm because, to them, it appeared that the good and the wicked 
prospered equally.

Those who trusted in the Lord would find it otherwise. They would be blessed by 
the Lord when He came. When the Lord came, the difference would be seen.

CHAPTER FOUR

The good would be saved by the Lord. The evil would choose to leap into hell 
because they annulled the Word. The Lord’s preparation of the way by John the 
Baptist made it possible for the Lord’s purification of evils and falsities. The Lord ’s 
foresight and providence enter into most minute singulars of human life. He takes 
care of things so minute “that it is impossible by any thought to comprehend as 
much as one out of a hundred millions of them…” (AC 3854)

The Lord’s New Church will bring us a church that not only is present but will offer 
sincere services of praise, purity, and devotion to the one God of heaven and earth.
